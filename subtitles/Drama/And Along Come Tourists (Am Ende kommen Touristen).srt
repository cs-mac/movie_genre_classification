2
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,793
Hello! Hello!
Auschwitz-Museum?

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,559
eh, street...

4
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,070
One moment, moment...
- This is... street...

5
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,317
- Thank you.

6
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,515
Hello.
- Good morning.

7
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,071
My name is Sven Lehnert.
I am here because of the civil service job.

8
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,550
Hello.
- Hello, hello...

9
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,718
Excuse me.

10
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,833
Excuse me,
is this your...

11
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,878
Empty?

12
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,519
Totally empty.

13
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,873
But you speak German, right?

14
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:47,120
Is this a hostel now?

15
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,038
You are Sven? Herold. Welcome.
I will show you around.

16
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,549
If you have questions, simply ask me, okay?
- Okay.

17
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,117
You are the only one doing service here.
In the moment and in the beginning,

18
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,437
You have to do everything's coming up
Later when you are more experienced,

19
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,075
You can guide groups,
Buy bus tickets,

20
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,910
Organize lunch and
Manage analysis groups.

21
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,834
We will see.

22
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,715
We are not a youth hostel only,
We also guide

23
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,593
The young visitors here
In an educational way...

24
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,350
Go to seminar room one, ok?
I'll see you there a little later.

25
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,277
You'll stay in the guest house first.
We usually put the teachers there,

26
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,994
For one or two days,
If there is no room left here.

27
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,270
These are the sleeping halls, but
I'll look for something in the city for you

28
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,473
You'll get to see some daily life there.
But I haven't got the time yet.

29
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,079
(Polish)
- Hmmm... milk.

30
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,430
Milk?
- Yes.

31
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,992
(Polish)
- Yes.

32
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,751
(Polish)

33
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,557
(Knocking on the door)

34
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,432
(Repeated knocking)
- Come in.

35
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,631
Hello, just wanted to say...
- (Polish)

36
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,155
Didn't want to disturb you,
Just... - You live here now?

37
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,397
Yes. I am living here.
Civil service.

38
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,676
From Germany?
- Mhm.

39
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,598
Where from?
- Berlin.

40
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,119
I see!

41
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,836
Why, do you know Berlin?

42
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,359
I am supposed to take care for you
for the time being. - Take care?

43
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,636
You are some kind of servant?

44
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,996
No.
- Assistant for my job?

45
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,989
No, it's only about helping around
With a few simply things.

46
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,758
Like buying things and such.
And I can drive you

47
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,510
To these... history witness talks.
And tomorrow we'll have physiotherapy.

48
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,791
I am not sick.

49
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,195
Who is saying that I need
Physiotherapy?

50
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,633
Mr. Herold. The latter dates you
Haven't attended, right?

51
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,636
This order, that you have to
Take care for me,

52
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,036
Herold said, that you should do that?

53
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,508
But that wasn't an order. That...
I believe, he wants to be nice to you.

54
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,995
Oh, yes.
I know.

55
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,515
I have... that's the reason I am here...
I bought a bottle of milk.

56
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,839
Put it in the fridge
And close the door.

57
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,833
That is great music.
- (Polish)

58
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,110
No, no, no. I...
- You are German?

59
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,037
Yes. I am from Berlin.

60
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,630
Uuuh, German, right?
Fritz, German, Berlin, yes?

61
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,115
Yes, yes, I...
- What are you doing here?

62
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,313
I am doing... civil service.
You know civil service?

63
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,874
Civil?
- Yes, civil service. For one year.

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,197
In Germany you can choose
To go to the army or do civil service.

65
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,471
Civil army? - Yes.
- And what are you doing?

66
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,390
I am working in the hostel, near
Auschwitz-Museum, you know?

67
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,437
Civil army Auschwitz?

68
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,477
Sort of, yes.
- I see, ok.

69
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,857
Hey guys!

70
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:07,292
The German army is here again
in Auschwitz.

71
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,437
Here you can see the suitcases.

72
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,155
The prisoners have been told,
They would be send to the east.

73
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,670
That's why they took all kinds of
Necessary things.

74
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,397
Right after their arrival here
The suitcases have been taken away.

75
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,309
Please have a look at the plates.
Here is the name,

76
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,513
Family name, birth date,
Transport number,

77
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,069
Sometimes the address as well.
What you see here,

78
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,749
Is only a small amount of the
Dispossessed suitcases.

79
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,552
Please follow me.

80
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,711
(Polish)

81
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,595
Unbelievable, how packed this was, right?
- Excuse me?

82
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,759
I said: it’s unbelievably crowded.
So many people around.

83
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,833
Weekend.

84
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,319
You don't go on?
- By bus?

85
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,352
No, I am not here by bus.
I am by myself.

86
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,994
Moved here a week ago.
Civil service.

87
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,712
Civil service?

88
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,551
Why this place?

89
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,478
I didn't want to. I was supposed to...
I had a position, hmm...

90
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,958
In Amsterdam, centre for young people.
But somehow that didn't work out.

91
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,113
And then this came along.
There was an open position here.

92
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,553
And now I am slowly getting
A feeling for it, why. Well...

93
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,074
Oh.

94
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,358
Amsterdam...

95
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,228
Ok, have to rush. Sorry.
- Bye.

96
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,909
(Polish)

97
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,392
(Herold) Please let me ask you,
To write down a word,

98
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,231
A short sentence on the cards,
Been given to you by Sven.

99
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,989
It is all about to find a "place"
Which came to your mind

100
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,795
In Birkenau and Auschwitz
Something in your memory.

101
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,755
"Emotion"... yes, some feeling,
You had visiting the memorial.

102
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
And please let me ask you
To concentrate on one feeling.

103
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,668
And with "Wish" please make a wish
Or a short sentence,

104
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,156
For the future, after you have left
The memorial.

105
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,475
(Silence)

106
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,072
Anybody wants to start? Anybody at all?
It is all voluntarily.

107
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,919
Nobody has to do this.
- Yes, I can start.

108
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,591
So I chose the place, hmmm... the room
With the suitcases from block six.

109
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,110
Hmm, there was this cupboard
With lots of suitcases.

110
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,074
My guess is a thousand or some.
And each of them had a name on it.

111
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,398
The prisoners and some also
The priso... or the detainee's number.

112
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,159
Good.
Sven, would you please pin this here?

113
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,749
As "place" I chose the children's clothing,
That was in block six as well,

114
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,510
Jonas mentioned this already.
There was a cabinet

115
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,837
With a small jacket,

116
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,430
Some small trousers,
Baby socks, a rattle

117
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,120
That made me feel very emotional.

118
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,912
As "Emotion" I chose helplessness

119
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,469
And as "Wish" I want,

120
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,632
That this terrible times never
Shall be forgotten.

121
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,432
Please!

122
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,472
Why are you walking so slow?

123
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,390
Wait downstairs.

124
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,959
Here.

125
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,553
Lighter.

126
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,313
The lighter, please.

127
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,078
To the left over there.

128
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,836
Mr Krzeminski? Excuse me.

129
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,919
Mr Krzeminski? I don't want to disturb but
I am working until seven only.

130
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,749
And what's the time? - It is already...
I believe it is almost eight.

131
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,555
You don't have a watch?
- No, I don't have one.

132
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:34,662
Look at this.
A German without a watch.

133
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:40,355
A German chauffeur.
Times are a changing.

134
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,709
Mr Krzeminski,
We have to go, ok?

135
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,038
You can leave then!
I don't keep you from going.

136
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,378
Just ask him,

137
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:53,601
Wether his Grandfather
Has been working here as well.

138
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,355
Ok, then I wish you
A nice evening.

139
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,110
Sven, let's have a word, ok?

140
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,038
One of the colleagues has picked up
Krzeminski half the way back.

141
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,432
He went by foot. In the night.
On the country road.

142
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,997
Sven, if something had happened to him! -
But I have asked him a few times.

143
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,078
He didn't want to come.
- Ok, but then you should have waited!

144
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,510
Or call us here. - But how should I know
That he would try to make it on his own.

145
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,438
Why hasn't he called a taxi?
- Listen, Sven, it's not that simple.

146
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,271
This is a sensitive place.

147
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,119
Former concentration camp prisoner
Dead in car accident,

148
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,549
Because German civil service worker
Left him alone.

149
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,875
That's what the newspapers
Would say.

150
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,239
Yes?

151
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,199
Krzeminski is in his eighties. And he
Is not in the best shape lately,

152
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,836
And this is why you are supposed
To take care. Is this so difficult?

153
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,272
No, but do I have to live with him
All the time?

154
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,550
That's kind of...

155
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,712
We have been talking about this,
I will find a way.

156
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,431
Where are you going?

157
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,635
Don't worry, I will be back.

158
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,512
Ok, we meet tomorrow, 3 o'clock.
- This is your new landlord.

159
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,633
Hello.
- Hello.

160
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,432
Hi. - Hi.
- Sven.

161
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,797
We have met before.
- Yes, at the exhibition.

162
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,309
So much the better.
- Yes.

163
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,079
Well, then... where are your things,
Your backpack?

164
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,589
My stuff is over there in the office. -
You want me to help?

165
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,598
See you later. - You are here?
- Yes I am waiting here.

166
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,434
Hey?

167
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,674
Hey!

168
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,488
Can you switch this off?

169
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,953
This is my brother Krzysztof.
Sven.

170
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,957
Fritz?
- Hello.

171
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,797
You know each other?
- Yes, hmm, I was at his concert.

172
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,483
What is he doing here?
- He is moving in.

173
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,296
Don't I disturb you?

174
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,266
I mean in your room.
Could you please move your stuff?

175
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,951
You have let my room?
- Yes.

176
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:49,605
Are you sure? - Just take your stuff
and don't start a discussion.

177
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:52,865
This German guy is going to
Take my room?

178
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:56,004
This is my place and you haven't paid
Your part of the rent since three months.

179
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:59,812
Take your things out now.

180
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:04,576
You are not serious, are you?
- Of course and now get going!

181
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,672
Welcome.

182
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:17,658
Calm down!

183
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,352
What? How? I, hmm...

184
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,517
Sleep in his room? And he is moving out? -
No, you will take this room.

185
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:24,678
Thanks, sweet sister mine.

186
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,436
A German in my room.

187
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,752
Should I sleep in his room? - This is not
His room. This is my place.

188
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,599
If this is a problem, I'll find something else. -
No, this is not a problem.

189
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,635
Where do you take me?
- Well, to this, eh... chemical factory.

190
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,838
We have a new trainee's group there
In the meeting facilities.

191
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,512
Rhon chemical. A German group.
They took over the factory.

192
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,952
Good morning.

193
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,035
My name is Stanislaw Krzeminski.

194
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,756
From the 10th of January

195
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:20,503
1941

196
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,949
I was prisoner number

197
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,414
9.372

198
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,557
in Auschwitz.

199
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,558
In my car from Tarnow

200
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,070
There were 102 comrades...

201
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,833
Sorry.

202
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,714
Four have survived.

203
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,588
Thank you.

204
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,755
You are German as well?
- Mhm.

205
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,070
Isn't it crazy, right? The way these
Polish guys have let this place gone down.

206
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,029
I don't know.
I didn't have a close look.

207
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,834
Well, wouldn't do that if
I were in your shoes.

208
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,358
At least not without helmet and
breathing protection.

209
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,078
Anyway, there's a lot to do.

210
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,840
We have got some other
Things working in the end.

211
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,517
Stop eating!
Come on in everybody!

212
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,834
Questions and answers now...
Mrs Schneider?

213
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,997
Hello Mr Dremmler.
- Hello. This is our history witness.

214
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,475
Mr...?
- Krzeminski.

215
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,156
Hello Mr Krzeminski. I am very sorry
that I couldn't make it to your lecture.

216
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,556
I had to listen to the
Reports by our trainees.

217
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,831
And they are very impressed.
This discussion will stay with them

218
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,714
A lifetime.
- It is only a story.

219
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,799
Oh no. This is an encounter.
And this will stay with them. Please.

220
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,151
Thank you.
- No, we have to thank you.

221
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,189
For my trainees and for myself
This is an exciting beginning,

222
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,552
In our new operation here
In Oswiecim.

223
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,235
I am positive, the few weeks here
Will be unforgettable and

224
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,831
An important part
Of your training.

225
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,269
I wish to say thank you
Once again

226
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,437
That we had the chance
To listen to your story

227
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,279
And I am confident that we will
Hear some interesting questions.

228
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,630
Steffi, can you please begin.

229
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,629
What did you eat in the camp?

230
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,674
We have eaten everything.

231
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,834
Leftovers from the swine feeders.

232
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,154
There was no grass left

233
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,040
Between the barracks.

234
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,158
I stole bread crumbs
From my neighbor.

235
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,071
By day and by night

236
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,836
We have been dreaming of food.

237
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,838
Yes, please. - Did he also get a
Number in the camp?

238
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,194
He wants to know, wether you
got a number tattoo in the camp..

239
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,036
All of us

240
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,628
Have got a number.

241
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,870
Eh... Would it be possible
That you show it to us?

242
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,955
Of course.

243
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,631
Almost gone.

244
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,472
Didn't have it renewed.

245
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,635
"Hey boy, do you wanna go with us?"

246
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,720
What's up? Do you come along?

247
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,111
Where to?
- Surprise.

248
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,749
I simply don't know,
What I want to do. - What?

249
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,348
I am not sure, what I want to do later.
It is just like that.

250
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,438
This is the good thing about this civil-thing,
because it gives me a year to contemplate.

251
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,472
Yes, this may be good. - l believe
Something's gonna happen, you know?

252
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,275
But there must be something you
Really want to do, right?

253
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,871
No. - Everybody has got that.
Like a dream. Dream! - No!

254
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,110
Maybe one or two... all my friends,
The girls from my grade,

255
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,755
They push buggies into church
And then they pick up their

256
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,474
Drunken husbands from the bar.
I simply don't want to do this.

257
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,831
That's your dream?
- Yes, the nightmare! - My nightmare!

258
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,835
And Krzeminski
talks about his camp life.

259
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,078
But the trainees really don't know
What they should ask him.

260
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,637
He gets this envelope from the manager
And says thank you for a thousand times.

261
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,759
She hasn't been there, has no idea
But show off like being so deeply  impressed.

262
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,156
And how bad it all has been...

263
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,956
She doesn't need to know anything
About history, all that matters is business.

264
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,232
Why? - At least they will invest
Here in this place. And this is good, isn't it.

265
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,157
Without the factory all people,
Including Krzysztof,

266
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,478
Wouldn't have a job.
- Krzysztof is working in the factory?

267
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,072
Yes. Not all can depend on the camp.
The tourists come in the morning,

268
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,159
And then they leave for Warsaw
Or they go to Krakow.

269
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,238
Ok, but I don't really believe
They will invest.

270
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,670
They come, that's globalization,
They come to this place, press out the juice...

271
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:25,029
Attention. Germans!

272
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,079
Are you mad?
You are really sick.

273
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,027
Calm down, dear sister.
- Asshole.

274
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:34,633
What's this called? - "Zasraniec".
- Zasraniec!

275
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,759
What?

276
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,993
Mr Krzeminski. We have to go
To physiotherapy, Mr Krzeminski.

277
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,148
Is it my fault,
If you come that late?

278
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,953
Come here.
Help me. Hold this.

279
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,756
This is all falling apart.

280
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,312
This new glaze
From that idiots.

281
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,309
Go to Konserwacja
And get me a new suitcase.

282
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,309
Listen, I better get you
To physiotherapy first.

283
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,639
And afterwards I would be pleased
To get a new one for you. - Yes, go ahead.

284
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,558
I have to pack this.
- We have to go now. Please!

285
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,511
Go ahead.

286
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,999
Hello.

287
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,959
Hello.

288
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,261
Can I help you?

289
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,673
Karol!

290
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:34,131
Krzeminski's suitcase.

291
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,349
Krzeminski says, it must be something...
With the glaze.

292
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,159
Glaze?

293
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,161
He is ruining the suitcases
with his old methods.

294
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:56,536
We can forget about this one
For the exhibition.

295
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:57,537
This is going on since half a year already.

296
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,747
He told me,
It was broken before.

297
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,153
Krzeminski fucks up
The suitcases, right?

298
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,992
Ok, good.
I will tell him.

299
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,428
Oh, and then I need
A new suitcase as well.

300
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,430
He wants a new one.

301
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:17,448
Give him one.

302
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,438
(Sven tries to speak Polish)
May I... may... help?

303
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,551
Oh, you are from, Germany?
- Yes.

304
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,477
Boah, what's this then?

305
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,474
I have tried it with my
Children and grandchildren

306
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,991
hmm... teaching them German,
but it didn't work out.

307
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,075
Only me and my brother
Speak German.

308
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,589
Ah, you want to Mr Krzeminski?
- Yes.

309
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,553
I just drove him into town.
- Oh!

310
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,952
And I have called last week
To confirm this.

311
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,958
He is doing this intentionally.

312
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,273
I don't think so, because he is
Attending physiotherapy. - Physiotherapy?

313
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,278
This is good!

314
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,757
Please hand this letter to my brother.

315
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,039
And if he's going mad

316
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,953
Just tell him,

317
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,471
I am not getting younger either.

318
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,068
Will you do this?
- I will. - Thanks a lot.

319
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,191
Good.
- Bye.

320
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,475
Lighter.

321
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,952
She said, you shouldn't get mad,
because she's not getting younger either

322
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,717
Is it her birthday?

323
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,711
The lighter, please.

324
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,109
Of course.

325
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,756
What's in this?

326
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,117
How should I know?
It's from your sister.

327
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,274
It's an exercise bike.
- What?

328
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,438
A bike. For indoors.

329
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,676
Take it with you and leave.

330
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,435
It's heavy.
can't carry it by myself

331
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,354
Ok, see you tomorrow then?

332
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,391
Bulb.
- What?

333
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,555
The bulb in the doorway.
Change it.

334
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,593
I am off since twenty minutes.
I'll do it tomorrow, ok?

335
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,877
You change the bulb now.

336
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,793
And where's the fucking ladder?
- Ladder?

337
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,751
I don't understand. I work from 9:30 am
to 6pm, 40 hours a week.

338
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,952
Enough time for you to give orders
I've no choice.

339
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,640
But I also respond to complete
sentences. If that's possible.

340
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,831
if I could do it myself,

341
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,832
climb a ladder,

342
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,751
do the grocery shopping,
drive a car,

343
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,954
believe me...

344
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,630
I wouldn't take up your time.

345
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,112
Please turn on the light.

346
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,799
Yes.

347
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,958
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

348
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,596
Take this garbage out with you!

349
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,596
Cassette.

350
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,955
Lighter. Lighter please.

351
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,029
Krzeminski...
- A strange guy.

352
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,439
Krzeminski has always lived at the camp.
He won't move out.

353
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,035
I don't get it. He's got family.

354
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,199
Why not live with them?
Or at least somewhere else?

355
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,630
Never change an old tree.

356
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,470
Where did you learn that??
- It's pretty.

357
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,275
German's a nice language.

358
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,634
An old tree like that can topple over.
I almost saw it today.

359
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,390
If he were to fall from that ladder,
it'd be "good night" for him.

360
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,152
Good night.

361
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,515
Hello. Good morning.

362
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,357
Have you learned

363
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,358
some Polish yet?

364
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,953
"Troche". "Przepraszam".

365
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,231
"Dzien dobry". "Dziekuje".
"Tak, tak, tak".

366
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,998
Very good.

367
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,350
Just four words.

368
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,434
Don't listen to him..

369
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,272
My pleasure. Hello.

370
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,833
Tadeusz.
- Thaddeus.

371
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,953
Boguslawa. - Oh?
- Boguslawa.

372
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,840
We have it all for your here.

373
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:54,123
A garden, a room, good food.

374
00:41:54,124 --> 00:41:57,015
In this one-horse town?

375
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,006
Stanislaw.

376
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:01,643
At least it is not the camp.

377
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:07,003
You never understood my point.
What a pity.

378
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:10,958
Stay stubborn then.

379
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:13,310
You are good at that.

380
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,045
You are right.
I am good at that.

381
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,591
Please turn off
this sentimental nonsense!

382
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,717
She says I should move in with her.

383
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,029
Why not? Her place is nice.
In the country.

384
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,750
My place is here.

385
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,476
I have a duty

386
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,196
she doesn't understand that.

387
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,955
She doesn't understand,

388
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,309
that I'm needed here.

389
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,992
Good night.

390
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,029
Thank you for driving me.

391
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,878
You are welcome.

392
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:48,911
Wonderfull!
Get up. You hear me?

393
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,157
Ok. Ok.

394
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:58,728
Enough! Can't you get up once
On your own and go to work?

395
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:01,462
How late is it?
- Twenty past five!

396
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:04,097
Shit!
- Shit.

397
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:07,956
Get going!

398
00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:11,486
You have waken up Sven.

399
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:15,854
Go to work!

400
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,592
Everything okay?

401
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,629
Sorry, I didn't want to wake you up.
- Doesn't matter.

402
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,319
I want to ask you a favor.
In a few days, the German trainees

403
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,557
will put up a memorial stone at Monowice.

404
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,032
It's from Rhon Chemie
who supports us here too.

405
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,278
maybe you could
take care of the project.

406
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,714
Sure.

407
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,440
You should read up
on the historical background a little.

408
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,917
and assist them when they're there...

409
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,714
No problem.

410
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,796
Have you been there yet?
- No.

411
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,317
It was a subcamp, for forced laborers
at IG-Farben.

412
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,869
Come on!

413
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,759
It's nice here.

414
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,278
This is Monowice.

415
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,232
Auschwitz III.

416
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,877
What was? Where? All over here?
- Yes.

417
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,752
This was the camp street
where you're riding now.

418
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,470
And the barracks were over there
where the houses are now?

419
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,912
Yes.

420
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,638
Wild. It looks like a normal village.

421
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,394
Wait! Look at this.

422
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,915
They want to put up
the memorial here.

423
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,839
How many prisoners were here?
- What?

424
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,875
How many prisoners were here?
- Around 30.000.

425
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,755
Come on , Sven.
No tours today.

426
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,077
Look here! A Bunker
-Come on.

427
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,830
The subject bothers you.

428
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,672
But how is it for you?
I'm sorry. I mean...

429
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,519
You lived here all your life and...

430
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,594
So?

431
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,679
Is it commonplace for you
to ride through Monowice?

432
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,553
or is it somehow...

433
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,956
Yes, but I...I was born here

434
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,595
I live here. My life is here.

435
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,228
Yes I know, but...

436
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,749
You live where humanity's
greatest atrocity took place.

437
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,555
You're living here now too.

438
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,550
How... do you feel about it?
You're German.

439
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,159
What do you think?

440
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,356
I don't understand the question.

441
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,672
Should we go? .

442
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,429
Want to go see a movie?
- You wouldn't understand a word.

443
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,796
So what?

444
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,510
Maybe another time.
- Okay.

445
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,596
But...
I don't understand...

446
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,110
Preserve! Not repair!

447
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:55,479
This is the most important 
Basic principle.

448
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,990
Conserve,
Not repair!

449
00:48:57,991 --> 00:49:01,725
He's never been to university.

450
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:05,163
Somebody's gotta talk with him.

451
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:10,035
I cannot take responsibility
Any longer.

452
00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:13,783
He's not gonna get any
Suitcases any longer.

453
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,633
No more suitcases.

454
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,080
What?
- It's over!

455
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,638
I don't understand.

456
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,909
Why no more suitcases?

457
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,834
I don't know either.
They said something like....

458
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,428
there are problems at the moment...

459
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,835
it's going slowly...

460
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,070
They need to look into it.

461
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,829
I don't know.
I didn’t understand the whole point of it.

462
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,193
Just as well.
Some time off.

463
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,152
You can visit your family

464
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,829
Or drink a beer with colleagues.

465
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,629
Horse betting.
- Don't bother me with that.

466
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,393
Good Morning.

467
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,151
Yes?
- Hello.

468
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,271
Everything's alright with the suitcases.
- Oh yes?

469
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,876
I'll be on my way.
- Alright fine.

470
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:14,345
Stay still!

471
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,671
Can you wet this?

472
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:27,240
Don't move!

473
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:30,079
Hold this. Face towards me.

474
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,832
Are you able to patch this... ah!

475
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,480
Look at me!

476
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,231
Can you cut the bandage
and pull it out?

477
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,232
Thanks. - Do you need more?
- Yes.

478
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,828
What happened?
- Nothing.

479
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:50,922
Don't be childish.
- You hurt me.

480
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:54,739
Just leave me alone, you idiot!

481
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,276
I have lost my job.

482
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,719
Why?

483
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,593
Germans kicked me out..
They're firing people.

484
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,351
Damn it.

485
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:25,940
What should I do?

486
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,157
Don't worry about it

487
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:32,253
I am fed up with this.

488
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,114
I'll let you be.

489
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,559
Wait.

490
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,958
We're a little late,
everyone's here already.

491
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,272
They won't start without me.

492
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,238
Mr. Krzeminski.

493
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,909
Good morning. How nice of you
to join us.

494
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,678
Mr. Friedrich
One of our board members

495
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,234
He came from Germany
especially for this.

496
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,716
On behalf of my company,
thank you for your time..

497
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,874
Good morning.
- Good morning.

498
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,552
You already know our mayor.
- Good morning, Mr. Krzeminski.

499
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,319
We're ready then. We can start.

500
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,150
The prisoners feared

501
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,478
the selections the most.

502
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,390
Right here, where you're standing,

503
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,154
On this roll call area

504
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,833
The SS medics used to decide
In a matter of seconds

505
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,719
On life and death.

506
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,670
I saw the bored faces of the doctors

507
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,598
Quite often.

508
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,676
They felt uncomfortable,

509
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,079
Just looking at us.

510
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,557
They only judged us

511
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,195
Based on our value to them.

512
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,515
Thank you, Mr. Krzeminski.

513
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,557
Thank you for your talk.

514
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,277
Okay we can take the picture. Thanks.

515
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,233
Mr Krzeminski, come, please.

516
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,953
No... sorry. I think it's better
if you'd come over here.

517
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,315
It's always very tiring for him.

518
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,918
Fine. We'll take the picture
without him.

519
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,238
What a remarkable man
this Mr. Krzeminski.

520
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,915
What goes on in the mind
of such a person?

521
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,713
Well, maybe you should have
let him finish.

522
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,192
I thought his talk was losing impact.
-What impact?

523
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,629
He should just talk some.

524
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,149
He can decide on his own
for how long.

525
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,878
Not everyone has the strength
to deal with the past,

526
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,149
like you do.

527
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,030
I think what you do is good.
You work here.

528
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,197
Do you know Krzysztof Lanuszewski?
He works for you.

529
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,709
A friend of yours?
- Yes, he’s Polish. About my age.

530
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,832
Yes you just fired him.
- I know him well.

531
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,952
Just like back then.
Thrown away when of no value.

532
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,236
He came too late or not at all.

533
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,828
Our plant cannot accept this.

534
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,675
And your comparison is tasteless.

535
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,109
No, no Krzystof you should have
told me why you lost your job.

536
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,471
You know one minute ago I'm standing
with Mrs Schneider talking about you...

537
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,319
It's not about Schneider.
- I want to help him.

538
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,831
Who asked you to get involved?
- You saw how they treated him...

539
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,191
Schneider is a real bitch
-Yes - She’s a bitch.

540
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,517
Why the sudden interest in Krzeminski?
- He was in the Camp. Let him talk.

541
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,598
That's not the problem.
You're the problem idiot.

542
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:41,014
You are the problem, Idiot.
- Calm down.

543
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:46,945
You are not my mother, ok?
I am really fed up with this.

544
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,156
I've had it.
I'm leaving.

545
01:00:50,157 --> 01:00:52,786
I am done. Thanks a lot.
I am leaving.

546
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,109
Just go.
I'll be gone in four weeks too.

547
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,077
What? you're going away?

548
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,274
I applied for a scholarship.
In Brussels.

549
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,751
To become an interpreter
for the agricultural commission.

550
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,076
And...
- And I won't earn a cent there..

551
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,115
And when...
- The exam is in Warsaw tomorrow.

552
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,595
And if you pass the exam?

553
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,389
Then I start in four weeks.

554
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,840
Hey.
- Good morning.

555
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,838
How do I look?
Can i go like this??

556
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,113
Yeah...

557
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,352
It looks like Brussels.

558
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,194
Are you going to wish me luck?
- Of course.

559
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,391
My train leaves in 30 minutes.

560
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,958
Mr. Krzeminski?

561
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,873
Mr Krzeminski?

562
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,353
Oh shit!

563
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,472
Mr. Krzeminski?
Can you hear me?

564
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,478
Mr. Krzeminski, what happened?

565
01:03:58,479 --> 01:04:18,275
What happened?

566
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,553
Here's some water?
- It's fine...

567
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,558
It’s fine. Leave me alone.

568
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,957
Is everything?
- It’s fine. Leave me alone.

569
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,435
It's okay.

570
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,632
Go!

571
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,118
What happened?

572
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,192
What I missed the most,

573
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,915
was not having cigarettes.

574
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,756
But if you pass out like that
nobody'd know.

575
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,714
It'd take forever for someone
to come by. It's not right.

576
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,758
I'm still functioning. Everything is okay.

577
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,799
You came.

578
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,875
By chance. I brought cigarettes for you.
If I had not...

579
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,634
Maybe you're right.
Can you call my sister?

580
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,751
A man like me...

581
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,428
isn't needed anymore
around here.

582
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,679
Well, I do believe,
that you are needed here.

583
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,716
For youth groups, for example.
And for the people you talk to.

584
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,949
It's like...
It's quite different isn't?

585
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,359
Show them "Schindlers Liste".

586
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,956
That has more impact.

587
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,595
Is the suitcase ready?
- Yeah, ready.

588
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,554
Na?

589
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,115
The boss asked me
where I come from.

590
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,949
and when I told him ...

591
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,993
they looked at me uneasily..
Everyone.

592
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,240
Maybe, that's why they chose me.
-Nonsense.

593
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,510
I do...
- I don't think so.

594
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,074
No...
- What?

595
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,352
And I had to sign right there...
the same evening...

596
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,756
I had to sign all documents.

597
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:57,475
It was strange. A few signatures
take me away from here.

598
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,038
Yeah...

599
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,556
Please don't do that.
- What? What's wrong?

600
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,513
Hey?

601
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,950
Talk to me
I don't understand you.

602
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,433
Yes I know.

603
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,874
How can I explain it?

604
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,314
I don't want that..
- Say what's on your mind.

605
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,951
I'm gone in 2 weeks.

606
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,278
You’re gone in a few months.
And it's different for you.

607
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,917
You don't know what you want to do.
You're waiting for what comes.

608
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,674
That has nothing to do with it.
- Yes it does.

609
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,635
I have only one chance to get away from here,
do you understand?

610
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,029
And I want to go away.

611
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,235
I would like to apologize
for Sven's behavior

612
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,156
and hope that this transgression

613
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,309
does not impair our good relations.

614
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,957
I will make sure that
this does not get repeated.

615
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:49,582
Krzeminski's work with the department

616
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:53,814
Is honored. - 
But we are part of a museum.

617
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:58,608
We have to consider
Every single piece.

618
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,670
Mr. Herold, excuse me,
but it's obvious...

619
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,837
that his work is being taken away.
It's his job. - Sven It's enough.

620
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,236
It's important to him. - Enough.
- Who says "sensitive place"!

621
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,952
Are you deaf?

622
01:11:10,953 --> 01:11:35,760
I am sorry, Mr. Krzeminski.

623
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,357
Mr. Krzeminski...

624
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,957
I'm really sorry.

625
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,034
I know I shouldn't have lied to you.

626
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,390
We just had one hour,

627
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,758
to take the bags,
the suitcase

628
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,591
and other things away from the prisoners

629
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,917
on the ramp.

630
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,959
I have promised...

631
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,594
these people, these families,

632
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,477
children... that they

633
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,589
would get their suitcases back.

634
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,757
Go now.

635
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,751
I would like to be alone.

636
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,590
Didn't you hear me?

637
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,912
What's this about?

638
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,831
What are you doing?
- I'm going back to Berlin.

639
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,509
What? - I'm going back.
It's too complicated here.

640
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,031
What's too complicated?

641
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,795
I went shopping for dinner.

642
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,914
So?

643
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,234
Wait here please.

644
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,959
Excuse me, do you speak English or German?
- Yes german.

645
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,868
Wonderful. The youth center?
Uliza Prschesy...

646
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,958
It's called "Ulica Przemyslowa".
Bus no 1 over there.

647
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,753
You know your way around??
- Yes. - Thank you.

648
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,029
Let's go to bus no.1 over there.

649
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:22,438
It's over there. -There?
-I'll come with you for the moment.

650
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:29,551
It's very kind of you. - No problem.
I forgot something anyway.

651
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,669
Our civilization, our culture
will be ultimately be judged,

652
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,476
on how we deal with this dark period
in history, right?

653
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,037
The systematic killing of millions of people
places a challenge before us.

654
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,958
I need to get to the ticket machine.

655
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,631
I think it's exemplary
what you're doing here.

656
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,831
Especially for our students.
