Hey, Bastard. How can you kill her off, Bastard

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Stop here.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do you think, I killed Kim Ae-kyung?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is that what this is?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
i said i'd take her back.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
When did i say i'll kill her?

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a Businessman, and no longer a mobster.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,900
You know, businessmen

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't do murder. They make business.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,500
Let's now get to the hearing.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,000
Kim Ae-kyung, please enter

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Today's the hearing, remember?

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Min- soo, do you like this?

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
Wow, thank you.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When is mom coming?

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Please stand for your oath.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
uh...

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,000
I solemnly swear

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the testimony about to be given

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,800
shall be nothing but the truth.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
huh? It's mom. She's on TV.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
congressman, please take turns

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to ask your questions.

24
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,000
Kim Ae-kyung. Did mayor Bae Sang-do

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
take bribes from chairman  Cho Young-gook?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,190
Prosecutor, those above the law...

27
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,190
We don't fall to the gutter.

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,300
Do you now realize

29
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,100
who you've been up against?

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,800
No. He hasn't .

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just you wait.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
I'll make it exactly like

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,100
three years ago.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
There is circumstantial evidence

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that you were involved in their act of bribery.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,700
Do you deny it?

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,400
That's not the truth.

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,500
Don't make false statements.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm not.

40
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,400
Aren't you well acquainted with Chairman Cho and Mayor Bae?

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,530
I'ev never met Mayor Bae.

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,200
The people are watching.

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,060
Why do you think you are here?

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm not sure.

45
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,200
Woo Jae-moon, that bastard.

(Bad Guys : Vile City) Subscene@Whimsical

47
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,930
While there were arguments on why Kim Ae-kyung

48
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,930
hadn't shown up to the hearings as a witness,

49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,930
her appearance today give us

50
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,930
a great deal of implications on this case.

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,800
Wouldn't this throw of prosecution's stance?

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:50,860
The prosecution claimed
Wouldn't this throw of prosecution's stance?

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,260
The prosecution claimed

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,600
Chairman Cho Young-gook was keeping Kim Ae-kyung

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,130
from talking on the stand.

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,600
But now, She's come to attend.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,130
She testified that nothing out of the ordinary

58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,200
took place to the tender process.

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,660
So this means...

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes, that's right.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The figures show a swing in public opinion.

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Ever since Kim Ae-Kyung came to the hearing,

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
public support for Mayor Bae's administration

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
has increased by six percentage point.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,330
And HS's Group's shares climbed 24 percent to...

Yeah.

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You're taking that too often. You holding up?

69
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,260
What if i'm not?

70
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,130
Rest. After this case.

71
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,330
Rest? What rest?

72
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,200
Don't worry. I got Pil-soon.

Yes?

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
What will you do now?

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,060
How will you make Kim Ae-kyung talk?

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,600
Do you have a plan?

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm still thinking.

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,730
So there's no plan.

80
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,800
Phew.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Why did you lose Kim Ae-kyung?

82
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
To Cho Young-gook's guys?

83
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,060
If things backfire, that'll be the end of us.

84

You even get that?

85

You said you're bitter.

That you're up for anything. As long as you get Cho.

151

Then show me.

152

169
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,200
Uh, this way.

170
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,930
Subscene@Whimsical

171
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,130
One sundaeguk and soju.

172
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,460
No sundae tonight. I'm out.

173
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,660
Just give me anything you got.

174
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,660
How long has he been there?

175
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,740
Two hours.

176
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,010
Jae-moon, what brings  you here?

177
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,530
You're not the only regular.

178
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,130
What's happened to you face?

179
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,660
And where's your wig?

180
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:38,670
I lost it, busy with work.
And where's your wig?

181
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,330
I lost it, busy with work.

182
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,410
I'll get a new one tomorrow.

183
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,200
Hey, I'm all for civil-rights lawyer stuff,

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,210
but also think of your rights.
Hey, I'm all for civil-rights lawyer stuff,

185
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,210
but also think of your rights.

186
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,400
Who did you fight for this time?

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,410
Evictees of Inseo-dong redevelopment district.
Who did you fight for this time?

188
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,400
Evictees of Inseo-dong redevelopment district.

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,410
I decided to take their lawsuit.
Evictees of Inseo-dong redevelopment district.

190
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,000
I decided to take their lawsuit.

191
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,730
I got in a few punches myself.

192
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,000
You know me, I still got my fighting skills.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,200
That's nothing to barg about, Save the fighting for court.

194
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,530
And don't get yourself beat up.

195
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,660
Think of your safety.

196
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,400
well, It first needs yo get to court to fight.

197
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,070
Back when I was prosecutor, I was at the courthouse

198
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,610
more often when I was home.

199
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,130
That,s how it was.

200
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,900
Why is it hard to reach for it now?

201
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,460
Having left since then

202
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,960
Why do you live like that?

203
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,960
Be like our other colleagues.

204
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Make money off divorce clients.

205
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Get yourself a good wig.

206
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,960
Why pass the bar? For this?

207
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,400
You call this doing well?

208
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,800
Then what is exactly is doing well?

209
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,370
You tell me.

210
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll make the most of that.

211
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,840
Sigh.

212
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,370
Jae-moon.

213
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,430
You know.

214
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,740
I want seowon, the city we live in,

215
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,060
to turn out like this.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,730
Good judgement prevails, not absurdity.

217
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,910
Rule of law prevails, not expediency.

218
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,940
Coexistence prevails, not survival instincts.

219
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Kind heart prevails, not indifference.

220
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,670
Nonviolence prevails, not violence.

221
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,060
To become such a place,

222
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,000
the people here shouldn't be hurt,

223
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,830
and to protect them from such pains.

224
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,830
this is the only way.

225
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,400
I may lose all the time get beat up and cry.

226
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,930
I know nothing about it.

227
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:52,940
I've never seen that.
I know nothing about it.

228
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,430
I've never seen that.

229
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:54,440
Do you know Oh Kwang-seon?
I've never seen that.

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,800
Do you know Oh Kwang-seon?

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:55,810
No, I don't
Do you know Oh Kwang-seon?

232
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,070
No, I don't

233
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,760
Come on, back in 2016...

234
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,730
You may tell me I'm a fool,

235
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,070
not getting how the world works.

236
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,500
But living like this,

237
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
trying  to change  something,

238
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,210
makes me free of conscience.

239
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,510
Don't you think every town needs a fool like me?

240
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,400
A few more would do better.

241
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Yes, Chief.

242
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,010
Let those people  go.

243
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,910
Let's start over.

244
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,870
And not bark up the wrong tree.

245
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,240
Yes, Sir.

246
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,460
Sigh.

247
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,010
Investigator.

248
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,770
Let them all go.

249
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,100
What are you waiting for? Send them home.

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,060
Thanks for your cooperation .

251
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
We'll get in touch with you.

252
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,310
You can go home now.
We'll get in touch with you.

253
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,360
You can go home now.

254
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,100
I'll receive you like a prosecutor next time.

255
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,240
(prosecution)

256
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,010
Having Kim Ae-Kyung at the hearing,

257
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,940
was that you idea?

258
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,460
Why side  with the likes of Cho Young-gook and Bae Sang-do?

259
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
You weren't that kind of guy.

260
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,540
Don't you know who they are?

261
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,730
How could i not?

262
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,730
I know them well.

263
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,100
Then why back them up?

264
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,760
Mayor Bae Sang-do was elected to office .

265
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,570
We should respect the decision of our people.

266
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,740
What if the people are wrong?

267
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,270
What makes us the judge of that?

268
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,130
We're prosecutors.

269
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,370
Does  that give us power?

270
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,570
Is that why you became one? Is that it, ji-soo?

271
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,760
Senior.

272
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,570
Remember when we we're student activists?

273
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,760
You were amazing then.

274
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,870
On a podium, you spoke to hundreds of students.

275
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,710
That was really impressive.

276
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,970
Do you know what I thought then?

277
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,870
So that's power.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,070
That guy, Ban Joon-hyuk, has power over us.

279
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,940
That came to mind.

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,940
What are you trying to say?

281
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,270
Where there are people, there is power.

282
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,570
If you don't take it, someone will.

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,570
You may argue otherwise,

284
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,310
but the prosecution is packed with authority.

285
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,110
And we have prosecution power.

286
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,940
That's the very reason we exist.

287
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,840
Stop your shenanigans.

288
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,070
When we're through, it won't look good

289
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,640
that a prosecutor has their back.

290
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,610
Get that, Ban Joon-hyuk.

291
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,770
Well, I don't know.

292
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,530
We'd have to wait and see

293
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:28,540
whichever way this works out.
We'd have to wait and see

294
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,310
whichever way this works out.

295
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,840
I mean, you've no hand to play.

296
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,500
Aren't you cornered, District Chief?

297
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,500
Many are suspicious now.

298
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,670
Think about it.

299
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,410
If the knives you dealt until now

300
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,610
point at your own neck.

301
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,330
and they see what you've done

302
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:48,440
and concealed all this time,
and they see what you've done

303
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,410
and concealed all this time,

304
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,360
who would be better off?

305
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,440
Senior, Are you threatening him?
who would be better off?

306
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,400
Senior, Are you threatening him?

307
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,410
No need.
Senior, Are you threatening him?

308
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,370
No need.

309
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,410
Joon-hyuk.

310
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
Are you that ambitious?

311
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,810
Even striking against your own?

312
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,640
Not everyone is like you, sir.

313
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,170
It's time you know that.

314
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,310
Sigh.

315
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,010
And?

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,140
Where is Woo Jae-moon now?

317
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,870
Subscene@Whimsical

318
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,270
Chief Woo Jae-moon.

319
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,670
The District Chief doesn't look too happy.

320
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,240
Is something wrong?

321
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,470
Why did you let them go?

322
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,510
Taking her family as hostage,

323
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,170
so she'll say what we want?

324
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,510
Isn't that a bit humiliating?

325
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
That's not how prosecutors work.

326
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,570
Not how prosecutors work?

327
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,570
Then tell me, how do we work?

328
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,410
I hope we don't cross that line.

329
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,310
We're not thugs.

330
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,130
They had no business here.

331
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,140
What was with that?!
They had no business here.

332
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,340
What was with that?!

333
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,810
Does that make you a true prosecutor?

334
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,270
That's your problem, you fool.

335
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,860
While your junior associates climb the ladder,

336
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:43,870
wonder why you're still stuck?
While your junior associates climb the ladder,

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,870
wonder why you're still stuck?

338
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,360
That line you won't cross!

339
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,370
Everyone else did.
That line you won't cross!

340
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,210
Everyone else did.

341
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,470
So just grab at Kim Ae-kyung?

342
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,160
Not enough with her parents,

343
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,170
but also lock up her kid?
Not enough with her parents,

344
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,610
but also lock up her kid?

345
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,140
Is that what I should?

346
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,670
Cho Young-gook said this last time.

347
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,940
Not to wield a knife at who

348
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm fond of or who I'd like to last.

349
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,710
That I could be the one to die.

350
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,910
So do you know what I did?

351
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,740
You. I called you.

352
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,910
To wield a knife against Cho Young-gook.

353
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,730
Call them back in.

354
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:21,740
And break them.
Call them back in.

355
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,410
And break them.

356
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,230
Then who knows?

357
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,240
Maybe I won't ask for you again.
Then who knows?

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,640
Maybe I won't ask for you again.

359
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,670
I can't do that.

360
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,770
I can do anything to get at Cho Young-gook or Dongbang Gang.

361
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll do anything you order.

362

But let's not torment innocent folks.

We're prosecutors.

364
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,810
Then kill him.

365
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Go kill Cho Young-gook.

366
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,270
You said you'd do anything I order.

367
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,470
What's wrong?

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,310
Can't do it?

369
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,010
You don't have guts.

370
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,170
That's your very problem.

371
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,470

I owe you one.

378

No. Nothing particular.

No. Nothing particular.

You know, Kim.

383
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,240
You're not hiding stuff, are you?

384
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,240
Of course not.

385
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,240
I got nothing to hide.

Sure. take care.

Yeah.

How relaxing.

394
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,810
that took long.

395
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,570
You didn't eat yet right?

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
You didn't tell my mom, right?

397
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,510
About what?
You didn't tell my mom, right?

That thing. I'm dead if she finds out.
About what?

That thing. I'm dead if she finds out.

401
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,670
So why did you?

402
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,010
If You're worried about her, stay away from such a place.

403
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,670
Who says I'm concerned for her? It's me I'm worried about.

404
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,740
I told you, she'd kill me.

405
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,470
Anyways, keep your promise.

406
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,260
Or I'd make you pay.

If you tell her, I mean.
Or I'd make you pay.

Eat first.

if you've had quite enough,

420
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,210
leave them.

421
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,970
That would do.

422
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
And end up like you?

423
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,540
Lose everything and get hurt?

424

Run a restaurant? In a place like this?

425

No.

He may be a hazard.
Shouldn't we stop Han Kang-joo?

Honestly, Chief.

I'm not sure I know who you really are.

You think people are that obvious?
Hey. There's no black and white.

You think people are that obvious?

Not so.
You think people are that obvious?

485

Not so.

This bloody world?

487
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:33,870
It's all gray.
This bloody world?

488
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,040
It's all gray.

489
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,810
you should know that now.

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,270
Yeah, but...

what are you trying to do here?

492
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,860
Just don't do anything, you bastard.

493
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:45,870
Whether Han Kang-joo kills Cho Young-gook or not,
Just don't do anything, you bastard.

494

Whether Han Kang-joo kills Cho Young-gook or not,

495

Shut your eyes, turn a deaf ear

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,900
and just sit there quietly.

497
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:50,910
Is that so hard to do?
and just sit there quietly.

Is that so hard to do?

Hey, why should we live like that?

663
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,600
Fighting all the time?

664
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:45,610
Can't we help and share?
Fighting all the time?

665
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,960
Can't we help and share?

666
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:48,970
Isn't that what makes us human?
Can't we help and share?

667
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,400
Isn't that what makes us human?

668
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,410
Shouldn't we live like that?
Isn't that what makes us human?

669
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,410
Shouldn't we live like that?

670
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,770
Yeah...

671
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,240
I get what you're saying.

672
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,910
But now, Han Kang-joo is your chess piece.

673
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,210
What make you any different from Cho Young-gook?

674
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,870
What's that?

675
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,640
What's that?

676
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,510
This isn't...

677
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,010
This isn't right.

678
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,570
Kang-joo was there? Today?

679
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,010
Yes, Sir.

680
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,760
I trusted my instincts.

681
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:47,770
and was able to stop him.
I trusted my instincts.

682
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,270
and was able to stop him.

683
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,010
Ugh!

684
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,940
I'm sure those bastards will come at you again.

685
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,840
Those prosecutors got the nerve to...

686
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,710
Those guys...

687
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,270
They were there to snuff me out?

688
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,240
Yes, I think so.

689
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,970
If that's what you saw, so it is.

690
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,910
What do you think we should do?

691
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,370
How do we get them back?

692
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
Any ideas?

693
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,210
To be honest,

694
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,310
I didn't expect to see you there.

695
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,510
What do you mean?

696
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,410
I thought you'd let Han Kang-joo stir things up.

697
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,070
Hey, I'm prosecutor.

698
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,460
I know. But I didn't realize

699
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:05,470
until today.
I know. But I didn't realize

700
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,670
until today.

701
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,700
You're walking all over me again.

702
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:11,710
It's because I like you, Chief.
You're walking all over me again.

703
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,410
It's because I like you, Chief.

704
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,470
You're a prosecutor. And I'm an investigator.

705
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,440
When people like us get to work,

706
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,140
they we're exercising public authority.

707
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,900
So we shouldn't forget about laws

708
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:26,910
and kill people straight up.
So we shouldn't forget about laws

709
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,040
and kill people straight up.

710
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,810
I mean, people like us

711
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,340
shouldn't get used to the taste of blood.

712
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,210
Blood tastes horrible.

713
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,640
Rule of law is more appetizing.

714
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,910
We should keep to that. Don't you agree?

715
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,070
That bastard Ha Sang-mo.

716
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,070
I think he recognized Kang-joo.

717
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,240
Keep him safe, Joo-myeong.

718
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,810
They can also stike back, so be ready.

719
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,740
Yup. Sure. Will do.

720
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,160
What's with that laughter?

721
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,170
You're excited today.
What's with that laughter?

722
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,440
You're excited today.

723
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,240
What's got you in a good mood?

724
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,710
Is your wife not at home?

725
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,530
Hey, why did you tell me about Jin-pyeong's order?

726
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:26,540
How is that being loyal?

How is that being loyal?

728
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm always your man.

729
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,640
I may be in tatters from all sorts of beatings,

730
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,210
but I'm your investigator, Chief.

731
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,170
I always will be.

732
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,640
What's with the smooth talk?

733
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,870
You say this to everyone, huh?

734
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,840
That's my sales secret.

735
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,840
I need to take a leak.

736
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,270
My bladder isn't working. I keep wanting to go.

737
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,340
Oops.

738
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,040
Subscene@Whimsical

739
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,110
Yes?

740
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,440
Ah, yeah. It's alright.

741
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,410
...due to rising suspicious,

742
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,140
conflict of interest concerning

743
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,300
Inseo-dong's redevelopment project

is getting worse.

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,030
Seo-won's Inseo-dong....

747
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
Does it hurt a lot?
Seo-won's Inseo-dong....

748
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,140
Does it hurt a lot?

749
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,170
I'm okay.

750
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,540
Gosh...

751
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,540
I'll bring you some.

752
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,170
Sigh.

753
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,810
Hey.

754
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,970
Get yourself treated.

755
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,310
Oh man.

756
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,910
What'd you do without me?

757
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,240
You'll die like that.

758
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,470
Whatever.

759
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,670
Don't worry and hurry back.

760
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,770
The sick belongs to hospitals.

761
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,210
This won't help...

762
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:20,840
Stop that nonsense.

763
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,740
Let's talk afterwards.

764
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,140
oh man.

765
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,510
Damn it.

766
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,370
There has been a brawl

767
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,810
over Inseo-dong's redevelopment issue.

768
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,510
This morning protestor crashed the briefing

769
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,940
where supporters of the redevelopment attended,

770
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,970
leaving five people hurt.

771
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,510
Picket- holders burst into on scene

772
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,870
and threw rotten eggs towards

773
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,110
Hello.

HS Group Chairman Cho Young-gook.

778
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,710
Inseo-dong's redevelopment project is expected to face challenges.

779
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,070
Reporter Park Dong-joo, what's your take on this?

780
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,300

Come on Why isn't it working.

Excuse me..

793
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,840
My daughter's feverish.

794
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,470
I don't have a car to take her to the hospital.

795
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,470
Can't you give us a ride?

796
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,970
Why are there fewer pills?

797
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,500
I just pass on what i get.

798
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:11,510
You should've asked for more.

00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,210
What's wrong? Huh?

801
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,930
-What? -Why are you sweating?

Here, the drugs.

806
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,170
You know... this can't be helped.

Huh? can't be helped?

808
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,670
Are you doped?

No, It's not.... It's not like that.

00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,840
-Joo-myeong. -Chief...

00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,470
Subscene@Whimsical

829
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,040
What's taking you?

830
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,460
Don't come here.

831
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,470
Pil-soon!
Don't come here.

832
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,470
Pil-soon!

833
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,410
Don't you think every town needs a fool like me?

834
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,710
A few more would do better.

835
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,440
Hey.

836
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,410
Sorry to burst your bubble.

837
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,410
But that won't happen.

838
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,470
If good judgement ever prevailed,

839
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,910
things wouldn't be this way.

840
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,910
If the rule of law ever prevailed,

841
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,730
we wouldn't have come this far

842
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:44,740
and you wouldn't be in this state.
we wouldn't have come this far

843
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,740
and you wouldn't be in this state.

844
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,340
They made me call you out.

845
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,810
 Pil-soon.

846
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,160
Look at you.

847
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,170
How can you live like this?
Look at you.

848
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,970
How can you live like this?

849
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,610
Our City,

850
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,160
it doesn't work that way.

851
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,170
Or it'd already be what you said.
it doesn't work that way.

852
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,440
Or it'd already be what you said.

853
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,110
You live in your dreams.

854
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,110
I'll go clean out the feces.

855
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,870
So.

856
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,210
Spit it out.

857
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,140
I have a favor to ask.

858
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:08,970
What is it?

859
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,170
Whether cops or our guys,

860
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,540
get me 20 men.

861
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,770
That bastard Cho Young-gook...

862
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,240
I'll go break his neck.

863
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,770
You'll go all-out?

864
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,610
It'd be hard to clear the mess.

865
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,570
I don't care for that.

866
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,040
I'll quit if i have to,

867
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,340
or get myself in prison.

868
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,770
just let me break

869
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,340
Cho Young-gook's neck.

870
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,370
Hey.

871
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,510
Can you send me ten guys?

872
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,810

Woo Jae-moon.

877
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,440
Any particular guys?

878
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,240
Younger the better? Who fight well?

879
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,240
It doesn't matter.

880
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,840
Just mad dogs.

881
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,210
Mad dogs will do.

01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,610
