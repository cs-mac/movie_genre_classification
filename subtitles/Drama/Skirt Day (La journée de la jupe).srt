1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,620
The Ballad of the Salty Sea

2
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,763
The Map of the Pacific Ocean.

3
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,869
Once I didn't know how to read it.

4
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,397
My name is Pandora,

5
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,291
Pandora Groovesnore

6
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:18,850
I met Corto when I was a child.

7
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,988
It was November 1913,
precisely the first of November.

8
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:29,056
On that day I saw Corto
Maltese for the very first time.

9
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,365
Now I'm a good man's wife.

10
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,300
But when my cousin
Cain comes to visit me,

11
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,180
we always draw out this
map, ruined by the sprays

12
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,180
of salty water and by time.

13
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:45,773
We unfold it slowly,
almost ceremoniously.

14
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:48,761
We think back of that
adventure we like to call

15
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,161
our ballad.

16
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,916
We simply say "the ballad"

17
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:56,553
but it was the turning
point of our lives.

18
00:01:56,753 --> 00:01:59,020
Nothing could tear us
apart, my cousin and I.

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,460
We were castaways, lost in
the middle of the Pacific,

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,311
surrounded by mysterious islands
and adults we couldn't understand.

21
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,071
The First World War
hadn't been declared yet,

22
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,386
and it seemed to me
as distant and unlikely

23
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,648
as the day when I would turn twenty.

24
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:19,906
Yet, on board of terrible
Captain Rasputin’s catamaran,

25
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,260
which had rescued us,

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,181
no one would have bet a bottle of rum

27
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,417
on the chances of the peace.

28
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,995
On the other hand, nobody wished for it.

29
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:29,309
Everyone wanted that war:

30
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:32,512
pirates, sailors, soldiers and spies.

31
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,629
Cain had succeeded to
determine with precision

32
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,067
the exact point where we
had crossed Rasputin’s route,

33
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,964
between the 155° meridian
and the 6° parallel,

34
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,945
and also the point where, after a while,

35
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,103
we were rescued by a Dutch boat.

36
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,188
He told me that during
the first months of the war

37
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,732
a part of the Pacific had
been under the Germans

38
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:54,919
but thanks to the Japanese, the Allies
succeeded in getting rid of the Prussians.

39
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:57,094
Cain gets excited when
he recalls Pitcairn.

40
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,318
That island is so small it
doesn't appear on the papers

41
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,376
and it's there that in January 1790

42
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,474
the mutineers of the Bounty, led
by Lord Chief Fletcher Christian,

43
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:10,832
chose to hide together
with some Tahitian women.

44
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,741
That story was told him by Corto.

45
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,663
It still makes him daydream.

46
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,920
We always think about the "Escondida",

47
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,158
the hidden island,

48
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,534
the Monk's island,

49
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,267
our mysterious island.

50
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,288
Our "ballad" lasted longer than a year,

51
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,973
the year 1914,

52
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:29,806
a year when everything changed:

53
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,992
the world, its frontiers

54
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:34,328
and two youths, Cain and me.

55
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:36,339
But no, nothing has changed.

56
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,316
The Pacific is always the biggest,

57
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,332
the most violent, the most indifferent.

58
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,813
As calm as a lake

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,806
or as violent as a volcano.

60
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:49,059
I'm the Pacific Ocean,
I'm the biggest of all.

61
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:53,228
But I'm not always Pacific.

62
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,325
I've just calmed down,

63
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:58,662
but yesterday I dusted away

64
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:01,179
three or four islands

65
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,644
and a bunch of nutshells.

66
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:06,521
I wonder how this one could make it.

67
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:11,741
Perhaps because captain
Rasputin knows his business,

68
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,880
perhaps because his
sailors come from the Fijis,

69
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,960
or maybe because today is "Tarowean",

70
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:21,998
"the day of the surprises".

71
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,931
Old pig!

72
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,390
Wild cat!

73
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,030
Don't you dare touch me!

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,504
And that's how you thank

75
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,024
the man who risked his life to save

76
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,112
the two of you?

77
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,044
Cain! Is he alive?

78
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,300
Captain Rasputin! Come, quick!

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,325
They're calling me,

80
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,648
but first I want you to understand this:

81
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,176
on this ship, the only one who can
lift his hands against others is me.

82
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,330
Captain Rasputin!

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,690
That's Corto Maltese.

84
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,530
Last time his boat was bigger.

85
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,606
Obviously this could be a good
occasion to get rid of him,

86
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,899
but the Monk would not agree.

87
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,490
One day or another one I'll make you
shut that big mouth of yours, Cranio.

88
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,210
Forever.

89
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,010
And so, Corto,

90
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,770
are you sun tanning?

91
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,970
Among all the sharks in the
Pacific I had to meet you...

92
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,690
Given your situation,
you should be more polite.

93
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,370
What happened to you?

94
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,850
Help me get on board.
We'll speak later.

95
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,850
You aren't being very nice, you know...

96
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,170
I could also leave you there.

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,210
Of course you could,

98
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,370
but then you'd never hear my story...

99
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,290
Come on, pick him up!

100
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,850
So?

101
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,810
How did you lose your ship?

102
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,010
Give me a drink.

103
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,330
It's me who gives the orders here.

104
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,130
Help yourself.

105
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,810
So, Corto, will you tell me or not?

106
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,050
It's a love story Rasputin,

107
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,290
a story of love and honour.

108
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:49,773
A long time ago I made
a promise to a girl.

109
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:51,930
The promise was sincere,

110
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,370
but crazy.

111
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,790
The girl was beautiful.

112
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,219
It looks like

113
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,031
my boatswain

114
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,331
was her brother.

115
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,037
He set my men against me.

116
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,810
They took up arms...

117
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,130
And they didn't kill you?

118
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,410
Damn savages! They always
leave things half-done.

119
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,410
Maybe they want to try
their luck as pirates.

120
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,010
We cannot blame them.

121
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,250
After all they've learned it from us.

122
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,010
At least I know how to restrain my men.

123
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,530
Now what? Why are you
looking at me that way?

124
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,290
You have a tired face, mate.

125
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,530
Try and sleep with both eyes shut.

126
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,850
Maybe you'll get sweeter.

127
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,810
And who are you?

128
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,970
Pandora Groovesnore, sir.

129
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,130
Groovesnore?

130
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,970
From the family of the
famous ship-owners from Sydney?

131
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,810
Thaddeus Groovesnore is my father.

132
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,210
Who did that to you?

133
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,650
Your friend the captain.

134
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,319
Friend is a big word.

135
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,480
Let's say we have
some business in common,

136
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,869
at the moment.

137
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,250
Is that what we were waiting for?

138
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,490
Yes.

139
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,090
Where are the youths?

140
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,010
Downstairs, in the cabin.

141
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,450
How strange,

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,210
it looks like a Fijian catamaran

143
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,930
but the Fijians never get
so far towards the west.

144
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,291
Maybe the hurricane forced
them to change their route.

145
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:28,810
Maybe they need help.

146
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,301
Look commander,

147
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,484
they're hoisting a flag.

148
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,188
That's most unusual.

149
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,268
There's a white officer
with some black sailors.

150
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,850
Pandora

151
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,570
Finally!

152
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,490
I thought you'd never wake up again.

153
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,330
My head hurts.

154
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,650
Where are we?

155
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,010
It's alright.

156
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,450
We're on a catamaran,

157
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,690
but the crew behaves strangely.

158
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,570
I believe they're pirates.

159
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,610
Don't worry, I'll take care of them.

160
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,090
I don't like that boat,

161
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,490
I don't like it at all.

162
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,210
Sometimes you remind me
of my sister, Van Herdern.

163
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,890
She no longer felt safe in Rotterdam,

164
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,250
so she moved to a small
village near the German border,

165
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,850
but she miscalculated

166
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,970
because now, with the
rumours about the war,

167
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,130
she feels even less safe.

168
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,770
Lately I've heard

169
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,810
she doesn't even go out anymore.

170
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,010
Poor Marike.

171
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,050
Hello captain.

172
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,090
Captain,

173
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,930
in the name of His Imperial Majesty

174
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,290
I take possession of
this ship and its load.

175
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,290
You're transporting coal, aren't you?

176
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,132
I don't understand...

177
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:39,107
We aren't at war...

178
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,504
Because everything is
delayed in the South Pacific.

179
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:43,379
How humiliating, isn't it?

180
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,385
So, this time we have decided
to take the initiative.

181
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,595
Then...

182
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:50,490
you're pirates!

183
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,290
Of course.

184
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,930
What was that?

185
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,370
I don't know.

186
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,210
I'll go and see.

187
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,730
What happened?

188
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,930
Go back inside.

189
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,770
Assassin!

190
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,155
He died immediately,

191
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:20,308
there's nothing we can do for him.

192
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,370
Put those idiots in a lifeboat.

193
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,490
with some luck they'll
be able to find an island.

194
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,290
We better do what he's saying.

195
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,690
Why have you killed that man?

196
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,450
To each their own methods, Corto.

197
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,450
Now I have two boats,

198
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,170
while yours was stolen,

199
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,970
therefore don't preach to me.

200
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,010
You were supposed to take the
coal, not to kill him for fun.

201
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,650
Who told you it was fun?

202
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,090
We'll see how the Monk will react.

203
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, the Monk... No one
can ever read his mind.

204
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,170
Come on, move away,

205
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,210
or I'll make you regret it.

206
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,650
Let down the lifeboat.

207
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,290
At least give us some water!

208
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,095
You don't need it.

209
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,970
Rasputin, no!

210
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,410
I can't see anything.

211
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,010
Listen,

212
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,217
the important thing
is for us to be alive.

213
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,311
They know our parents are rich,

214
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,942
I'm sure they won't do us harm.

215
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,660
Perhaps someone on the boat could...

216
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,770
...someone could help us.

217
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,610
I'm scared, Cain.

218
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,890
You're completely crazy.

219
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,686
Why?

220
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,132
In these times

221
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:07,850
we can't afford to leave any witnesses.

222
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,610
Rasputin, you're a filthy coward.

223
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,290
Just move a finger and you're dead.

224
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,850
But...

225
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,930
you saved my life.

226
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,463
Moor the catamaran.
Let's leave, quickly!

227
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,050
Lock up this idiot till he calms down.

228
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,330
Captain Rasputin wants to see you.

229
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,130
It's cool upstairs,

230
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,810
and the sea looks beautiful.

231
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:00,957
Let's go.

232
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,120
Looks like you need me.

233
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,610
Me? Need you?

234
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,450
I have never said such a thing.

235
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,930
Very well, end of discussion.

236
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,490
Soon we'll reach the island of Kaiserine

237
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,690
and if the Germans see
the two Groovesnores

238
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,530
they'll take them
under their protection,

239
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,970
and you can forget your ransom.

240
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,410
You can't bet on that.

241
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,570
I can instead,

242
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,210
and since you don't trust Cranio...

243
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,570
Not even you, I trust you no more!

244
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,490
Of course you don't,

245
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,250
but there's no one left

246
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,912
unfortunately.

247
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,789
You can't always solve
everything with a gun.

248
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,730
Listen,

249
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,610
once in Kaiserine I'll sell
the coal to the Germans,

250
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,970
while you stay with the youths
on the catamaran, agreed?

251
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,930
And then we'll share
the ransom, me and you,

252
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,090
leaving out the Monk.

253
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,090
I think you're crazy, Rasputin.

254
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,410
Sooner or later the
Monk will get to know.

255
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,610
Cranio is on his side.

256
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,730
Nobody trusts him anymore,

257
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,570
not even the Monk.

258
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,510
We'll make it, Pandora.

259
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,650
Kaiserine

260
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,210
is where we're headed to.

261
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,690
New Guinea? But it's German territory!

262
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,930
Exactly. As soon as
we have met the Germans

263
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,170
they'll put us under their protection.

264
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,650
I don't think they'll let us show up.

265
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,810
Our parents are rich

266
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,810
and they surely want to
ask them for a ransom.

267
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,450
I think your cousin
is right, young fellow.

268
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,330
You were lucky so far, and if
you want to keep being lucky

269
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,290
you'd better not have
your brain work too much.

270
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,370
Especially you, Cain.

271
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,105
Stop calling me by name.

272
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,792
We have nothing in common.

273
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:54,881
Alright,

274
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,090
but if you want me to be
polite, you have to be as well

275
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,650
otherwise go to hell.

276
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,650
Kaiserine!

277
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:28,971
Captain Corto!

278
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,987
Captain Rasputin wants to speak to you.

279
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:34,862
Too many captains, aren't there?

280
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:37,505
Take the youths inside. I'm going.

281
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,410
Hey, wait!

282
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,610
Damn it, that cannot be!

283
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,650
But what are they doing?

284
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,730
We won't be able to meet the Germans.

285
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,010
Release the moorings!

286
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,490
See you by the mouth
of the river, as agreed.

287
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,450
Do you think they will
offer you champagne?

288
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,130
I don't really hope so.

289
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,890
I'm going there for our business's sake,

290
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,170
so don't play tricks, understand?

291
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,778
Wow, you're scaring me!

292
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,143
So?

293
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,507
What are you going to do with us?

294
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,219
We'll go fishing.

295
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,890
Are you cold, Slütter?

296
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,930
Here comes our coal,

297
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,490
it should warm you up.

298
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,810
Captain Rasputin has
organized things well,

299
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,210
it's good to deal with professionals.

300
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,770
Professionals?

301
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,970
Yes, Slütter

302
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,250
you're about to meet

303
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,850
a real modern pirate.

304
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,610
You seem shocked.

305
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,890
"Surprised" is more correct.

306
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,450
I didn't know the Kaiser's Navy

307
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,770
had similar allies.

308
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,010
You're no longer at
the Academy, Slütter.

309
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,650
In a while, nothing
will shock you anymore.

310
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,250
Welcome to Kaiserine.

311
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,925
Admiral Von Stecke is very
sorry for not to being here,

312
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,530
You'll have to deal with me.

313
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,450
You aren't too disappointed, I hope...

314
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,050
On the contrary, Galland.

315
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,117
To our deal.

316
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,690
Aren't you going to drink, Slütter?

317
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,050
This champagne is tepid.

318
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,330
Don't be too demanding, please.

319
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,370
In this dirty country everything that
isn't boiling hot must be welcome.

320
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,170
Don't you agree, Rasputin?

321
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,330
I like this country,

322
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,235
and the champagne, yet Mr. Slütter

323
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,741
doesn't look happy.

324
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,650
Slütter never looks happy,

325
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,730
but I assure you he's full of joy,

326
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,530
he only needs a little
lesson in Realpolitik.

327
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,410
This champagne is undrinkable indeed.

328
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,530
Let's talk about something more serious.

329
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,650
It's a real pleasure to
deal with you, Galland.

330
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,650
Calm down, stop it!

331
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,370
Stop what, huh?

332
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,930
Rasputin is sipping champagne

333
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,690
while we're rotting in here!

334
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,890
The world is going to shit,

335
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,706
that beast can't even use a fork.

336
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,250
I can see you're accustomed
to shellfish, captain.

337
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,970
Not particularly, but I like crabs.

338
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,090
How about you, lieutenant?

339
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,428
He lost his appetite
when he lost the case

340
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,656
which contained his books.

341
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,410
It disappeared between
Lubec and Surabaya.

342
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,751
A tragedy.

343
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:58,378
What kinds of books? By Goethe?

344
00:18:58,578 --> 00:18:59,770
By Goethe, Lenau,

345
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,970
and above all Rilke.

346
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,633
"Who, if I screamed, would hear me

347
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,375
among the ranks of angels?"

348
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,890
I feel like shouting too, sometimes.

349
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,930
It can't be farther
than sixty meters.

350
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,690
I could swim, speak to
a German soldier and...

351
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,850
They would shoot you.

352
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,850
If the Germans and these
pirates are partners,

353
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,050
I don't think they'll renounce
everything only to help us.

354
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,730
I don't recognize you, Pandora.

355
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,330
Maybe you're afraid?

356
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,020
Do as you wish.

357
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,984
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life in regret.

358
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,330
Cain!

359
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,810
When the war breaks out

360
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,010
all the German bases
will be neutralized.

361
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,250
We'll have to get by
with our two torpedo boats

362
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,490
and a submarine.

363
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,650
Obviously we can't make a legal war

364
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,490
therefore we'll lower the German flag.

365
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,330
We're talking piracy here!

366
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,490
Call it as you wish.

367
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,770
The Germans will show the British

368
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,330
that the sea doesn't
belong to them at all.

369
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,930
We need provisions for these boats,

370
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,130
and some fuel...

371
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,770
Captain Rasputin offered
us this Dutch collier.

372
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,690
When the war breaks out
he'll give us the fuel.

373
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,490
And what shall we give
back to captain Rasputin?

374
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,050
The best thing of all apart
from friendship, Slütter: gold.

375
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,250
Gold...
and your collaboration.

376
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,090
My collaboration?

377
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,210
Cain?

378
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,250
Good evening Pandora.

379
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,890
I thought you wouldn't
mind chatting a little.

380
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,810
Get out of here at once!

381
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,930
As you wish.

382
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,530
Corto Maltese?

383
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,290
Wait... You're right,
I feel like chatting.

384
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,370
I know you won't set us free,

385
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,970
but I also know I'll
never make it by myself.

386
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,210
Cain is too young. You instead...

387
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,210
you're a man, you aren't
afraid of Rasputin.

388
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,250
Me?

389
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,290
Of course I'm afraid of him,
I'm not that crazy after all...

390
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,890
What do you want?

391
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,130
I don't know, I thought
that maybe, you and I...

392
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,930
What are you saying?

393
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:29,450
- Enough! I'm going...
- No! I... Stay...

394
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,810
You know what, Pandora?

395
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,050
Let's go to Manila.

396
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,410
- We'll get married and forget the rest.
- No! What are you doing?

397
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,490
Let go of me! Let go of me!

398
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,010
You really thought you could
fool me with that farce?

399
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,170
Farce? I don't understand!

400
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,290
Don't worry, now you'll
understand. Bring him here!

401
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,290
Don't be afraid, he wasn't hurt.

402
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,370
Luckily I was on board
instead of Rasputin.

403
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,090
It takes some courage to do

404
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,770
what you did,

405
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,290
but I'm an old sea wolf,

406
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,330
and it takes more than
a spoilt brat to fool me.

407
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,810
One day I'll kill you, Corto Maltese!

408
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,090
What a night... Do you think
she'd really kill me, Cranio?

409
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,930
If we stayed by the mouth
of the river, she could.

410
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,890
If we stay here we'll get swept away!

411
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,370
Out! Come on!

412
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,050
Pandora!

413
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,490
Dam it!

414
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,490
Pandora!

415
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:13,097
I can't believe it! Pandora...

416
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,370
That cannot be...

417
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,410
Are you still there, Friday?

418
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,730
My name isn't Friday. And
you aren't Robinson Crusoe.

419
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,130
- You speak my language?
- Yes, and I also have a name.

420
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,730
My name is Tarao. I was
on the catamaran as well.

421
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,090
And you know the story
of Robinson Crusoe.

422
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,850
A teacher told me,

423
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,130
she gave some lessons in our village.

424
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,050
I had a look around while you
were sleeping. I saw nobody.

425
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,610
I'm not surprised. I also
believe that Pandora is dead,

426
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,130
- I'm quite sure that...
- ...Listen!

427
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,250
- Oh, No!
- Yes...

428
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,690
Don't do anything. Let me speak.

429
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,250
- Then?
- Everything's great.

430
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,890
The beach and the jungle
are full of cannibals.

431
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,170
If I could choose, I wouldn't
like to be anywhere else.

432
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,410
Why are you
looking at me like that?

433
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,450
I understand you, you know, but I hate

434
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,690
to be with someone who
said they want to kill me,

435
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,090
and if it weren't for the cannibals,

436
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,210
I'd leave you alone in your
boudoir, my little romantic bijou.

437
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,570
Stop it!

438
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,890
It's not fair for Cain
to die while you...

439
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,370
A group of Papuans.

440
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,370
Perhaps the same ones who caught Cain.

441
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,330
- Cain was caught? But then...
- Then what? Cain's alive,

442
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,130
but he's a prisoner of the Papuas'.

443
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,010
Damn liar, why did you lie to me?

444
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,650
Maybe not to cause
you a fit of hysteria!

445
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,970
Come on, give me the gun.

446
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,770
You're too young to play...

447
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,250
Cain!

448
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,143
I thought you had died in the shipwreck!

449
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,050
How did you make it?
Did you swim up to the shore?

450
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,591
No, Corto Maltese saved me,
otherwise I would have drowned.

451
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,530
And where is he now?

452
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,810
I think I've killed him.

453
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,450
Here they are. They must
have taken a decision.

454
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,530
The men of mysteries are
going out of the big house.

455
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,170
Wait a minute! But what...

456
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,802
Calm down Pandora.
Don't be afraid now.

457
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:42,050
You... you know my name?

458
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,690
I know many things.

459
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,970
Come and see.

460
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,850
I thought I'd killed him.

461
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,730
It would have been a big
loss. Why did you shoot him?

462
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,330
- But you are...
- Yes, that's me, Cranio.

463
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,912
- But then you're a cannibal too!
- No,

464
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:12,730
I have taken the place of one of
their wizards and healed Corto.

465
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,730
This situation can't last long.

466
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,770
I have set a pirogue,
and now I need your help.

467
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,690
You want us to help you? Cain and I?

468
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,450
Don't worry, Tarao will
take care of the pirogue.

469
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,890
I trust him more than you.
You're only two whites, after all.

470
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,450
It could be a trap.

471
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,090
Think about it, after
we've helped Cranio,

472
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,530
what can prevent him from
handing us over to the cannibals?

473
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,650
He counts on us, Cain, and on Tarao.

474
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,410
He trusts your skills as a sailor.

475
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,090
I hope he's right.

476
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,050
Fire! Fire!

477
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,410
It's time!

478
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,650
I can't believe it all went so well.

479
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,690
I have a bad sensation.

480
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,650
Shoot, come on! Shoot!

481
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,250
You too, Cain!
What are you waiting for?

482
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,570
Trigger happy Pandora!

483
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,850
What if I dug a nice
hole in your head now?

484
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,397
- Cain!
- Pandora has been very brave,

485
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:12,262
we're out of danger at
last. How do you feel Corto?

486
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,850
What are you singing, Tarao?

487
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,610
- The song of the sbimpe fish.
- Really?

488
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:44,450
And you think it'll show up all
of a sudden because you sing?

489
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,690
- I don't think anything.
- A submarine!

490
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,610
Corto! but where the hell
were you, you ugly bastard!

491
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,128
Why, maybe you know who you father is?

492
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,970
You wanted to see me, Mr. Slütter?

493
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,370
Yes, Mr. Maltese.

494
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,410
It's about some delicate matter.

495
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,170
It's about the girl,

496
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,370
I'd like you to tell Mr.
Rasputin to leave her alone.

497
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,530
Why don't you tell him yourself?

498
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,010
I'd rather avoid accidents,
but if you force me...

499
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,770
I won't force you to do anything.

500
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,930
You're doing everything yourself.

501
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,210
I'd like to have some
explanation, though.

502
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,930
How come those youths are on board?

503
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,530
Their ship wrecked
and we picked them up.

504
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,290
Simple as that.

505
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,570
It seems to me a bit too simple...

506
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,690
I like Slütter.

507
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,770
As long as we're with him, we're safe.

508
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,930
I doubt it, he's
always a soldier at war.

509
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,530
Only because his eyes are blue...

510
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,530
I apologize, I hope not
to disturb you, but...

511
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,210
I'd like to have something explained.

512
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,650
I was wondering how come you didn't
get off the boat in Kaiserine.

513
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,930
Perhaps you were kept prisoners?

514
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,450
Leave my cousin alone.

515
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,730
I'll tell you how come.

516
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,650
So when we reached Kaiserine

517
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,090
Corto Maltese took us away
not to let the Germans see us.

518
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,410
Rasputin and Maltese made an agreement.

519
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,010
They want to ask for a ransom.

520
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,770
- What do you want to do with that gun?
- Are you spying on me?

521
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,690
Who me? No... you know
I love you. Are you angry?

522
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:49,010
- Go away, Corto, otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

523
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,530
- I'll kill you!
- Will you?

524
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,490
Try to.

525
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,170
But, what the hell do you want?

526
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,530
Haven't you heard? The boy
said everything to Slütter!

527
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,810
And who cares? What
difference does it make?

528
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,850
Do you think that Prussian
will disobey the orders

529
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,650
to help two spoilt brats?

530
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,290
I cannot see what you
see, but you may be right.

531
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,410
You're so stupid that it's not
difficult for you to be right.

532
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,589
You find me stupid?

533
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,096
We'll discuss it later. Let's
go get us something to drink.

534
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:29,290
Honestly I don't understand you.

535
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,090
I got us out of trouble

536
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,970
and you're pulling a long face, cousin?

537
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,330
Do you really think that men like
Slütter and Rasputin and Corto Maltese

538
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,290
will let a 16 year-old
boy manipulate them?

539
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,370
Why not?

540
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,890
Now that they're
all against one another

541
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,770
there's no longer need for that.

542
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,450
And then you should
have taken care of it

543
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,650
- as you're 17 instead...
- Great! You're so cunning...

544
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,890
At least I did something.

545
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,250
Yes you have, but you don't
care for the consequences.

546
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,930
"Alone, alone, all, all alone...

547
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,650
"Alone, alone, alone,
on a wide wide sea!

548
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,890
"And never a saint took
pity on my soul in agony.

549
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,570
"The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie;

550
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,170
"And a thousand thousand slimy
things lived on; and so did I".

551
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,170
How come you're here, my romantic bijou?

552
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,730
- I was looking for you.
- Don't look for me,

553
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,250
I don't want to fight.

554
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,690
I'm sorry to have been so
impulsive the other time.

555
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,850
The other time? Why,
will there be others?

556
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,810
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Then what did you mean?

557
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,610
Nothing. You'll never
take me seriously anyways.

558
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,570
Take charge of the submarine
and take me to my father!

559
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,050
I thought millionaires were
crazy, but now I know for sure.

560
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,570
Maybe it's something
they put in your dollars.

561
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,610
Listen to me well.

562
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,010
The best thing that you
and your cousin can do

563
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,410
- is to stay close to me.
- Really? And why?

564
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,730
Because I bring luck.

565
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,250
I'm really curious to know
what the Monk will decide.

566
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,730
If you're referring to the youths,

567
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,330
the Monk won't decide anything at all.

568
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,730
I'm responsible for them, just me.

569
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,170
It doesn't have to be an
unpleasant responsibility...

570
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,810
Watch out, Rasputin. Don't
forget whom you're speaking to.

571
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,130
Don't make me laugh, lieutenant...

572
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,010
I know what you have in mind very well.

573
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,450
You won't forget her that way!

574
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,650
What's happening up there?

575
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,290
Nothing. Slütter is
fighting with Rasputin,

576
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,850
and I think I know why.

577
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,570
You'll pay for that, I swear! You better
never turn your back on me anymore!

578
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,130
Exactly, and in the
meantime you watch out, too

579
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,770
otherwise you'll get hurt.

580
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,497
You'll pay for that too, Corto!

581
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:58,400
All of you!

582
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,090
- Do you recognise that flag, Mr. Maltese?
- Of course.

583
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,650
It's flag of the Monk,
the king of the sea.

584
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,250
It may seem foolish,

585
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,490
but I like to give
a proper name to things.

586
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,610
What's the name of that island
which isn't reported by any map?

587
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,770
Escondida, the hidden island.

588
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,810
The fleets of three nations
looked for it for a long time

589
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,450
but they couldn't find it.

590
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,770
- I hope you appreciate your fortune.
- Look, lieutenant!

591
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,970
I suppose they're still
friends of yours...

592
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,450
Very dear friends.

593
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,690
They have just prevented us
from bumping against the reef.

594
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,102
Welcome to the Escondida,
guys. My name's Sbrindolin.

595
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:29,747
The Monk will be back soon.

596
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,768
In the meantime,
if you need anything

597
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,361
let me know.

598
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,690
Are you still angry?

599
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,890
No, I never got angry.

600
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,890
- That's good.
- It wasn't worth it.

601
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,410
Have you seen how
polite everyone is here?

602
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,810
I'd like to know what
the Monk looks like.

603
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,930
What should he look like?

604
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,450
He certainly is a
pirate like the others.

605
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,890
A pirate like the others?
You can't generalize...

606
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,410
Corto Maltese for example
has always helped us.

607
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,290
There has to be something good in him.

608
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,290
I think we could even make friends
with him. Don't you agree, Cain?

609
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,530
Cain?

610
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,770
Are you talking to yourself?

611
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,530
I have just met him in the
courtyard, he seemed furious.

612
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,202
I can drive you around
the island if you want,

613
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:30,782
so you'll pass the time
waiting for the Monk to be back.

614
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,126
Pretty girl...

615
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,010
Who's this Monk?

616
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,890
Cain says that according to
the native he's 200 years old.

617
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,690
Who knows... 200 years?
Sometimes I believe it too.

618
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,810
But it's not true. Perhaps
he'll tell you his story.

619
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,810
You're not as bad as you try to look.

620
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,010
Have you come to keep me company?

621
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,970
In any case, you haven't found anything!

622
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,090
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

623
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,890
Why have you destroyed my hut?

624
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,970
Don't pretend not to understand,
you perfectly know why.

625
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,650
I don't know what you're talking about!

626
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,530
Damn you! You thought you could kill
me, but sooner or later I'll kill you!

627
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,050
I still haven't killed anyone today.

628
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,530
But I could start from you.

629
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,970
You're such a liar!

630
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,170
When I got in you were
cleaning the rifle!

631
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,930
Whatever… The day I'll kill you

632
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,570
I won't need a rifle.

633
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,330
My hands will do!

634
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,290
Corto Maltese, but...

635
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,290
What's wrong? Maybe
you've you seen a ghost?

636
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,227
I don't know what you mean...

637
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,352
Sbrindolin!

638
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:11,500
- Why are you dressed like a nun?
- It's for Miss Pandora,

639
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,458
so she'll think this place is refined.

640
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,862
Get out of here, idiot.

641
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,450
I know you.

642
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,250
You're annoyed because
you didn't think of it yourself.

643
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,490
Is that you, Sbrindolin?

644
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,850
No, it's me. How are you,
romantic bijou?

645
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,410
Corto! I was told...

646
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,570
You saved my life.

647
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:43,090
Now I'd like...

648
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,410
I would like...

649
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,530
What?

650
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,523
Promise me
you'll never hurt Cain.

651
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,259
Promise me.

652
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,477
Good morning everyone.

653
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:49,476
I've got some interesting
news for you.

654
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:54,810
On 4th August 1914, England
has declared war to Germany

655
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,970
and therefore we're at war as well.

656
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,930
I have already set two
islands for the Germans to refuel.

657
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,130
Monk,

658
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,810
I've taken the coal to Kaiserine;

659
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,050
I've also picked up two youths
who are worth a fortune,

660
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,930
but Corto Maltese and lieutenant
Slütter interfere with my plans.

661
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,410
The youths
must not be involved.

662
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,210
I suggest that we take them
to some island of the Fijis'.

663
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,810
They mustn't be involved.

664
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,370
No one can tell me what to do.

665
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,970
No one.

666
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,570
I thought you were less
impulsive Mr. Slütter.

667
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:38,057
Your commander ordered you
to be at my disposal.

668
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:41,751
Never forget it!
And you Corto Maltese,

669
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,970
have lost a schooner
and the power on your men?

670
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,610
Because of a woman.

671
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,970
However, power

672
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,568
is something you've got,
till you have to use it.

673
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:02,326
Your answer is subtle.

674
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:06,744
Unfortunately it also shows
you're unable to command.

675
00:47:06,944 --> 00:47:11,199
You're an individualist, Maltese.

676
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:13,778
You're a subversive.

677
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:16,117
That's not bad,

678
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:19,511
but isn't good either.

679
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:22,430
Corto, you'll stay
on the island with Cranio.

680
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:27,207
Slütter, get ready to set sail.
We'll leave in two days.

681
00:47:28,586 --> 00:47:29,933
That's all.

682
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,530
The Monk said
nothing about the youths.

683
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,090
Don't be worried about them.

684
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,050
they're worth a lot of money,
they aren't at risk.

685
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,610
How about Rasputin?

686
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,570
Rasputin doesn't matter.
And then I'll stay there.

687
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,450
I wanted to tell you...

688
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,210
that despite what the Monk said,

689
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,170
I believe you're a good commander.

690
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,330
A good commander...

691
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,130
Who gives a damn...

692
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,608
Come out!

693
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,410
Oh, it's you. What do you want?

694
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,050
- You want to kill me as well?
- Can I have a drink?

695
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,490
Help yourself, as you're there.

696
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,050
Since you whites have been here,
everything has gone wrong.

697
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,690
Every people is specialized
in something. That's what we do best.

698
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,490
So far, we've tried
to make the best of things,

699
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:00,370
but I don't like the idea to see
my people involved in your wars.

700
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,370
Nobody likes the war.

701
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,690
That's why there are so many.

702
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,453
However I reckon
there's some advantage in it.

703
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:12,243
The Melanesians are standing
united for the very first time.

704
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,410
The people from the Fijis, the Samoa
and Tonga islands are discussing it.

705
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,490
It is as if we should mend a big coat.

706
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,823
I hope you have
a big sewing machine,

707
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:26,123
because if you have
to do it by hand...

708
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,953
You look tired,
I better leave you.

709
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,610
Thanks for the drink.

710
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,552
We have to find a way to escape.

711
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,770
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

712
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,210
- We'll leave together.
- When?

713
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,170
When the moment is right.

714
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,730
You're too impatient.

715
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:18,730
You'll never change.

716
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,140
When you want something,
you don't mind what others think.

717
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,780
I've asked you to help me,
not to preach on me.

718
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,287
You're the one who shot, aren't you?

719
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:34,202
I didn't know
Pandora was in the car!

720
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:36,856
You wanted
the guilt to fall on me!

721
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:38,740
Dam you!

722
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,660
That's enough, Rasputin!

723
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,906
If he really did what you say,

724
00:50:56,106 --> 00:50:59,060
the boy's not an idiot.

725
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,093
Will you tell me your name?

726
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:04,580
Cain Groovesnore, sir,
of the Groovesnores from Sydney.

727
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,292
Rasputin, from now on
you'll be personally responsible

728
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:12,580
- for Mr. Groovesnore's life.
- Me? But... But actually...

729
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,540
If he dies, you'll die.

730
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,300
Well...

731
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,900
Alright Monk.
Don't get angry. I...

732
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,660
Enough now, leave me alone.

733
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,420
So you're Elijah Groovesnore's son...

734
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,100
Yes sir, and Pandora is the
daughter of my uncle Thaddeus.

735
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,540
Tell me,

736
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,340
you have another
uncle, Renaldo. Do you?

737
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,220
Yes sir, he's a commander
in the Australian Navy.

738
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,060
And is there also a certain Thomas
among the Groovesnores?

739
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,820
He died in a fire on the day
when Thaddeus married aunt Margretha.

740
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,900
But how come you know our family?

741
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,100
Uncle Thomas...

742
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,260
But we never speak of him at home.

743
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,100
- Did you know him?
- And Margretha?

744
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,900
- How about your aunt Margretha?
- She died when Pandora was born.

745
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,140
Uncle Thaddeus raised her.

746
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,420
He adores her.

747
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,340
Listen,

748
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,380
if you have a heart, you should
let our family know we're alive.

749
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,721
A heart is a muscle which pumps
blood, Cain, not sentimentalism.

750
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:37,820
But...

751
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,580
After all those questions I thought...

752
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,140
Don't think.

753
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,620
And above all, never
do it when I'm there.

754
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,260
I reserve that privilege to myself.

755
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,576
- What happened?
- I don't know.

756
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,060
He got in, stared
at the girl and went crazy.

757
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,580
Take care of her, I'll go and check.

758
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,525
I don't understand, he's
decided to leave immediately.

759
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:37,020
He wants to leave me here
and go with you? It's not fair!

760
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,700
I've never seen him like that,
we better not leave him alone.

761
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,180
You're right Cranio. I'll go.

762
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,391
You're strange, Monk.
What's happening to you, tell me...

763
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:54,728
I've seen the Devil, Corto.
I've seen the Devil.

764
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:56,813
And I was afraid.

765
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:01,701
Don't leave me alone, my friends.
Don't leave me alone.

766
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:03,900
No one will leave you, Monk.
You're talking nonsense.

767
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,300
- Do you really want to leave Rasputin here?
- Why not?

768
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,660
Cranio will stay, too.

769
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,940
- He will guard them.
- Cranio?

770
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,300
Sooner or later
he'll need to sleep,

771
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,580
and Rasputin will get rid of him.

772
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,580
He'll steal the money
we've made,

773
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,540
he'll inform the British Admiralty,

774
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,620
he'll bargain over
the ransom for the two youths

775
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,595
- and he'll disappear.
- What if you stay instead?

776
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,060
Do you think I'm stupid, Corto Maltese?

777
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,893
But what do you want?
I don't understand you anymore!

778
00:54:33,093 --> 00:54:34,438
I want you to come with me.

779
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,048
I don't want you to stay here
and flirt with Pandora

780
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,865
- while I'm away.
- Oh, that's it then!

781
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:42,826
Don't laugh!

782
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,144
I forbid you to laugh!

783
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:51,069
- You don't know anything! I forbid you!
- Let go of me!

784
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,820
Cranio, you'll take my place here.

785
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,580
I want you to watch over Rasputin,
and the youths to be treated well.

786
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,500
Let's go lieutenant Slütter. It's time.

787
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,100
Do you think it's normal
for us to be equipped like this

788
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,420
just to go and pick up
crabs on a desert island?

789
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,260
- There's no difference...
- Silence, you two!

790
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,300
Why don't they pick up
their own crabs?

791
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,020
And I don't even like them...

792
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,660
Don't you? I do, instead.

793
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,540
Hey, look down there!

794
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,580
Sergeant, sergeant! We've
found a message! It's important!

795
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,220
"We've just been stopped

796
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,700
"by a German submarine
and by an armed freighter.

797
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,580
"They're forcing us to follow them".

798
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,380
The signature is:

799
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,220
"Captain Perez,
embarked on the Bonito.

800
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,100
"November 1914."

801
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,780
The Bonito?

802
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,020
Hadn't it sunk three months earlier?

803
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,700
Goddam Krauts!

804
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,700
But where the hell do
they get the coal?

805
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,620
All the German islands are taken.

806
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,540
My dear, I'll gladly leave that
to the Admiralty.

807
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,500
Submarines in the Pacific...
we'll make them dance.

808
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,260
Good morning Cranio.

809
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,900
- It's a beautiful day.
- Indeed. Good morning Pandora.

810
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:51,763
Where is Corto Maltese?

811
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,905
It's all right, Pandora.
Corto is wounded

812
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:01,547
and not far from here, hidden,

813
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:03,802
but Rasputin doesn't have to know.

814
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:06,620
What about lieutenant Slütter?

815
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,660
I've heard indirect news.

816
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,500
Many British ships sank
in the roadstead of Papeete

817
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,420
and he and the Monk keep bothering
the cargo boats of the Allies.

818
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,180
But who is this Monk?

819
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,980
The Monk?

820
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,260
The Monk is a defrocked priest.

821
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,367
Well... Actually
he's a Protestant ex-shepherd

822
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,704
who has taken the place
of an excommunicated monk.

823
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:32,401
Well, something like that.

824
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:35,777
In any case, we better
not have priests on the island.

825
00:57:35,977 --> 00:57:39,321
We have our wizards
and they're enough for us.

826
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:41,530
The Monk is okay,

827
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,867
as well as Rasputin is
a brute and an assassin.

828
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:47,900
But he's also useful.

829
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,980
As regards Corto Maltese...

830
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,660
He's a free man,
he knows many things,

831
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,780
but he never takes
any responsibilities.

832
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,100
Ship!

833
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,740
Sailing ship! War ship!

834
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,780
Halt!

835
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,580
He wanted to warn the Japanese!

836
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,500
He did, but now
he's changed his mind.

837
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,220
Haven't you, Cain?

838
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:23,020
I haven't! I'm going to... Aah!

839
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,980
Hello?

840
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,340
This island is taboo.

841
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,020
we're initiating the young lads
into magic. What do you want?

842
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,740
We're sorry Chief.
We couldn't know.

843
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,180
We only want some fruit
and some crabs.

844
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,620
Take all the fruit and
crabs that you want,

845
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,140
then return to your ship.

846
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,380
Help! Help!

847
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,700
Who shouted?
What's happening down there?

848
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,580
I'm very sorry, lieutenant.

849
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,220
If the girl hadn't shouted you
could have left for good, but now...

850
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,340
Don't be fool.
You cannot face a war ship.

851
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,820
You'd better...

852
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,860
But what the...

853
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,373
Bravo, Cranio!
Well done, my friend.

854
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:44,340
Have you seen?

855
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,940
There's nothing left of it.

856
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,740
The ball must have
centred their ammunition store.

857
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,660
- Yes, what a pity.
- A pity? You must be joking.

858
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,020
The Germans will pay us for that.

859
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,660
Now we only have to punish
that little traitoress as she deserves.

860
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,540
You won't punish anybody, Rasputin.

861
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,580
You heard what the Monk said.

862
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,260
Listen Cranio, the Monk
isn't eternal, understand?

863
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,660
Do you know what
I hate about you?

864
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,380
Almost everything.

865
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,700
Idiot!

866
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,540
Stupid cannibal.

867
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,380
Where have you come from?

868
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,340
When have you...

869
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,740
Corto Maltese!

870
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,660
Cain? Pandora?

871
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,100
It's time!

872
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,750
All's ready,
the beach is deserted.

873
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,869
It's the right time.

874
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,700
The pirogue isn't very
big but we can make it.

875
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,260
I have taken some food,
it will last for two or three days.

876
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,940
Wait a moment...
Where's Corto Maltese?

877
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,660
He isn't dead. Cranio hid
him on the island, but he cannot...

878
01:01:52,816 --> 01:01:56,736
If Corto's wounded we can't
leave him here with Rasputin the Mad.

879
01:01:56,936 --> 01:01:59,923
- You two leave, I'll stay.
- Then, I'll stay as well.

880
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,420
No.

881
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,380
You have to go to inform the Admiralty.

882
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,780
They have to send someone here.
It's better this way, Pandora.

883
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,820
- What are you doing here? What's happened?
- Cranio is dead.

884
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,500
- Rasputin?
- Yes.

885
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,620
He's gone completely crazy.

886
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,900
Pandora has run away with Tarao.

887
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,420
Cranio said that you were wounded,

888
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,340
so I've stayed. For you.

889
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,700
For me?

890
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,940
Then I have to think I have a friend?

891
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,700
But it's good for you to have stayed,

892
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:08,900
because we're going to have much fun.

893
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,282
They came on three big boats.

894
01:03:13,482 --> 01:03:16,287
The man who led the fleet
had tattoos all over his body.

895
01:03:16,487 --> 01:03:19,414
He observed the flight
of the birds to get his bearings,

896
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:21,654
the direction of the waves and the tides,

897
01:03:22,026 --> 01:03:24,066
and at night he watched the stars.

898
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,820
He was looking for an island.

899
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,100
And when the water and the air refreshed,

900
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,500
Tamatea saw a long
bright cloud on the horizon.

901
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,980
Natoirangi, the wizard,
encouraged the rowers,

902
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,740
and they doubled their effort.
...Why are you laughing?

903
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,020
I'm not laughing at all,
your story is fascinating.

904
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,660
Go ahead, Tarao.

905
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:44,649
At sunset the cloud
took shape and consistence.

906
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:48,260
It was Ao-Tea-Roa,
that you call New Zealand.

907
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,173
In those times, its beaches
were infested by giant birds.

908
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,028
Tamatea and his men fought them,

909
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:56,183
and so they earned
the right to live there.

910
01:03:56,782 --> 01:04:00,341
Now you know why the Maori
are scattered along all the islands,

911
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,255
and don't fear the sea.

912
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,576
Then, I don't have to fear it either.

913
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,820
- How beautiful!
- Yes.

914
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:18,365
But when they fly like that,

915
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:20,840
it means it won't
be windy for a long time.

916
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,660
- A shark!
- It's Mao!

917
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,260
He's followed us for a while.

918
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,340
Don't be afraid, Pandora.

919
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,060
Mao is our friend.
He only wants some company.

920
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:35,697
Now you better sleep.

921
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:37,620
Alright. But will you?

922
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,540
I'm not tired.

923
01:04:42,982 --> 01:04:45,757
Hey, shark!

924
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:48,085
Lead me to Ao-Tea-Roa!

925
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:51,530
Lead me, as you led
Tamatea and Arawa,

926
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,065
our ancestors!

927
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,134
The crew is ready
for the inspection, lieutenant.

928
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:12,017
Spats aren't a problem anymore.

929
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:14,270
Don't you think, Mateau?

930
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,020
Well...

931
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,060
The Monk wants to see you.

932
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,900
Alright, I'll go straight to him.

933
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,020
I've tried to call the Escondida
for three days,

934
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,940
but Cranio doesn't respond.

935
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,740
I'm afraid that
something happened.

936
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,406
- What do you think?
- Me?

937
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:42,100
I think they don't want
to speak to us.

938
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,620
That's impossible. I'm
the Monk, the king of the Escondida.

939
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,220
You've asked me what
I thought, and I've replied.

940
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,180
What are you going to do?

941
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,220
Let’s go to the Escondida.

942
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,820
We'll miss a good prey.

943
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,180
It's a pity. A steamboat full
of women and children.

944
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,660
It would have been
one of our noblest actions.

945
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,700
You're too sarcastic, lieutenant.

946
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,460
We're at war, and the war kills anyone.

947
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,300
You cannot choose your victims...

948
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,740
...only to satisfy
your chivalrous mind.

949
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,366
Shark, I'm looking for an island.

950
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,700
It shouldn't be
too far from here,

951
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,060
it's called...

952
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,900
Bura-nea!

953
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,500
We have arrived, Pandora! Look!

954
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,660
Bye-bye Mao!

955
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,180
Joa-rana!

956
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,340
I couldn't help it!

957
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,060
Cranio wanted to surrender
to the Japanese! Believe me!

958
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,820
I was forced to kill him!
It's the truth!

959
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,980
And the youths? The Groovesnores?

960
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,380
They've disappeared.

961
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,140
We've looked for them everywhere
but they've disappeared.

962
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,740
And you tell me this way?

963
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,340
We need to talk.

964
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,780
- A shark?
- Exactly. It's a friend of his.

965
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,620
I know, uncle Renaldo,
it's hard to believe

966
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,460
but I can assure you it's the truth.

967
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,100
I have seen it with my eyes.

968
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,700
A shark...

969
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,820
If I report that to the Admiralty

970
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,460
everyone will laugh at me.

971
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,380
What matters is to find
the Escondida, right?

972
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:58,220
Tarao can find the right
direction watching the stars,

973
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,860
and soon it will be night.

974
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,900
Monk!

975
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,420
The British will land here soon.

976
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,940
Come on, you know them...

977
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,740
It will take them
months to find the Escondida.

978
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,740
With such a navigator as Tarao?

979
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,620
They'll find us in a flash.

980
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,780
Then what do you suggest?

981
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,140
Let's abandon the Escondida.

982
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:28,260
Damn it! This island is mine.

983
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,380
And then the Monk can die,
but he won't run away.

984
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,900
Well, die then.

985
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,820
I can't, I've done it once already.

986
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,340
There has to be a solution.

987
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,180
Maybe you can half
die and half surrender.

988
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,620
Corto, do you know what I like in you?

989
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,620
You always see
the funny side of things.

990
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,380
I'm glad you're safe and sound.

991
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,060
Corto?

992
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,020
Oh, that's you. Good evening.

993
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,820
Good evening Slütter.

994
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,220
The German fleet in the
South Pacific have surrendered.

995
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,980
I have done

996
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,020
shameful things for nothing.

997
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,340
Here Germany
has already lost the war.

998
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,700
So the Groovesnores have escaped?

999
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:53,180
Yes. Pandora has run away
and Cain is in a safe place.

1000
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,900
Very well. Let him stay there.

1001
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,980
It's better for
the Monk not to find him.

1002
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,420
- Why?
- People speak more easily

1003
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,180
when they're locked in a
submarine. Also the Monk.

1004
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,260
He told me many
things about Cain,

1005
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,700
Pandora and all that family
of nutty billionaires.

1006
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,740
- Did I scare you Cain?
- A little.

1007
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,740
I didn't hear you come.

1008
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,380
The British will land soon.

1009
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,460
We'll be forced to abandon the island.

1010
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,999
You'll have to come away with me.

1011
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:32,695
I'll be your hostage, won't I?

1012
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:33,736
Not at all.

1013
01:10:33,936 --> 01:10:36,124
I'll take you away with me
because I love you.

1014
01:10:36,324 --> 01:10:37,733
You mean a lot to me, Cain.

1015
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:41,060
Also Pandora, but
unfortunately she isn't here.

1016
01:10:41,214 --> 01:10:42,624
Pandora?

1017
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:45,811
What happened when
you went to her room?

1018
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,572
I saw someone

1019
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:50,340
- I thought I'd never see again.
- Who?

1020
01:10:50,684 --> 01:10:52,683
Pandora's mother.

1021
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,326
- Margretha.
- Aunt Margretha?

1022
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,109
Yes, my boy.

1023
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,062
I have loved her.

1024
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,765
Very much.

1025
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,660
But who are you?

1026
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,540
I'm the Monk, who do you think I am?

1027
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,780
You seem disappointed, Corto.

1028
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,260
I've often wondered who was
concealed by the habit of the Monk,

1029
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,820
and now that I know I'm afraid

1030
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,300
it won't make
my life more interesting.

1031
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,780
It's certainly snowing in my hometown,

1032
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,100
Lubecca,

1033
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,620
and here it's boiling hot.

1034
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,180
Look at those girls
dressed in leaves.

1035
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,842
It would be a pity
to wait till autumn

1036
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:40,937
to keep them company, don't you think?

1037
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,300
You aren't too bad for being a pirate.

1038
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,780
I do what I can, Mr. Slütter.

1039
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,980
However, you aren't too bad too,

1040
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,540
for being an officer.

1041
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,940
Now that you've finally had
your kingdom back,

1042
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:20,900
perhaps you should think
of filling its safes.

1043
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,940
- What happened?
- The Monk escaped.

1044
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,860
He wanted to take me away.

1045
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,580
Slütter didn't let him.

1046
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,420
The Monk shot him...

1047
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,980
then he left.

1048
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,820
I think he wants to take
possession of the submarine.

1049
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,020
Save... my men...

1050
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,020
The British don't have
to find him. Help me.

1051
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,963
He... has killed them all.

1052
01:13:43,148 --> 01:13:45,220
No, not all. At least not yet.

1053
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,524
Resist, I'll try to save you.

1054
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,580
I'm going to hurt you.
Stay calm,

1055
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,300
or you'll never be credited
in the saga of the Nibelungs.

1056
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,154
Try to bandage him.

1057
01:14:12,354 --> 01:14:13,813
We'll take the Monk's yacht.

1058
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:16,753
- I'll go set it and be right back.
- But...

1059
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,787
Do as I said.
I'll get back for you two.

1060
01:14:42,496 --> 01:14:43,728
Halt!

1061
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,900
Tarao! You made your way...

1062
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,140
from cannibal to soldier
in the New Zealand army.

1063
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,740
I've never been a cannibal,

1064
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,380
but my grandfather was.

1065
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,780
therefore don't force
me to imitate him.

1066
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,260
I know. It was so to laugh.

1067
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,980
You'll be pleased to hear
that Pandora is safe and sound.

1068
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,820
Of course I am.

1069
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,180
Cain is safe and sound as well,

1070
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,300
therefore you can be happy too.

1071
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,340
Now go ahead, and no jokes!

1072
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,380
You're so full of piss...

1073
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,940
Rasputin! What are you doing
in that beautiful suit?

1074
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,740
Sbrindolin has betrayed us.

1075
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,940
He had the New Zealanders
land and recognize him as a king.

1076
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:48,233
King of the Escondida?

1077
01:15:48,433 --> 01:15:50,100
It's ridiculous. Follow me.

1078
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,340
Corto Maltese, born in La Valletta.

1079
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,420
- Are you a British citizen?
- Exactly.

1080
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:03,780
Strange. How come you know
this gang of pirates?

1081
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,540
Which gang of pirates?

1082
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,260
For me they were all friends.

1083
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,820
You've got a strange
idea of friendship.

1084
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,860
Perhaps,

1085
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,380
but that makes life
more interesting.

1086
01:16:19,837 --> 01:16:22,448
Come on, move, you bunch of idlers!

1087
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,740
Tarao?

1088
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:28,140
I'm happy to see
you again. Is Pandora...

1089
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,380
She's well.

1090
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,420
She's still on board of the torpedo-boat.

1091
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,260
She should land soon.

1092
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,060
Perfect. And Corto Maltese?

1093
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,940
We know you've hidden

1094
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,340
the commander of the German submarine.

1095
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,020
For some obscure reason the Admiralty

1096
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,020
- wants this gentleman to be...
- He's a lieutenant.

1097
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,620
Lieutenant Slütter.

1098
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,460
...they want Mr. Slütter

1099
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,060
to be tried summarily in a military court.

1100
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,540
- Take us to him and we...
- You what?

1101
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,780
We'll give you a thousand
pounds and a safe-conduct.

1102
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,740
Wow, inflation is galloping!

1103
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,780
Thirty pieces of gold used to be enough...

1104
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,020
Take him away!

1105
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,380
The Victoria's on fire!

1106
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,420
Help!

1107
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,900
Cheer up, we're coming!

1108
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,980
There's another one there!

1109
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,420
Be careful.

1110
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,860
He could be a German.

1111
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,830
Christian Slütter,

1112
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:03,070
you have been recognized
guilty of the following crimes:

1113
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,310
piracy, high treason, homicide,

1114
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:07,470
sabotage and espionage.

1115
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:11,590
Accordingly, this court condemns
you to the death penalty.

1116
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:13,630
You'll be shot tomorrow,

1117
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,510
19th January 1915.

1118
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,550
Have you got something to say?

1119
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,030
You can all go to hell!

1120
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,710
That's nonsense!

1121
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,750
Slütter isn't a pirate,
even less a traitor.

1122
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,790
Don't be childish, Pandora.

1123
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,710
Slütter has sunk the
Victoria with 15 men on board,

1124
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,630
as well as many other merchant ships.

1125
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,190
Perhaps it doesn't matter to you,

1126
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:41,070
but it does to the public opinion.

1127
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:44,150
That's why the Admiralty
wants the head of your friend.

1128
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:45,830
What would you do,

1129
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,110
uncle Renaldo,

1130
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:50,590
if you senior officers ordered you
to act against your principles?

1131
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:53,350
Unfortunately, I don't have
any more principles.

1132
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,190
I prefer the law and the facts.

1133
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,590
Answer my question.

1134
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,990
What do you want me to say?

1135
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,870
It's Slütter who was condemned, not me.

1136
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,110
The only thing I can do now

1137
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,190
is to grant you
the permission to see him.

1138
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,870
Thanks, I don't want your pity.

1139
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,630
I know you aren't a pirate

1140
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,950
- or a traitor.
- Yes.

1141
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,190
But unfortunately it won't be enough.

1142
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,190
I understand their point of view.

1143
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:30,790
after all I could have gone
against the orders,

1144
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,510
but there were the hierarchies,

1145
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,284
the traditions...
all that bullshit.

1146
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,790
Prisoner Slütter, it's time.

1147
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,510
If you to confess, the chaplain...

1148
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:51,070
Confess what? That I've obeyed
my commander's orders?

1149
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,390
Let's put an end
to this hypocrisy.

1150
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,910
I'm ready.

1151
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,550
Miss Groovesnore, you better leave now.

1152
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,670
This isn't the right place for you.

1153
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,390
I'll stay here.

1154
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,937
I have to inform you that
Commander Groovesnore

1155
01:20:18,137 --> 01:20:21,144
had the accusations of high treason
and homicide withdrawn.

1156
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:23,430
Thank him on my behalf.

1157
01:20:23,638 --> 01:20:25,634
I wish I could do it in person.

1158
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:29,710
May I say a few
words to my men, captain?

1159
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,190
Ready!

1160
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:48,910
Fire!

1161
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:06,870
- It's over, Groovesnore.
- I know, I'm not deaf.

1162
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,470
Good, because we need to speak, Renaldo.

1163
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,230
Now that the guy
is dead I can tell you:

1164
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:13,590
you've made a big mistake

1165
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,550
having the accusations of high treason
and homicide withdrawn.

1166
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,830
The public opinion need culprits,

1167
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,550
and if Slütter is innocent
they'll demand other heads.

1168
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,310
Yours, for example.

1169
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,590
What should I do then?

1170
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:28,990
Now Slütter's problems are over.

1171
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,950
Let all the accusations be.

1172
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,870
It's good to be
generous and chivalrous,

1173
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:34,990
but first of all think of the survivors,

1174
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,910
and their career.

1175
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:40,430
In a year you'll be rear-admiral.
Don't ruin everything.

1176
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,710
So you haven't left?

1177
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,190
No.

1178
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:56,030
But I will as soon
as you have set Rasputin free.

1179
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:59,150
I don't like this island anymore:
there are too many soldiers.

1180
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:02,750
Have no illusions,
Rasputin will be condemned,

1181
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,590
- to death.
- You got Slütter,

1182
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:08,870
- I think that's enough.
- Get out of here!

1183
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:14,990
It's easy for you to condemn
those you don't know,

1184
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,710
but you're very comprehensive
with your loved ones.

1185
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,990
What do you mean? Tell me.

1186
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:25,390
I'll tell you all. I'm sure
you'll find it interesting.

1187
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,950
Once upon a time there were four brothers.

1188
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,990
We'll call them Elijah, Thaddeus, Renaldo

1189
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:32,950
and Thomas Groovesnore.

1190
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,750
Thomas was in love with a girl

1191
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,550
called Margretha,

1192
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,990
but Margretha had
been promised to Thaddeus.

1193
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,990
Shut up, damn you!

1194
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,990
Let me end my story.

1195
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:52,150
Your brother Thomas Groovesnore

1196
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:56,510
is also the Monk and
the real father of Pandora.

1197
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:59,270
and that's why
you will release Rasputin,

1198
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:01,190
so the Admiralty won't find out.

1199
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,950
You!

1200
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,590
You're blackmailing me!

1201
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:07,750
To each their own methods.

1202
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,070
Hey, sweet eyes, let's go.

1203
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,990
You and I, end of the story.

1204
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,750
Come on Rasputin, spare me.

1205
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,910
I have done it for Slütter, not for you,
but what is done is done.

1206
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,630
Therefore come with
me, and that's it.

1207
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:29,950
Well, if you really care...

1208
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,342
After all I like you.

1209
01:23:33,858 --> 01:23:36,156
I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

1210
01:23:36,356 --> 01:23:39,010
From now on
you'll be my best friend.

1211
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,445
Me?

1212
01:23:40,645 --> 01:23:42,858
I'd rather be
a friend of a tarantula's.

1213
01:23:44,799 --> 01:23:46,105
We'll take the yacht of the Monk.

1214
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:48,043
We'll have to slip away before
Groovesnore changes his mind.

1215
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:49,507
One never knows
with these soldiers...

1216
01:23:49,707 --> 01:23:51,627
They never practise
what they preach.

1217
01:23:51,814 --> 01:23:53,757
We'll leave with the tide.

1218
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,990
Hey!

1219
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,270
I'm the one who decides here.

1220
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,590
Corto!

1221
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,030
I wanted to ask you...

1222
01:24:15,828 --> 01:24:17,813
I'd like to sail with you.

1223
01:24:18,013 --> 01:24:19,849
With me?

1224
01:24:20,049 --> 01:24:22,543
Sure. You're the best
navigator I know.

1225
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,749
Here they are, they're setting sail.

1226
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,870
Already?

1227
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,510
Come on, go!
What are you waiting for?

1228
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:39,870
I prefer to stay here.

1229
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,790
I don't like goodbyes.

1230
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:48,070
Corto! Corto Maltese!

1231
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,830
She is dying with desire
to say goodbye to you,

1232
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:01,390
but she'll never do it.

1233
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,670
Hey... Romantic bijou!

1234
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,390
Good morning Corto Maltese.

1235
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,670
You look beautiful, Pandora.

1236
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,150
You remind me of a tango

1237
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,750
I listened to in Buenos Aires
many years ago.

1238
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:19,110
Perhaps you were with
someone who looked like me?

1239
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,470
No.

1240
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:23,150
I've always
wanted to meet you

1241
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,990
because you don't
look like anybody else.

1242
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:32,630
I cannot come with you.

1243
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:33,990
I know.

1244
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:39,630
Goodbye Pandora.

1245
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,350
See you soon, Corto.

1246
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:43,950
- Goodbye Cain.
- Why goodbye?

1247
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,790
We live in a big house in Cape
Cod, with a beautiful white gate.

1248
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,270
You'll find it easily.

1249
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,470
You're invited too, Corto,

1250
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:53,950
and all the people
you want to bring.

1251
01:25:55,015 --> 01:25:56,148
See you, my friends.

1252
01:25:56,348 --> 01:25:57,510
See you.

1253
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,230
That little idiot. Have you seen?

1254
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:13,910
He hasn't invited me.

1255
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,190
Of course he has.
What does it mean:

1256
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:18,230
"all the people you want to bring"?

1257
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,310
Then you'll bring me?

1258
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,870
I've never said that.

1259
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:24,909
