1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,979
Back in the '70s,
every cop wanted out of the city.

2
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,067
But the only cops allowed to live
outside New York were transit cops...

3
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,904
because the Transit Authority
was also run by Jersey and Connecticut.

4
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,658
So these guys I knew at the 3-7...

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,994
they started pulling overtime
at subway stations...

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,622
and got the city to declare them
"auxiliary transit cops".

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,128
They bought some land in Jersey.
Got some cheap loans from people they knew.

8
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,089
They made themselves a place
where the shit couldn't touch 'em.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,859
Every precinct has its "cop bar"...

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,112
a private club, all blue.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,574
For the 3-7, it was the 4 Aces...

12
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,868
just across the river.

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,137
So this Armenian guy,
he's from the other side over there.

14
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,724
He tells her that she's dead.
She's gonna be dead by morning.

15
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,060
- Right.
- So he drops this box off at her place.

16
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,062
They call you guys. They call Bomb Squad.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,232
We go in there. We X-ray it on scene.

18
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,484
- And we can't see anything in there.
- Right.

19
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,445
I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.

20
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,991
I see that there's some white fuzz.

21
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,160
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.

22
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,371
Suddenly I realize
I am looking at a tongue.

23
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,498
- Shit!
- A big, fat tongue sticking out at me.

24
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,959
- No way.
- Yes. The guy put a goat's head in there.

25
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,419
This at the end of the 20th century.

26
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,463
I mean, HG Wells,
he'd turn over in his grave...

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,216
to think at the start of a new millennium,
some Iranian guy-

28
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,759
Armenian.

29
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,804
Some Armenian would be deliverin' a goat's
head to the door of the woman he loved.

30
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,014
- People are-
- Backward culture over there.

31
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,016
Let me tell you.
We're all backwards, Berta.

32
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,186
Our machines are all modern
and shit, but our minds?

33
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,398
Our minds are primitive.
Our minds are primitive, Berta.

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,150
Hey.

35
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,027
- I gotta go home, baby.
- Wait. I'm just waitin' on the call, okay?

36
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,863
Come here. Come here.

37
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,242
- I gotta pick up the car. This is not-
- Monica, sit down.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,496
Excuse me. Do you mind?

39
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,585
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

40
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,505
Roberta, that's Freddy.
Freddy's cool. Freddy's cool.

41
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,175
He's got a bad ear. He's good people
though. Don't worry about it.

42
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,387
You have no authority.

43
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,973
You have no authority.

44
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,100
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,568
It's quiet tonight, huh, Freddy?

46
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,406
It's quiet.

47
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,368
Everyone's at that bachelor party
across the river.

48
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,954
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Whoop-de-doo.

49
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,790
You got any quarters?

50
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,919
Don't look at me.
I just put two more in the goddamn meter.

51
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,754
- It's his birthday.
- Oh, yeah?

52
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,089
- He's going for high score.
- Happy birthday, Freddy.

53
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,759
Happy birthday. Let me see what I got.

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,887
I wasn't into making a big deal
after the 10-year thing.

55
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,349
Hey. How you doin'? Sorry, Freddy. Hey.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,729
I was wondering
if you'd be able to come by.

57
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,982
Yeah. 4 Aces. Where else?

58
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,656
Shit!

59
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,742
Damn it.

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,714
Two kinds of people in this world.

61
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,175
Pinball people and video game people.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,636
You, Freddy, you're pinball people.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,349
- Always got somethin' to say, Figgsy.
- Come on.

64
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,476
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

65
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,688
Freddy! Freddy! Come on.

66
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,607
Come on. Come on. Come on.

67
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,028
It's bedtime, Sheriff.

68
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,282
You all right to drive?

69
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,701
- You sure?
- Positive.

70
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,122
- Take it easy, Freddy.
- Take it easy.

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,380
It was not Lady Luck
that Jim Maloney found in Atlantic City.

72
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,132
It was the cops.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,427
The 30-year-old native
of the Caribbean island of Antigua...

74
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,014
was captured in a casino
just days after an aspiring rap artist...

75
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,058
was fatally beaten
in a Queens convenience store.

76
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,937
Sources have filled in some of the blanks
for 1010 WINS saying Maloney-

77
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,689
Shit!

78
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,380
All right. Take it easy, take it easy.

79
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,549
- I apologize.
- Murray!

80
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,011
Magilla Gorilla, you fucking ape.

81
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,556
- Mikey, I'm out.
- Where're you goin'?

82
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,935
- I'm gettin' outta here. I love her.
- Yeah! Hangin' out in your apartment?

83
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,066
- Roger.
- Okay, Superboy. You're my man, Superboy.

84
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,151
- My man, Roger.
- Keep it up.

85
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,614
You guys take it easy. Davey,
can you dispose of this legally, please?

86
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,575
I don't like bachelor parties.

87
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,952
See you back in Jersey.

88
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,594
Shit!

89
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,905
Goddamn it!

90
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,950
Fuck.

91
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,048
Fuck!

92
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,681
Shit!

93
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,061
You have the fuckin' wrong stuff here.

94
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,980
- Jesus!
- Frankie?

95
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,734
Jesus Christ! What are you guys doin'?
You're giving me a heart attack over here.

96
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,736
Hey, Superboy, what do ya say, kid?

97
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,864
- You all right, Jackie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

98
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,160
Yeah? I'll see you guys tomorrow, man.
You're like creepers back here.

99
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,412
Thanks, kid. Be careful driving.

100
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,358
Giants leading it 10 to 6 as they move
to the bottom of the seventh inning.

101
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,694
In a game characterized by big rallies...

102
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,030
the Giants scored seven times
in the first inning off-

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,041
- Motherfucker!
- The Yankees lost to the Angels today.

104
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,127
Chili Davis hit two-run homers
from either side-

105
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,798
Hey!

106
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,302
Pull over. NYPD. Pull over!

107
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,767
Hey, you hear me? Pull over!

108
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,229
No!

109
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,231
Bang!

110
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,032
Fuck! Shit!

111
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,919
Fuckin' cocksucker!

112
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,664
Freddy?

113
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,807
Traffic incident? Bullshit!

114
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,143
Hey, what's up, man?
These guys were shot like six times.

115
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,021
Hey, just shut up, do your fucking job!

116
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,315
- Fucking nurse.
- What've you got?

117
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,735
I got four vials of crack here and a pipe.
That's it.

118
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,820
Russell, what you're thinking, swallow it.

119
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,989
The guy saved five babies
out in Red Hook, all right?

120
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,159
That's right, black babies.
Mashed potatoes don't mean gravy.

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,664
- I'm on the bridge.
- Is Babitch there?

122
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,500
- Yeah. I see him.
- Take care of it.

123
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,670
Uncle Ray?

124
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,173
- Uncle Ray, I saw a gun.
- Calm down.

125
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,343
I swear to God, he took a shot at me.
Tell 'em. They took a shot at me.

126
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,386
Stay right here with us, all right?

127
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,597
Tunney didn't even get the grand jury
for shit like this.

128
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,059
Fuck the GJ. You're Superboy.
You saved, what?

129
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,062
Six black babies?
Come on, kid, the shit plays!

130
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,106
- Three babies.
- One at a time, please.

131
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,777
I got PA on another channel,
the mayor's office, assistant DA.

132
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,445
Press up the yin-yang.

133
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,491
They're not here because we got gridlock
from across Bronx to the Palisades.

134
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,992
There's no gun.

135
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,539
You didn't see it, Jack?
You can't find it?

136
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,709
- Flaky.
- Listen, I heard a shot, Ray.

137
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,545
- I heard a shot. I saw a gun.
- In my trunk, in the grand union bag.

138
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,507
- I heard a shot, Leo. - The kid had
a steering wheel lock in his hands.

139
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,176
Your tire blew.

140
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,970
You're fucked up,
and you wasted a pair of shit-bags...

141
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,972
who aren't worth the hair
in the crack of your ass.

142
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,684
So you cool it
with the patty-cake morality.

143
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,520
Because without me, kid,
those stiffs'll put you in a room...

144
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,605
where you will fuck your uncle
and everything he's built.

145
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,648
Hey, Leo.

146
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,859
The black van's gonna be here in a minute,
and I haven't done shit!

147
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,445
- What I'm doing is highly-
- Sympathetic.

148
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,155
- Yeah, damn right.
- It is.

149
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,783
- Ray, we don't have to do this.
- Calm down.

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,410
Fuck, Ray!

151
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,433
Ooh, baby! Hey, we got it.

152
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,935
Look at that, huh? We got it!

153
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,231
- What the fuck are you doin', man?
- I found their piece.

154
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,233
- Found their piece?
- Jesus!

155
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,819
- That wasn't in there.
- It was underneath the floor mat.

156
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,821
- Bullshit, man. You can't do that!
- Man, come on.

157
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,407
- Shut the fuck up!
- It was underneath the fucking floor mat.

158
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,118
- What the fuck are you doing? Fuck you!
- Put it down!

159
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,996
I told you not to do it like this, Ray.

160
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,415
- We're just doin' our job, so calm down.
- I told you!

161
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,793
- It's a fuckin' Uzi!
- Take it easy. Hey!

162
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,421
You boys should take care
of your own business here.

163
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,132
Take my fuckin' shield away from me.

164
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,926
- Hey, put it down!
- What? You gonna shoot me?

165
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,680
- Put it down, Chico!
- Chico this, motherfucker!

166
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,934
- Frankie, Help me start it up.
- What the fuck you gonna do?

167
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,938
Kiss my ass!

168
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,778
Fuck!

169
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,658
Hey, Jack, Jack. Hey, hey.

170
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,535
Oh, my God!

171
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,080
Oh, my God! Leo!

172
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,042
Leo! Jesus! He jumped!

173
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,962
Oh, my God! He jumped!

174
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,259
- He jumped!
- Murray?

175
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,097
Somebody shine a light down there.

176
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,021
He just hit the water,
and... he went down.

177
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,815
Davis? Where's Davis?

178
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,983
I want Aviation, I want Harbor.
I want some illumination now!

179
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,944
Stupid fucking kid!
Oh, my God!

180
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,904
We got a man over the fucking GW!

181
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,648
How long is the car gonna take?

182
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,318
Lenny won't know
till the parts guy gets in.

183
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,737
You should take number two.

184
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,531
What did you tell Lenny
about the accident?

185
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,035
- Chasin' a speeder.
- What?

186
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,913
Sheriff was chasin' a speeder.

187
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,177
Our top story on 1010 WINS:

188
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,973
A fatal shoot-out on the GWB
and a cop's suicide.

189
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,351
Harbor Patrol continues searching
the Hudson River for the body...

190
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,812
of Officer Murray "Superboy" Babitch.

191
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,022
Babitch leaped off
the George Washington Bridge last night-

192
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,774
Put it out.

193
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,235
an apparent suicide,
after engaging in a high-speed chase.

194
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,987
Fucking asshole.

195
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,489
There's no way that guy jumped, man.

196
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,366
There's no fucking way!

197
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,618
Controversy swirls
around events on the bridge.

198
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,788
Officer, how can you testify...

199
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,167
that Superboy jumped off that bridge
when you didn't see him jump?

200
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,170
I'm looking at your statement right here...

201
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,340
that you filled out at 0200 hours.

202
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,010
Wait a minute. I'm gonna object
because we went through this.

203
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,637
He's been up all night.

204
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,473
How many times are you gonna
ask the same question?

205
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,103
Let me ask you another question, brother.

206
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,153
Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?

207
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,739
- What kind of question
is that, Lieutenant? - Counselor.

208
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,325
Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?

209
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,246
- Those white boys on that bridge-
- Come on, Lieutenant.

210
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,707
- You think this is The Mod Squad?
- Please. I object to this!

211
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,876
I'm offended by this.

212
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,337
All right! All right, listen.

213
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,341
He doesn't tell us what we want to know,
he's gonna lose his job.

214
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,093
That's about as simple as I can make it.

215
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,971
He's gonna lose his fuckin' job. All right?

216
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,182
Do you want that?

217
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,851
What do you take us for?
A bunch of fuckin' morons?

218
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,937
- What is the matter with you?
- With all due respect, but I think-

219
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,524
- You be quiet! You be quiet! Shut up!
- I'm just saying- I believe-

220
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,028
If you don't mind my French, all right?
You be quiet.

221
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,115
He's off the force if he does not
start answering questions.

222
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,951
You want to save your ass?
Start giving us answers.

223
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,287
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.

224
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,457
So do yourself a favor,
and stop fuckin' around.

225
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,921
Hey!

226
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,131
- We gonna talk or what, man?
- When your rep gets here.

227
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,259
- No. Fuck the rep. I gotta talk to you.
- When your rep gets here.

228
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,804
Ruben, can you call EMS about this guy?

229
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,140
Yeah. Hey, Moe, Harbor found
one of Superboy's shoes.

230
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,684
What about the socks?
They find them too?

231
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,023
Fuckin' shoe.

232
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,317
Jack Rector's comin' in tomorrow at 9:00.

233
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,653
- What about Donlan?
- Next week.

234
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,364
- His PDA attorney says-
- Who's that? Who's his lawyer?

235
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,325
- This guy Sloan.
- Sloan? Ooh, big gun.

236
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,746
Says he's grieving
and all depressed for his nephew.

237
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,084
Ray's all grieving and depressed.

238
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,669
I'll bet he is.

239
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,754
If Superboy is alive...

240
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,049
he's the fuckin' plague
right about now, right?

241
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,176
You're not gonna bring that home.

242
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,679
I mean, you don't shit
where you eat, do you?

243
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,264
I do, Carson.

244
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,808
I live in a house, and in it I shit...

245
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,144
and I eat.

246
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,582
It's Grotto.

247
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,120
- Murray, get down.
- It's Freddy's new girl.

248
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,955
Cover yourself.

249
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,753
- Hi. Can you turn your engine off for me?
- I got the air on.

250
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,756
- You on the job? - No. We're comin'
from Forest Hills, honey.

251
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,799
I'm John McEnroe. That's Jimmy Connors.

252
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,427
Is your license in there?
Can you pull it out for me, please?

253
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,930
- This is a school zone.
- Oh, Christ!

254
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,933
Listen, Miss Betts. You're new, right?

255
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,186
Yes, I'm new here,
but I'm not new on the job.

256
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,774
- I was a municipal deputy in Elmira.
- Freddy! Freddy!

257
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,777
You see, Officer, in Garrison...

258
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,781
when the car you're gonna tag
has got a PDA sticker...

259
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:46,077
I'd advise you to think to yourself,
"Hey, that's one of the good guys.

260
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,079
I think I'll go catch me a bad guy. "

261
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,332
If we didn't pull over PD, there wouldn't
be any violations in this town.

262
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,710
The problem ain't the people that
live here. It's the element that visits.

263
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,047
Is this a new car, Ray? It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.

264
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,549
Come on, Freddy. I wanna go home.
Tell this cupcake to heel.

265
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,510
- Okay, that's not necessary.
- Cindy.

266
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,431
- Listen. Take care, guys. See you later.
- Hey!

267
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,101
What happened to you, Freddy?

268
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,561
This was a fender bender.

269
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,023
She's kinda cute.

270
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,299
Dispatch. Hi!

271
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,759
Can I call you back? Bye.

272
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,263
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I got it.

273
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,355
Dispatch.

274
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,525
No, no. That's the next town over.
You called Garrison.

275
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,694
Right. The town with all the police.

276
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,320
What are you gonna do with Superboy?
You gotta stash him someplace.

277
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,405
We lie low.

278
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,958
Hey, Moe!

279
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,796
Hey, Ray.

280
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,720
- Sorry to hear about your nephew.
- Yeah, he was a good kid.

281
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,848
We were up all night with it.

282
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,603
I know you need to talk to me.

283
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,855
I'll come in next week sometime.
How's that?

284
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,235
- Jackie's comin' in early for you.
Tomorrow. - Hi, Jackie. Moe Tilden.

285
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,529
Yeah, hey.

286
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,531
- Moe Tilden.
- Yeah. Frankie Lagonda.

287
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,658
- What house?
- Out of the 3-7.

288
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,203
- You been there long?
- Maybe too long, huh?

289
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,957
- Too long. Right.
- Moe was my classmate at the academy.

290
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,210
Back in the day.

291
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,840
Before he fell in love
with this redhead at IA and transferred.

292
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,134
Is that how it went, Ray?

293
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,931
So what brings you to our fair city?
Checkin' up on us?

294
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,228
I heard there was a way of life out here.
Thought I'd check it out for myself.

295
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,315
Yeah. What are we, like the Amish now?

296
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,952
See you around.

297
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,375
You fuckin' rat.

298
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,310
Shit!

299
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,375
I thought you gave me a ticket.

300
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,835
You the sheriff?

301
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,839
- I thought you gave me a ticket.
- One second.

302
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,804
Hey, hey, Gordon, that's it.
Knock it off. Let him go.

303
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,599
- Asshole! - Just let him go.
Everyone, go to the park.

304
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,685
Go on, before I kick your ass.

305
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,395
Get on!

306
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,900
- Sorry.
- How long you been a sheriff?

307
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,444
- Ten years.
- That's great.

308
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,031
I see there's a lot of city cops here.

309
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,450
- Oh, yeah. A lot of cops.
- Great gig.

310
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,119
I like it.

311
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,249
I don't wanna waste your time.
Let me give you my card.

312
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,753
It's a special unit in the city.

313
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,881
If you ever wanna talk about anything,
it's all confidential.

314
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,677
Okay.

315
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,887
Nice to meet ya.

316
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,980
Ray, that fuck Tilden
shows up here with that grin.

317
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,024
Freddy's new girl pulls us over.

318
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,361
I mean, someone's talkin'.

319
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,030
I say it's Figgs.

320
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,243
I mean, we got some loose ends.

321
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,873
Freddy's my man.

322
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,461
Unfortunately,
he's on the wrong side of the river.

323
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,966
That don't mean you can't trust me, Ray-
with anything.

324
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,843
I trust you, Freddy.

325
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,055
I trust you to make sure the kids
don't kill themselves on prom night.

326
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,935
I trust you to suggest a good opera record
for my sister at Christmastime.

327
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,146
I'm serious.

328
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,067
Freddy, when I leave here everyday...

329
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,612
I trust you with my town.

330
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,323
Maybe I don't trust you with anything...

331
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,703
but I trust you
with my home and my family...

332
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,372
and, to me, that's everything.

333
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,464
I'm sorry. Jesus.

334
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,508
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I heard voices.

335
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,678
I was gonna have the base
call you back anyway.

336
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,889
Freddy!

337
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,349
Look what you found.

338
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,686
She's gonna be so happy. Her dad
won it, and I left it on top of the car.

339
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,271
I know. I saw from my window.

340
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,900
It's awful about Ray's nephew.

341
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,154
What happened to your nose?

342
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,823
Little accident.
I was chasing a speeder.

343
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,326
Mommy, I need some black!

344
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,415
Look what the sheriff found. Remember
how you were crying for that today?

345
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,251
Freddy, do you want some coffee?

346
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,962
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Liz.

347
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,716
- I got a little bit on me.
- You got a little bit on you, didn't you?

348
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,053
Come here. Okay. All right. You know what?

349
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,556
I have to get something
to clean this off of you.

350
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,392
Okay. We got it off both hands.

351
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,604
Isn't that nice?
I'm gonna go get a washcloth. Okay?

352
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,941
All right. You just draw a rainbow.
Enough with the sparkles.

353
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,984
I'll be right back.

354
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,820
All right?

355
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,869
Well. I was gonna call you.

356
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,081
Not you. One of your guys.

357
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,625
Why? What's up?

358
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,295
Someone's been dumping garbage-
garbage bags.

359
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,215
Is that them?

360
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,802
Just one of them. The rest are mine.

361
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,638
I don't tell Joey, 'cause then
he thinks he's got to deal with it.

362
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,474
Not that he doesn't think much
of the local- about you guys.

363
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,937
I'll take care of it. It's okay.
He's got the city to worry about, right?

364
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,233
Anyway-

365
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,672
What's the point with the black garbage
bag?

366
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,260
It's just I found your phone bill
in a black garbage bag down the street.

367
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,805
So, what if I said I didn't know
where it came from?

368
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,391
I'd take your word for it, Rose.

369
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,811
- Is Ray home? - No. He's taking care
of our little visitor.

370
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,484
My garbage gets picked up every Tuesday.

371
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,070
All right.
Thanks for your time, Rose.

372
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,657
You tell Joey that he should
come and talk to me...

373
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,910
if he thinks I got no right.

374
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:53,540
I wanna believe you when you tell me
something. Did you dump these bags or not?

375
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,626
Freddy, this isn't a law problem. Okay?

376
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,713
You tell Joey Randone
if he does not like my garbage...

377
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,591
then he should stop soiling my sheets.

378
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,346
You gonna tell Ray about this?

379
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,113
- Hey, Ray.
- What's up, Freddy?

380
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,742
Decided to give me that ticket?

381
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,702
No.

382
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,538
Somebody's been dumping garbage.

383
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,040
A felony.

384
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,380
- What's wrong, Officer? - Could I see
your license and registration?

385
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,258
- I was just asking-
- We just came to get a view of the city.

386
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,220
- I don't believe this.
- It'll be all right.

387
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,975
- They're just a couple. - They pull us
over for watching the sunset?

388
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,644
- I'll sit.
- All right, roger that.

389
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,274
We just drove down to visit the city.

390
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,401
He can't give us a ticket
for driving to the city.

391
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,571
I don't understand.
You should get his badge number.

392
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,616
This is racism, plain and simple.

393
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,812
- Ass motherfucking pig.
- We came here to watch the view!

394
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,106
- And you pull this?
- Speeding? My ass! Goddamn.

395
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:45,027
Do you know the meaning of "harassment"?
That's what this is, you know.

396
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,657
- It was Rose, wasn't it?
- Liz.

397
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,453
If you want me to, I'll talk to 'im.

398
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,956
Why?

399
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,125
You didn't marry him.

400
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,793
No.

401
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,130
But I'm your friend.

402
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,717
Freddy, look, I gotta go.

403
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,636
And let me be clear.

404
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,640
It was the system that drove Murray
"Superboy" Babitch off that bridge.

405
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,391
There it is.

406
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,852
Murray Babitch was a hero cop.

407
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,607
He deserved a fair hearing, but he knew
this would not happen, not in this city.

408
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,610
Activist Cyril Johns
met the parents of the slain teens...

409
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,988
calling for a human blockade
on the bridge tomorrow.

410
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,534
A drunk cop jumps off a bridge. That does
not erase the murder of two black children.

411
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,329
- Mayor Farelli responded to reports-
- 2-for-1.

412
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,540
of cops attempting to plant
evidence on the bridge.

413
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,669
We are looking into it. There may have
been some irregularity on the bridge.

414
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,379
- But as I say-
- Your mother's an irregularity.

415
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,924
No more comments. I'm here to enjoy
the ball game with my wife. Thank you.

416
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,261
- Yankee fan.
- That's your boss. Are you kidding?

417
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,723
- You'll never get another raise in your
life. - Who's gonna tell?

418
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,435
Wanna see something really cool?

419
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,357
Diagonal rule.

420
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,361
Diagonal rule. Red light, don't fight.
You make a right.

421
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,321
It's more important than the golden rule.

422
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,532
If Superboy knew that, he'd still be alive.

423
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,786
Freddy, I heard you saved
Ollie the turtle today.

424
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,748
- What happened to your nose?
- Nothing. I just had a little accident.

425
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,086
Listen, there's something we should
talk about if you've got some time.

426
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,714
- What?
- If you have a few minutes.

427
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,550
Pretty boy Joey bettin' against the Bulls.

428
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,802
What is that?
What, are you some kind of high roller?

429
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,264
- Fuck you, Figgs. I had 12 points.
- Against the five-time NBA champs?

430
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,724
What kind of bet is that?

431
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,060
You night guys watch way too much Oprah
when you should be catching your Z's.

432
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,731
Figgs. Well, at least I'm not the one
sniffin' my money away.

433
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,275
That was your inner child
making that wager, Joey.

434
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,861
Little boy Joey with the little Met poster
taped above his bed.

435
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,947
Really? Tell you what, Figgs.
Why don't you do me a favor.

436
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,993
Come on over here, unzip me, pull out
my inner child and take a bite, baby.

437
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,870
Bite it hard and bite it big.

438
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,414
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

439
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,502
Dumb fuck like that PD.
How's that make you feel, Freddy?

440
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,090
- I don't care.
- Yeah?

441
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,801
You like eatin' doughnuts?

442
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,596
Look, Freddy.
I say it's okay to be jealous.

443
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,183
You saved this girl's life, right?

444
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,895
From it, from risking yourself, from saving
her sorry ass, you go deaf as a result.

445
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,855
- In one ear.
- In one ear.

446
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,941
Then you have to watch as this girl
you saved, this beauty queen...

447
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,360
marries this cocksucker!

448
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,322
And you, with your ear,
you can't even get a desk on the force.

449
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,699
Right? You're fucked.

450
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,785
Be jealous, Freddy.

451
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,787
Let it out. I would.

452
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:46,500
Purge! Cleanse yourself.
Fucking cleansing.

453
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,256
Del, Del, let me have another beer.

454
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,759
I gotta go, Freddy.

455
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,804
School's in session. See you later.

456
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,350
This guy bets against the Bulls.

457
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,319
No one wants to get involved
in your personal life, Gary.

458
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,907
But just because you're undercover now,
that don't mean people aren't watchin' you.

459
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,660
What's going on here?
This is fuckin' bullshit.

460
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,080
This is bullshit.
What is this, omerta?

461
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,207
Listen, if IA's gonna fuckin'
hang me by the balls...

462
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,459
it ain't gonna be over
some fuckin' missing evidence.

463
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,504
Figgsy, you've been a cop 12 years.
Six grams missing.

464
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,923
It's not a white socks violation, babe.

465
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:39,261
Come on! You bought that big ol' house.
Maybe you're tryin' to get out from under.

466
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,931
- Hey! Jack.
- What the fuck's up your ass?

467
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,350
You're telling me you're gettin' by
without gravy, any of you?

468
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,229
I was putting out Ray's fires when you were
still suckin' on your mama's titties...

469
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,439
so just back the fuck off, all right?

470
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,109
So you want to toss me? What? You can't-

471
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,570
- Sit down, Gary.
- No! Tell me what's going on!

472
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,739
- This is bullshit! - Even better,
why don't you get the fuck out?

473
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,994
Fuck you, you fucking child!
Just back the fuck off.

474
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,580
At least I'm not shackin'
with no reekin' whore.

475
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,041
You're supposed to fuck 'em, Gary,
not open up a methadone clinic.

476
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,382
- Figgis, get the hell off of me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

477
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,426
Hey, Figgis, come on.

478
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,387
That's too much now. Hey, hey, hey!

479
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,764
- Gary.
- Fuck you.

480
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,436
You got a problem with me
helpin' a girl in trouble?

481
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,021
- Figgsy.
- You have a problem with that?

482
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,064
No, you're a fuckin' humanitarian!

483
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,192
Come here.
You think you're so fuckin' bad?

484
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,403
- Oh, God!
- Come on. Come here. You see this?

485
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,488
Look at Tunney. You see him?

486
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,992
- That was my fuckin' partner. That was a
cop! - Enough!

487
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,369
Let go of him, Figgsy.

488
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,333
Go home.

489
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,924
You all right, Jack? Let me look at you.

490
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,592
Don't shut me out, Ray!

491
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,222
You found us a sweet little town. You got
us the low interest, and I'm grateful.

492
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,392
But don't forget who it was that you
came to two years ago to cover your ass.

493
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,895
Get him outta here, Freddy!

494
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,273
- Come on. - It's not my fault
that you can't look at him!

495
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,611
You sit in this chair
with your back to 'im!

496
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,780
You want it to go away, but I'm still here.

497
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,950
In for a penny, in for a pound.

498
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,578
Don't shut me out, Ray.

499
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,297
I'll take care of it, Ray.

500
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,175
It's bullshit.
I'm gettin' the fuck outta this town!

501
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,390
- Open the door.
- You wanna play games? I don't play games.

502
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:53,103
Liz, open the door.
I want the door op- I want-

503
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,940
Open it now!

504
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,943
Shut up!

505
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,363
Why don't you go up the street
and get into bed with Rosie?

506
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,491
- Liz, open the goddamn door now!
- Idiot!

507
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,829
Open it... now!

508
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,749
Freddy, go home.

509
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,128
Everything is just hunky-dory. Please go.

510
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,551
- Mind if we check up on Liz?
- Yes, I do. I mind.

511
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,806
I said I mind, Freddy.

512
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,101
- Joey, I've had it, okay?
- I'll get the kit.

513
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,477
Liz, it's Freddy.

514
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,440
Does Ray know?

515
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,693
Freddy, does Ray know?

516
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,741
- Hi, Freddy.
- Are you okay?

517
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,747
Your Uncle Freddy is here
to rescue you again.

518
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,051
Liz, maybe you and the baby
need a place to stay. Let him cool off.

519
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,179
I could take you over to the Ramada.
Do you want me to do that?

520
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,683
He didn't do anything.
I... hit him with a bottle.

521
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,902
Freddy?

522
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,713
His girlfriend was in the basement.

523
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,049
- So where's Figgs? - I called him
at the precinct. He's on his way.

524
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,696
We got no pressure. I wonder if there's
still water in that tower over there.

525
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,035
Monica, can you hear me?

526
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,037
Oh, my God!

527
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,206
Oh, my God! Monica!

528
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,044
Baby, what were you doin' in there?

529
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,840
Hey! I came back to see you.

530
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,011
I needed some-

531
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,807
Wanted... to see you...

532
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,645
but you weren't there.

533
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,524
I was workin'. I was workin'.

534
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,405
Monica! No, baby.

535
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,703
We're losin' her.

536
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,043
Oh, my God.

537
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,994
- The fucker's gettin' payback.
- Who is?

538
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,079
Ray. Who do you think?

539
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,456
Lenny said it wasn't suspicious.
He said it was electrical.

540
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,393
Figgsy?

541
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,353
Look at me, Figgsy.

542
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,243
Did you call in?

543
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,374
I'm not on till Tuesday.

544
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,343
I'll call in. Buy you a couple weeks.

545
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,245
Dispatch.

546
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,083
Tell them they can't, ma'am.

547
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,920
Just because they're TV people, that
doesn't mean they can park on your lawn.

548
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,589
In a cemetery practically
reserved for cops...

549
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,759
you come across the tombstone
of Officer Glenn Tunney.

550
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,594
You may recall his case.

551
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,472
He was murdered in his jail cell
awaiting the grand jury.

552
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,558
Two years later, deja vu.

553
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,603
Another hero cop- Murray Babitch
is his name- dubbed "Superboy"...

554
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,064
unwilling to trust the system
that destroyed his friend...

555
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,066
jumps from the George Washington Bridge.

556
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,697
- Freddy.
- How ya doin'?

557
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,283
Freddy.

558
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,245
Maybe we should go up there.

559
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,169
Okay.

560
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,838
I want you to meet the head
of the Patrolmen's Defense Association.

561
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,047
Great.

562
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,676
Vincent.

563
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:08,514
Vincent Lassaro, I'd like you to meet
Sheriff Freddy Heflin.

564
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,892
You did a good job here.
You did a great job. Real nice.

565
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,602
- Thank you.
- Freddy's a hell of a guy.

566
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,145
Good. Great.

567
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,857
He tried to get on the force for years,
but he had this problem with his ear.

568
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,276
- You're not a lip reader, are ya?
- No, no.

569
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,820
It's just this one ear-
when I was a kid I had this accident.

570
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,157
You should call me. I mean,
when Ray Donlan puts his thumb in the air-

571
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,410
It's not the force,
but I got my own people. Call me.

572
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,830
Is he serious?

573
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,000
Freddy, my boy, that is how things happen.

574
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,253
- See you later.
- Detail! Atten-hut!

575
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,509
"Eternal God, our Father,
the Lord of our life and death...

576
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,846
we acknowledge Thee in all our ways
and in all events which befall us.

577
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,640
Lift us above the shadow-"

578
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,642
What's in the coffin?

579
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,685
His uniform.

580
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:59,690
"Then in Thy great mercy,
grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest.

581
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:04,362
And peace at last
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. "

582
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,239
Amen.

583
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,659
Unto God's gracious mercy
and protection, we commit you.

584
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,203
The Lord bless you and keep you.

585
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:17,542
The Lord make His face to shine upon you,
and be gracious unto you.

586
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:21,254
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon you and give you peace...

587
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,215
both now and forevermore.

588
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,384
Amen.

589
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,615
Hi, Sheriff. How you doin'?

590
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,659
How you doin'?

591
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,870
This is Detective Carson.

592
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,040
- How's it goin'?
- Come on in. It's your office.

593
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,132
That there is Manny Cardoza
and his brother.

594
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,842
They're drug runners.

595
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,183
I didn't know they allowed
classical music in Jersey.

596
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,564
Who's this?

597
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,734
Toy Torillo. You heard of him?

598
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,444
Oh, yes.

599
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,780
I don't know how you do it, Sheriff.

600
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,826
Keeping all these Hessians in line.

601
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,747
All blue.
Everybody packing. All together.

602
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,166
One door down from the next.

603
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,710
The wives borrowing the sugar.

604
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,754
It's like you're the sheriff for Cop Land.

605
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,007
Look at this.

606
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,317
You see, Sheriff, I got a sticky problem.

607
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:11,405
My jurisdiction ends, in a sense,
at the George Washington Bridge.

608
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:17,161
But half the men I watch
live beyond that bridge...

609
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,080
where no one's watching.

610
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,706
I'm watching.

611
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,209
I can see that. You've got a crime rate
here of about, what?

612
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,419
The lowest in northern New Jersey.

613
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,714
You got Hoboken and Jersey City
over here. Newark.

614
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,342
We try to do a good job with what we have.

615
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,177
With a staff of three? No, Sheriff.

616
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,430
What you got here is a town
that scares the shit out of certain people.

617
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,350
Lieutenant, I told you, I'm watching.

618
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,854
If you look around, you see none
of these people are wearing silk shirts.

619
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,983
Their pools are above ground. You know?

620
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,320
You raise your family somewhere decent,
I guess that's a crime now.

621
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,577
Lieutenant, look around.

622
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,789
This is a town with a population
of 1,000 people.

623
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,710
- I got news for you. Not all cops
are dirty. - I'm not saying they are.

624
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,227
This kid, he was- He lived around here.

625
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,148
He used to come by,
have drinks with the guys, hang out.

626
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,316
He never caused any problems.

627
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,160
You mind if I sit down?

628
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,289
We buried a suit today.

629
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,584
We buried a suit today!

630
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,464
That doesn't bother you?

631
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,427
- He jumped off the GWB.
- Yeah, but his body never hit the water.

632
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,681
That doesn't bother you.

633
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,394
What does? That I investigate cops?

634
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,898
- Being a man who always pined to be a cop?
- I am a cop.

635
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,358
Pined to be NYPD.

636
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:16,322
Three forced absent, 10 years
appeals of hearing tests.

637
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,990
Right?

638
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,496
You may be law enforcement,
and so am I, but you are not a cop.

639
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,669
Now, I may watch cops,
but tell me if I'm wrong.

640
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,380
Every day out these windows, so do you.

641
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,841
You watch cops too.

642
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,261
And since we are both law enforcement,
we share a duty.

643
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,722
Do we not?

644
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,767
If there is a stink, we must investigate.

645
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,270
We must gather evidence
because evidence makes us see the truth.

646
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,942
Is this the stink of a criminal act,
or is it a turd in a bag?

647
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,653
I'll tell you something, Sheriff.

648
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,072
I see cops who lose their way every day...

649
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,574
and I don't like that...

650
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,662
because their ambivalence is contagious.

651
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,000
They infect those around them.
They're like maggots.

652
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,169
Where you find one, you find a nest.

653
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,382
And I take that real personally.

654
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,221
I went to the same academy
as our friend there.

655
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,599
Ray? Good man.

656
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,935
I stood by him at graduation.

657
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,396
He was a beauty.

658
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,065
- He's been good to me.
- Yeah, a real collar man.

659
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,278
To the cop that he was,
to his memory, I am loyal...

660
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,656
but through the fog of my loyalty
to the men...

661
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,741
the evidence makes me see...

662
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,202
and, these days, what I see...

663
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,622
like an island out of my reach...

664
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:53,210
I see this beautiful island
shining through this fog...

665
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,963
every house financed
by one of two mob banks.

666
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,135
That's right, Sheriff.

667
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,262
What I see is your town.

668
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,474
No, no, you don't see that.

669
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,936
Babitch isn't dead.
You know that and I know that.

670
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,441
Ray got him off that bridge alive,
before he could talk.

671
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,154
But he wasn't so lucky the last time
when the shit hit the fan with Tunney.

672
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,449
That boy he took care of later.

673
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:27,745
But now what? What does Ray do now?
That's the $64,000 question.

674
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,455
And that's why I'm here.

675
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,749
That's why I'm here, Sheriff.

676
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,834
Because you're on the inside.

677
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:39,298
Besides the church traffic and the cats
in the trees and all that other bullshit...

678
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,677
there isn't much here for you to do
to keep your mind busy.

679
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,263
But I look at you, Sheriff...

680
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:50,267
and I see a man who's waiting
for something to do.

681
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,394
And here I am.

682
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,273
Here I am saying, "Sheriff...

683
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,777
I got something for you to do. "

684
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,354
So let's make the most
of this beautiful day

685
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,608
Since we're together,
we might as well say

686
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,571
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?

687
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,409
Won't you be my neighbor?

688
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,287
You know, Figgsy...

689
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,542
you don't have to sleep at the station
if you don't want to.

690
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,545
You can stay in my basement
until you find a new place.

691
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,925
Come on. Let's get this guy, Frank!

692
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,512
- It's gonna be a long day, Papa!
- Kid, you're up. Your turn to be a hero.

693
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,515
Billy heard they're having a party tonight.

694
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,994
I'll take care of it, Bill.

695
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,503
Hey, Frank, is Ray home?

696
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,589
What, you need us to turn it down?

697
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,299
No, I just need to talk to Ray.

698
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,719
Come here. Come here.
Wait outside there.

699
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,680
I don't wanna go through this again.

700
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,768
- It's too fuckin' bad.
- I can't! I told the boys-

701
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,438
I mean, they're downstairs now
saying good-bye.

702
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,358
Ray, how many people you got
at this party? The whole 3-7?

703
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,693
You got a party downstairs.
He needs to talk to you.

704
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,947
Here I am cleaning this thing up for you,
and you're throwing a fuckin' party.

705
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,369
The mayor's gonna suspend this case.
I'm making it happen tomorrow!

706
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,747
But sooner or later, Ray,
they gotta find a body in that river...

707
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,457
or it will not hold.

708
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,627
Mets, it's my sister-in-law's kid!

709
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,214
Didn't you say he was adopted?

710
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,845
Turn it down!

711
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,142
- Don't go yet.
- I gotta drive Donna home.

712
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,103
Take her to the train.

713
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,655
Ray, this doesn't make things
very easy for me.

714
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,575
This is a pretty big thing you're having
here the day after. How do you think-

715
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,661
Freddy, what are you talking about?

716
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,166
This guy came to see me yesterday,
this Moe Tilden from IA.

717
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,293
- He brought all these pictures and-
- Freddy.

718
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:07,673
That guy's had a hard-on for me for years.
It's a personal thing.

719
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,050
- He is a scumbag.
- All right.

720
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,803
You know how they recruit at IAD?

721
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,638
They catch you on the take...

722
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,350
and they tell you
you can either do time or join 'em.

723
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,646
He knows you know Superboy is-

724
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,358
I told him he was dead, Ray.
I told him he was wrong about you.

725
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,110
But I'm the sheriff.

726
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,113
I mean, I'm supposed to know
what's goin' on.

727
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,159
How do you think this looks?

728
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,954
Go home, Freddy, and don't think so much.

729
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,166
- Ray, I can't go.
- Freddy-

730
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,503
- Freddy, go home. Go home. Go home.
- I can't go-

731
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,975
Yo, Ross, come over here. Look at this.

732
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,395
Super!

733
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,652
It's not Murray. It's not Murray.
He's part of a search.

734
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,906
- In Tempe, Arizona.
- Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta, Georgia.

735
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,121
Murray, Murray.

736
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,707
Okay. Listen.

737
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,710
- I want you to have this. - No, Aunt Rose,
I'm fine. Seriously. I gotta go-

738
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,213
Look, Murray, look.

739
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,674
Listen to me. I want you to have this.

740
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,385
All right. You made it for me?

741
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,305
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

742
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,724
- Okay.
- Thank you.

743
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,319
Hi.

744
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,363
Hi.

745
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,785
You guys have another fight?

746
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,121
We were supposed to have a big talk.

747
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,168
So I sent Caroline over to my mom's.

748
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,878
And-

749
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,299
And Joey called
and told me that he was stuck...

750
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,760
and that he made some arrest.

751
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,557
I mean, I... can't believe him
when he tells me...

752
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,227
anything.

753
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,855
Liz, you wanna come inside?

754
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:43,579
You can get this on CD,
you know, in stereo.

755
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,082
It wouldn't matter to me.

756
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,418
Oh, right.

757
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,344
You know, it's a funny thing
when you owe someone your life.

758
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,650
Why is it you never got married, Freddy?

759
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,744
All the best girls were taken.

760
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,376
This is crazy.

761
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,877
Yes.

762
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,058
All right. Take it easy. All right?

763
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,227
All right, Gabriel. Take it easy.

764
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,957
Murray?

765
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,835
Hey, Murray!

766
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,421
Ray's outside waitin' for ya.

767
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,925
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin', I'm comin'.

768
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,163
That was a great party, Ray.

769
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,797
You know, Ray,
it's a really great thing you did.

770
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,092
Makin' a place where everybody
could stick together.

771
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,471
I mean...

772
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,016
I know you didn't have to do this for me.

773
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,685
You could've just-

774
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,814
I wanna let you know I appreciate it.

775
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,234
- I really do.
- Everyone's gone.

776
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,570
- Just us, buddy.
- That's it.

777
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,866
I always said to my mom,
"Uncle Ray doesn't like me, but-"

778
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,203
I always liked you, Murray.

779
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,456
You just sweat too much.

780
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,168
- Hey, what's doin'?
- Hey, Superboy.

781
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,838
So what are we gonna do now?
I'm gonna go meet some people?

782
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,840
How does this work?

783
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,384
I got all my bags packed
and everything, Ray.

784
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,178
Just I'm a little buzzed.

785
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,097
You know, maybe we could
do this tomorrow or something.

786
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,184
I'm really tired, Ray.

787
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,521
- Where's Joey?
- He's working tonight, kid.

788
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,689
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

789
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,108
Sorry it came out this way, Murray.

790
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,486
It's not that bad, Jack.

791
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,615
Yeah, it is, Murray.

792
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,724
- Fuck!
- What the fuck is going on here?

793
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,436
What is this? What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

794
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,897
- Stay outta this.
- What the fuck is this?

795
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:24,526
Ray, you said PDA was gonna
set him up with a new life.

796
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,695
You think I'm all that, Joey?

797
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,808
Fuck it.

798
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,695
Put your files in there.
We're done. It's over.

799
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,783
- Moe-
- We were shut down by the mayor. Here.

800
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:17,370
- What the fuck is this? - Put your files
in there. The case is closed.

801
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,623
Ruben, what are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

802
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,208
- I'm on hold with the phone company.
- Is that the Garrison file?

803
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:26,630
Is that a Garrison file?
Give me your Garrison files.

804
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,590
- Give me it all. Give me it all.
- All right.

805
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,509
Is that more?
I'll take everything. The case is closed.

806
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,720
The case is fucking closed!

807
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,514
Closed!

808
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,938
The case is closed, finished, over!

809
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,606
Go to lunch.

810
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,444
Go to lunch! Go! Hey, go to lunch.

811
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,698
Go to lunch! The case is closed.
Everybody, get the fuck outta here.

812
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,242
Get outta here!
The case is fucking closed!

813
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,169
With community leaders
and pundits crying "Cover up"...

814
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,339
Mayor Farelli's suspension
of the Babitch case is a big gamble.

815
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:14,094
No one's gonna read this. They never read
it. It's just a bunch of red tape.

816
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,514
- Sheriff! Sheriff!
- She's gonna fuck up my insurance claim.

817
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,183
- Don't pull the paper out of the thing.
- Here's your coffee.

818
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,395
Cin, please just try it
his way for a while.

819
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,438
I'm tellin' you,
you don't need to do this.

820
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,649
It's just a bunch of bullshit.

821
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,363
What do you want?

822
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,156
Are you gonna help us or not?

823
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,369
Help you help what?
Help Ray here find him?

824
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,830
Help Ray finish cleaning up
his goddamn pool with the guy's head?

825
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,582
Is that it, Mr. Humanitarian?

826
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,292
You got something
you wanna say to me, Ray?

827
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,045
Or is this about something
a little more personal?

828
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,550
I'm on at 10:00. I'm outta here.

829
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,219
We all are. We got another hour.

830
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,304
Hey, come on, Joey.

831
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,652
Instead of taking cop lessons
from a cokehead...

832
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,697
maybe you should be lookin'
at that fire, you know?

833
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,617
My girl over at Chase
says Figgs is missing a few payments.

834
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,661
Where were you that night, Jack?

835
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,375
I had nothin' to do with it.

836
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,380
That would be retribution,
and that I leave to God Almighty.

837
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,091
I'm Gandhi.

838
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,596
I'm tellin' ya, the mob built
this town for Ray...

839
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,265
so they could own a fuckin' precinct.

840
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,560
It's a deep and dark motherfuck.

841
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,940
What you're feelin' right now, Freddy-

842
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,694
friendless, angry, nervous, misunderstood-

843
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,322
this is it, this is the life.

844
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,283
You're lucky your ear
kept you off the force.

845
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,454
You know...

846
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,415
if I saw Liz...

847
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,836
drowning in the water-

848
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,464
If I saw that today...

849
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,717
I wouldn't go in.

850
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,971
I'd stand there, and I'd think about it.

851
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,393
And that's the best thing
I ever did with my life.

852
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:30,522
- So?
- So?

853
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,442
So you wanna sit around your whole life
wishing you were on the force?

854
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,320
Or do you wanna bring the faggot in?

855
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:38,822
Let him spill.

856
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,118
I wouldn't know where to begin.

857
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,831
All right. Brother's in deep shit.

858
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,959
He's down, he's bleeding,
and you gotta get there.

859
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,504
But there's lights, right?
All over the city, red lights.

860
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,381
You go through the red lights.

861
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,259
Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail,
you go through the red lights.

862
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,846
But that's slow, Freddy,
fighting your way through traffic.

863
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,014
The goal is perpetual motion.

864
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,558
You want greens.

865
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:10,937
But how do you ensure the greens?

866
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,109
You can't. As in life, in traffic.

867
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,444
So what you do
is you leave yourself an out.

868
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,322
At every corner,
you leave yourself an alternative.

869
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,491
You move diagonal.

870
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,202
You turn the wheel
when you hit a red light.

871
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,705
You don't drive down Broadway
to get to Broadway.

872
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,917
If you move diagonal...

873
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,504
you're gonna get perpetual motion.

874
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,006
That's what you want.

875
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,219
But how does this apply
to what you were saying in there?

876
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,597
It applies, Freddy!

877
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,892
It's just as easy to tail a man
walking in front of him.

878
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,520
You butt heads with these friends of ours,
you're gonna come at them head-on?

879
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,773
- Okay.
- They got lives, Freddy.

880
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,067
Families.

881
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,405
No.

882
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,782
You move diagonal.

883
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,451
You jag.

884
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,414
Christ! Where the fuck are you guys?

885
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,416
We're on our way- in 20.

886
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,586
I'm down.
But Joey, he's tryin' to hold on...

887
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,255
but this big bastard, he cut me up.

888
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,507
I need help!

889
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:25,136
- He's a fucking monster!
- I need your location, Tom!

890
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,181
- I need an assist.
- I can't move. I think he cut my tendon.

891
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,934
What the fuck-

892
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,395
Shit-

893
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,731
You got a wife?

894
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,733
You got a baby?

895
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,445
Quit! Tell me you quit.

896
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,614
I'll let you go. You can go home.

897
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,701
Kiss your wife.
Eat your baby's Fruit Loops and shit.

898
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:52,622
You thank me, motherfucker.
You're gonna be redeemed.

899
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,249
Redeemed...

900
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:58,461
Officer... Randone.

901
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,853
Shit! Stupid-

902
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,231
- You motherfucker!
- Shit.

903
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,907
It's the roof, Jack. That's a clusterfuck.
You got units, send 'em in.

904
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:31,160
I'll check the front.
We don't know what's going on!

905
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,376
Come on, come on.

906
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,506
Son of a bitch!

907
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,219
Please.

908
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,433
No!

909
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,488
Help! Help!

910
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,880
In here!

911
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,182
Joey's in trouble, Ray.

912
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,435
Ray, let's just break
the fuckin' thing down.

913
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:41,606
Got it.

914
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:10,760
God.

915
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,316
His father is serving a life sentence
for murder, murdering an ex-girlfriend...

916
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,652
with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988.

917
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,988
The New York Times is quoting
one friend of Royster as saying...

918
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,533
that the guy had an IQ of 160.

919
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,085
I need your help.

920
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,295
They're tryin' to kill me.

921
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,214
- Who?
- "Who"?

922
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:52,093
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan tried to kill me.

923
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:55,304
Shit!

924
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,390
Holy shit!

925
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,350
Speak of the devil!

926
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,368
Freddy, forget it.

927
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,380
I don't get this.

928
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,966
This doesn't make any sense.

929
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,343
Why'd they get Superboy off the bridge...

930
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,180
to bring him back here and kill him?

931
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,766
Ray had a plan...

932
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,687
and it got very fucked up.

933
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,294
You awake, Freddy?

934
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,926
I feel like shit.

935
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,679
Fuckin' allergies are killin' me.

936
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,313
Hey.

937
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,790
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

938
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,167
through our Lord, Jesus Christ...

939
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,128
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph...

940
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,422
and we commit his body to the ground.

941
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,300
The Lord bless him and keep him.

942
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:58,594
The Lord make His face
to shine upon him...

943
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,846
and be gracious unto him.

944
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,933
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon him...

945
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,476
and give him peace.

946
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,272
Honor Guard, retreat.

947
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,444
- No, I don't know.
- What the hell are you doing?

948
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,863
- I just- I gotta-
- What are you doing?

949
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,906
- Call you back.
- Excuse me.

950
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,075
Moe, I apologize.
He just walked in here.

951
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,953
I'm sorry for rushing in like this,
but you were right.

952
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,372
They tried to kill him like you said,
but he got away.

953
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,292
Now he's runnin' through the woods
like a scared animal. He's scared to death.

954
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,336
That motherfucker should be scared.

955
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,005
His uncle got this case closed
with one phone call.

956
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:22,428
I'm sorry it took so long for me
to come around, but you were right.

957
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:26,307
I couldn't see the truth. The evidence,
my loyalty, they were confusing.

958
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,434
They never give you
any napkins in this place.

959
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,729
What am I supposed to use?

960
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,898
You want this?

961
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:37,902
What is this?
You came to me, to my town...

962
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,529
with all these speeches,
talking about doing the right thing.

963
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,074
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on? What are you doing?

964
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,619
That was like two weeks ago.

965
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,205
Two weeks ago?

966
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:58,339
- What about Babitch?
- What about him? Fuck him.

967
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,928
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.

968
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,056
What about Joey Randone?

969
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:10,351
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?

970
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,563
Listen, Sheriff, I'm really sorry...

971
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,358
to have awoken you from your slumber,
but it's over.

972
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,694
Hands are tied now. You shut me down.

973
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,988
Listen to me. You're IA. That's why I came
to you. You can do whatever you want.

974
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:25,908
Remember you came to me, said,
"You wanna be a cop?" I'm bein' a cop.

975
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,868
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.

976
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,287
I need to do something.
I need to do this for myself.

977
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,832
Listen, you deaf fuck.
I offered you a chance.

978
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,793
When we could have done something,
I offered you a chance to be a cop...

979
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,129
and you blew it!

980
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,297
You blew it.

981
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:55,187
You people are all the same.

982
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,653
That cupcake makes a mess,
we got a case again.

983
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:11,889
The mob runs millions in drugs
through their precinct...

984
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,350
and everybody gets a nice house.

985
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,815
Figgs is right. The mob owns this town.

986
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,629
They closed the case, Freddy.

987
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:47,258
- If they don't have the stomach for it-
- They had to. It's circumstantial.

988
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,010
You don't have anything either.

989
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,680
All that stuff is illegal. You stole it.

990
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,411
I know this guy.

991
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,680
He's a corrections officer.

992
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:55,701
They took care of Tunney
when he was gonna talk.

993
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,830
How come Figgis didn't do somethin' about
it? He was Ray's right-hand man back then.

994
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,791
Then they tried to kill Superboy.

995
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,919
They were hiding him, Freddy.

996
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:10,090
Then they burned down Figgsy's house
when they think he might talk.

997
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,594
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.

998
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:20,684
Not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy.

999
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,063
I think you been hangin'
around Figgs too much.

1000
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,732
He's the only one getting cash
out of that house...

1001
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,359
and he's totally playing you-

1002
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,237
just like those assholes in the city.

1003
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,743
And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing
you can do about this.

1004
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,162
Yes, there is.

1005
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,498
I can find Superboy,
and I can bring him in.

1006
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:53,008
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.

1007
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:56,595
I don't want any part of this.

1008
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,847
I don't want any part of this place.

1009
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,809
Come on, Cindy.

1010
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:08,524
Shit.

1011
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,860
Freddy.

1012
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,905
Look, I don't know about Ray, okay?

1013
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,074
But everyone in Garrison
is not a murderer.

1014
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:22,371
No. They just keep their eyes closed
and their mouths shut, just like me.

1015
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:43,517
Hey, Freddy.

1016
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,527
All right, thank you. Thank you.

1017
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,446
Thank you, sweetheart. I love you too.

1018
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,614
All right, terrific.

1019
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:30,773
- Two in the center?
- No. Rules are different for cops.

1020
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,777
- I'm losin' my shirt here with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?

1021
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,072
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.

1022
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,949
- Hey, Freddy.
- You a cop too?

1023
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:42,951
Yeah, yeah, I heard ya.

1024
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,246
Enjoy your trip to the big city?

1025
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,714
You gotta hit the next five to win.

1026
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:07,518
Shit!

1027
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,609
I just hope you're not trying
to prove anything, Freddy.

1028
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,487
I know some of them are real assholes.

1029
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:21,824
They think they're high priests
or somethin'. I don't know.

1030
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:25,577
But why would they do all this?
Maybe they're doin' the right thing.

1031
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,751
Liz, I saw these pictures of Ray
meeting with these guys.

1032
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:35,003
You know, like mobsters.

1033
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:37,339
Everyone's houses are financed
by these mob banks.

1034
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,133
Says who? IA?

1035
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,428
Even you said Joey's death
was no accident.

1036
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:47,224
Joey fell off a building, Freddy! Okay?

1037
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,853
I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do. I don't.

1038
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:54,189
All Joey wanted was a place for us to live.

1039
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:58,068
Who are you to judge that
until you've walked in his shoes?

1040
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,404
Maybe that's what
you're tryin' to do with me.

1041
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,293
What are you gonna do, Freddy?

1042
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,380
You gonna arrest the whole town?

1043
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:22,426
You goin' to New York to take
"paint by number" cop lessons?

1044
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:25,762
You know, Ray likes you.

1045
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,015
That don't mean
I'm gonna let you fuck him over.

1046
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,022
Ray Donlan gave you this job, Freddy.

1047
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,817
You forgot that? We made your sorry ass!

1048
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,614
So now you can do us a favor.

1049
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:47,534
You could tell us... where Superboy is.

1050
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:51,121
If I knew where he was,
he'd be in the city already.

1051
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:58,253
You're gonna be hurtin', Freddy.

1052
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:00,672
You're not gonna know when,
you're not gonna know where.

1053
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,634
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words. I'm watchin' you!

1054
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:42,631
Hey.

1055
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,677
- You got your check.
- Yep.

1056
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,929
Thanks to you, Freddy.

1057
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,348
Filing out those forms
in such a timely fashion.

1058
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,770
You with Liz?

1059
01:27:58,523 --> 01:27:59,940
Where you goin'?

1060
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:04,111
I don't know.

1061
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,073
My leave came, so I thought I'd look
around for a new reality. You know?

1062
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,744
Anyway, I'm sure you could use
your privacy, Freddy.

1063
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,209
No, no.

1064
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,167
Look all you want, Freddy.

1065
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,669
You're not gonna find anything.

1066
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,006
I took care of it.

1067
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,347
That lady cop from the Bomb Squad...

1068
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,475
got you the stuff
to do this with, didn't she?

1069
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,022
You didn't know Monica was gonna be here.
Did you, Figgs?

1070
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,524
No.

1071
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:09,486
Monica said she was going over to her
friend's house to watch some pay-per-view.

1072
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,241
The thing was on a timer. I didn't know
she was gonna be here, Freddy.

1073
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,495
It's all bullshit.

1074
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:22,207
You, Figgs, are the bullshit!

1075
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,418
Smarten fuckin' up!

1076
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,795
You even turned your back on Tunney
when he needed your help!

1077
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:30,382
Figgs! I'm gonna find Superboy,
and I'm gonna bring him in!

1078
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,385
And for once, everybody in this town's
gonna tell the truth!

1079
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:36,096
- You gotta find him first, Freddy!
- I'll find him.

1080
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:40,308
Listen to me. I got a check
in my pocket for $200,000.

1081
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:42,310
I got a chance to start my life again.

1082
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,397
I don't give a shit about this town!
I don't give a shit about that town.

1083
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:48,942
And I don't give a shit
about your fucking justice!

1084
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:52,446
Bein' right is not
a bulletproof vest, Freddy!

1085
01:30:58,494 --> 01:30:59,870
Go on, Figgsy!

1086
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,205
Go on! Run away!

1087
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,392
Hey, Freddy.

1088
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,103
- Ray's not home.
- I know.

1089
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,647
I'm lookin' for your nephew.

1090
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:31,318
I don't know where he is.

1091
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,112
Why the hell would I tell you if I did?

1092
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,532
Rose, I'm his only chance.

1093
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:56,778
Let's go.

1094
01:32:58,197 --> 01:33:01,616
- You workin' with the feds?
- No.

1095
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:05,078
- IA?
- No.

1096
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:08,331
You're alone.

1097
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,750
Let's go.

1098
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,259
- Oh, shit.
- All right. Get down. Get down.

1099
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,052
- Oh, shit.
- And stay down.

1100
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,554
Shit.

1101
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,434
Bill, where are you?

1102
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,858
Bill, if you read,
we're going back to the station.

1103
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,658
You gonna keep me in here?

1104
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:45,785
You gonna keep me in here with cuffs?

1105
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,122
- You don't know what you're doing, do you?
- Shut up.

1106
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:55,337
You don't have a clue as to what the fuck
is going on, do you, Sheriff?

1107
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,049
Bill, do you copy?

1108
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,134
Bill, do you read?

1109
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,168
- It's just club soda, Freddy.
- Finish it.

1110
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:42,884
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey, Freddy.

1111
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,261
I came to tell you I found Superboy...

1112
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:49,849
and I'm bringing him in
tomorrow morning...

1113
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,559
and I'd like you to come with me.

1114
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:53,770
I owe you that much.

1115
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:00,193
He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced
you're tryin' to kill him.

1116
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,862
Just tell me where he is, Freddy.

1117
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,948
You got him at the station?

1118
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,160
Ray, there's gotta be a way
out of this for everyone.

1119
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:12,288
So, I say why don't we all
go in tomorrow together?

1120
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:14,374
Listen to me, Freddy.

1121
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:23,299
You know the difference
between men and boys?

1122
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,803
Boys bet everything on everything.

1123
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:30,056
Boys think every hand is a royal flush.

1124
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:34,018
You play cards with a man,
he knows his limits.

1125
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:38,565
Freddy, I invited men...

1126
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,400
cops...

1127
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,943
good men...

1128
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,779
to live in this town.

1129
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:48,616
And these men, to make a living,
they cross that bridge every day...

1130
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:51,953
to a place where everything
is upside down.

1131
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,874
Where the cop is the perp,
and the perp is the victim.

1132
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,793
But they play by the rules.

1133
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,588
They keep their guns in their holsters...

1134
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,758
and they play by the rules.

1135
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:09,596
The only thing they did
was to get their families out...

1136
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:13,016
before it got to them.

1137
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,435
We made a place where things make sense...

1138
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,897
and you can walk
across the street without fear.

1139
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,400
And you come to me
with a plan to set things right.

1140
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:26,780
Everyone in this city holding hands,
singing "We Are the World. "

1141
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,698
That's very nice.

1142
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:34,579
But, Freddy,
your plan is the plan of a boy.

1143
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:40,126
You made it on the back of a matchbook
without thinking!

1144
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,923
Without looking at the cards.

1145
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,593
I look at the cards.

1146
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,428
I see this town...

1147
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:53,681
destroyed.

1148
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:56,267
That's not what you want, is it?

1149
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,687
I look at this town...

1150
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,567
and I don't like what I see anymore.

1151
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,986
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1152
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:11,991
The sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey.

1153
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,118
Then be the sheriff!

1154
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,540
Defend this town! Protect these men!

1155
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,295
Freddy, you got him at the station?
Just drop the keys.

1156
01:37:24,463 --> 01:37:26,381
A little too rich for my blood.

1157
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:30,218
Maybe they fell out of your pocket-
or maybe Cindy's.

1158
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:32,470
Now, you go home and you sleep...

1159
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:36,808
and you wake up and you guide the traffic
through this town...

1160
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:39,143
and everything will be the way it was.

1161
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,773
I'm taking him in
tomorrow morning at 6:00.

1162
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:49,028
That's in a few hours.
I'd like you to come with me, Ray.

1163
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:58,830
There's nothing I can say?

1164
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:10,967
Okay. Then 6:00 it is.

1165
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,512
Yeah. No, Lis.

1166
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,223
Who was he supposed to call?

1167
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,684
Ray knows everybody.

1168
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:25,064
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone? What?

1169
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,942
You know what? Okay, fine.

1170
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,405
Why don't you go home?

1171
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:37,285
I mean...

1172
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:40,204
I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but-

1173
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,833
Lisa's nervous, you know. She's pregnant.

1174
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:47,003
- I mean-
- So, go on. I'll be fine.

1175
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,550
Yeah.

1176
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,260
You be careful, Freddy.

1177
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:56,804
Yeah. You too.

1178
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:26,042
Shut the fuck up! Would ya, please?

1179
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,044
Fuck!

1180
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,567
Come on.

1181
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:04,706
Come on.

1182
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,460
- Oh, shit!
- Get down!

1183
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:11,421
- All right, you jackass.
- I said get down, buddy.

1184
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:14,424
Jesus. You guys
don't wanna do this. Jack.

1185
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:16,426
Don't shit in your pants, Freddy.
He's not gonna kill ya.

1186
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:18,720
This is the good one, right?

1187
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:20,680
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1188
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,765
Move, move, move!

1189
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:25,143
God!

1190
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,604
All right, hit it, Jackie. Hit it, Jack!

1191
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:50,538
Jesus Christ!

1192
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:56,294
You fuck!

1193
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:43,359
Freddy!

1194
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,351
I can't hear you, Ray.

1195
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:02,438
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1196
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,609
Hey, hey. What're you doin'?

1197
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,028
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

1198
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:13,324
Come on, guys, it's cool.
Everything's cool.

1199
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:17,244
Everything's cool. Everything's cool.
Come on. Everything's cool.

1200
01:46:17,412 --> 01:46:19,163
- Please move.
- Where the hell are you goin'?

1201
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:20,831
Please move!

1202
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:23,793
Holy shit!

1203
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,961
Wait. Guys, guys. Beat it. Beat it.

1204
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:27,755
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine. It's cool.

1205
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,341
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck?

1206
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,761
Come on, Freddy.
Everything's cool. Everything's fine.

1207
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:37,223
- Wait. Where do you think you're goin'?
- Call EMS. Call EMS.

1208
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:43,229
Come on, fellas. Back up.
Back up. Back up. Back up.

1209
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:47,233
- He can't hear.
- Rubens, take him.

1210
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:51,487
- Hey, hey, it's all right. It's okay. It's
okay. - They blew out his ear.

1211
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,365
It's all right. It's all right! It's okay.

1212
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:56,909
It's okay. Come on.

1213
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:01,455
Go on, Freddy.

1214
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:05,793
Come on inside.

1215
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:11,257
Come on.

1216
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:38,826
So Gary Figgis copped a plea.

1217
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:42,746
Gave up the connection between Ray,
the PDA and the mob.

1218
01:47:42,914 --> 01:47:44,915
There were a shitload of indictments.

1219
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:49,420
And the sheriff, Freddy Heflin-

1220
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:53,299
You know, there's people on both sides
of the river wish he never recovered.

1221
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,385
They cursed the day
he took down Ray Donlan.

1222
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:58,888
But what they don't know, he figured out:

1223
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:00,973
No one is above the law.

1224
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:05,769
Four cops dead,
and one dead cop resurrected.

1225
01:48:05,937 --> 01:48:10,316
Murray "Superboy" Babitch
sits alive and well in a holding cell-

1226
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:13,861
Sheriff Fred Heflin apprehended
Babitch single-handedly.

1227
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:18,115
...he will be recovering the hearing
in his good ear, so that's good news.

1228
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:20,951
Files were seized this morning-

1229
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:24,663
Officer Gary Figgis testified
about mob influence and bribery.

1230
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,916
Three months since the shoot-out
