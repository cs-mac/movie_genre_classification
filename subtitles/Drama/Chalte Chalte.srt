1
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,481
What do you think of my shot?
- Mind-blowing!

2
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:54,820
Appears as if you didn't like it.
- Relax. lt wasn't so great

3
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,220
You haven't won the world cup.
- What do they do with it anyway?

4
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,226
Hi guys! Long time no see!
Where have you guys been?

5
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:05,828
Who's that with Deepak?
- Looks like a girl to me

6
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,327
''Thank you, thank you''

7
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,238
''Hey Deepak, how have you been?''

8
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:22,839
''Meet Aditya. And this is
his beautiful wife, Rashmi''

9
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,243
And that's Vivek;
he's still looking for a girl

10
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:28,845
And meet my fiance ... Sheetal

11
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:32,849
You didn't tell us you got engaged!
- Amazing friend!

12
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,491
''lt happened so quickly,
l didn't even realise it''

13
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:39,264
You never get to realise anything.
- Hold on... please sit down

14
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,532
''She comes here for the first time,
and you guys...''

15
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,863
''Vivek, what's all this about? Salim
called and asked me to get here''

16
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,874
But he didn't tell me any reason.
Would you know why we're meeting here?

17
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,271
He always keeps the reason a suspense.
ls that Salim? Where are you?

18
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:58,279
We've been waiting here for you!
What? Stuck in the traffic?

19
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:02,287
''Hurry up, l say!
What...? All right''

20
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,617
He's still stuck in the traffic.
- That's his usual excuse

21
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:10,290
What book is this?
- A love story

22
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,293
''lf one could have a romance like this
in real life, it'd be terrific''

23
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:19,637
''Deepak, haven't you told her
about Raj's love story?''

24
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:22,307
''No, l didn't get the opportunity.
- You're crazy''

25
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,041
''lf you had told her, she wouldn't
have been talking like this''

26
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:29,906
Are you telling me that a fairytale
romance takes place even in real life?

27
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,911
l don't believe it.
- Decide that after you've heard it

28
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,919
l'll tell you how they met...
- One moment. You've started already!

29
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,918
''Before that, tell her
something about Raj''

30
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,331
''One moment. l'll tell her...
- No, l'll tell her''

31
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:53,338
Raj is from Punjab.
His father has a farm there

32
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,932
So Raj...
- ls a farmer?

33
00:04:56,343 --> 00:05:00,336
''No, Raj wanted to become an engineer.
So he moved to the city''

34
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,042
So Raj is an engineer?

35
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,342
''No, although he came to the city
to learn engineering, he was...''

36
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,955
taken up with the export business.
- And now...

37
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,557
he mustn't be in the exports
business either?

38
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,361
''This Raj of yours...
he does something, doesn't he?''

39
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:20,363
''That's Raj for you. What he
thought about, he never did''

40
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,365
''And what he did,
he never thought about again!''

41
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,391
''Hello, Raj!
- How are you doing?''

42
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,391
Give me that tape-recorder...
- Don't touch it

43
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,987
''l'm playing the music of ''Gadar''
''and Sunny Deol's my favourite hero''

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,401
''Raj, you got here from Bangalore in
just two days instead of three?''

45
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,404
And you take three days
instead of two!

46
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:03,403
Can't help it. My truck stalls
and l get delayed

47
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,343
''So my truck's scrap, eh!
Know what?''

48
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,805
Three girls jumped before my truck
at Pune's check post and said...

49
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,416
brother-in-law's here!

50
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,419
He meets the girls and tells me
that my trucks are junk!

51
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:20,423
''l've fixed new tyres in the truck,
it has a rotary compression engine''

52
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:23,428
So don't use kerosene in it.
Use Castrol lubrication oil

53
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,431
''You don't have any more excuses
to come late, okay?''

54
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,369
''Raj, there's a phone.
- So? What's the matter?''

55
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,695
lt's the owner of Tradelink.
- Tradelink!

56
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:36,032
Pass it to me! Quick!

57
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:53,458
''How could l forget the meeting!
Guys, where are my boots?''

58
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,460
''Must be right there, Raj''

59
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,408
Sonofagun! Stop singing!

60
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,474
The trucks haven't got there yet?
lmpossible. l'll find out right now

61
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,483
Why haven't the trucks
reached there yet?

62
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:30,496
They're at the pump for air...
- l'll shove it all up yours! Morons!

63
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,120
''The trucks will be there, sir.
When? l'll find out from my engineer''

64
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,528
''How long will it take to get ready?
He's asking, you morons!''

65
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,131
lt'll take at least half an hour.
- Half an hour...?

66
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,528
l'm going to beat you guys up!

67
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:13,538
''The truck's there...
Any moment now, sir''

68
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:19,544
''l have a landline to mobile phone.
l'm following it, l sure am''

69
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,478
We must meet at the Oberoi's.
That's where l have my lunch

70
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,552
Damn you! Hurry up!

71
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,833
''l'd like to meet Raj.
- Sure, why not''

72
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,575
Anyone who hears about him
says the same thing

73
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,806
You were telling me
Raj's love story

74
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,508
Now tell me about the girl
in the love story

75
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,810
The girl...?
lt's Priya

76
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:08,191
''Actually, Priya is from Greece.
She was born and brought up there''

77
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,591
''After her graduation, she has
come to lndia, to her aunt''

78
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,601
Her first show was such
a big hit that...

79
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,252
What a difference between
Raj and Priya

80
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,592
How did they meet?

81
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,260
On the highway. During an accident.
- Accident?

82
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:28,266
''Yes, a real accident.
On the way to Mahabaleshwar...''

83
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,942
between Raj's truck
and Priya's car

84
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:09,311
Driver! Can't you drive...?
There could have been an accident!

85
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,711
''lt's your mistake, madam.
lt's such a big truck...''

86
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:18,048
Well? Can't you drive?
What if there was an accident?

87
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,725
Who gave you a licence?
- Licence!

88
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,337
You're talking in English. Do you
think the driver will understand?

89
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,742
''You know Hindi, don't you?''

90
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,762
''Maybe he's a mute, Priya''

91
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:00,026
Raj...
- Shut up!

92
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:05,361
He's not a mute!
You asked me to shut up!

93
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,763
Not you. Him

94
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,777
''You can ask your help to shut up,
you can glare at me...''

95
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:15,379
but you can't say sorry!
You guys are all alike!

96
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:27,391
Look...
- Me? You ought to look...

97
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,392
how you were driving the truck!

98
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,390
Down! Down!

99
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:38,803
''Not down, it's behind
- My car was coming up from behind''

100
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:42,807
l only overtook your truck.
- Your car's going away from behind

101
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,407
''Tell me, where was
my car coming from?''

102
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,406
lt's gone now

103
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:02,822
''You said it was coming from behind,
l said it was moving from behind...''

104
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,829
it's gone

105
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:36,452
''As Salim's bride, you look
just like Anarkali today''

106
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,860
Here's your gift

107
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,860
Well? You seem to be in
a poetic mood today?

108
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,461
''Yes, you do appear changed.
- A double opportunity''

109
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,473
''At a Muslim wedding, l can
get to be poetic...''

110
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,873
and it's about what happened
to me on my way here

111
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,469
What happened on the way?
- An accident with a girl

112
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:57,882
''Really? ls all well?
- All is not well, Salim!''

113
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:02,114
''lt surely is not!
l met the girl, l lost the girl''

114
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,480
l don't know if l will
ever see her again

115
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:09,488
But what a girl!
What a girl...!

116
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,904
''She's the one!
Who's she, Salim?''

117
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,497
Which one?
- ln that white dress!

118
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,006
''That's my friend, Priya.
- Lovely friend, l say!''

119
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,505
She's coming right here. Just ask
her how her journey was

120
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,014
What?
- No questions

121
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,175
''Divorce her, Salim. She asks
many questions. Just ask her!''

122
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,931
''Priya, how was your journey?''

123
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,869
l narrowly missed having a
huge accident with a truck

124
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,941
l even stopped the truck.
But the driver was so weird!

125
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:03,539
''Truck-drivers are an insolent lot.
- No, he wasn't insolent''

126
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,943
''l kept swearing at him,
but he just looked at me''

127
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,955
What happened then?
- As usual...

128
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:15,221
l forgot to use the handbrake
and the car landed in a ditch

129
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:18,957
''He could've stopped your car, l think.
- No...''

130
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,564
he came forward to stop the car.
But l couldn't understand...

131
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,969
and l prevented him.
- So he wasn't bad at heart?

132
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,907
''Yes, that's what l've
been thinking about too''

133
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,978
''l should've said thank you
to him, shouldn't l?''

134
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:35,980
So say it now

135
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,924
Maybe you can't recognise me.
Must l wear a lungi and kurta?

136
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,587
l was the one

137
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,594
''Although he looks like a
truck-driver, he isn't one''

138
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,403
He has a transport business.
- A small one

139
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:05,009
''This is Priya, my special friend.
- l've already met her...''

140
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,406
but it's nice to meet you
all over again

141
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,611
''Let's have a photograph.
- Oh sure, come on''

142
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:15,012
''Sarah, step aside...
over here...''

143
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:24,028
''l was angry then,
but l realised later...''

144
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,429
that l was in the wrong.
- l knew it all the time...

145
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:31,035
that you were in the wrong.
- l said so much to you...

146
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,298
in a fit of anger.
- You said so much!

147
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:34,963
But you were still silent

148
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:40,644
''When you're angry, there's
a strange sparkle in your eyes''

149
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,041
''There really is. You can't notice it,
because you're angry''

150
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,052
And l kept looking at it.
l didn't pay attention...

151
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,646
to what was right or wrong

152
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,650
l seek your forgiveness
for what happened

153
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,657
Saying sorry won't do.
- Then?

154
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,063
You're getting a punishment.
- Punishment?

155
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,070
What punishment?
- Your punishment is...

156
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,674
you're going from Mahabaleshwar
to Mumbai with me tomorrow

157
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,335
ln the truck.
- The truck?

158
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,671
How can l...?
- Don't refuse

159
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,682
''You called me a menace to society,
l really felt bad''

160
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:23,084
l was deeply hurt.
You can't refuse me. Please...

161
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,710
''Sorry, it was a fly''

162
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:57,119
A colourful world...

163
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:01,717
and people from all across

164
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,725
To meet and separate...

165
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:15,735
is part of destiny

166
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:24,142
Witness to games like this...

167
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:32,153
''there's a flutter
in my heart''

168
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,778
''ln a hundred hues, the world
is a unique place to be in''

169
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,781
So don't hold back your heart

170
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,184
''To the land of love,
let's go''

171
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,183
''l'm going there anyway.
So walk with me''

172
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:49,233
''When your scarf flies,
unfurled...''

173
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,232
our path is lit up

174
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,837
''When my scarf flies,
unfurled...''

175
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:00,244
our path is lit up

176
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:04,578
''At every turn,
there's a new story...''

177
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,252
for you and me

178
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:11,248
On our path...

179
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,851
we hum

180
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,862
''The blowing winds
say to us...''

181
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:28,273
''where are you, O travellers?
Come to us''

182
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,868
''To the land of love,
let's go''

183
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:38,282
''l'm going there anyway.
So walk with me''

184
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,308
''O Madhav,
where are you headed?''

185
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,709
l go to where my bride is

186
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:35,339
The clouds meet the mountains...

187
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,934
the bees meet the buds

188
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,947
''The river flows
in gay abandon...''

189
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:54,349
to meet the ocean

190
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,353
Slowly...

191
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,366
slowly...

192
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:06,370
''the songs of love
that flow in the streams...''

193
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:10,374
''make the birds sing
in harmony...''

194
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:14,378
''Tis the season to meet,
listen to what it says...''

195
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:19,978
''To the land of love,
let's go''

196
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:25,389
''l'm going there anyway.
So walk with me''

197
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,454
Get down!

198
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,458
''What's up, constable?
Why did you ask me to stop?''

199
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:37,461
Why? Can't you see the road...?

200
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:40,054
''What happened?
- Nothing, l'll handle it''

201
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:46,061
This is the first time l see a boy
romancing a girl in a truck!

202
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,563
Nice style.
- What style?

203
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,733
The boy will take the girl in whatever
he has. What's your problem?

204
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,779
''l'm not the one with a problem, son.
See that board? What does it say?''

205
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,743
l can't see things at a distance.
- Can't you?

206
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:02,479
l'll tell you. No entry

207
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:07,483
''Get the truck out of here. Go on.
- Two minutes, sir''

208
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:10,494
l'll drop her a bit further
and catch the highway from there

209
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:14,493
''You think traffic laws are a joke?
- Raj, don't worry''

210
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,092
l'll go on my own.
- Hear that?

211
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:20,500
The poor girl says she'll go all alone!
- But l'm here at her service!

212
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,108
Get that truck out of here! At once!
- All right

213
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,509
ls this also a no-bye zone?
Can l at least say bye ? Please?

214
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:29,638
Go ahead

215
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:39,780
This is for you... a sugarcane

216
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,134
What are you standing around for?
Go after the girl

217
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:53,537
''You get that truck out of here.
- Okay, you...''

218
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:08,143
l'll call later

219
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:11,821
l'll call later

220
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:18,556
One moment...
He says he'll phone you later

221
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:22,162
But he didn't even
take my telephone number

222
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,160
You didn't take her number?
- No

223
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:28,162
''So take it!
- Yes, one second''

224
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,575
What are you up to?
- Ask her ... the number?

225
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,578
What's the number?

226
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,185
Talk clearly.
- l did. lt's 3

227
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:51,690
Why're you yelling?

228
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,196
lt's okay

229
00:25:57,203 --> 00:26:00,536
Say bye-bye.
Say bye

230
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,620
That's enough. Go away

231
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,749
What...?

232
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:54,658
''Where have you been, Priya...?
- Auntie! Just try this step!''

233
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,663
You were supposed to be here at noon.
And it's 6 already

234
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,926
Have you ever stolen
sugarcane from the fields?

235
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:06,661
Did you steal this one?
- When did l say...

236
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,673
l stole sugarcane from the fields?
And that the farmer ran after me?

237
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,676
With a huge stick!
- Are you all right?

238
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,679
''Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, aunt. l'm perfectly okay!''

239
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,678
Now go and take a bath.
You look so dirty

240
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:21,275
''All right. But there's water
in the hand-pump, l hope?''

241
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,945
''Yes, there is
Handpump?''

242
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,691
There's water in the shower!
What's gotten into this girl?

243
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,283
She's going to drive me mad some day

244
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,697
Was that Priya's voice?
- She's gone for a bath

245
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,791
l've been waiting for her all day
and you didn't even tell her?

246
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:41,706
''l forgot, son. She was
saying strange things''

247
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,440
l'll go and tell her right now.
- Not you. l'll give her a surprise

248
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:54,713
''The large-hearted men
will leave with the bride''

249
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,322
''Nandu, you're always singing
that song. Sing this one...''

250
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:14,738
Nice song.
- Nice? So sing it

251
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:25,345
''The large-hearted men
will leave with the bride''

252
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:28,749
''You have no hopes, Nandu.
That's the song you will always sing''

253
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:32,355
''l'm happy singing this one.
One life, one girl...''

254
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:36,757
''one love and one song.
- That's my principle, too''

255
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:40,354
''One life, one girl,
one love and one song''

256
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,861
So that's how Raj and Priya met?
- Met?

257
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,065
That was only their first meeting

258
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:54,369
''lf lovers had to meet so easily,
there wouldn't be any love stories''

259
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,374
''When they loved each other so much,
where was the problem?''

260
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:05,384
Where...? Problem was the piece of
paper on which Raj wrote Priya's number

261
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:09,794
This is the limit! You should at
least check before you wash my clothes!

262
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:15,390
Every washerman always checks the
pockets before he washes any clothes...

263
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:18,196
to see if someone has left
some money in it

264
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:21,805
''ln these five years, l couldn't
find a penny in your pockets''

265
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:24,398
And now l've stopped checking.
- Have you?

266
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,412
''Raj, l've made some piping
hot dhokla. Come to our place''

267
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,416
''Sister-in-law, no dhoklas...
Manubhai, ask her to leave''

268
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:37,415
''Go away, Savita. You know what
tension we have here?''

269
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,421
We're trying to find Priya's number

270
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:43,827
Who's that friend Priya has in Pune?
- Farah

271
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,420
Farah! Call her up and
take the number from her

272
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,430
Farah and Salim have
just been married

273
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:51,069
''They're away on a honeymoon,
l don't know where''

274
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,432
What's this? How did my shirt
land in Raj's house?

275
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,841
See? l've been looking for this
shirt and it's lying here!

276
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,107
You're worried about the shirt?
l have a problem. Give me an idea

277
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:06,447
''Your problem, you will solve.
This is what Ganpat does!''

278
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,854
We'd rather hand him to the police.
- Police...?

279
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:26,871
How often will you say that?
A telephone number has eight digits!

280
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,872
lt's difficult for me.
- Why?

281
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:32,872
l'm a traffic cop. l've got to remember
just four digits of a car number

282
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:36,277
So what am l supposed to do?
- Why don't you go to her house?

283
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:41,476
So you're scared of the
girl's father. Aren't you?

284
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,885
l'd be scared if l knew where she
lives. That was our first meeting

285
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,892
''And you're the one who stopped me.
- This sure is a mess, l say''

286
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:53,488
''She surely lives in this area. She
walked home the other day, didn't she?''

287
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,897
You're right. Know what?
We'll ask the betel-leaf seller

288
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:11,915
Tell him.
- l'm looking for a girl

289
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,917
She lives somewhere around.
l'll tell you how she looks...

290
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:20,918
''Tiwari, l'm busy making betel-leaf.
l don't look at girls''

291
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:24,928
You know Laxman?
He still keeps ogling at girls

292
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:28,156
Take him there.
You'll get to know

293
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:31,928
''No, Tiwari. l look only at Radha.
No one else''

294
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:35,537
''Think about it, Laxman! Think!
- Don't be scared of me''

295
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,938
The poor guy's so desperate.
Tell him if you know

296
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,941
But l don't know.
- lt all happened because of me

297
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:44,539
''But l was doing my duty...
and l've said sorry, haven't l?''

298
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:48,949
l have an idea. Postman Ganga
can give you the address

299
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,955
He's right! Let's go

300
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,550
Give me a chocolate.
- Take my heart instead

301
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:05,561
Priya Chopra? There's one Chopra
who lives in Swapnalok

302
00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:08,901
''He has two sons,
but he has no daughters''

303
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,567
''Ganga, there's a Chopra
in Akashganga too, right?''

304
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:14,975
''He has a daughter too, right?
- Yes, doesn't he have a daughter?''

305
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,579
One moment

306
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:23,587
''Rustom, that girl is eight years old.
Eight years''

307
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:26,990
''No, mine is a bit older.
- Older, isn't she?''

308
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,226
There's another Chopra
who has just one daughter

309
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:33,588
But she lives in Australia
with her aunt

310
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,398
That's good!
Priya lives with her aunt too!

311
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:41,004
So tell me the aunt's name.
- Sure. The aunt's name...

312
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:43,601
l don't know.
- He doesn't know

313
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,606
''He doesn't know anything, Tiwari.
How are we going to find her?''

314
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:50,245
''So what are we going to do, Raj?
He doesn't know anything either''

315
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:55,012
''Do what...? Whatever anyone says,
l'm sure...''

316
00:32:55,621 --> 00:33:00,024
''l'll find my Priya.
Aunt, or no aunt''

317
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,620
''How will he find her?
No name, no whereabouts...''

318
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:10,625
he'll find her!
Just like that! ln thin air!

319
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,634
Missing...

320
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:23,047
someone's gone missing

321
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:26,042
where is she?

322
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:40,661
''l was right here,
so was she''

323
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:45,068
''l'm right here again,
but she isn't here''

324
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:47,069
Missing...

325
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,678
''She's beautiful to look at.
She stays somewhere around...''

326
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,685
but she has gone missing

327
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:10,088
''She's a fairy,
an alluring beauty...''

328
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,095
she has gone missing

329
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:19,099
''l look for her with
all my heart and soul...''

330
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:30,705
''l've looked for her all over
the world, l wonder where she is''

331
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:34,117
Missing...

332
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:10,150
O beloved...

333
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,154
''come unto my heart,
O beloved''

334
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:18,754
''l was ignorant
in matters of the heart''

335
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:31,170
''But that girl has
driven me crazy''

336
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:35,770
''Everywhere l look,
l think l see her...''

337
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,515
''it's her face
my eyes see all the time''

338
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,783
''What restlessness is this?
What's all this fuss about?''

339
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,181
Missing...

340
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:27,830
''Take me to that girl
somehow, my friends''

341
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,237
''Give me all the happiness
l've lost''

342
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:44,244
''Show me where she lives
and l'd give up my own house''

343
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:48,847
''lf l meet her now,
l'll take her for my own''

344
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:52,254
''When will the poor man's
desires be fulfilled?''

345
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,253
Missing...

346
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:09,870
''She's beautiful to look at.
She stays somewhere around...''

347
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,873
but she has gone missing

348
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:18,275
''She's a fairy,
an alluring beauty...''

349
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,284
she has gone missing

350
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:26,684
''l look for her with
all my heart and soul...''

351
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:30,885
''l've looked for her all over
the world, l wonder where she is''

352
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:34,294
Missing...

353
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:03,784
''For 20 days, you've
been looking for me?''

354
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:06,589
''Every place, morning and night.
But l've found you at last''

355
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:09,930
Can l ask you out for dinner
and a drive after that?

356
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,166
''l can't go with you, Raj.
- Why not?''

357
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:15,496
l'm going to Athens tonight.
- Athens?

358
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,471
''Participating in the Olympics?
- Stop joking, Raj''

359
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,678
My folks will wait there for me.
- So we'll call make an excuse

360
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,608
No excuse will work.
lt's necessary for me to go

361
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:29,284
What could it be that they can't
manage without you? What?

362
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,116
''l'm getting engaged, Raj.
- All right, so...?''

363
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,211
And l thought you perhaps
like me

364
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:01,885
''Of course l like you, Raj.
And that's why l'm here''

365
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,520
So what's this about an engagement
and wedding? Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,994
How could l? lt was all
decided only last week

367
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,797
Last week?
- Yes

368
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,659
''Papa called to ask whether l could
get engaged, and l agreed''

369
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:24,141
And you agreed to marry a man
you don't even know

370
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:28,009
l'm sure he doesn't even have
a truck driving license

371
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:33,815
''Sameer is a childhood friend, Raj.
l know very well''

372
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,755
How am l to blame if we didn't meet
in our childhood?

373
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,749
But get to know me now.
See what l'm worth

374
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:47,025
Please give me one chance.
You can decide anything after that

375
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:52,367
''Raj, this isn't how one
takes decisions in life''

376
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,706
Nor does one lead his life
the way you think

377
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:59,374
''There's something called commitment.
From London, Paris, America...''

378
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,702
my relatives from all over the
globe are arriving in Athens

379
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,038
''ln fact, they must already
be there by now''

380
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:06,373
''lt's necessary for me
to get there, Raj''

381
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:13,047
And what happens of me?

382
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,827
''You're a very nice boy, Raj.
You'll surely find a nice girl''

383
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:25,393
''l did, but she's talking
about going away too''

384
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,064
To Athens

385
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:48,321
''Raj, l must leave now''

386
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:55,089
Can l drop you somewhere?

387
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,767
You already have

388
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:21,417
''Moti, it happened when
you weren't even born yet''

389
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,722
That is where she lived

390
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:29,129
And this is where l sat
to look at her every day

391
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:36,597
''At the window, at the door,
coming and going''

392
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:42,480
''And one day, she went away
with someone else''

393
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:51,146
''lt was my mistake too.
l wish, l had told her that l...''

394
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,151
maybe...

395
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,863
''When she was leaving as a bride,
everyone sang...''

396
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,833
''The large-hearted man will
take the bride away''

397
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:08,634
l sang with them too

398
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:23,646
Priya's the one who's going to Greece.
Why are you packing your bags?

399
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,979
l'm packing my bags because
l'm going away to Greece too

400
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,849
Stop arguing and pack my bag.
Get on with it!

401
00:42:29,194 --> 00:42:34,188
''lt's Greece, not a suburb where
you can go away in a jiffy''

402
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:38,198
''l have decided. For Priya, l can
reach any part of the globe in a jiffy''

403
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,004
''l've told Vivek, he's bringing
my visa to the airport''

404
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:44,004
Please pack this.
- That's all right...

405
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:47,106
but what are you going for?
- Why? Priya's getting engaged!

406
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:51,609
''You're going to stand in attendance?
- Priya is not yet engaged, okay?''

407
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,941
l don't want to argue with you.
Sister-in-law...

408
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,210
''you see Nandu every day, don't you?
Years ago...''

409
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,887
he didn't stop his girlfriend.
He sits with a bottle and a dog...

410
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:05,561
''and laments every day,
lf only l had stopped her once''

411
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:09,229
''l don't want to say,
lf only all my life''

412
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:12,897
Give me my credit cards.
- Sure... it's in the drawer

413
00:43:13,238 --> 00:43:16,639
lt's my last chance to win Priya.
- You'll end up losing money you saved

414
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:18,966
You're talking like Manubhai now!

415
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:21,711
What will l do with the money
if Priya's not with me?

416
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:25,982
''No, it's not that. The truck
owners association is meeting tomorrow''

417
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:29,718
''You must attend, or they'll
cut off your subsidiary''

418
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:33,512
''Not subsidiary, it's subsidy.
- Right, it'll be cancelled''

419
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:35,917
To hell with the subsidy!
- What rubbish!

420
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:38,252
ls this the way to do business?

421
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:41,592
''Manubhai, l don't know
how business is done''

422
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:44,258
But love surely is done like this

423
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,731
''My foot, love is done like this!
Hear that?''

424
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,903
ls this how love is done?

425
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:04,721
''You?
- Yes, l'm going to Greece too''

426
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:07,081
''l mean, l'm coming.
- Suddenly?''

427
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:10,284
''What can l do, Priya?''

428
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:14,624
''Actually, l heard a love story
when l was a little boy''

429
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:18,969
''The heroine is leaving the hero,
and the hero gives up hope''

430
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:24,640
''All his life, he thinks he should
have atleast tried to stop her''

431
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:26,967
Maybe things would
have been different

432
00:44:28,313 --> 00:44:30,975
''l know, l don't stand a chance...''

433
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:34,683
but l don't want to lament it
all my life

434
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,716
''l've made you see reason, Raj...
- l have seen reason, Priya. l have''

435
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:41,648
But my heart won't

436
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:45,656
Sit down. We're on
the same aircraft now

437
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:57,667
We're together.
- So? What am l to do?

438
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:02,006
l wondered if l could sit here?
- You'll sit on me?

439
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:06,750
''Why would l sit on you, Uncle?
l mean, l have another seat 3C''

440
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:09,076
You see that auntie sitting there?

441
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:14,021
''Over there? l'm not sitting there.
- Please, Uncle...''

442
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:16,827
''l told you, l'm not sitting there.
Go away''

443
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:22,055
Haven't you gone?
- l'm about to

444
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:37,206
''Actually, l wanted to sit
with that girl there''

445
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:40,382
She's a friend.
- So what am l to do?

446
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:46,380
l was wondering if you could sit
there and l could call her over...?

447
00:45:47,392 --> 00:45:50,054
l actually requested that
gentleman so much

448
00:45:50,395 --> 00:45:54,058
But he wouldn't agree.
He's a terribly grumpy man!

449
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:56,993
l know. He's my husband

450
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,768
''The two of you ought to sit together,
isn't it? Husband and wife?''

451
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:07,407
''For a week now, we've been
having a fight''

452
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:31,291
This is terrible!

453
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:45,508
You have a cellphone?

454
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:54,844
''Papa, you know how bad the
weather in Athens is''

455
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,246
The flight is delayed
by eight hours

456
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,854
''Please make everybody
see reason, Papa''

457
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:26,540
''That boy has been playing for so long,
but no one is giving him any money''

458
00:48:27,285 --> 00:48:29,014
Know why?
- Why?

459
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,551
''There's nothing in his music,
his tune, his talent...''

460
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,224
So you know a lot about music?
- Don't you remember Mahabaleshwar?

461
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:44,365
''To the land of love,
let's go...?''

462
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:50,136
You know how well l sing. l'll wake
you up with a song every morning...

463
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:54,741
and put you to sleep with a lullaby.
l'll be your walking-talking radio

464
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:13,124
What an ugly dog! How horrifying!

465
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,592
Exactly. Such a cutely ugly dog

466
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,830
''Oh yes, sweetly ugly''

467
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,140
You like it?
- Yes

468
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:29,136
You want it?
- Yes

469
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,478
May l get it for you?

470
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:02,175
You have amazing aim.
Maybe the cans are at the wrong place?

471
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,981
''No, l was only practicing.
Just watch now''

472
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,119
Go ahead and laugh

473
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,652
''While you aim, l'll have an ice-cream.
- l'll do it right now''

474
00:50:20,665 --> 00:50:22,997
''You can't do it, Raj.
- Of course, l can''

475
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:28,662
''Raj, you can't do it!''

476
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,274
''Raj, you can't do it''

477
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:40,012
l know l can't do it.
But what can l do?

478
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:13,049
ls that true?
- Lies

479
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:15,408
So how did you get this?
- That uncle gave it away to me

480
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:17,720
Just like that?
- Not just like that

481
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:21,252
He gave it away when he saw
how much l love you

482
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:23,617
But l regret...
- What happened?

483
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:27,124
A stranger in an alien land
understands my feelings

484
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:30,059
''But the one who ought to,
does not''

485
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:32,525
''Priya, l have decided.
- What?''

486
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,168
''After our marriage, one meal
l will cook on my own''

487
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:37,872
l'll take care of the kids too

488
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:51,751
l know a bit of homeopathy too.
You'll never have coughs and colds

489
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:54,751
''Your minor ailments,
l'll drive away in a jiffy''

490
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,555
''l am mechanic anyway, right?''

491
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,472
''That woman's wish will
be fulfilled, Raj!''

492
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:22,446
''Funny. Toss a coin in the lake,
get a naked kid to fetch it...''

493
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:26,154
''and your wish will be fulfilled.
- People here believe that, Raj''

494
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,015
Do you believe it?
- Yes. Do you have a coin?

495
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:33,791
''l have a coin of the commission.
Don't lose it, okay?''

496
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:06,626
''Look over there, idiot''

497
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:00,210
Found it!

498
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:11,584
Why did you jump into the water?
- To get the coin

499
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:14,557
l know. But who asked you to?

500
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:17,559
''Your face did.
- l'm not joking, Raj''

501
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:20,564
''Neither am l. The expression on
your face said, ''Raj, take a jump''

502
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:22,702
And Raj took the jump!

503
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,383
''Nice photograph, isn't it?''

504
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:46,389
What did you ask for
at the wishing well?

505
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:49,923
Nothing.
- Oh come on. Tell me

506
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,101
l asked to reach home on time

507
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,103
That?
- Yes

508
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:08,583
Know what l'd have asked for?
- l know

509
00:55:08,953 --> 00:55:11,513
''This is a new one...
- l know, Raj...''

510
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:15,189
Listen to it once...
- l don't want to

511
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,154
Listen Priya...

512
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:22,664
You didn't realise....

513
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:25,468
the crazy lover that l am...

514
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,770
''l had brought to you
my heart as a gift''

515
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:35,973
To the story of my heart...

516
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:41,979
''please listen,
lend me your ear...''

517
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,719
''choose me as your
companion''

518
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,232
You're silent...

519
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:09,064
and l wonder...

520
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:15,669
''how l will tell you
the secret''

521
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:20,073
l could die for you...

522
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:22,749
l speak the truth...

523
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:28,422
''ask for my life,
if you will''

524
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,660
''Please listen,
lend me your ear...''

525
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,297
''choose me as your
companion''

526
00:58:23,414 --> 00:58:25,405
l'm lonely...

527
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,641
you're lonely too

528
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:35,147
''lmagine how would things be,
if we got together?''

529
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:41,624
''Every goal, had we crazy lovers...''

530
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:47,167
to take the caravan of our love...

531
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:53,170
''please listen,
lend me your ear...''

532
00:58:54,178 --> 00:58:58,581
''choose me as your
companion''

533
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:05,979
You didn't realise....

534
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:09,008
the crazy lover that l am...

535
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,948
''l had brought to you
my heart as a gift''

536
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:20,258
To the story of my heart...

537
01:00:21,265 --> 01:00:25,668
''please listen,
lend me your ear...''

538
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:31,270
''choose me as your
companion''

539
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:04,974
''Not to worry, Priya.
l've made all enquiries''

540
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:07,436
Even if the flight is delayed
for another 1 2 hours...

541
01:01:07,778 --> 01:01:09,769
there are several more places
we still haven't seen

542
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:12,980
''Look, l've even got the map.
The nightspots...''

543
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:16,309
lt's very necessary for me
to get home

544
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:19,917
They must all be waiting for me

545
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:24,325
Papa had asked me to reach there
a day or two in advance

546
01:01:25,262 --> 01:01:29,665
lt's all my fault.
l have delayed everything

547
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:37,335
''Don't cry, please''

548
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,336
''You've got to get to Athens, right?''

549
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:43,909
l'll take you to Athens

550
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,744
Just don't cry

551
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:00,458
Not yet. Let me take you home first

552
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:03,089
What time have you got to be there?
- At eleven

553
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,361
l'll take you there by 7:30. C'mon.
- Are you going to drive all night?

554
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:12,164
Won't you be tired?
- Very much

555
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:17,370
''But once l've taken you there,
l'll get all the rest''

556
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:20,372
Let's go

557
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:32,785
We're home?
- Yes

558
01:03:33,457 --> 01:03:34,788
When?

559
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,991
Fourteen minutes ago

560
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:42,531
Why didn't you wake me up?

561
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:47,698
l thought of waking you.
But then l thought...

562
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:51,464
''if l woke you, you'd awaken...''

563
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:55,473
''and had you awoken,
you'd go away''

564
01:03:57,581 --> 01:03:59,572
And if you had gone away...

565
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:02,816
how would l look at you
from so close?

566
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:11,284
''Raj, we have spent very little time
together. But it was beautiful''

567
01:04:12,496 --> 01:04:14,794
So don't say such things
when you're going away

568
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:23,069
l'll get your luggage out

569
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:47,586
Are you keeping my jacket?
- No

570
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:52,859
l have a few things in this.
Look

571
01:04:54,538 --> 01:05:01,205
Our boarding passes from Mumbai.
l'll keep yours

572
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:07,042
And the amusement park tickets.
l'll keep one

573
01:05:10,454 --> 01:05:13,548
The restaurant bills.
l'll keep these too

574
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:20,123
''This coin, you keep''

575
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:22,756
l got it from the lake for you

576
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,907
All this...?

577
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:35,568
When l miss you...

578
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:38,170
l'll have these things

579
01:05:41,485 --> 01:05:43,248
And now for this photo

580
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:48,753
You keep it.
- No

581
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:53,885
We ought to be fair

582
01:05:57,601 --> 01:05:59,933
You keep this part

583
01:06:06,343 --> 01:06:07,833
Priya didi (didi:sister )

584
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,611
''Didi, come!''

585
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:13,143
''Time to go away, isn't it?''

586
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:15,951
''But l had to go away, Raj''

587
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:18,084
True

588
01:06:24,628 --> 01:06:27,028
''Make a wish, Priya.
- What?''

589
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:30,128
Just like that

590
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:36,037
''May you always be happy
in life, Priya''

591
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:42,638
''May you never have to say,
lf only in life...''

592
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,739
like the hero of my story said

593
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:54,049
May you have everything
your heart desires

594
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:02,330
''Remember, Priya. There will be
a man in the world somewhere...''

595
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,657
who will be very happy...

596
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:10,663
because you are happy

597
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,844
''That's it, that's all''

598
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:27,680
Don't ask me to come in

599
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:31,694
l won't be able to refuse you

600
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,754
Nor will l be able
to go in

601
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:43,503
''C'mon, Priya didi... c'mon!''

602
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:56,535
Very fine. Congratulations
on your daughter's engagement

603
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,577
''Thank you.
- Where's she, by the way?''

604
01:08:58,782 --> 01:09:01,114
Where is she?
- She'll be here any moment

605
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:09,114
She's not ready yet?
- She's a girl

606
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:11,784
lt takes time for them
to get ready

607
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,591
''l know l don't
stand a chance, Priya''

608
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:21,794
''But l don't want to say
lf only all my life''

609
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:25,971
''l tried to make you see reason, Raj...
- l see reason, Priya. l see it''

610
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:28,804
But my heart won't

611
01:09:31,648 --> 01:09:33,639
''A stranger in an alien land
understands my feelings...''

612
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:37,614
''but the one who must understand,
won't understand''

613
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:40,218
''Priya, l have decided.
- What?''

614
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:42,614
''After our marriage,
l'll cook one meal for us''

615
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:45,826
l'll look after the kids too

616
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:07,412
''Remember, there will be someone
happy somewhere in the world...''

617
01:10:08,418 --> 01:10:10,249
because you are happy

618
01:10:40,884 --> 01:10:44,183
''Papa, l have something
to tell you''

619
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:25,918
''What is happening, grandma?''

620
01:11:27,664 --> 01:11:30,098
Why have you to think so much?

621
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,930
''You're not going to
do as she says, will you?''

622
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:38,539
Priya's marrying Sameer
and Sameer alone

623
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:42,304
''Auntie, Priya won't be
happy with the marriage''

624
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:45,808
And l understand that pretty well.
- But Sameer...

625
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:52,145
''No, l don't want our marriage
to be based on a compromise''

626
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:59,126
''Sameer, l came here
for the engagement''

627
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:03,956
But how was l to know that
all this would happen on the way?

628
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:12,741
''l understand, Priya.
- You understand nothing, Sameer''

629
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:17,112
And why are you quiet?
You are the bride's father

630
01:12:17,714 --> 01:12:19,147
Say something

631
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:31,989
''My child, are you sure he's a nice
boy and that he'll keep you happy?''

632
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:35,990
Yes.
- Why don't you meet him?

633
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:39,798
What's gotten into all of you?
You even want to meet him now?

634
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:43,668
What's wrong in meeting him?
- He must be in the plane by now.

635
01:12:44,007 --> 01:12:45,998
He left four hours ago

636
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:49,605
''No, aunt. He mustn't have gone away''

637
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:55,773
''Papa, if l know him well,
he must still be waiting for me''

638
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:05,221
May l and stop Raj? Please?

639
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:13,480
''Yours must be the first step
in our house, Priya''

640
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:18,689
What happened?
- One second

641
01:15:19,062 --> 01:15:20,723
l'll go in for a while

642
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:23,731
Something important to do...
l'll be back soon

643
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:27,002
''Don't worry. l'll take you in.
l've married you, after all''

644
01:15:27,337 --> 01:15:28,634
One minute

645
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:46,184
''l'm coming in, Raj.
- Wait...''

646
01:15:50,993 --> 01:15:53,427
Let no one say that we didn't
complete the rituals

647
01:15:54,163 --> 01:15:57,189
''lt's actually meant to be done
by my mother, but right now...''

648
01:16:11,948 --> 01:16:13,210
Red ink

649
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:15,747
Let me do it

650
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:28,019
This is also meant to be done
by someone elderly...

651
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:30,563
''but since l'm doing everything,
this one too...''

652
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:39,308
Now for this ritual.
l don't know who performs it...

653
01:16:39,976 --> 01:16:42,342
but it's performed all right.
l know that

654
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,081
May l come over?
- Please

655
01:16:49,419 --> 01:16:51,910
But mind your step.
Don't slip on the talcum powder

656
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:24,381
''Priya, this is our house''

657
01:17:41,103 --> 01:17:42,297
lt's nice

658
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:50,873
''You're already up, Raj?''

659
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:53,913
l didn't go to sleep all night

660
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,980
And l never got better sleep
than this

661
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:03,320
''What are you wearing, Raj?
- This is Allah Mian''

662
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,721
Allah Mian?
- God

663
01:18:06,062 --> 01:18:08,496
You know Salim?
His mother gave it to me

664
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:15,436
''Know what? Whatever l ask Him for,
He gives it to me''

665
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:18,430
Like you. l have you

666
01:18:20,076 --> 01:18:24,342
''You always carry Him with you?
- Yes, He's always with me''

667
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:30,142
l feel incomplete without Him

668
01:18:32,088 --> 01:18:33,885
Won't you even give Him to me?

669
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,691
One moment

670
01:18:43,366 --> 01:18:47,700
''God, if something
ever happens to me...''

671
01:18:49,171 --> 01:18:50,866
if l'm no more...

672
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,366
do look after my Priya

673
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:57,711
Because even she doesn't know
how much l love her

674
01:18:59,382 --> 01:19:04,376
l love Priya very very much

675
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,691
We'll always remain together Raj

676
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:34,614
l didn't find a love story
like this even in fairytales

677
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:41,422
''Sorry guys, l'm late.
l'm sick of this traffic''

678
01:19:42,425 --> 01:19:45,417
''l told you, you're never on time.
And they...''

679
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:53,963
''Salim, this is my fiancee Sheetal''

680
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:58,229
''This is Salim and that
is his wife, Farah''

681
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,104
We got stuck in the traffic...
- l told him

682
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:06,108
''No, it isn't about that. Actually,
while waiting for you...''

683
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:09,111
l heard a wonderful love story.
- Which one?

684
01:20:09,452 --> 01:20:11,443
Raj and Priya's love-story

685
01:20:16,459 --> 01:20:19,121
l'd like to meet
Raj and Priya some day

686
01:20:19,462 --> 01:20:20,986
Oh certainly

687
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,322
''You're very lucky, Sheetal.
- How come?''

688
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:29,262
Because today is the first wedding
anniversary of Raj and Priya!

689
01:20:35,211 --> 01:20:37,475
lt's their surprise party
we're going to today

690
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:42,874
Sonofagun! Couldn't you tell me
that over the phone?

691
01:20:43,219 --> 01:20:45,881
''lf l told you, the surprise
wouldn't be a surprise anymore''

692
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:48,690
''Let's go, we're getting late.
- But where is the party?''

693
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:51,994
On the terrace of their building.
C'mon

694
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:55,760
''Come, come...''

695
01:20:57,266 --> 01:21:01,862
''Manubhai, why have you brought us here?
- Don't ask, just see what l've done''

696
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:04,832
Now look...
- What will l look at in the darkness?

697
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,835
What's here anyway?

698
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,511
''l'm Sheetal, Deepak's fiance!''

699
01:21:21,624 --> 01:21:24,889
''When they told me about your
love story, l couldn't believe...''

700
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,855
that someone could have a romance
like yours in our times!

701
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:38,336
''Manubhai, this surprise party
is great fun!''

702
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,347
''Quiet, quiet!''

703
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:52,211
''For two hours, this is what
we were talking about...''

704
01:21:52,555 --> 01:21:56,252
''and you want to fight even here!
- Not me, Raj. You want to fight''

705
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:59,960
Priya! You've changed so much
in the past one year

706
01:22:00,362 --> 01:22:03,024
You are the one who has changed?
- Have l?

707
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:05,560
You're fighting with me
on our first wedding anniversary...

708
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:08,233
and you say l've changed?
- Do you think l like fighting...

709
01:22:08,571 --> 01:22:12,735
with you on our first anniversary?
But you're not the man l got married to!

710
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:17,278
You married the wrong man!

711
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,571
Just leave me then!

712
01:22:29,325 --> 01:22:31,316
At least sweeten
each other's tongue first

713
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,392
Your turn. Come on!

714
01:23:07,159 --> 01:23:09,423
Looks like the lady isn't
in a nice mood this morning

715
01:23:09,928 --> 01:23:12,522
You were even late in coming.
ls everything all right?

716
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:15,661
l didn't sleep well last night.
- No? That's nice

717
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:18,128
Were you thinking about me?
- No

718
01:23:19,171 --> 01:23:21,605
l was thinking what a huge
nuisance marriage is

719
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,931
What does it mean?
- Problem if you marry...

720
01:23:24,142 --> 01:23:26,576
problem if you don't.
- What makes you say that?

721
01:23:26,912 --> 01:23:29,813
Look at Raj and Priya. lt was
supposed to be a great love affair

722
01:23:30,148 --> 01:23:32,275
''But what happened?
- Yes, what happened?''

723
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:35,749
Hold on... are you talking
about last night?

724
01:23:38,156 --> 01:23:40,624
Every man and wife have
their share of problems

725
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:42,950
That doesn't mean they aren't
happy with each other

726
01:23:43,195 --> 01:23:45,959
l know Raj.
He loves Priya very much

727
01:23:46,298 --> 01:23:48,994
Loving your wife doesn't
make you a very nice husband

728
01:23:49,334 --> 01:23:52,963
''Really? The way you talk, it seems as
if you've done a Phd on marriages''

729
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:54,636
What?
- You haven't said this...

730
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,637
''to anyone else, have you?
- No''

731
01:23:56,942 --> 01:24:00,571
And please don't!
People will laugh at you

732
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:03,573
Raj and Priya love
each other very much

733
01:24:19,798 --> 01:24:23,529
Raj is always late. He knows
Priya doesn't like it at all

734
01:24:33,812 --> 01:24:36,872
Your son-in-law hasn't arrived yet?
- What can l do?

735
01:24:37,215 --> 01:24:40,878
l asked him before holding a ritual
for their peaceful future

736
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:45,349
But the boys nowadays...!
- Praise the Lord!

737
01:24:48,994 --> 01:24:50,825
His phone's not working

738
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:57,501
See your friend?
He's still missing

739
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:01,462
''He's late, but l'm sure
he'll come''

740
01:25:06,244 --> 01:25:11,045
''My child, the ritual is over
and your husband hasn't arrived?''

741
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:14,716
He has already left the office.
He should be here any moment

742
01:25:15,053 --> 01:25:18,045
lt was necessary for both of you
to be present at this ritual

743
01:25:19,257 --> 01:25:21,418
The auspicious hour has
passed already

744
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,528
We can't wait anymore

745
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:31,861
All right. You may do
as you think fit

746
01:25:33,038 --> 01:25:38,999
We will now pray to God
to bless you both

747
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:54,648
This spinach looks delicious.
And the chickpeas smell great

748
01:25:54,993 --> 01:25:57,723
Nobody makes chickpea
like you do... enough

749
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:00,960
Sit ... down

750
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:07,499
''How will this do, Priya?
l've said sorry, sought forgiveness''

751
01:26:08,006 --> 01:26:10,099
lt's all over...
at least talk to me now

752
01:26:10,342 --> 01:26:13,311
How will it do if you don't talk?

753
01:26:16,348 --> 01:26:20,580
''All right. lf you're not eating
with me, l'm not eating too''

754
01:26:25,323 --> 01:26:29,760
''Priya, talk to me! l told you,
l made a mistake. l'm sorry!''

755
01:26:30,095 --> 01:26:33,326
''You say sorry, but how about the
ritual aunt Anna held for us?''

756
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:35,656
Do you realise how
insulted l felt?

757
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:42,102
l was coming any way.
But Mr Malhotra showed up

758
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:45,001
And you know how important
Mr Malhotra is for our business

759
01:26:45,343 --> 01:26:47,334
l know how important
your business is!

760
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,409
Where was your business when you
followed me all the way to Greece?

761
01:26:51,183 --> 01:26:54,414
lt had to do with love then.
- With love?

762
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:57,051
So where is your love now?
- But we're already married

763
01:26:57,355 --> 01:26:59,550
''What does that mean, Raj?''

764
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:04,624
Just that one marries
the one he loves

765
01:27:04,963 --> 01:27:06,954
''And love is always there,
or why would the marriage be?''

766
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:09,759
''l mean, love goes in a bit of a
background after marriage...''

767
01:27:10,102 --> 01:27:13,367
''You're in love, l'm in love...
we're loved ones''

768
01:27:15,373 --> 01:27:17,364
Shit! What am l saying!

769
01:27:19,077 --> 01:27:22,046
''Priya, listen to me.
That wasn't what l meant to say''

770
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,041
l was confused

771
01:27:24,382 --> 01:27:27,215
''What l meant to say is that after
marriage, one becomes responsible''

772
01:27:27,552 --> 01:27:30,885
So you say you're responsible?
- Hundred per cent responsible!

773
01:27:31,223 --> 01:27:33,123
''You're hundred per cent
responsible, right?''

774
01:27:33,391 --> 01:27:37,191
''This is your shirt, isn't it? But you
took it off and kept it on the sofa''

775
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:40,089
''lf you wished, you could also keep
it with the laundry, couldn't you?''

776
01:27:40,398 --> 01:27:42,730
But you won't.
And your shoes always...

777
01:27:43,535 --> 01:27:44,729
Which shoes?

778
01:27:48,173 --> 01:27:50,198
''What ?
- You just picked them up, didn't you?''

779
01:27:51,276 --> 01:27:54,803
''You just picked them up, didn't you?
- All right, but l picked them up''

780
01:27:55,147 --> 01:27:57,513
Why wouldn't you do it earlier?

781
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,748
''All right, l won't smile! But let's
decide what you're complaining about!''

782
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:08,082
''That l'm late, l didn't get to the
temple, my shoes, my smile...?''

783
01:28:08,426 --> 01:28:11,190
What is it that you complain about?
- l complain about everything you do!

784
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:14,090
''Everything?
- There's a way of living together, Raj''

785
01:28:14,432 --> 01:28:16,832
Now hold on! You're going to
teach me to live together?

786
01:28:17,169 --> 01:28:19,103
The large-hearted one...

787
01:28:19,471 --> 01:28:24,534
Shut up! What silly song is that!
We're have a fight going here!

788
01:28:31,249 --> 01:28:34,116
l'm no kid for you to...

789
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:35,441
Shut up!

790
01:28:36,588 --> 01:28:39,113
''So stop lecturing me, please''

791
01:28:39,457 --> 01:28:41,789
''lt's not wrong to point
someone's mistakes, Raj''

792
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:44,453
Mistakes...?

793
01:28:48,466 --> 01:28:51,629
''You say mistakes, Priya. But it's
not always my mistake''

794
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:54,700
You make mistakes several times
and l still say sorry

795
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,272
So you're saying you're perfect?
- Did l say that...?

796
01:29:01,346 --> 01:29:05,146
''l'm not perfect, Priya. You...
you think Nandu's perfect?''

797
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:08,475
He's not.
None of us is perfect

798
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:13,849
l come back home after
a hard day's work...

799
01:29:14,192 --> 01:29:16,626
l feel like sitting down
and chatting with you...

800
01:29:17,262 --> 01:29:21,494
or the two of us having
a cup of coffee in the balcony

801
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:29,498
You want romance?
And chat with me?

802
01:29:30,242 --> 01:29:31,903
With the tv on ?

803
01:29:34,512 --> 01:29:37,913
''l switched on the tv because...
- That's your daily routine, Raj''

804
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,946
You come home every day
and sit down before the tv

805
01:29:41,286 --> 01:29:43,948
l too want you to talk to me
when you come back home

806
01:29:44,289 --> 01:29:45,984
But you'll never understand...

807
01:29:47,525 --> 01:29:51,359
l've switched off the tv.
So let's talk. Please. Come on

808
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:54,631
What did you do in the office today?
- Let's not talk about the office

809
01:29:55,233 --> 01:29:57,861
Because l'm sick of office-talk
while l'm in the office

810
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:00,999
''When l come back home, l feel like
talking about something else''

811
01:30:01,339 --> 01:30:03,967
But you talk of nothing else Raj.
You begin to watch tv!

812
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:06,743
''But l only catch up with the news!
- News, Cricket match and...!''

813
01:30:07,545 --> 01:30:11,003
''You're right and l'm wrong, okay?
- No, you're not wrong''

814
01:30:11,349 --> 01:30:16,218
''l'm wrong! And l'm sorry!
- Please, Raj! Stop saying sorry''

815
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:19,216
And l'm not going to forget
today's insult ever

816
01:30:19,557 --> 01:30:22,549
What insult?
And l can't even say sorry!

817
01:30:23,295 --> 01:30:25,286
l want to sleep.
- So sleep

818
01:30:25,563 --> 01:30:27,554
Have your food and switch
off the lights

819
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:30,224
Why must l eat? You took away
my plate! And the lights...?

820
01:30:30,568 --> 01:30:33,230
Why must you have everything your way?
The lights are not being switched off!

821
01:30:33,571 --> 01:30:36,563
Let me see who switches them off!
- All right. Let the lights remain

822
01:30:51,589 --> 01:30:54,149
''Milkman, can't you come
a bit early?''

823
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,993
My husband's been pestering
me for tea all morning!

824
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,060
''But l can come only when the
Buffalo starts milking, right?''

825
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:04,266
You have a new excuse every day.
lf you don't come on time tomorrow...

826
01:31:04,602 --> 01:31:08,265
l'll stop your supply and
take milk from the dairy instead

827
01:31:08,606 --> 01:31:10,437
You get that?
- All right

828
01:31:14,312 --> 01:31:16,143
Milk for 2 rupees

829
01:31:17,615 --> 01:31:21,176
''Nandu, have you given up booze
and started drinking milk instead?''

830
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:26,286
Not for me. lt's for Moti.
Can't you see how skinny he's become?

831
01:31:26,624 --> 01:31:27,955
Smell him

832
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:33,731
He's in bad shape.
He needs calcium

833
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:43,603
''Your juice, Raj''

834
01:31:43,641 --> 01:31:45,973
Breakfast is lying on the table.
Have it before you leave

835
01:31:46,644 --> 01:31:48,908
There's no saying when
you'll have lunch anyway

836
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:53,142
''l just scrubbed the floor, Raj.
What are you doing?''

837
01:31:53,585 --> 01:31:56,315
What?
- You've wet the pillow

838
01:31:56,654 --> 01:31:59,179
lt's my pillow.
l use it

839
01:31:59,524 --> 01:32:01,151
And... all right

840
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,822
ls it okay now?

841
01:32:10,468 --> 01:32:12,936
''What's that now?
- You'll wet the bedsheet, Raj''

842
01:32:13,605 --> 01:32:16,665
What arguments do we get
caught up in every morning?

843
01:32:16,941 --> 01:32:19,341
''l haven't started the argument, Raj.
- The way you...''

844
01:32:19,677 --> 01:32:21,804
how will l do any work at
the office in this mood?

845
01:32:22,147 --> 01:32:24,172
Your mood gets spoilt
every now and then

846
01:32:24,682 --> 01:32:27,480
''But naturally, Priya!
lt's because of what you say!''

847
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:30,845
You tell me how to go about
every little thing

848
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:34,352
''This isn't right. Don't keep
the shoe here, someone might trip''

849
01:32:34,692 --> 01:32:38,924
Must l keep the shoes on my head?
How's anyone going to trip on shoes?

850
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:41,490
Do you fall over this ironing board
which is lying here?

851
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,097
Do you fall over the bed?
But you'll trip over the shoes

852
01:32:44,436 --> 01:32:47,371
''You're always picking on my shoes!
- What wrong have l said, Raj?''

853
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:49,696
''l just want some cleanliness
to be maintained, isn't it?''

854
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:53,033
''What's wrong if our house is clean?
- lt's wrong, very wrong!''

855
01:32:53,711 --> 01:32:55,804
l like to have my room littered

856
01:32:56,414 --> 01:32:59,383
''l want one of my shoes to lie here,
and one to lie there''

857
01:32:59,717 --> 01:33:01,514
l want to see who
trips over them!

858
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:04,847
lt's because l'm illiterate!
l'm a bloody bum!

859
01:33:05,256 --> 01:33:08,851
''l like to have my pillow
at my feet, not my head''

860
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:12,060
And these blankets mustn't be
on the bed when l'm about to sleep

861
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:15,524
''And this towel, wherever l take it off
is the right place''

862
01:33:16,668 --> 01:33:20,195
''l agree, l don't know how to live.
l don't know it at all''

863
01:33:20,538 --> 01:33:23,063
Only you know it!
And what can l do?

864
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:25,432
l got married for the first time!

865
01:33:27,512 --> 01:33:29,503
''lt's my first marriage too, Raj''

866
01:33:30,615 --> 01:33:32,845
And throw away that bedsheet too

867
01:34:24,602 --> 01:34:26,263
''What are you doing, Priya?''

868
01:34:28,706 --> 01:34:30,298
People are watching!

869
01:35:13,818 --> 01:35:17,447
''Goodness!
The signs you make...''

870
01:35:18,856 --> 01:35:22,519
they make me crazy about you

871
01:35:24,395 --> 01:35:28,855
What secrets are you exposing...

872
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:34,061
''what are you telling me
with your eyes?''

873
01:35:34,606 --> 01:35:37,871
You do wield all the magic

874
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:42,878
''Goodness!
The signs you make...''

875
01:35:44,115 --> 01:35:48,051
they make me crazy about you

876
01:35:49,687 --> 01:35:54,420
''You are the one who
touches my heartstrings''

877
01:35:54,892 --> 01:35:59,352
Why would anyone meeting you...

878
01:35:59,731 --> 01:36:03,167
not lose her heart to you

879
01:36:30,228 --> 01:36:34,528
''Your lush body,
casts a spell''

880
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:39,527
''Your dense tresses
exude a fragrance''

881
01:36:40,004 --> 01:36:44,634
''On my breath
lingers a scent...''

882
01:36:45,143 --> 01:36:49,341
''because your eyes
are going astray''

883
01:36:49,714 --> 01:36:54,617
''Your body is as beautiful
as the rosegardens...''

884
01:36:55,286 --> 01:36:58,551
''the sight of it
drives me out of my senses''

885
01:36:59,824 --> 01:37:03,954
''Goodness!
The signs you make...''

886
01:37:33,524 --> 01:37:37,790
''An intoxication
is taking over...''

887
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:42,563
l'm barely in my senses

888
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,494
l'm lost to myself too...

889
01:37:48,005 --> 01:37:52,339
''l awake
but l feel as if l'm asleep''

890
01:37:52,677 --> 01:37:57,614
''Keep swaying,
keep melting...''

891
01:37:58,082 --> 01:38:01,540
when you are in my arms

892
01:38:02,854 --> 01:38:06,813
''Goodness!
The signs you make...''

893
01:38:07,825 --> 01:38:11,818
they make me crazy about you

894
01:38:13,131 --> 01:38:18,034
''You are the one who
touches my heartstrings''

895
01:38:18,736 --> 01:38:23,139
Why would anyone meeting you...

896
01:38:23,508 --> 01:38:27,035
not lose her heart to you

897
01:38:28,179 --> 01:38:31,842
''Goodness!
The signs you make...''

898
01:38:32,884 --> 01:38:37,048
they make me crazy about you

899
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:43,250
What secrets are you exposing...

900
01:38:43,995 --> 01:38:48,432
''what are you telling me
with your eyes?''

901
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:52,325
You do wield all the magic

902
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,104
Take care of this small car.
lt might get lost

903
01:39:33,811 --> 01:39:36,439
Let me tell you again. Whenever
l go to your high society parties...

904
01:39:36,781 --> 01:39:40,581
it ruins my mood. Like my small car
here among big ones...

905
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:43,478
l will also feel awkward...
small and out of place

906
01:39:43,821 --> 01:39:45,812
''Not again, Raj! Sameer has
invited us with such a lot of love''

907
01:39:46,123 --> 01:39:49,524
''l know, so you can go ahead. l'll go
to lrfan's garage in the neighbourhood''

908
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:51,852
''Give me a call when the party is
over, l'll come and collect you''

909
01:39:52,129 --> 01:39:54,654
''Raj, does it look nice for me to
go parties alone after my marriage?''

910
01:39:54,999 --> 01:39:58,935
''You're not alone, it's your family,
your friends. What would l do...?''

911
01:40:00,938 --> 01:40:02,803
''Okay, l'm going with you''

912
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:17,143
''Wow! You look extra beautiful
in that sari! What say, Raj?''

913
01:40:20,858 --> 01:40:22,849
You remember we went to Athens
during our vacations?

914
01:40:25,863 --> 01:40:28,161
''Of course, l remember. Know what, Raj?
There was a lovely lake by the house''

915
01:40:28,499 --> 01:40:31,024
ln which Sameer and l went
boating all day

916
01:40:31,369 --> 01:40:36,306
''Remember, Sameer? We insisted with our
parents that we wanted that very house?''

917
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:40,801
l remember. And l've
fulfilled the condition

918
01:40:41,178 --> 01:40:43,669
''You mean, you...?
- l've bought the house''

919
01:40:47,184 --> 01:40:49,982
You must see that house.
lt was beautiful

920
01:40:51,989 --> 01:40:54,048
Why don't you take Raj there
for a holiday?

921
01:40:54,392 --> 01:40:56,383
lt'll be a break
even for you Raj

922
01:41:10,908 --> 01:41:15,072
You talk about this? How about
the Versace suit you're wearing?

923
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:23,478
The girl who marries you
is going to be really lucky

924
01:41:32,029 --> 01:41:34,020
What are you guys playing
the boring couple for?

925
01:41:39,036 --> 01:41:41,231
''Must l ask for permission?
Please let me, sir!''

926
01:42:10,267 --> 01:42:13,759
''How's my suit?
- lt's nice, sir''

927
01:42:14,271 --> 01:42:16,398
l got it stitched during my wedding

928
01:42:19,276 --> 01:42:22,473
''How about my watch?
- lt's nice too, sir''

929
01:42:40,364 --> 01:42:42,662
''Ramji, tell me what price
you're selling ladyfinger for''

930
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,163
10 rupees for a quarter kilo.
- You think we're industrialists?

931
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:53,967
l hope you liked it Rustom Uncle?
- l loved it

932
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:56,302
''Your biscuits were nice
too, sister-in-law''

933
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,971
''They were from my shop.
- This is for you, Radha''

934
01:42:59,316 --> 01:43:02,114
Aunt! What a pleasant surprise!

935
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:05,318
''Do come again, okay?
- Very well. Good bye''

936
01:43:12,329 --> 01:43:13,921
Aunt!

937
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:18,858
''Tell me what you'll have.
Tea, coffee...?''

938
01:43:19,203 --> 01:43:20,761
l don't want anything

939
01:43:21,105 --> 01:43:23,630
Do these people come
even to your house?

940
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:27,143
They hadn't seen me in a
long time and came over...

941
01:43:27,478 --> 01:43:31,005
to ask about my well-being.
But tell me how you have been!

942
01:43:31,348 --> 01:43:33,748
''l'm all right.
- Hello, sister-in-law''

943
01:43:34,085 --> 01:43:36,110
How many eggs?
- 6. Keep them in the refrigerator

944
01:43:38,355 --> 01:43:42,018
''Be careful, don't break the eggs.
- Very well, sister-in-law''

945
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:47,154
''What's happening here, Priya?
Vegetable sellers and egg sellers!''

946
01:43:47,498 --> 01:43:49,489
Are these the only people left
in your life?

947
01:43:50,267 --> 01:43:53,065
''Hello, Lady. Your clothes.
- You got my sari, Ganpat?''

948
01:43:53,404 --> 01:43:55,804
Of course.
- All right. Keep it here

949
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:58,131
l'll take it in later.
- Very well. Good bye

950
01:43:58,375 --> 01:43:59,364
Good bye

951
01:43:59,944 --> 01:44:03,038
Priya! You even know
your laundryman's name?

952
01:44:04,115 --> 01:44:05,104
''Yes, aunt''

953
01:44:05,483 --> 01:44:08,008
What kind of a life
are you leading?

954
01:44:08,385 --> 01:44:13,015
What have you come to?
And l had such dreams for you

955
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:16,848
''There's nothing of the sort, aunt.
l'm very happy here''

956
01:44:17,194 --> 01:44:19,185
l'm starting my work
all over again and...

957
01:44:19,396 --> 01:44:23,196
''Raj is landing a new contract too.
- What new contract, Priya''

958
01:44:23,534 --> 01:44:27,436
''l've been hearing that for ages!
Anyway, l've made up my mind''

959
01:44:27,805 --> 01:44:30,069
l've brought you
two tickets to Greece

960
01:44:30,407 --> 01:44:32,398
Go and have a holiday

961
01:44:33,144 --> 01:44:36,545
''But how can l accept it, aunt?
l'm already married''

962
01:44:36,881 --> 01:44:39,748
Why can't you accept it?
l'm like your mother

963
01:44:40,151 --> 01:44:43,848
And a mother can give her daughter
anything and any amount she wants to

964
01:44:44,188 --> 01:44:46,622
You get that? lt's her right

965
01:44:51,228 --> 01:44:56,427
''The large-hearted one
will leave with the bride...''

966
01:44:58,469 --> 01:45:02,200
''Raj doesn't like my song and...
- No, Nandu. Go ahead and sing''

967
01:45:02,573 --> 01:45:07,442
Can l ? Even in the night?
- You may sing all night

968
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:12,115
So l'm going to sing
for Raj tonight!

969
01:45:12,449 --> 01:45:16,783
''Raj, you sing so well too.
Join me in the nights''

970
01:45:17,254 --> 01:45:20,849
''l'm all alone.
- Some other time, Nandu''

971
01:45:21,192 --> 01:45:23,183
''Tonight, l have a programme
for romance''

972
01:45:23,527 --> 01:45:24,551
Really?

973
01:45:25,529 --> 01:45:28,259
You provide the background music
and l'll get on with the romance

974
01:45:36,473 --> 01:45:38,464
ls this Mr Raj Mathur's house?

975
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:42,603
''Yes, but he's not in right now''

976
01:45:44,248 --> 01:45:47,809
What's the hurry? lt's wonderful
that Raj Mathur is not at home

977
01:45:48,485 --> 01:45:50,817
Let me shut the door...
- You?

978
01:45:51,188 --> 01:45:55,147
l'm your immediate neighbour.
The building opposite yours...

979
01:45:55,492 --> 01:45:59,724
''third floor, third window.
- Oh yes, l've seen you''

980
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,827
And l saw you watching

981
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,829
Know what? l've been waiting
for this opportunity for many days

982
01:46:07,438 --> 01:46:09,497
Frankly speaking... so was l

983
01:46:14,011 --> 01:46:16,502
''What do you mean by ''so was l'' ?
What...?''

984
01:46:16,847 --> 01:46:18,178
l'll explain

985
01:46:18,515 --> 01:46:20,506
What are you doing?
- Taking advantage

986
01:46:20,851 --> 01:46:23,319
What advantage?
- He hasn't any time from his trucks

987
01:46:23,654 --> 01:46:26,589
Lay off! Doesn't he have
to work and make money?

988
01:46:26,924 --> 01:46:30,087
Let him make money. You come inside.
- With a stranger...

989
01:46:30,527 --> 01:46:32,722
''What's all this, Priya?
You're kidding, aren't you?''

990
01:46:34,465 --> 01:46:35,523
Mr Neighbour!

991
01:46:35,866 --> 01:46:39,302
l've never seen you
in this light before

992
01:46:39,637 --> 01:46:42,299
''l'm very happy today, Raj.
- Always be happy''

993
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,540
But not with the neighbour

994
01:46:45,309 --> 01:46:47,300
l've got to give you 2 bits
of good news

995
01:46:47,544 --> 01:46:49,535
Give me the second one first

996
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,878
''Remember, l sent my designs
to an Australian company?''

997
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:55,074
They've approved

998
01:46:56,353 --> 01:46:58,344
And listen to the second
good news

999
01:47:00,257 --> 01:47:02,248
Tickets for Greece. Look

1000
01:47:05,095 --> 01:47:09,555
Tickets for Greece?
You've won a jackpot?

1001
01:47:10,567 --> 01:47:12,797
Aunt Anna gifted it to us

1002
01:47:14,371 --> 01:47:15,565
Aunt Anna?

1003
01:47:16,707 --> 01:47:20,734
''Since we haven't been on a honeymoon,
she asked us to visit Greece, Raj''

1004
01:47:25,482 --> 01:47:29,111
What happened?
- Well... one second

1005
01:47:29,687 --> 01:47:31,587
What happened?
- One second

1006
01:47:32,122 --> 01:47:34,989
''Nothing.
- What happened, Raj? Tell me''

1007
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,351
''Priya, if you don't mind,
let me tell you something''

1008
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:42,998
''We'll surely go to Greece,
but with our own money, okay?''

1009
01:47:43,334 --> 01:47:46,269
''But this is our money too.
- No, it isn't our money''

1010
01:47:46,603 --> 01:47:49,265
lt's Aunt Anna's money.
- But aunt's like our mother too

1011
01:47:49,606 --> 01:47:53,599
''No, Priya. For you, she is.
Not for me''

1012
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:56,875
Why're you making a prestige
issue out of this?

1013
01:47:57,214 --> 01:48:01,173
''C'mon, Priya! lt hasn't to do
with prestige, honestly''

1014
01:48:01,618 --> 01:48:05,281
So what is it?
- What is it?

1015
01:48:06,623 --> 01:48:09,057
l'll tell you what it is

1016
01:48:09,393 --> 01:48:11,987
l've always got the feeling
that your folks...

1017
01:48:12,329 --> 01:48:15,423
are not very happy with our marriage.
That's how l feel

1018
01:48:15,766 --> 01:48:18,564
They probably think that if you
had got married to Sameer...

1019
01:48:18,902 --> 01:48:22,099
he could have given you everything
that l haven't been able to

1020
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:24,703
And that's right too. There's
no question of prestige at all

1021
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:27,840
''Raj, l think you haven't been able
to understand me at all''

1022
01:48:28,212 --> 01:48:30,203
Did l ever say anything
in this regard to you?

1023
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:31,405
No.
- Did l ever complain?

1024
01:48:31,682 --> 01:48:34,810
So why must you misunderstand?
- Don't raise your voice!

1025
01:48:35,953 --> 01:48:37,944
You're the one who doesn't
get it right

1026
01:48:39,523 --> 01:48:41,457
You are the one they want
to send away on a holiday

1027
01:48:41,658 --> 01:48:43,353
You are the one they pity

1028
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,651
You are the one they want to
see happy... not me or us

1029
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:49,793
They've got to tolerate me because
l am unfortunately their son-in-law!

1030
01:48:54,671 --> 01:48:56,662
l don't know why you
take things to such limits!

1031
01:48:57,007 --> 01:48:59,066
You think of things
that make no sense!

1032
01:48:59,410 --> 01:49:03,346
Makes no sense?
For you it must be senseless

1033
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,377
''For me, it's a truth
l feel every day...''

1034
01:49:14,825 --> 01:49:16,850
''May we end this discussion here?
- Yes, please!''

1035
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:25,497
Are you going to sleep?

1036
01:49:45,522 --> 01:49:49,151
''Trouble with Priya again?
- No, no trouble with Priya''

1037
01:49:49,493 --> 01:49:52,189
''No, you do have trouble with her.
- Okay, okay''

1038
01:49:52,529 --> 01:49:55,862
''Last night, l had another
argument with Priya. Happy?''

1039
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,067
Happy my foot!
Now listen to me

1040
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:03,065
''When we buy a new truck, we have
a few problems initially, don't we?''

1041
01:50:03,407 --> 01:50:05,398
What are you talking about?
- Hear me out first!

1042
01:50:05,742 --> 01:50:08,176
''A new truck also stalls
when it heats up, doesn't it?''

1043
01:50:08,512 --> 01:50:10,343
''All right, it does.
- So what do we do?''

1044
01:50:10,547 --> 01:50:12,538
Don't we shut it down
and start it again?

1045
01:50:12,749 --> 01:50:15,411
So there's not much difference
between a truck and marriage

1046
01:50:15,752 --> 01:50:18,550
They ask for a bit of adjustment
which you've got to make...

1047
01:50:18,889 --> 01:50:22,416
and carry the story further. Right?
- How does one take it further?

1048
01:50:23,494 --> 01:50:26,429
Silly arguments! Are marriages
and trucks like each other?

1049
01:50:26,763 --> 01:50:29,197
lsn't it her fault too?
- Now get one thing clearly

1050
01:50:29,533 --> 01:50:32,434
''Between man and wife, never try to
find out who's right and who's wrong''

1051
01:50:32,769 --> 01:50:35,203
Just say sorry and finish
the matter there and then

1052
01:50:35,539 --> 01:50:39,202
That's what l always do.
- l'm prepared to say sorry too

1053
01:50:39,543 --> 01:50:42,774
''l don't like fighting,
l don't want to fight''

1054
01:50:43,347 --> 01:50:45,713
''But the same rule applies
to her also, doesn't it?''

1055
01:50:46,049 --> 01:50:50,486
''Now look, now don't split hair.
l know the problems with you''

1056
01:50:50,888 --> 01:50:53,914
What's my problem? What?
- Want me start counting?

1057
01:50:55,792 --> 01:50:59,023
''l know, Manubhai. There are
problems with me too''

1058
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:02,795
That's exactly why l am asking
you to take my advise

1059
01:51:03,967 --> 01:51:07,459
''What am l to do, Manubhai?
- Go to Priya today...''

1060
01:51:07,804 --> 01:51:10,398
like the perfect husband.
The ideal husband

1061
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:14,802
ldeal?
- Like me

1062
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,945
ls it funny?

1063
01:51:30,827 --> 01:51:35,423
''Priya, l got this gourd,
ladyfinger, carrot...''

1064
01:51:35,832 --> 01:51:40,826
and other stuff from the vendor.
And this one too

1065
01:51:42,839 --> 01:51:47,105
l'll put all this in
the refrigerator

1066
01:51:47,844 --> 01:51:49,505
That is where it is kept

1067
01:51:49,846 --> 01:51:52,178
l bought it all
from the wholesale shop

1068
01:51:52,716 --> 01:51:55,844
The vendor there took me for a fool

1069
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:59,282
''l asked him for the price of carrots
and he says ''30 rupees for a kilo''

1070
01:51:59,556 --> 01:52:03,515
''l asked him to give it at 20 rupees,
or l was leaving''

1071
01:52:04,628 --> 01:52:06,425
He gave it to me at once

1072
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:09,861
How much would you buy it for?
- 10 rupees a kilo

1073
01:52:15,672 --> 01:52:19,199
But this is fresh... and red

1074
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:28,112
''lf there are any chores to
be done, just tell me''

1075
01:52:33,824 --> 01:52:37,692
l'll wash these utensils.
l'm in the mood today

1076
01:52:39,696 --> 01:52:44,065
l forgot to tell you about the office.
Manubhai came calling today

1077
01:52:44,701 --> 01:52:46,692
He had a cup of tea
and went his way

1078
01:52:48,772 --> 01:52:51,570
Mohammadbhai also came calling.
He had a cup of tea and...

1079
01:52:51,908 --> 01:52:54,399
he went his way too

1080
01:52:56,913 --> 01:53:01,316
And then came Vivek.
He asked me for two trucks

1081
01:53:01,652 --> 01:53:04,587
''l said l didn't have two trucks,
they're away for servicing''

1082
01:53:04,921 --> 01:53:08,118
''One had an axle broken,
another's bonnet wouldn't open''

1083
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:11,791
''And l said, l couldn't
give him the trucks''

1084
01:53:12,129 --> 01:53:14,063
l asked him to have a cup of tea...
and go his way

1085
01:53:16,099 --> 01:53:17,930
He went his way too

1086
01:53:18,869 --> 01:53:21,463
Everybody went his way
at the office today

1087
01:53:25,676 --> 01:53:29,942
Where do l keep these utensils?
- Keep it where you picked it up from

1088
01:53:31,615 --> 01:53:33,947
But here...
- They're washed utensils

1089
01:53:36,687 --> 01:53:38,484
l washed them

1090
01:53:38,955 --> 01:53:41,150
So l washed them again!

1091
01:53:41,825 --> 01:53:43,952
These big vessels
get dirty very soon

1092
01:53:44,294 --> 01:53:46,285
One must wash them
as often as one can

1093
01:53:47,798 --> 01:53:51,632
Look at this one...
gleaming!

1094
01:53:51,968 --> 01:53:57,634
''Raj, l know what you're trying to say.
But you needn't do all this''

1095
01:53:57,974 --> 01:54:00,966
That you realise it
is enough for me

1096
01:54:05,982 --> 01:54:08,314
''Go and sit down. Let me warm the food.
- No, we're having carrot halwa''

1097
01:54:08,652 --> 01:54:10,552
with our dinner tonight.
And l'm making it.

1098
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:14,448
Can you?
- But l'll keep trying till you hug me

1099
01:54:14,825 --> 01:54:17,988
And what's so great about carrot
halwa? Grate a bit of carrot and...

1100
01:54:18,762 --> 01:54:20,423
Does it hurt?

1101
01:54:26,737 --> 01:54:29,331
Know what Priya?
lt isn't that finger...

1102
01:54:30,006 --> 01:54:31,997
this is the one l nicked

1103
01:54:32,509 --> 01:54:34,500
l've cut my finger.
Please give me a hug!

1104
01:54:45,789 --> 01:54:46,847
How are you doing?

1105
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:49,181
''Manubhai, coming for
a cup of tea?''

1106
01:54:51,495 --> 01:54:53,793
''Good morning, my foot!
Have you read the newspapers?''

1107
01:54:54,131 --> 01:54:57,157
Why? Has news of your fight with
your wife been printed in it?

1108
01:55:01,772 --> 01:55:04,707
Look at this.
The company you worked for...

1109
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:07,032
has closed down overnight.
lt has gone bust

1110
01:55:09,045 --> 01:55:11,036
What are you talking about?
- Read it

1111
01:55:12,849 --> 01:55:14,942
''Yes, Raj.
We're in serious trouble''

1112
01:55:15,285 --> 01:55:17,845
The bankers called thrice.
They want to see you

1113
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:50,486
How will he be able to repay
2.5 million in a single week?

1114
01:55:50,854 --> 01:55:52,754
l can't do anything about that

1115
01:55:53,089 --> 01:55:56,889
''Mr Mathur, if the bank is not
repaid its dues in a week...''

1116
01:55:57,227 --> 01:56:00,094
we'll have to seize
all your properties

1117
01:56:45,208 --> 01:56:47,802
''Raj, where have you been
all this while?''

1118
01:56:48,144 --> 01:56:51,545
l've told you so often to telephone me
if you're going to be late

1119
01:56:51,882 --> 01:56:53,873
Your telephone in the office
wasn't reachable

1120
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:57,244
l spoke to Vivek and Deepak. Even
they didn't know where you were

1121
01:56:57,921 --> 01:57:01,152
''You know how worried
l get for you, Raj''

1122
01:57:08,832 --> 01:57:10,493
What is the matter?

1123
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:12,628
''What is it, Raj?''

1124
01:57:13,203 --> 01:57:15,171
Tell me what happened

1125
01:57:17,073 --> 01:57:20,167
The company we have most of
our business dealings with...

1126
01:57:20,977 --> 01:57:24,970
has gone bankrupt. With that
goes the money they owed us

1127
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:29,043
You mean...?

1128
01:57:29,386 --> 01:57:33,186
l have bank loans and other
debts to repay...

1129
01:57:35,191 --> 01:57:37,182
l don't know what to do

1130
01:57:38,395 --> 01:57:41,956
Don't be upset. Come and
eat something first. Come on

1131
01:57:42,299 --> 01:57:43,288
No

1132
01:57:46,937 --> 01:57:49,201
Do you want me to
have a word with Papa?

1133
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:52,538
''No, Priya''

1134
01:57:54,978 --> 01:57:57,913
Every decision l have taken in life
has been my very own

1135
01:57:59,215 --> 01:58:01,206
l never sought any help

1136
01:58:01,985 --> 01:58:06,786
''And from this difficult situation,
we will have to find our way out''

1137
01:58:13,096 --> 01:58:17,556
''Don't lose hope, Raj.
The two of us will think of a way''

1138
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:23,234
''You have your Friend with you.
You have faith in Him, don't you?''

1139
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,837
He will help us

1140
01:58:42,192 --> 01:58:45,252
l expected business from your
company and took an extra loan...

1141
01:58:45,395 --> 01:58:48,660
''for two trucks, sir...
- You're getting so worked up...''

1142
01:58:49,265 --> 01:58:52,257
as if it's not my company
but yours that has sunk

1143
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:58,673
''Actually, sir, there is lot of
money your company owes me''

1144
01:58:58,775 --> 01:59:01,938
''No, no... the company
owes you nothing''

1145
01:59:02,278 --> 01:59:07,272
''lt ''owed'' you money. Past tense.
Because the company is no more''

1146
01:59:09,285 --> 01:59:11,845
''But l did my work with
all honesty, sir...''

1147
01:59:12,389 --> 01:59:16,291
Why did you?
Did l ask you to be honest?

1148
01:59:16,826 --> 01:59:21,695
Look at me! My company has sunk!
But have l sunk? No

1149
01:59:21,865 --> 01:59:23,696
Learn something

1150
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,703
''l'm no match for you, sir.
All l want...''

1151
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,976
Now don't bother me. l'm going
away to Europe for two months

1152
01:59:34,444 --> 01:59:36,969
l'm very tired.
l want to relax

1153
01:59:39,315 --> 01:59:43,718
''But yes, l'm thinking of starting
a new company after l return''

1154
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,312
You can meet me then.
l'll do something for you

1155
01:59:47,557 --> 01:59:49,718
''ln the meantime, you can
take a holiday too''

1156
01:59:49,893 --> 01:59:52,726
Where do you folks go?
What do you call that place...?

1157
01:59:52,862 --> 01:59:57,322
''Khandala...? Go to Khandala.
- Thank you, sir...''

1158
01:59:58,535 --> 02:00:02,733
but l don't want to go anywhere.
lt's just that by the time you return...

1159
02:00:03,339 --> 02:00:05,068
the time the bank has given me
will be over

1160
02:00:05,341 --> 02:00:09,334
You're ruining my time
and my mood now

1161
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:14,347
There are many people like you who
are upset at the company going bust

1162
02:00:14,651 --> 02:00:19,350
And l haven't started a charity to
distribute alms to everyone coming here!

1163
02:00:20,356 --> 02:00:23,348
''l'm not asking for alms, sir.
l'm asking for my rights''

1164
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:30,026
Rights? You don't ask for rights!
You only ask for alms

1165
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:33,360
''lf you want your rights,
go to the courts''

1166
02:01:04,701 --> 02:01:08,398
''Raj, have this coffee.
And change your clothes quickly''

1167
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:18,604
''What is the matter, Raj?''

1168
02:01:23,653 --> 02:01:25,416
''What happened, Raj?''

1169
02:01:28,424 --> 02:01:30,415
l... l just felt like crying

1170
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:05,859
''Nothing's working, Manubhai.
l've tried everything''

1171
02:02:06,462 --> 02:02:08,453
We'll have to sell the trucks

1172
02:02:09,966 --> 02:02:12,867
Everything's going to go away.
- No way

1173
02:02:12,969 --> 02:02:16,461
l'll telephone Jignesh right away.
- Why keep calling Jignesh!

1174
02:02:16,606 --> 02:02:19,871
How many people will you talk to?
You spoke to ... Saeed earlier

1175
02:02:20,476 --> 02:02:22,467
Did he give you any money?
Nobody's going to

1176
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:26,107
You've given me so much already.
This chap is cancelling his wedding

1177
02:02:26,482 --> 02:02:29,474
''Everybody's trying his best,
but nothing's happening. Nothing''

1178
02:02:29,586 --> 02:02:34,489
''Look, have patience. Ups and downs
are part of business. Right?''

1179
02:02:34,591 --> 02:02:38,493
''Oh yes, don't lose hope, Raj.
We'll find a way out''

1180
02:02:38,628 --> 02:02:40,493
What way will we find...? What?

1181
02:02:40,663 --> 02:02:43,894
Someone else's company closes down
and the bank holds me by the throat!

1182
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,490
Let me try

1183
02:02:46,703 --> 02:02:50,503
There's another notice from the bank.
- What new notice is this?

1184
02:02:50,807 --> 02:02:53,901
''lt says, you've got to 3.5 million,
not 2.5''

1185
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:58,913
3.5 million? How come?
l've settled it at 2.5 with the bank!

1186
02:02:59,182 --> 02:03:01,514
''Look at how the bankers
are behaving, Manubhai''

1187
02:03:01,684 --> 02:03:03,914
l had a clear understanding
with them that...

1188
02:03:07,924 --> 02:03:10,518
This is a cheque. For 2.5 million

1189
02:03:13,162 --> 02:03:15,926
lt's yours.
- Ours

1190
02:03:16,332 --> 02:03:18,926
Don't worry. l haven't taken it
from Papa. l swear

1191
02:03:19,535 --> 02:03:21,935
Remember my assignment
from the Australian company?

1192
02:03:23,539 --> 02:03:25,700
lt has been approved.
And this is the advance

1193
02:03:26,709 --> 02:03:30,941
''But who'd give 2.5 as an advance...?
- Big folks, big business''

1194
02:03:31,547 --> 02:03:34,539
They have hefty advances too.
They aren't beggars like us

1195
02:03:35,685 --> 02:03:38,552
You can have the money.
l'll manage on credit

1196
02:03:41,224 --> 02:03:43,954
''What a narrow escape! Else,
we'd have lost this office too...''

1197
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:46,961
and we'd sit under the
staircase with our accounts

1198
02:03:52,969 --> 02:03:55,961
''Manubhai, don't drink too much.
- This is my first drink!''

1199
02:03:58,574 --> 02:04:00,974
This is the photograph Raj had
torn up in a fit of emotions

1200
02:04:06,582 --> 02:04:08,573
Why're you roaming around
with the photo?

1201
02:04:09,585 --> 02:04:14,989
l've had to work so hard for Priya...
and the photo's damaged anyway

1202
02:04:27,603 --> 02:04:30,595
''What are you upto, Raj?
What will Priya think?''

1203
02:04:31,107 --> 02:04:34,008
lt's Priya l'm doing it too.
- l see. Go ahead

1204
02:04:35,611 --> 02:04:38,603
''Know what, Manubhai? l'll telephone
Sameer and call him over''

1205
02:04:38,781 --> 02:04:42,012
''All right... who's that?
- Her friend from Europe, remember?''

1206
02:04:42,251 --> 02:04:45,618
''No, he'll find it odd here!
- He'll talk to her...''

1207
02:04:45,955 --> 02:04:48,617
''and she'll be happy. Else,
we keep talking only about the garage''

1208
02:04:49,625 --> 02:04:52,025
''Sameer, this is Raj here.
Where are you?''

1209
02:04:52,628 --> 02:04:56,029
You're so close to our house!
Come over

1210
02:04:57,633 --> 02:05:00,625
''We're having a party,
a small get-together...''

1211
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:03,034
come over. Priya's here too

1212
02:05:04,307 --> 02:05:05,638
Talk to her

1213
02:05:09,779 --> 02:05:13,044
lt's Sameer. l've called him over

1214
02:05:17,653 --> 02:05:20,645
''No, it's a small get-together.
- One moment''

1215
02:05:21,657 --> 02:05:24,057
''Sameer, Priya's busy
for a second''

1216
02:05:28,064 --> 02:05:30,658
''Yes, Sameer. Talk to her''

1217
02:05:34,937 --> 02:05:36,666
Raj insists that you must come

1218
02:05:39,675 --> 02:05:42,166
''And listen, l'm talking to you
from another room now''

1219
02:05:43,079 --> 02:05:46,071
Don't even make the mistake of
telling Raj...

1220
02:05:46,182 --> 02:05:48,082
that you're the one l took
the money from

1221
02:05:48,684 --> 02:05:51,414
''lt should remain between
you and me, Sameer''

1222
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:55,981
Raj mustn't get to know

1223
02:06:10,106 --> 02:06:11,869
l've been talking to Sameer

1224
02:06:16,212 --> 02:06:17,702
''ls there anything you want, Raj?''

1225
02:06:20,183 --> 02:06:21,207
No

1226
02:06:27,723 --> 02:06:30,123
So Sameer was the one
who gave you the money?

1227
02:06:32,728 --> 02:06:36,129
Just tell me whether Sameer
gave you the money or not

1228
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:39,732
''Raj, l...
- Yes, or no!''

1229
02:06:41,737 --> 02:06:42,726
Yes

1230
02:06:43,139 --> 02:06:45,903
Why did you take the money from Sameer?
- Raj...

1231
02:06:46,075 --> 02:06:48,737
Why did you take it from Sameer?
- Talk softly

1232
02:06:48,911 --> 02:06:52,142
We have guests at home.
We'll end up having a drama...

1233
02:06:52,381 --> 02:06:55,748
But we're already part of a drama!
You're worried about the guests?

1234
02:06:56,052 --> 02:06:59,146
l'll show you what a drama is!

1235
02:07:02,758 --> 02:07:05,750
Thanks for coming to the party.
Shut that music!

1236
02:07:08,464 --> 02:07:10,398
Go home. This moment!

1237
02:07:13,436 --> 02:07:14,767
l'm not kidding!

1238
02:07:16,072 --> 02:07:17,334
Go away!
- lt's only 10

1239
02:07:17,406 --> 02:07:20,773
The party at my house is
over at 10. Get going!

1240
02:07:22,778 --> 02:07:25,770
What's gotten into you?
- l'm sorry

1241
02:07:26,182 --> 02:07:29,174
''Before l get nastier, go away.
- All right''

1242
02:07:41,898 --> 02:07:43,798
''The drama is over, okay?''

1243
02:07:44,133 --> 02:07:47,796
''Now tell me, why did you
take the money from Sameer?''

1244
02:07:49,105 --> 02:07:52,438
''You had a bank loan to repay...
you were so upset, Raj''

1245
02:07:52,808 --> 02:07:54,969
And so you took the money
from Sameer?

1246
02:07:55,611 --> 02:07:57,806
''You didn't sleep all nights, Raj.''

1247
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:02,210
Now l won't sleep all my life!
You took money from Sameer!

1248
02:08:02,818 --> 02:08:05,218
What would be the worst
thing to happen? What?

1249
02:08:05,521 --> 02:08:08,820
''Our business would have wound up,
this house would have been sold...''

1250
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:12,223
and we'd have been out on the streets.
But there are millions on the streets!

1251
02:08:12,428 --> 02:08:15,829
''Their life is a struggle, but
they have faith in each other''

1252
02:08:16,165 --> 02:08:19,225
''They trust each other.
- l tried everywhere, Raj''

1253
02:08:19,969 --> 02:08:22,335
l even spoke to the export company

1254
02:08:22,838 --> 02:08:25,636
''But when they didn't give me
any money, l asked Sameer...''

1255
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:27,832
l didn't take a penny
from my own father!

1256
02:08:28,344 --> 02:08:30,972
''l didn't borrow from my relatives,
not even from your father!''

1257
02:08:31,247 --> 02:08:35,240
And you went and begged Sameer?
What will he think?

1258
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:42,256
That it's because of his favours
that l'm so happy and delighted!

1259
02:08:42,391 --> 02:08:45,258
''lt's no favour, Raj.
lt's business''

1260
02:08:45,494 --> 02:08:47,860
''l've got to make garments for him, Raj.
l've only taken an advance''

1261
02:08:50,266 --> 02:08:52,666
Are you going to
teach me business now?

1262
02:08:54,270 --> 02:08:58,263
Does anyone give such a big advance?
And you know why he gave the advance!

1263
02:08:58,407 --> 02:09:00,875
''You know it and l know it,
you will not say it...''

1264
02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:04,270
But l'll tell you!
He gave you the advance...

1265
02:09:04,413 --> 02:09:06,881
because he's still in love with you.
- Raj!

1266
02:09:08,017 --> 02:09:09,882
And you know that he's
in love with you!

1267
02:09:10,019 --> 02:09:11,509
Which is why he gave the money

1268
02:09:13,556 --> 02:09:15,888
You know he loves you
and gave you the money

1269
02:09:16,192 --> 02:09:18,285
Does anyone give such a huge
advance just like that?

1270
02:09:26,302 --> 02:09:29,294
''Priya, Sameer's here.
Welcome, Sameer''

1271
02:09:29,905 --> 02:09:33,306
You're the one we were waiting for.
We were talking about you

1272
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:38,311
lt's your house...
he has brought you flowers!

1273
02:09:40,216 --> 02:09:43,310
''Sorry, l've broken all the bottles.
- What is the matter, Priya?''

1274
02:09:43,419 --> 02:09:45,319
l'll tell you what the matter is

1275
02:09:45,921 --> 02:09:49,322
The truth is that the two of you
have made a fool out of me

1276
02:09:49,925 --> 02:09:52,917
All l want to know is
why you did it?

1277
02:09:53,095 --> 02:09:57,054
''lt's between you and me, Raj. Why
are you dragging Sameer into it?''

1278
02:09:57,233 --> 02:10:02,330
''Don't stand up for Sameer!
Don't... okay, okay, l'm sorry''

1279
02:10:02,638 --> 02:10:06,335
''Do stand up for him! Go ahead!
You're made for each other, right?''

1280
02:10:07,576 --> 02:10:10,636
''She's wearing such a lovely sari,
and look at your suit...''

1281
02:10:10,946 --> 02:10:12,345
Which suit is this?

1282
02:10:12,948 --> 02:10:15,348
''l'm not fighting, l'm only
taking a look at the suit''

1283
02:10:15,951 --> 02:10:17,942
Don't touch me! l'm taking
a look at his suit!

1284
02:10:27,963 --> 02:10:29,453
''What are you talking about, Raj?''

1285
02:10:35,271 --> 02:10:38,365
l've got nothing. You've got the money!
lt's aunt who sends tickets for me

1286
02:10:38,974 --> 02:10:41,966
And your dream of childhood
in Switzerland...

1287
02:10:47,983 --> 02:10:50,383
And there's Sameer
to lend us money

1288
02:10:52,221 --> 02:10:54,382
This is between the two of you.
l must leave

1289
02:10:54,490 --> 02:10:57,391
Where d'you think you're going?
lt's between the two of you!

1290
02:10:57,493 --> 02:10:59,654
Rather l go away!

1291
02:11:00,996 --> 02:11:04,397
''Actually, l'll call a priest and
have the two of you married''

1292
02:11:05,735 --> 02:11:08,397
''Why even call a priest? l know
the rites, l was recently married''

1293
02:11:08,504 --> 02:11:10,995
l remember everything.
Give me your hand...

1294
02:11:12,007 --> 02:11:13,406
''What are you up to, Raj?''

1295
02:11:57,052 --> 02:12:00,044
l'm in love...

1296
02:12:01,056 --> 02:12:04,048
you are in love...

1297
02:12:04,727 --> 02:12:09,460
so what have things come to be?

1298
02:12:12,234 --> 02:12:15,328
l am not unfaithful...

1299
02:12:16,071 --> 02:12:19,063
you are not unfaithful...

1300
02:12:19,742 --> 02:12:25,476
''so why do we hold
so much against each other?''

1301
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:32,485
We were walking together...

1302
02:12:34,723 --> 02:12:39,490
''so what caused these
distances between us?''

1303
02:12:45,601 --> 02:12:48,502
We don't even know...

1304
02:12:50,105 --> 02:12:55,099
where we are headed

1305
02:13:18,801 --> 02:13:23,534
''l'm in love,
you are in love...''

1306
02:13:24,139 --> 02:13:28,132
so what have things come to be?

1307
02:13:29,144 --> 02:13:31,135
l am not unfaithful...

1308
02:13:31,547 --> 02:13:33,538
you are not unfaithful...

1309
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:37,550
''so why do we hold
so much against each other?''

1310
02:13:39,521 --> 02:13:43,548
We were walking together...

1311
02:13:44,393 --> 02:13:48,557
''how have we come to be distanced
from each other?''

1312
02:13:54,169 --> 02:13:56,569
We don't even know...

1313
02:13:57,606 --> 02:14:00,575
where we will go

1314
02:14:22,998 --> 02:14:27,196
''My heart is immersed
in pain...''

1315
02:14:28,971 --> 02:14:32,202
my eyes are filled with tears

1316
02:14:33,509 --> 02:14:37,605
This season of loneliness...

1317
02:14:38,213 --> 02:14:41,614
isolates me from my path

1318
02:14:43,619 --> 02:14:47,612
''We had dreamt of achieving
our goal together''

1319
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:53,228
But our paths are now different

1320
02:14:53,429 --> 02:14:57,627
Even as we walked together...

1321
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:01,631
''l wonder how we
have lost our way''

1322
02:15:15,884 --> 02:15:20,253
''l'm in love,
you are in love...''

1323
02:15:20,589 --> 02:15:24,650
so what have things come to be?

1324
02:15:37,673 --> 02:15:40,665
Look at the lovebirds.
They're at it again

1325
02:15:41,276 --> 02:15:46,680
Their romance is beginning and Raj
and Priya's love is coming to an end

1326
02:15:47,282 --> 02:15:51,685
lt's almost a month now.
- No one knows what caused the trouble

1327
02:15:51,787 --> 02:15:53,687
One moment. l'll explain

1328
02:15:53,956 --> 02:15:55,685
''Radha, come here''

1329
02:15:56,291 --> 02:15:59,954
Let's suppose Radha is Priya
and he's Raj

1330
02:16:00,295 --> 02:16:04,026
Now say something to each other.
Anything... get started

1331
02:16:05,634 --> 02:16:06,692
Go on

1332
02:16:07,302 --> 02:16:10,897
lt's the man who starts it all.
- Why? lt's the woman who starts it

1333
02:16:10,973 --> 02:16:13,703
''A woman speaks only when the man
does something wrong, isn't it?''

1334
02:16:14,043 --> 02:16:16,477
Are you telling me that it's the man
who's always at fault?

1335
02:16:16,645 --> 02:16:19,705
''Whatever, it's the man who
actually starts it all''

1336
02:16:19,815 --> 02:16:22,306
Won't the man react
when his wife keeps nagging him?

1337
02:16:22,484 --> 02:16:26,318
''Don't say anything against women, okay?
- Not against men either, okay?''

1338
02:16:26,622 --> 02:16:28,988
''Because you're a man, you've
got the power to scream at me?''

1339
02:16:29,124 --> 02:16:30,648
And who gave you the
power to scream at me?

1340
02:16:30,826 --> 02:16:33,317
''Enough, enough!
l get it''

1341
02:16:33,829 --> 02:16:35,729
Neither of them are at fault

1342
02:16:36,331 --> 02:16:38,322
They've separated for
no rhyme or reason

1343
02:16:40,335 --> 02:16:44,738
Wash the windshield properly.
lt's the last time

1344
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:49,333
So you've examined the truck?
Tell us if there is a problem

1345
02:16:51,346 --> 02:16:56,340
''Raj, think it over again
with a cool mind''

1346
02:16:56,652 --> 02:16:59,746
''You're not making a mistake by
selling off your trucks, are you?''

1347
02:17:01,657 --> 02:17:04,751
''l know l'm making a mistake, Manubhai.
- So why?''

1348
02:17:05,027 --> 02:17:08,758
l'm making a mistake.
But l have no other choice

1349
02:17:09,364 --> 02:17:12,356
''Unless l return Sameer's money,
l can't have any peace''

1350
02:17:22,878 --> 02:17:26,177
l wish to meet Mr Sameer Arora.
My name is Raj Mathur

1351
02:17:26,315 --> 02:17:28,875
''Mr Mathur, he's in a meeting
right now. Please be seated''

1352
02:17:29,585 --> 02:17:33,043
Tell him Raj Mathur is here.
lt's urgent

1353
02:17:33,288 --> 02:17:36,052
''He's busy in a personal
meeting, Mr Mathur''

1354
02:17:36,191 --> 02:17:38,785
He has told us not to disturb
him for the next half hour

1355
02:17:38,894 --> 02:17:40,384
Please sit down

1356
02:18:35,450 --> 02:18:39,853
''When he's through with his personal
meeting, give him this cheque''

1357
02:18:47,129 --> 02:18:50,121
l'm telling you again.
Keep the cheque

1358
02:18:51,466 --> 02:18:54,867
''You can return it to me later.
- No, Sameer''

1359
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:58,132
My work with the Australian
company has already begun

1360
02:18:58,774 --> 02:19:02,870
''l know that, Priya.
But l'm feeling very strange...''

1361
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:06,204
the way you're returning
this cheque to me

1362
02:19:06,815 --> 02:19:09,477
''For me, it's very important to
return the cheque to you, Sameer''

1363
02:19:09,818 --> 02:19:13,879
''ln fact, l shouldn't have
taken it from you at all''

1364
02:19:15,591 --> 02:19:20,494
''No, Priya. lf a friend doesn't
help a friend, who will?''

1365
02:19:21,630 --> 02:19:25,896
''No, Sameer. lt was my mistake''

1366
02:19:28,136 --> 02:19:32,505
''Before taking the money from you,
l should've considered...''

1367
02:19:33,709 --> 02:19:36,872
how much it would hurt Raj

1368
02:19:46,521 --> 02:19:50,924
lf you think your relations with Raj
will be okay if l take back the money...

1369
02:19:51,193 --> 02:19:54,185
''l'll take it back.
- No, Sameer''

1370
02:19:55,097 --> 02:19:59,932
lt isn't about money.
lt's not money

1371
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:07,939
''l admit, l made a mistake.
But what Raj said and did...''

1372
02:20:08,543 --> 02:20:12,946
no woman can ever tolerate.
She can't ever

1373
02:20:18,754 --> 02:20:22,952
''l had to relieve myself of a burden,
and l've done it''

1374
02:20:36,872 --> 02:20:38,897
Raj is such a fortunate man

1375
02:20:40,876 --> 02:20:42,707
You love him so much

1376
02:20:48,583 --> 02:20:53,987
''Let me drop you home.
- No, Sameer. l'll go on my own''

1377
02:21:04,599 --> 02:21:06,999
''l'm glad you're here, Manubhai.
- What happened?''

1378
02:21:07,135 --> 02:21:11,595
''Raj has been drinking all evening,
talking about Priya. Look''

1379
02:21:16,111 --> 02:21:18,602
Not a word from you.
l'll talk to him

1380
02:21:22,784 --> 02:21:26,413
''Raj, what's up?
stop it now''

1381
02:21:26,621 --> 02:21:28,612
Let me drink this up

1382
02:21:28,690 --> 02:21:29,952
''What happened, Raj?''

1383
02:21:31,126 --> 02:21:36,029
All l want to ask Priya is:
Why did she go to Sameer?

1384
02:21:36,631 --> 02:21:39,623
''They're childhood friends,
we all know that''

1385
02:21:40,035 --> 02:21:45,302
''Raj, you aren't suggesting...?
- What rubbish! No!''

1386
02:21:46,108 --> 02:21:48,042
''l didn't mean that... no, not at all''

1387
02:21:48,143 --> 02:21:51,635
All l want to ask is why
she went to Sameer. That's it

1388
02:21:53,648 --> 02:21:56,640
''You're no longer together,
it could be anything else''

1389
02:21:56,718 --> 02:21:58,652
''What say, Manubhai?
- What anything else?''

1390
02:22:00,055 --> 02:22:04,048
What if she's not with me?
She's still my wife and l...

1391
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:08,660
''Why're you getting sentimental?
- Yes, l'm sentimental!''

1392
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:13,065
''And she knows that too and
despite that, she went there''

1393
02:22:21,009 --> 02:22:23,671
l'll be back in a moment.
- Where to?

1394
02:22:24,012 --> 02:22:27,311
l'll just go and ask Priya
why she went to Sameer

1395
02:22:27,382 --> 02:22:28,679
Listen...

1396
02:22:30,018 --> 02:22:34,216
''You think l'm going to fight with her?
Bansi, get us some more drinks''

1397
02:22:34,689 --> 02:22:37,681
''lf l had to fight, l'd have
given Sameer a punch right there''

1398
02:22:38,693 --> 02:22:41,423
l'm only going to ask her.
Only to ask her

1399
02:22:42,364 --> 02:22:44,491
Go ahead and drink.
l'll be back

1400
02:22:46,701 --> 02:22:48,100
''No, l don't want the car''

1401
02:22:48,236 --> 02:22:50,704
Theirs is a strange love.
l can't understand it

1402
02:22:52,407 --> 02:22:55,433
l think there's going to be a fight

1403
02:22:56,478 --> 02:22:59,208
But l also get the feeling that...

1404
02:22:59,581 --> 02:23:04,143
''since he's meeting her after
many days, they'll get cozy''

1405
02:23:04,486 --> 02:23:06,716
lt'll all be settled.
Take it from me

1406
02:23:07,055 --> 02:23:09,250
''Bansi, get us some glasses''

1407
02:23:19,034 --> 02:23:21,901
''Madam, one Raj Mathur
is here to meet you''

1408
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:26,798
Raj Mathur? At this hour?
Ask him to come tomorrow morning

1409
02:23:27,142 --> 02:23:29,736
''Tomorrow morning? Okay, madam...
- Tomorrow morning, my foot!''

1410
02:23:30,078 --> 02:23:31,739
Give me the phone

1411
02:23:33,482 --> 02:23:36,974
''Aunt, it's Raj.
l want to have a word with Priya''

1412
02:23:37,352 --> 02:23:40,480
You can't meet her at this hour.
ls this any time for decent folks?

1413
02:23:40,822 --> 02:23:45,759
What decent folks? l want to talk
to my wife. Please give her the phone

1414
02:23:47,362 --> 02:23:49,830
l told you once.
You can't meet her. That's it

1415
02:23:50,165 --> 02:23:51,427
What's once...?

1416
02:23:52,767 --> 02:23:54,564
She hung up on me!

1417
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:57,434
l don't need anyone's permission
to meet my wife!

1418
02:23:57,772 --> 02:24:00,206
''What are you doing, sir?
- Please leave''

1419
02:24:00,542 --> 02:24:02,510
l want to see my wife

1420
02:24:16,591 --> 02:24:18,252
''Guard, don't let him get in''

1421
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:21,725
Will l have to take your permission
to meet my wife?

1422
02:24:22,063 --> 02:24:24,588
We have so many problems
only because of you!

1423
02:24:25,534 --> 02:24:27,195
Don't talk like a thug

1424
02:24:27,402 --> 02:24:29,063
You call me a thug!

1425
02:24:29,304 --> 02:24:30,464
''Yes, you're a thug''

1426
02:24:30,805 --> 02:24:33,467
''You're a thug, a ruffian!
- Get the hell out of here!''

1427
02:24:33,808 --> 02:24:35,503
Why're you pushing me?

1428
02:24:35,810 --> 02:24:38,870
What drama is this? Stop it!
Let us sleep!

1429
02:24:39,214 --> 02:24:41,614
Go inside and sleep!
- Stop this drama

1430
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:43,941
Decent folks live here.
- You're decent...

1431
02:24:44,286 --> 02:24:47,619
''because you live in tall buildings?
She calls me a thug, a ruffian!''

1432
02:24:47,956 --> 02:24:50,151
l'm going to beat her up!

1433
02:24:50,592 --> 02:24:51,957
Stop pushing me

1434
02:24:54,996 --> 02:24:57,260
What's the matter?
What racket is this?

1435
02:24:57,599 --> 02:25:00,295
''lt's your son-in-law, the thug.
He's showing his true colours''

1436
02:25:00,635 --> 02:25:02,159
Leave me alone!

1437
02:25:28,863 --> 02:25:31,991
l'll tell the police you are
not letting me meet my wife

1438
02:25:32,334 --> 02:25:34,461
Even the police have arrived!

1439
02:25:34,869 --> 02:25:37,201
Let go of my hand!
l'll report you guys

1440
02:25:37,672 --> 02:25:39,333
Let go of him. Leave him alone.
- Sir...

1441
02:25:39,674 --> 02:25:41,665
l want to meet my wife.
- You get drunk and cause trouble?

1442
02:25:41,876 --> 02:25:42,865
No

1443
02:25:43,111 --> 02:25:45,102
Say whatever you want to
at the police station

1444
02:25:48,617 --> 02:25:52,348
''What are you doing, sir...?
l want to meet my wife''

1445
02:25:52,687 --> 02:25:53,346
Hold it

1446
02:25:55,557 --> 02:25:57,184
Please let him go

1447
02:25:59,761 --> 02:26:01,524
He's my husband

1448
02:26:02,664 --> 02:26:05,292
Your husband?
- Yes

1449
02:26:08,003 --> 02:26:11,700
''All right. l'll let him go,
because you're asking me to''

1450
02:26:12,607 --> 02:26:15,235
You are educated and decent folks

1451
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:18,511
Does it look nice to publicly
behave like a thug ?

1452
02:26:18,847 --> 02:26:21,145
Get in... go on
Get on with your work

1453
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:24,448
lt's a husband-wife quarrel.
Go on

1454
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:57,741
''Go home, Raj. Please''

1455
02:27:00,855 --> 02:27:03,289
''You've made a mockery
of our marriage, Raj''

1456
02:27:04,059 --> 02:27:07,620
lt wasn't my intention
to do that

1457
02:27:08,663 --> 02:27:12,565
All l came to ask you was...

1458
02:27:12,967 --> 02:27:16,300
''and they stopped me.
Called me a thug, a ruffian''

1459
02:27:18,173 --> 02:27:21,142
''l don't know why it happened.
- lt happens all the time, Raj?''

1460
02:27:22,010 --> 02:27:26,447
All the time?
ln Sameer's presence the other day...

1461
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:30,978
''and now, in the presence
of the whole world? Why?''

1462
02:27:32,053 --> 02:27:35,682
Have you ever thought
what l'm going through?

1463
02:27:38,793 --> 02:27:42,388
''l try to do one thing, but l always
end up doing something else''

1464
02:27:43,865 --> 02:27:48,165
''l know that.
l know you very well, Raj''

1465
02:27:49,037 --> 02:27:52,131
But l can't take it anymore.
l can't

1466
02:27:54,776 --> 02:27:58,337
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1467
02:27:59,714 --> 02:28:01,545
we'd better separate

1468
02:28:03,785 --> 02:28:06,015
''Don't say that, Priya''

1469
02:28:06,821 --> 02:28:10,154
''Remember what you once told me, Raj?''

1470
02:28:12,794 --> 02:28:16,355
''ln the world somewhere,
there will be someone very happy...''

1471
02:28:17,031 --> 02:28:20,023
because you are happy
Remember?

1472
02:28:23,838 --> 02:28:26,306
Go on. Go home

1473
02:29:08,950 --> 02:29:14,786
''My child, think again.
lt's a very crucial step''

1474
02:29:15,156 --> 02:29:17,750
And you can't take such decisions
in haste

1475
02:29:18,092 --> 02:29:20,526
''Kishore, what's gotten into you?''

1476
02:29:20,895 --> 02:29:23,887
lf Priya has decided to leave lndia
and go away to Greece...

1477
02:29:24,232 --> 02:29:26,666
she must've thought about it

1478
02:29:27,001 --> 02:29:30,334
You saw the racket
he created last night

1479
02:29:30,805 --> 02:29:31,897
Priya...?

1480
02:29:35,877 --> 02:29:39,108
lt's very difficult for me
to live with Raj

1481
02:29:41,115 --> 02:29:46,382
And it's also difficult for me
to live here and stay away from him

1482
02:30:01,836 --> 02:30:03,827
''What have l gone
and done, Manubhai?''

1483
02:30:04,939 --> 02:30:08,238
What did l set out to do..?
And what did l end up doing!

1484
02:30:08,576 --> 02:30:13,536
That's the trouble with you!
You think after you do!

1485
02:30:17,218 --> 02:30:20,745
What am l to do now?

1486
02:30:21,155 --> 02:30:24,488
What can you do?
You've done what you had to!

1487
02:30:24,826 --> 02:30:28,091
So why're you asking us
what to do? Why ask us!

1488
02:30:28,429 --> 02:30:32,160
After doing everything...
- Calm down

1489
02:30:37,105 --> 02:30:40,700
''Son, let's go home''

1490
02:30:41,309 --> 02:30:44,642
''No, l'm not going home''

1491
02:30:45,046 --> 02:30:46,308
Hear that?

1492
02:30:47,982 --> 02:30:49,973
l feel very lonely there

1493
02:30:51,953 --> 02:30:57,186
Tell me... what should l do?
l don't want to lose her

1494
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:02,855
''Raj, Priya called to say she's
going away to Greece forever''

1495
02:31:03,197 --> 02:31:06,189
She has left for the airport.
The flight leaves at 10:30

1496
02:31:07,068 --> 02:31:10,003
Hear that? What are you
going to do now?

1497
02:31:10,305 --> 02:31:12,205
She's leaving!

1498
02:31:12,907 --> 02:31:15,432
''No, l won't let her go''

1499
02:31:16,744 --> 02:31:18,712
l'm not letting Priya go away

1500
02:32:15,069 --> 02:32:16,798
Where's Priya?
- She has left

1501
02:32:17,138 --> 02:32:18,867
Where?
- She's in there

1502
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,702
''Where to? Where's your ticket?
- Mister, l've got to in''

1503
02:32:22,043 --> 02:32:24,807
''He's not going abroad,
he's going to meet his wife''

1504
02:32:25,146 --> 02:32:26,613
That's not allowed

1505
02:32:29,283 --> 02:32:31,080
Mr Tiwari...
- What happened?

1506
02:32:31,419 --> 02:32:33,410
Priya's going away.
- Where to?

1507
02:32:33,788 --> 02:32:35,449
She's leaving me and going away.
- Don't tell me!

1508
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:38,750
l've got to stop her. Please ask him
to let me go in for five minutes

1509
02:32:39,093 --> 02:32:40,958
Let me talk to him

1510
02:32:41,295 --> 02:32:43,092
''Listen, Yadav''

1511
02:32:49,003 --> 02:32:51,631
''Go on, Raj. Hurry up.
- Just 15 minutes''

1512
02:32:53,107 --> 02:32:55,974
Where are you going...?
- One moment

1513
02:32:56,310 --> 02:32:58,642
Listen...

1514
02:33:03,317 --> 02:33:04,648
Hurry!

1515
02:34:55,229 --> 02:34:56,423
Don't go

1516
02:34:57,565 --> 02:35:01,433
l know l've made a mistake.
Please forgive me

1517
02:35:05,306 --> 02:35:09,675
''Raj, that's just what l was trying
to explain to you last night''

1518
02:35:11,245 --> 02:35:14,043
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1519
02:35:14,448 --> 02:35:16,040
we'd better part

1520
02:35:18,352 --> 02:35:21,253
Whether you take the decision
to separate or l...

1521
02:35:21,589 --> 02:35:25,457
''isn't it one and the same thing?
- No, Priya''

1522
02:35:27,161 --> 02:35:29,152
''l know, l'm the one
who has made a mistake''

1523
02:35:30,464 --> 02:35:33,797
But give me one more chance.
Please Priya

1524
02:35:35,803 --> 02:35:37,668
''Can you be happy without me, Priya?''

1525
02:35:41,275 --> 02:35:43,140
''Maybe not, Raj''

1526
02:35:44,478 --> 02:35:47,811
But it isn't necessary to have
the company of someone you love...

1527
02:35:48,616 --> 02:35:50,675
''for a lifetime, is it?''

1528
02:35:58,259 --> 02:36:02,491
''How many times will you say that, Raj?
How many times?''

1529
02:36:04,498 --> 02:36:08,332
''Don't make it any more difficult
for me to go away, Raj. Please don't''

1530
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:14,499
Maybe this is what was
to come out of our marriage

1531
02:36:23,718 --> 02:36:26,846
''No, Priya. This isn't
the outcome of our marriage''

1532
02:36:33,527 --> 02:36:36,519
''Priya, l've had a dream''

1533
02:36:38,532 --> 02:36:43,526
We have two children.
A son and a daughter

1534
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:47,532
The son is just like you

1535
02:36:48,542 --> 02:36:52,672
He only has a nose like mine

1536
02:36:57,551 --> 02:37:01,647
The daughter is very pretty.
She has your eyes...

1537
02:37:02,423 --> 02:37:05,859
she's very nice too. Like you

1538
02:37:11,666 --> 02:37:13,725
''You're a very nice person, Priya''

1539
02:37:15,369 --> 02:37:17,963
''l could've changed for the
better too, in your company''

1540
02:37:19,273 --> 02:37:21,867
''Don't go away, Priya.
l'll change my ways...''

1541
02:37:23,377 --> 02:37:26,574
''l'm sorry, Aunt Anna''

1542
02:37:32,053 --> 02:37:35,284
l'll even say sorry to Sameer

1543
02:37:37,591 --> 02:37:41,254
''When the children wake up at night,
l'll look after them''

1544
02:37:41,595 --> 02:37:46,157
''l won't give you any trouble.
Please don't go away, Priya''

1545
02:37:47,601 --> 02:37:51,401
''lf you go away,
it'll shatter my dream''

1546
02:37:54,308 --> 02:38:01,077
''Raj, l've had the same dreams.
The same dreams, Raj''

1547
02:38:05,419 --> 02:38:07,910
But reality is otherwise

1548
02:38:14,695 --> 02:38:17,630
O beloved...

1549
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:10,880
''My loneliness, the ache
in my heart, never went away''

1550
02:39:11,485 --> 02:39:14,147
''The whole world
pokes at fun''

1551
02:39:17,591 --> 02:39:21,083
''You and l break up, my love...''

1552
02:39:22,496 --> 02:39:25,488
''like a star breaking away
from the skies''

1553
02:40:21,655 --> 02:40:24,419
''God, if l'm no more...''

1554
02:40:25,559 --> 02:40:27,550
look after Priya

1555
02:40:28,762 --> 02:40:34,029
Because l love Priya
very very much

1556
02:40:48,883 --> 02:40:53,786
''You are bidding me a farewell
and leaving me in God's care''

1557
02:40:54,522 --> 02:40:59,789
But you have broken my heart

1558
02:41:04,565 --> 02:41:08,126
''Broken hearts
are never put together again''

1559
02:41:10,571 --> 02:41:14,268
''You and l breaking up, my love...''

1560
02:41:15,809 --> 02:41:19,802
''like a star breaking away
from the skies''

1561
02:42:01,555 --> 02:42:04,854
''How often have l told you to keep
your shoes at the right place, Raj?''

1562
02:42:27,748 --> 02:42:30,876
''l couldn't go away, Raj.
l couldn't''

1563
02:42:35,155 --> 02:42:39,148
l can't live without you

1564
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:47,057
''l realise, Raj, that l belong here.
ln this house. With you''

1565
02:42:49,670 --> 02:42:54,403
And this talisman belongs
with you

1566
02:43:00,614 --> 02:43:04,175
''The dreams we saw
were the same, Raj''

1567
02:43:05,786 --> 02:43:09,017
And we can fulfill them
only by living together

1568
02:43:44,692 --> 02:43:48,093
''Promise me, Priya.
You will not leave me ever again''

1569
02:43:48,662 --> 02:43:50,789
And you must promise
never to shout at me again

1570
02:43:51,131 --> 02:43:53,622
''When do l...?
All right, l won't''

1571
02:43:53,967 --> 02:43:57,630
But why did you leave me and go away?
- You said such nasty things to me

1572
02:43:57,971 --> 02:44:01,236
''l know, but l went to Aunt Anna's
house to bring you back''

1573
02:44:01,575 --> 02:44:04,476
''Not to bring me back, to fight with me.
- That's what Aunt Anna says''

1574
02:44:05,112 --> 02:44:07,637
That's it! You get wrong
things in your mind!

1575
02:44:07,981 --> 02:44:09,778
l know what's on your mind right now!
- What?

1576
02:44:10,084 --> 02:44:12,109
When l'm picking up the shoes.
- No...

1577
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:16,456
''All right, but did l say anything?
- No, but l understand''

1578
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:18,655
This is love.
- This isn't love

1579
02:44:18,992 --> 02:44:21,517
''Shoes are where shoes should be,
and love is where love is''

1580
02:44:21,862 --> 02:44:25,320
So my love is a shoe?
- That's not what l said

1581
02:44:25,999 --> 02:44:27,330
Don't shout at me.
- Am l shouting?

1582
02:44:27,601 --> 02:44:30,798
You promised you wouldn't shout.
- But l shout to show my love

1583
02:44:31,138 --> 02:44:33,800
That's your way of showing love?
- Yes

1584
02:44:36,009 --> 02:44:38,000
''Shut up, will you?
We're making love''
