1
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,468
Antwerp, 1995

2
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:23,500
She's a cutie. Really.
You'll be happy. I know it.

3
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,714
One thing I can say about myself:
I'm a good judge of people.

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,886
For instance, I can
see that you're nervous.

5
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,556
The first time you came to
the bar, you were nervous too.

6
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,018
I said to myself:
Oops, the silent type.

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,479
An introvert.

8
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,231
Am I right..

9
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,984
or am I right?

10
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,660
Everything will be fine.
As long as you behave.

11
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,372
And produce the money.

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,137
Carnival in hell,
beware of Tinkerbell.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,311
Her name is Bieke.
Go sit next to her.

14
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,357
Go sit next to her. Go on.

15
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,467
Can I see your drawing?

16
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,262
- I'd rather not.
- Bieke.

17
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,854
What's wrong? First time, hey?

18
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,899
I knew it. I'm a
good judge of people.

19
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,151
Bieke!

20
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,454
I want to talk a bit first.

21
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,623
Wouldn't you rather
let me spoil you?

22
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,293
I want to talk a bit first.

23
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,462
About you, about the people
who come here to visit.

24
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,631
My daddy doesn't allow that.

25
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,759
What's that?

26
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,803
Daddy!

27
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey, dude. Hey, what's that?

28
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,520
Damn. He got caught!

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,025
Vincke got caught! Quick!

30
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,903
Quick, hurry! Hurry!

31
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,495
Careful!

32
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,790
No panic!

33
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,501
Follow me!

34
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,171
Put the gun down! Put
the gun down, damnit!

35
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,050
Filthy bastards! Bastard!

36
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,259
Take it easy.

37
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,929
She's coming with
me, you hear? Here!

38
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,765
Take it easy. Let's
not do anything stupid.

39
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,935
Not you.. Not us either.

40
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,188
We go outside together.
Nothing has happened yet.

41
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,940
A lot has happened.

42
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,360
What would you know?
Do you think I'm stupid?

43
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,406
Look at Bieke. She loves you.

44
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,203
You're her father.
She likes you.

45
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,085
- She needs you.
- What would you know?

46
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,382
I'm gonna kill you,
pal. I'm gonna kill you.

47
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,385
- Vincke..
- Shtt, Freddy.

48
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,179
Freddy!

49
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,098
Daddy! Daddy!

50
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,064
Don't move!

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,608
On your knees!

52
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,362
On your knees! On
your knees, now!

53
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,830
- Daddy!
- They're assholes, Bieke!

54
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,999
They're all assholes!

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,587
Daddy! Daddy!

56
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,280
He could have told
us a lot, Freddy.

57
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,533
You know me, Vincke. No risks.

58
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,744
We should have
busted him sooner.

59
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,954
- We had enough.
- I was hoping for more.

60
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,458
Do you think I was the first
one he asked to come up?

61
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,084
Look at it from
the bright side.

62
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,129
One less fatso, and
the girl has been saved.

63
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,495
Vincke? Eric?

64
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,061
Marseilles, five days later

65
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,564
- In Belgium?
- Yes.

66
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,859
There are potential customers,
Angelo. It would..

67
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,863
- ..be an important market.
- Not for me.

68
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,659
Fries, please.

69
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,037
Right away. But you
just ordered some.

70
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,000
What's wrong with you?

71
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,049
Gilles, you'd better
send somebody else.

72
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,135
I'm tired.

73
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,763
Don't start whining
about retirement again.

74
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,685
Angelo, people like
us don't retire.

75
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,690
- I hate Belgium.
- As does everybody.

76
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,693
But you know the
place. That's important.

77
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,449
Don't you have
a brother there?

78
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,994
- You could pay him a visit.
- If he's still alive.

79
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,539
Visit his grave then.

80
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:43,190
THE ALZHEIMER CASE
<font face="Gill Sans Ultra Bold"> Film Courtesy of Gap821 OLIVAR</font>

81
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,938
WELCOME TO ANTWERP

82
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:43,083
Most foreigners only
know Bruges in Belgium.

83
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,502
They talk about
Bruges, Bruges.

84
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,630
But Antwerp is much
prettier, right?

85
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,800
There is more to see
here than in Bruges.

86
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,554
Bruges is a lot smaller too.
It doesn't amount to much.

87
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,182
Most people don't know..

88
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,735
Here you go, Mr. Ledda.
You have room 633.

89
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,030
Is this your first
time in our hotel?

90
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,740
I speak Dutch.

91
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,640
- A bad habit.
- I've got more of those.

92
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,439
And? Alone?

93
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,651
Not anymore.

94
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,246
- Are you Mr..?
- Casoni.

95
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,751
Did you have a good trip?

96
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,717
I've got the files
you asked for.

97
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,469
It's all there.

98
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,058
Excuse me.

99
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,064
Yes, hello?

100
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,775
Yes, I'm working hard on it.

101
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,403
No, he doesn't say much.

102
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,781
And he looks like his head has
been under a tram for two years.

103
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,659
But they must know
what they're doing, no?

104
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,785
Yes.

105
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,082
My customer wants
to know when.

106
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,961
If everything has been
planned well, it'll go fast.

107
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,548
Fast is too slow.
We want to know when.

108
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,431
First I'm going to lay with my
head under a tram for a year or two.

109
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,414
Are you coming to the opening
of the exhibition with me?

110
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,334
No time, honey.
Building permits.

111
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,879
And a meeting in
Brussels. But have fun.

112
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,216
After all, that's what
you married me for.

113
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,679
- A long time ago, yes.
- What's that supposed to mean?

114
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,723
Nothing, Bob,
nothing. See you later.

115
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,395
If it gets too late, I'll have
to spend the night in Brussels.

116
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,817
Okay. But do me a favour.
Buy her a better perfume.

117
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,839
Top nomination
Bob Van Camp

118
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,935
Typical!

119
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,192
Your keys, I bet.
How often did I..

120
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,573
Are you smart? Are
you smart, I asked.

121
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,451
If you're smart,
you know who sent me.

122
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,995
I'm asking you
again. Are you smart?

123
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,167
If you're smart, you'll
also know why I'm here.

124
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,378
Do you know?

125
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,256
Where is it?

126
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,930
Downstairs?

127
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,060
Where is it?

128
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,437
Where is it?

129
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,831
You don't know
who I am, do you?

130
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,210
If that scum
really thinks..

131
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,889
If I give it to you,
will you let me go?

132
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,270
Please.

133
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,525
I swear I won't talk.

134
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,972
Daddy?

135
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,285
Daddy, I'm going
to Katrien's, okay?

136
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,017
Hello, who's speaking?

137
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,477
Yes, it's me.

138
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,775
No, problem
number 1 is solved.

139
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,321
No, you don't have to worry.

140
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,698
Yes, see you soon.

141
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,807
- Yes, Freddy?
- How do you know it's me?

142
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,019
Anybody in their right mind hangs
up after 20 times. What's up?

143
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,230
The big boss needs
us. It's rather urgent.

144
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,151
- You absolutely had to be there.
- I'm on holiday.

145
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,361
Give me ten minutes, okay?

146
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,372
- Never heard of mineral water?
- Mineral water? In the morning?

147
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,125
Definitely not with an eclair.

148
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,256
Shit! Fucking BMW's!

149
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,343
Give way to the right.
Pay some attention.

150
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,387
But it's true, isn't it? They
push you right off the road..

151
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,307
flashing their lights. Made
in Germany and who drives them?

152
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,059
Hair dressers and doorkeepers.

153
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,187
- I'll tap their rear lights.
- No, no.

154
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,689
I'll pee on their
door handle. Yes.

155
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,567
It sticks and
stinks like a hell.

156
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,653
The cheap models
will rust for sure..

157
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,572
but above all: the
insurance doesn't pay.

158
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,284
When you're rear light is broken..
One phone call and it's solved.

159
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,787
You're on the wrong track.
You're punishing the wrong one.

160
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,498
Yeah, yeah. The
insurance, the wrong one?

161
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:32,923
Come on. Very urgent
matter. I'm curious.

162
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,677
- Good morning, chief. Freddy.
- Linda.

163
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:40,389
We don't know much. Mr. Van
Camp didn't come home last night..

164
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,100
and didn't show up at work.

165
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,769
- That's for Missing People.
- The national police has been there yet..

166
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,980
but the lady is a good
friend of the boss.

167
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,731
- Is Van Parys here?
- Yes.

168
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,402
He wants us to investigate
the case very discretely.

169
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,695
Why?

170
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,447
Mr. Van Camp is
quite a big shot.

171
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,325
Director General of
the Planning Department.

172
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,457
Eva, chief Vincke and
inspector Verstuyft.

173
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,377
- Nice to meet you.
- Mrs. Van Camp.

174
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,046
Mrs. Van Camp is a
good friend of my wife.

175
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,967
- Did Linda brief you?
- Yes, well, she told me what she knows.

176
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,054
The car is still in the garage.
It hasn't been used yet. So..

177
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,681
I'm afraid something happened.

178
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,351
Did your husband have a reason
to leave? An argument maybe?

179
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,687
Is this the first time
he's gone overnight?

180
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,106
Verstuyft, let
Vincke do his job.

181
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,109
Look at that car.
Coemans knows the way.

182
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,157
My husband knows
his addresses.

183
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,203
But his work comes first.
He'd never not show up.

184
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,206
- Does he have any problems?
- Problems?

185
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,750
All big construction files
pass through his office..

186
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,212
I can imagine he has
friends, but also enemies.

187
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,130
Can we stick to the facts?

188
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,218
I'll try. Would you rather
do the interrogation yourself?

189
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,930
Or are we going to let our friends
of the national police do their job?

190
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,099
Van Parys, damnit.

191
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,102
A political buddy falls
asleep on top of his mistress..

192
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,688
and all Antwerp
has to act on it.

193
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,066
Van Parys wants to
shag her. Can't you see?

194
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,276
I think he killed her man.

195
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,320
What shall we do?
Search the whole forest?

196
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,322
- Drive, Freddy.
- Wait.

197
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,972
Don't you have
a brother there?

198
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,559
You could pay him a visit.

199
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,328
Paolo?

200
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,374
It's me, Angelo.

201
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,877
Paolo?

202
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,593
Sir? Can I help you? Are
you related to Mr. Ledda?

203
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,261
Distantly.

204
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:31,226
- Has he been here for a long time?
- Yes, yes. Very long.

205
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,229
It went fast. It started..

206
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,148
I know how it starts.

207
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,772
You're right.

208
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,442
Why do you need to know
French for a chief's exam?

209
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,028
To be able to read the menus
in the posh restaurants.

210
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,531
Coemans, shut up!

211
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,035
And stop ogling at Linda, pig!

212
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:36,124
Say, hasn't that file been
handed to Child Welfare?

213
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,169
- I borrowed it for a while.
- Over achiever.

214
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,796
Does Van Parys know about it?

215
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,590
Sometimes one has to
go against the rules.

216
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,094
Do we know anything
about Van Camp yet?

217
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,930
Linda and Coemans
are working on it..

218
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,057
but so far, no news.

219
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,601
I promised Mrs. Van Camp
that we'd have some news.

220
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,728
Freddy, you know somebody
from the national police.

221
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,272
Try to find out something.

222
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,066
Chief, we're working on
something else at the moment.

223
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,526
Bieke Cuypers, I guess?

224
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,988
The file that you requested from
Child Welfare, behind my back.

225
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,991
Sorry, but that case
is closed for us.

226
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,472
Miss Cuypers? Brigitte?

227
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,649
Everybody calls me Bieke.

228
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,445
Are you a friend of daddy?

229
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,241
Are you a friend of daddy?

230
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,837
She's 12, 13 at the most.
Sorry, I'm not doing that.

231
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,632
You're wrong. She looks
much younger than she is.

232
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,471
She's 12, 13 at the most.
Sorry, I'm not doing that.

233
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,433
You already said that.
You're stuck in a groove.

234
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,894
She's still a
child. I won't do it.

235
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,272
If you think you
can do this to me..

236
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,440
you've got another
thing coming!

237
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,318
One phone call! One
phone call to Marseilles!

238
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,822
You don't get it.
Nobody will do it.

239
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,367
Forget it. We'll
find somebody else.

240
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,494
No, you won't!

241
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,290
No? Give me one
reason why not.

242
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,709
I'll give you three.

243
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,753
One!

244
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,755
Two!

245
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,174
And three!

246
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,845
The treasure-chest of your good
friend Bob Van Camp. Understood?

247
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,346
Crazy!

248
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,643
But okay! Did you hire a
bunch of carnival singers?

249
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,692
My customer wants to see you.
Tomorrow. Here, same time.

250
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,697
Don't forget your box.

251
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,867
Your wallet.

252
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,286
Mr. Seynaeve.

253
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,637
Van Camp has just disappeared.

254
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,972
Even his mistress
doesn't know anything.

255
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,059
They check the passenger
lists at the airports.

256
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,561
He fled abroad. Is
that what they think?

257
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,814
Is there any concrete information
or is it occupational therapy?

258
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,777
Concrete information?
Occupational therapy?

259
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,446
Our intellectual legal friend
from the Judicial Police.

260
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:35,614
Commissioner.

261
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:40,577
If you need information,
we're very happy to oblige.

262
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,872
But first send us an
official piece of paper.

263
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:45,582
You're good at
that, aren't you?

264
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,336
Sorry, commissioner. We didn't
know you people could read.

265
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,923
I didn't know you
had to learn to shoot.

266
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,093
And since you have to learn
to shoot, Mr. Verstuyft..

267
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,929
why don't you have
your own shooting range?

268
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,766
Unfortunately, we don't have the
same budgets as the national police.

269
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:08,146
No. It's because 90% of your
budget is spent on paper.

270
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,785
If I used too much paper, you
can come and get some from us.

271
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,328
Marc.

272
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:28,292
- It'll be the night of your life.
- Yeah, yeah, I bet.

273
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,296
A night like you have never had
before in your entire career.

274
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,465
- Some other time, okay?
- Come on. Look here.

275
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,051
Room 105. Perfect
for a hot woman.

276
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:42,181
Excuse me, you're bothering the
lady, the other guests, and me.

277
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,976
And who are you?
Her pimp, maybe?

278
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:51,273
Tell me how much this hot
truffle is going to cost me.

279
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,946
You're looking for
something hot, right?

280
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,627
- A gentleman?
- No.

281
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,672
A customer.

282
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,826
Relax, relax.
You were dreaming.

283
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,789
Don't you know me anymore?

284
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,134
Stay.

285
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,512
Sorry. Stay.

286
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:22,281
- I can hear your blood flow.
- That's my head that's leaking.

287
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,242
You're a character.

288
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:27,995
Can you tell?

289
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,207
I know.

290
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,129
I fancy strange men.

291
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:05,657
Two bullets in the chest, one
in the head. Professional job.

292
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,209
Bastards.

293
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,380
Bastards! Bastards!

294
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,050
And the other wounds?

295
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,429
From the ship propeller. She
must have been mangled by it.

296
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,854
Freddy, make sure you'll
become chief as soon as you can.

297
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,074
So I don't have to do it anymore.
The child

298
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,150
was 12 years old, for
crying out loud!

299
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:45,489
Forensic investigation shows
that the girl is the victim..

300
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,449
of a brutal murder.

301
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,827
Her identity has
now been released.

302
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:54,706
It's 12 year old Brigitte
Cuypers, from Merksem.

303
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:58,377
She was recently involved
in child prostitution.

304
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:02,589
That case also cost
her father his life.

305
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,844
Have I been here
all night? Say it.

306
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:11,014
- Have I been here all night?
- Yes. Where else?

307
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,392
Come on, you have to go.

308
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,061
Get dressed.

309
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:19,773
Sorry.

310
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,692
- Back!
- Yes, but your pills..

311
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,362
Back! You have
to go back! Back!

312
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,123
Shit.

313
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,499
You were right, Gilles.

314
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,088
People like us don't retire.

315
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:01,870
Vincke!

316
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,374
We have a witness.
A hotel guest.

317
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,173
Mister Casoni?

318
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,427
- Your passport.
- Thank you.

319
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,764
Hello. Vincke, chief.

320
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,893
You can speak Flemish, chief.

321
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,021
I'm from everywhere
and nowhere.

322
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,233
This gentleman knows the
identity of the victim.

323
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,571
I just saw him get
in. The poor guy.

324
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,323
His name is Ledda.

325
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:42,369
- Angelo Ledda.
- How do you spell that?

326
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:46,456
Like in the swan,
but with two d's.

327
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,543
That's Greek mythology.
Basic knowledge.

328
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:54,339
- So you know Mr. Ledda?
- Yes. From here, in the bar.

329
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,300
A friendly person.

330
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,428
Retired. A real Frenchman.

331
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,140
This was found
under another car.

332
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:06,018
A credit card to
Angelo Ledda's name.

333
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:09,980
Guys, have a look!

334
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,724
I was waiting for
that. It's not your day.

335
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,976
Baron? It's time.

336
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:53,065
No, that's okay. Joseph
can give the injection.

337
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,359
You guys are good at
that, right, Joseph?

338
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,529
Psychiatrists don't
knock people out all the time, Gustave.

339
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,614
Sometimes we talk
to our patients.

340
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,699
Before or after the injection?

341
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,874
- Baron De Haeck.
- Yes, it's me.

342
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:17,965
Turn on the TV, baron.
Teletext, BRT, page 101.

343
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,094
Mafia crime in Antwerp

344
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,521
What do you think? Say what
you want about those Frenchies..

345
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,232
but when they make a
mistake, they fix it.

346
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,651
With a bulldozer,
if they have to.

347
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,779
You can sleep well, baron.

348
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,699
Don't worry. It's all over.

349
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:47,536
That is, if you
didn't forget about me.

350
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,122
You didn't forget about
me, did you, baron?

351
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,374
Great.

352
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,218
If I may say so..

353
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,181
nothing beats doing business
with an honest person.

354
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,225
Here's our friend Casoni.

355
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:14,104
But according to France,
this is the only Bernard Casoni.

356
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:18,650
Young guy, centre half of
Olympique Marseilles, since 5 years.

357
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:22,446
You see, in our job, it's
better to know your football..

358
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,615
than your Greek mythology.

359
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:27,868
So what do we
know? Angelo Ledda.

360
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,456
Yes, the credit cards are fakes.
In France they don't know him.

361
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,124
- And here?
- Here they do.

362
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,210
The juvenile court
has a file on him.

363
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,087
Unfortunately, this Ledda
has been dead for 40 years.

364
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,006
Let them send it anyway.

365
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,635
- And the woman in the trunk?
- That's Anja Laeremans.

366
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,137
A prostitute,
according to the barman.

367
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,097
No pimp, no criminal record.

368
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,475
Also no family or
friends, unfortunately.

369
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:55,062
- We keep searching.
- Revenge in the prostitutes scene?

370
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,649
And what does an
over achiever think?

371
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:02,569
Yes, yes. Why not?

372
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,948
Maybe the Nijvel
gang is also involved.

373
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,534
Chief? Things are
the way you thought.

374
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,745
The bullets are
from the same gun.

375
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:16,250
The woman has been shot
by the murderer of Bieke.

376
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,098
What's going on?

377
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,453
Problems?

378
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,460
Impossible. You're dead.

379
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,505
No, you're dead.

380
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,705
Two bullets in the chest
and one through the head.

381
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,081
Again.

382
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,834
He isn't cold
yet. Want to feel?

383
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,504
No way.

384
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,940
Stimorol.

385
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,859
He arrives, wants
to open his gate..

386
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,737
the detector has been
sabotaged. He gets out and bam.

387
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,823
Coemans? Did you
give them the car?

388
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,617
Affirmative, chief.

389
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:16,245
I am for 69.

390
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,083
An even sicker mind
than yours, Freddy.

391
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:29,883
Mrs. Seynaeve..

392
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:33,053
chief Vincke and
inspector Verstuyft.

393
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:37,516
We're very sorry, madam.

394
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,520
Life goes on.

395
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:47,359
If you were expecting
tears and a black veil..

396
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,819
I have to disappoint you.

397
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:51,238
But if you have
questions.. Shoot.

398
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,782
Where did your husband come
from at such a late hour?

399
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:57,828
He was gone for business. With
whom and where? I don't know.

400
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:02,124
We don't talk about that.
We don't talk a lot anyway.

401
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,169
I'm not a big talker.

402
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,176
Did your husband receive
any threats in the past?

403
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,677
Not from me.

404
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,805
Did he have enemies?

405
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,474
No.

406
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,102
No, only friends.

407
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,938
My husband had many friends.

408
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,109
What I'm about to
say, sounds harsh.

409
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,905
But we found this in
your husband's mouth.

410
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:36,575
Any idea?

411
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:42,122
No idea. But I'm glad there
still are some honest people.

412
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:48,504
- Or aren't you honest?
- Yes, I am.

413
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:53,634
I am, just a bit
suspicious by nature.

414
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:02,184
If I give it to you,
will you let me go?

415
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,860
I swear I won't talk.

416
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:14,863
If that scum
really thinks..

417
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,548
- Is he inside?
- Yes.

418
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,976
What are you doing?

419
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,812
Good morning to you too, Jean.

420
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:50,649
Didn't you hear?
Seynaeve has been shot.

421
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:52,776
Impossible.

422
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:56,321
Daddy, what on
earth are you doing?

423
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,241
That guy is walking around
outside here. I wish..

424
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,120
'I wish' is for old bags.
A man says: 'I want'.

425
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,423
Don't worry. He
doesn't know me.

426
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,383
All leads stop with Seynaeve.

427
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:19,303
- Says who? Seynaeve?
- Says I.

428
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,190
Bastards.

429
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,067
Fucking bastards.

430
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:04,097
Nothing. We have
nothing, people.

431
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,017
Four murders and all
we have are facts.

432
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,269
We need to connect the facts.

433
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,439
Prostitution. Revenge.

434
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:16,777
But Bieke Cuypers
is child prostitution.

435
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,738
And Anja is hotel
prostitution.

436
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,241
Two totally different scenes.

437
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:25,827
Seynaeve has got nothing
to do with prostitution.

438
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:28,205
He's in another league.

439
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,208
But he's been killed the
same way as Bieke Cuypers.

440
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,001
Not with the same weapon.

441
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,171
Seynaeve's bullets are
of a different calibre.

442
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,049
Hello?

443
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:42,928
Chief? Chief?

444
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,848
Bernard Casoni!

445
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,355
- Is that legal?
- No, it's Japanese.

446
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,358
Vincke.

447
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,864
Did you read the
papers, chief?

448
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,367
The woman in the trunk doesn't
have anything to do with it.

449
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,202
She was an angel.

450
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,956
And you know what happened
and want to help us?

451
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,543
Help you? I'm doing
your job here.

452
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:19,006
Get the scum of the streets,
because you're too slow.

453
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:20,716
I don't have much time left.

454
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,760
And who are the scum?

455
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,680
I can't tell you yet.

456
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:27,931
Then why do you call us?

457
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:32,853
If I can't finish
it, you'll have to.

458
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,983
Do you want the real
bastards behind all this?

459
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:39,610
Yes.

460
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,697
Keep searching and
you'll find them.

461
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:48,285
Unless we find you first.

462
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:50,621
Mr..

463
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:54,291
Ledda?

464
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,795
Well done. You
already know my name.

465
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,422
I do now.

466
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:04,343
Doesn't matter. I
have nothing to lose.

467
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,887
Just my head.

468
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:12,809
Okay, we've got
him. 0475/56.28.36.

469
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,020
Coemans, check with Belgacom.

470
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,523
No need. That's
Seynaeve's number.

471
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,693
Why do these thugs have
a mobile and we don't?

472
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,403
Ledda is our man.

473
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,698
And we still have nothing.

474
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,118
Vincke..

475
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:34,373
remember how Mrs. Seynaeve
was talking about those friends..

476
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,543
and how she reacted to the
money? Can I try something?

477
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,587
If we pressure her a
bit, she'll open up.

478
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,674
You'd like that, wouldn't
you? Her.. naked..

479
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,384
Let me give it a go.

480
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:50,430
- Sorry, Freddy, I can't allow that.
- Vincke, you said it yourself.

481
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,350
Sometimes one has to
go against the rules.

482
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,702
Mrs. Seynaeve?

483
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:23,005
- You almost look like a pro.
- The door was open.

484
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,841
Don't you know a
better way of coming in?

485
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,552
Thanks for letting me see you.

486
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:29,970
Shoot.

487
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:34,391
- Do you know Angelo Ledda?
- No.

488
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:38,770
- Bernard Casoni?
- Big? Blond?

489
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,940
- Dark.
- I know lots of those.

490
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:45,277
But, no, the name
doesn't ring a bell.

491
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,201
He called us on
your husbands mobile.

492
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:56,121
- What do you think about that?
- I should get it disconnected.

493
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,959
- Your act is very impressive.
- I beg your pardon.

494
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,922
Do you think I don't
know why you're here?

495
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,341
- Madam, I'm..
- What did you think?

496
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,219
I should put her
up against the wall?

497
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:14,097
I think you know more
than you're saying.

498
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,183
Oh, you're a real thinker?

499
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:20,395
I thought you were
more about action.

500
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:21,647
Come.

501
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,942
We can make each other happy.

502
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:34,201
Angelo Ledda?

503
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,497
No, never heard of him.

504
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:41,041
But that other name, Casoni..

505
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,670
I overheard that name
once during a phone call..

506
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,172
with De Haeck.

507
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,260
The concrete baron?
The former minister?

508
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,429
You asked for a name,
not a family tree.

509
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:05,649
Come on. Drink up
before it gets too warm.

510
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,321
Never on duty.

511
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,792
Fucking Belgian cop.

512
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:30,674
Vincke!

513
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,887
We have a name. Compliments
of Mrs. Seynaeve.

514
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,889
- De Haeck.
- Minister of State?

515
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,682
His son. Jean De Haeck.

516
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,475
He resigned last month..

517
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,519
as Director General of
the Planning Department.

518
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,147
Who was his successor?
Bob Van Camp.

519
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,025
- Fireworks?
- I think so.

520
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,402
Where does he live?

521
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,144
No, go on. They'll call back.

522
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:29,858
Blackmail. That's it.

523
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:33,111
For years, Van Camp has been
missing out on all these goodies.

524
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,863
They all go to big
shots, like Jean De Haeck.

525
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:37,282
Then he discovers
De Haeck's weak spot.

526
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,201
Children. Bieke Cuypers.

527
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:41,995
He's not answering. Again.

528
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:45,165
Van Camp blackmails De Haeck and
steals his promotion from him.

529
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,049
Sorry.

530
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,557
Hello?

531
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,726
Yes, hello?

532
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,938
I lost him. Who would
dig a tunnel here?

533
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:48,562
Verstuyft. Put him through
and record the call, okay?

534
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:49,855
Ledda.

535
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,068
Chief? About our agreement.

536
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:59,281
- Agreement?
- Get the scum of the streets.

537
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:03,202
Bieke Cuypers,
12. Was she scum?

538
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,248
That was a shame.
But not my doing.

539
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:11,001
They should keep their
filthy hands off children.

540
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:12,961
Why should I believe you?

541
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,465
Because I'm helping you.

542
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,635
I'm giving you the
bastards, for free.

543
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:22,804
Stop it and let's work
together. We can..

544
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:23,972
Too late.

545
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,770
About five minutes. You
people are really too slow.

546
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:34,149
- Who?
- Somebody called De Haeck.

547
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:35,901
Jean De Haeck.

548
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,781
Nobody will miss him.
I didn't miss him.

549
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:44,743
Nice talking to you, chief.

550
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:45,994
Till the next one.

551
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,624
Ledda is with De
Haeck. He killed him.

552
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:54,211
Immediate assistance.
Merodelaan 2.

553
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,182
Down, Freddy.

554
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:16,460
Come!

555
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:55,290
Vincke?

556
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:07,970
I feel for you, chief.

557
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:10,806
All that ugliness,
all those corpses.

558
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,853
And every day you take
the filth home with you.

559
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,438
My house is empty. That helps.

560
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:21,775
Vincke?

561
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,865
Damn!

562
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:33,203
Is he a good shot, Mr. Vincke?

563
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:38,041
Ledda, put your weapon
down! Weapon down!

564
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:42,171
If he's good, you only
need to do one step aside.

565
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:45,799
- But you know that.
- Come on, Vincke. One step.

566
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:49,178
One step and I blow
his head off. Vincke?

567
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,556
Or are you afraid, Mr. Vincke..

568
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:55,434
that the truth will go
into the grave with me?

569
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:57,996
The suspect is using a
grey Mercedes, IAM 469.

570
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:02,000
He's extremely dangerous. I
repeat: extremely dangerous.

571
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:06,421
All information has been passed to the
national police and the teams on the road.

572
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:11,009
Couldn't you do one
step to the side?

573
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,846
He's our only witness. Sorry.

574
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:43,041
Hey, you. Are you going
to live here?

575
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,966
It won't get any greener.

576
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:57,931
Sorry, I haven't been
drinking. I fell asleep.

577
00:59:58,599 --> 00:59:59,766
Your lights too?

578
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,857
Your lights,
fallen asleep too?

579
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,987
That's better, isn't it? This way
you can find your papers.

580
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:17,910
Car registration, identity
card, driving license.

581
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:24,416
What's that, pal?

582
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:28,545
Damn!

583
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:52,903
Lemmens, what are
you doing here?

584
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,572
Okay. It's the judicial guy.

585
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:58,408
What's this? The
invasion in Normandy?

586
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:03,413
- Is the baron being threatened?
- We give no details.

587
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,959
- Why are you here?
- We give no details.

588
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,378
- Is the baron home?
- Yes.

589
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:15,092
Lord, give all our enemies
true peace and love..

590
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,553
forgive them for
all their sins..

591
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:22,015
and protect us against
their ambushes. Amen.

592
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:24,476
Baron?

593
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:28,897
Chief Vincke of
the Judicial Police.

594
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:36,613
Mr. De Haeck, I have
some bad news for you.

595
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:39,324
I've already heard, gentlemen.

596
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:44,663
Many people care about me.

597
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,835
Joseph Vlerick, psychiatrist.
And here as a friend.

598
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,631
I know this is not
the best moment.

599
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:58,385
We think the murderer
knew your son.

600
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:01,722
Do you know if your son
received any threats?

601
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,850
Not that I know. He was
an honest civil servant.

602
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,939
Can I ask why the national
police are protecting you?

603
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,691
That's between me and them.

604
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,027
If you're threatened
yourself..

605
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,654
I can't help you,
you can't help me.

606
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,615
If you want to pray
with me, you're welcome.

607
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:24,661
Otherwise, please leave
the chapel. I lost a son.

608
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:33,629
For you.

609
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,300
Verstuyft. Yes, Coemans?

610
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:40,969
What happened?

611
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:46,767
Vincke, it's closed off here.

612
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:51,438
We think we know
who's behind it.

613
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:55,317
We've been after him for a
while. He killed Jean De Haeck..

614
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:57,444
a couple of hours ago.

615
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:01,448
- Do you have any proof?
- We're almost certain.

616
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:04,952
You want us to pass the
investigation over to you.

617
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:08,205
Forget it, Vincke.
They're my men.

618
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,003
I'd like to know what's
happening with the baron.

619
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:17,047
I can't say a word about it.

620
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,134
I'll be clear: I want
to see your files..

621
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,679
I advise you to do
the same with ours.

622
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,597
Vincke, I'll be clear too.

623
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:28,851
I don't need an intellectual
loudmouth like yourself.

624
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,813
Let's agree on this: you find
your murderer, we find ours.

625
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,065
If it's the same
one, we'll call you.

626
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:38,277
- For the group picture.
- De Keyzer..

627
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:41,572
you're a pain in the ass.

628
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:57,754
If you had let me do my
work, he would still be alive.

629
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:31,181
Excuse me.

630
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,602
I thought I heard
someone say 'come in'.

631
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:42,818
Mister prosecutor, what
do we owe the honour to?

632
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,072
The honour is ours, Vincke.

633
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,617
You had a run-in with the
commissioner, yesterday?

634
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:55,789
- Yes, that's correct.
- You called him a pain in the ass?

635
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:01,420
Yes, something
to that effect.

636
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,092
I would like you to
apologise, Vincke.

637
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,603
My apologies..

638
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,731
- ..pain in the ass.
- Vincke!

639
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:23,442
I can't continue to
ignore your arrogance.

640
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,110
You meddle with
their operations..

641
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,405
you request files, on the
basis of wild assumptions.

642
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:30,407
It's normal for him to
ask for an explanation.

643
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:33,952
Excuse me, he didn't
ask for an explanation.

644
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,246
On the contrary, he
wanted to get rid of us.

645
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:39,082
This is the wild assumption.

646
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,835
The bullet that killed the
national police officer..

647
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:45,339
comes from the weapon
of our main suspect.

648
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,092
So it is a bit our
business, I guess.

649
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:58,143
That's new to
me. I think we..

650
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:00,938
I think it's best
to keep this quiet.

651
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:03,815
The media will call it
obstruction of the investigation..

652
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,235
the national police
are hiding evidence.

653
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,403
What do you think, prosecutor?

654
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:18,580
I expect your file
on my desk at 9 am.

655
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,209
Yes, and a copy on this desk.

656
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,216
Bieke Cuypers,
12. Was she scum?

657
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:32,845
That was a shame.
But not my doing.

658
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:36,098
They should keep their
filthy hands off children.

659
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:39,601
'Keep their filthy
hands off children'

660
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,229
That tells me that..

661
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:44,648
Ledda found out
about the child abuse..

662
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:47,276
and turned against his
client, Jean De Haeck.

663
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,695
And the baron
with his protection?

664
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:54,449
Nice talking to you,
chief. Till the next one.

665
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,911
He'll be next. I'm certain.

666
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,581
He's involved, but
how do we prove it?

667
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,833
- Ledda says..
- Ledda says, Ledda says..

668
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,793
I can sing along
with that tape by now!

669
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,172
You know what?
Have fun with him..

670
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,007
and let him go..

671
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,217
until all of Antwerp
is in the freezer.

672
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,345
Do you think I have any
sympathy for that bastard?

673
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:20,142
My sympathy is here
and nowhere else.

674
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:24,229
Without Ledda we're nowhere.
I want all the bastards.

675
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:27,107
Tell that to the
children of the policeman.

676
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,444
Chief? I have the file from
the juvenile court..

677
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,363
on Angelo Ledda who has
been dead for 40 years.

678
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:38,118
I'm afraid he's still
a little bit alive.

679
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:39,494
Here.

680
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:44,458
Five times in juvenile
court, one burglary..

681
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,335
four cases of violence.

682
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,838
Died with his father in a
house fire at the age of 17.

683
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:55,260
Juicy detail: It was suspected
that Angelo lit the fire himself.

684
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:57,513
His first murder.

685
01:08:57,804 --> 01:09:01,725
Another spicy detail:
Angelo has a brother.

686
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,478
Paolo Ledda. I've
got the address here.

687
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:06,563
A bar in the Kerkstraat.

688
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:09,858
Right now, he
lives in St. Ursula.

689
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:13,362
Linda, Coemans,
search that bar.

690
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:17,115
- We're going to his brother.
- Bring some grapes.

691
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,667
I don't know.

692
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:30,003
It's only a
drawing. It could be.

693
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,717
The chaplain. He'll
know more about it.

694
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:37,427
He had him in his class.

695
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:40,013
Paolo, having visitors?

696
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:44,852
Chief Vincke. I'm
investigating Angelo Ledda.

697
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:48,355
Angelo? What
good does that do?

698
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,112
Man, stuffy! Jesus.

699
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,948
It's been empty for
months but have a look here.

700
01:10:05,831 --> 01:10:07,666
His father's house.

701
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,171
Get a search
warrant for that too.

702
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:28,103
I always said that Angelo
should be three classes up.

703
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,440
- Highly gifted?
- Incredible memory.

704
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:34,610
And not really a bad boy.

705
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,570
He did everything
for everybody.

706
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:41,283
Sometimes something stupid happened,
somebody calling him 'lice head'..

707
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:44,119
or kicking his shins..

708
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:45,370
then he'd go ballistic.

709
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:01,136
I was sorry for the Ledda's.

710
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,014
The mother died young,
and the father..

711
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:07,684
Sometimes they fell off
the stairs, understand?

712
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:17,569
During medical checks, they
sometimes found something.

713
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:20,447
Sexual abuse?

714
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,825
I don't know a thing about it.

715
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:33,645
Linda, never mind
the search warrant.

716
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:41,153
Vincke! Ledda. Telephone.

717
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:51,997
Vincke.

718
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,751
Are you all right, chief?

719
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,794
I'm fine, yes.

720
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:02,257
That policeman..
Sorry, it was him or me.

721
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,761
- Next time it's you.
- The shooter.

722
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:10,682
I went on a family visit.

723
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,018
Somebody called Paolo.

724
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:22,361
Ledda?

725
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:41,296
Japanese trash!
That's our own number.

726
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:46,051
Are you all right, chief?

727
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,096
I saw Paolo.

728
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:54,476
We found your pills.
We know you're sick.

729
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:58,897
Shut up about me. Tell me
what you know about the scum.

730
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,942
We think that Van Camp..

731
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,069
blackmailed his
predecessor, Jean De Haeck.

732
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,572
It's about children. Right?

733
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:11,118
Who else is
involved? The baron?

734
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,120
If I give you dynamite..

735
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,540
will you keep it covered
up or will you let it blow?

736
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:18,834
- It will blow.
- Can I believe you?

737
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,712
Verstuyft. Is that
tracer connected well?

738
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:24,882
Can I believe you?

739
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:28,218
- Yes.
- No outside line?

740
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,222
It's an inside
line. He's in here.

741
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,349
Damn!

742
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:50,741
TOO SLOW

743
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,118
Vincke!

744
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,330
Ledda. Telephone.

745
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,202
- A drink?
- I'm here for work.

746
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,288
Sit down, Freddy.

747
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,253
I thought you preferred
being alone in a bar.

748
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:47,422
- I am alone.
- You've got me, don't you?

749
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:50,092
That can be worse
than being alone.

750
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:51,385
Any news?

751
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:53,887
They found Ledda's escape car.

752
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:58,308
- In the Helmstraat.
- That's very close to the Kerkstraat.

753
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:01,103
- His brother's house.
- We've been there.

754
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:02,938
Is that the official report?

755
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:06,066
'Dust on the pedals..

756
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:09,069
traces of animal faeces.'
- Faeces?

757
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:12,739
Shit. Dog shit,
cow shit. Shit.

758
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,494
Vincke, I know where he is.

759
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:19,621
Pigeon shit.

760
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:12,276
Coemans!

761
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,371
Sorry. I saw something move.

762
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:27,249
Sorry.

763
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:03,493
- Do you expect anybody?
- No.

764
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:24,723
Who's there?

765
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:28,519
Who's there?

766
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:47,204
Verheyen, Lemmens,
everything okay?

767
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:49,998
There's nobody. Nobody.

768
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:53,293
- Positions?
- Verheyen checks the north side.

769
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,172
- I stay near the entrance.
- Careful, people.

770
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:15,607
- Verheyen, see anything?
- Negative.

771
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:24,324
- We need more people.
- Quiet, nothing's happening.

772
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:26,243
Ask for backup!

773
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,126
The suspect has gone inside!

774
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:37,421
Suspect is in the
basement. I'm coming back.

775
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:43,343
Take me to the baron and
I'll let you live. Understood?

776
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,265
Lemmens, everything okay?

777
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,518
Lemmens? Lemmens!

778
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:54,688
Damn! Stay here.

779
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:03,906
Lemmens?

780
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,936
Come! Come, come!

781
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,173
Verheyen at north entrance.
I'm trying a lock-in.

782
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,212
Verheyen, Lemmens,
situation. Come on, answer.

783
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,090
Lock-in complete.
We're waiting.

784
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,969
Suspect sits on the S-stairs.
He has no way to go.

785
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,722
Put that down.
Idiot. Put that down.

786
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:52,574
Lemmens, what's
happening there? Lemmens!

787
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:56,161
The suspect has gone,
outside. Position unknown.

788
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:04,127
We stay standby.

789
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,339
Sergeant!

790
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:11,885
Sergeant!

791
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,188
This is ridiculous.

792
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,650
I hired you. I paid you.

793
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,569
I've come to pay you back.

794
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:31,113
That attempt at your life
was an idea of your boss.

795
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:32,614
I was against it.

796
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,829
Shit! Sergeant!

797
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:41,415
Sergeant!

798
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,668
Around the other way. Come on.

799
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:48,380
How much do you want?

800
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:56,430
My son was being blackmailed. I
did it for him. Please understand.

801
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:06,857
Wouldn't you do the
same thing for your son?

802
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:09,568
- I don't have a son.
- And your father?

803
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,279
Wouldn't he have
done it for you?

804
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:15,741
- Shut up!
- We aren't animals, are we?

805
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:18,452
No, please!

806
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:22,122
Forgive me. Please.

807
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:27,044
I hired you. I paid you.

808
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:30,589
I did it for my son!

809
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:31,692
Weapon down! Weapon down!

810
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,490
Kill him! Kill him!

811
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,784
- Destroy him!
- Silence, baron.

812
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,162
Cowards! Cowards!

813
01:26:58,468 --> 01:26:59,428
From Ledda.

814
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,936
Vincke, careful!

815
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:24,912
I need my pills.

816
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:29,416
- Who is your client?
- I need my pills.

817
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,419
- My pills..
- Forget about those pills.

818
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:36,089
I need my pills.

819
01:27:36,465 --> 01:27:40,093
He's been here for more than 12
hours. Should we inform Judicial?

820
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:43,847
If you like them so
much, go work there.

821
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,141
He killed one of our men.

822
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:50,020
Judicial Police get him
when we are finished.

823
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,029
'When you read this, I'll
be on a beach or in a coffin.

824
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:00,656
Let it blow.'

825
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:04,409
If he'd been in a coffin,
we would have known.

826
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,371
The asshole is
laying on a beach.

827
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,915
We have time.

828
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:14,503
He'll get hungry or thirsty. Or
his shoulder will start to hurt.

829
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,382
Come on, boy. Talk!

830
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:24,179
Chief Vincke. Only
to chief Vincke.

831
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:38,861
Oh, no.

832
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:44,408
Daddy!

833
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:10,851
- Yes, Vincke.
- Coemans here.

834
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:14,271
I'm at the castle.
The police have left.

835
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,566
- Say that's not true!
- They left.

836
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:20,611
Say that's not true.

837
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:25,282
Chief, don't ask me that.

838
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,869
Marc, just answer
yes or no. Yes or no?

839
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,122
Yes. He's here with us.

840
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:37,294
He's been there for more than 15
hours. So we hear from our source.

841
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,046
And you assigned
the case to us.

842
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:42,925
Commissioner, how
come I don't know that?

843
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:46,595
It was because of a
protection assignment.

844
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:48,013
We didn't know..

845
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:51,433
National police couldn't
know it was Ledda.

846
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,728
He had no ID and
refused to talk.

847
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,064
I can't help it. That's
what they tell me.

848
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:01,527
Bullshit. But they're
bringing him over.

849
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,634
Too slow, Ledda?

850
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:31,598
He hasn't got it, chief.

851
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:34,893
- He really hasn't got it.
- Yes, Ledda.

852
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:39,398
- He just hasn't got it for you.
- And you?

853
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,610
It's always the same
with men like you.

854
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:45,612
Basically, you're okay..

855
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,907
but when you have problems, you
drag everybody down with you.

856
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:52,077
Guilty, innocent,
doesn't matter.

857
01:30:54,246 --> 01:30:57,666
If you're looking for
a friend.. don't bother.

858
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,295
Let's not talk about
me. Waste of time.

859
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,049
What's the deal?

860
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,595
We patch you up,
we protect you..

861
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:14,057
and you fill the gaps
in our investigation.

862
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:16,977
The baron, chief.

863
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:20,147
The baron must hang.

864
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:23,066
If he's our man, absolutely.

865
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:25,068
Deal.

866
01:31:27,696 --> 01:31:28,655
Tell me.

867
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,994
Should he be able
to follow too?

868
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,580
Let me start from
the beginning then.

869
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:57,809
- Mrs. Van Camp.
- Chief Vincke.

870
01:32:01,522 --> 01:32:02,814
Bad news?

871
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,568
Mum, who is it?

872
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:10,781
It's ok, Ine. It's for Mum.

873
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:15,661
Did you find the murderer?

874
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:20,832
- A man from Marseilles.
- The murderer? The real murderer?

875
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,256
There's a problem, Ledda.

876
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:31,009
I have the story, but there's
no evidence against the baron.

877
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:36,139
- You have my testimony.
- Your testimony?

878
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:42,312
Shall I tell you what
a testimony is worth?

879
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:47,609
A woman and a child are
hit by a car in the street..

880
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:50,821
in broad daylight.

881
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:54,867
The woman dies instantly.
The child doesn't.

882
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:59,705
What does the driver
do? He wants to get rid of it.

883
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:03,542
Nobody around. He puts
the car in reverse..

884
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:08,338
and drives over the
child one more time.

885
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,551
This time the child is dead.

886
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:19,975
The driver drives away,
but it's not his lucky day.

887
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:23,562
There's a boy of
around twelve years old.

888
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:27,649
He saw everything and tries
to remember the license plate.

889
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,195
But he forgets one
letter. One letter.

890
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:35,240
You know what, Ledda?

891
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:39,328
One letter made the
difference in court.

892
01:33:40,579 --> 01:33:43,582
The driver was
caught and acquitted.

893
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,751
There was no proof.

894
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:53,217
And the testimony?
Worth nothing.

895
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,262
Beautiful story, Mr. Vincke.

896
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:02,017
Aren't we friends then?
We have something in common.

897
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:03,894
Sadness.

898
01:34:06,396 --> 01:34:08,440
Or wasn't the story about you?

899
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:12,110
Are you finished or is
there something else?

900
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:15,989
We have something
else in common. Anger.

901
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:19,451
But, yes, there
is something else.

902
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:24,581
I've got an audio
tape where..

903
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,715
- That first man.
- Van Camp.

904
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,509
Thank you.

905
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:40,514
I have a tape where he's
threatened with death..

906
01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:41,765
by the baron.

907
01:34:45,477 --> 01:34:48,856
I wouldn't want
it to get lost.

908
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:53,193
It's well hidden.

909
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:57,573
So if you stick
to the deal..

910
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:07,165
If I understand it
correctly, Ledda's testimony..

911
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:09,710
is the only thing we've got.

912
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:12,921
Not enough evidences to arrest the
baron, don't you think?

913
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,090
There's another evidence.

914
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:19,469
And why haven't
we seen that yet?

915
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:22,347
- You have to take my word for it.
- Your word?

916
01:35:22,556 --> 01:35:23,932
Or Ledda's word?

917
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:30,814
Okay, I know enough.

918
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:34,693
Good. Congratulations
on this file.

919
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:38,113
We can no longer
ignore the evidence.

920
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:15,526
I can only report it, Gustave.

921
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:19,613
We can wait a week
with the arrest.

922
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,865
But that's it.

923
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:27,496
What should I do?
Run of to Brazil?

924
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:30,999
Baron De Haeck in the jungle.

925
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,836
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

926
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:35,921
No, Marcel, this
is my country.

927
01:36:36,129 --> 01:36:38,173
People like me
made Belgium big.

928
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:41,009
I'm Minister of
State. I don't run.

929
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:43,470
One week. That's all I can do.

930
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,014
'That's all I can do.' Loser.

931
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,397
And your financial
games, Marcel?

932
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:57,985
Should I send copies of
invoices to the newspapers?

933
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:01,071
You're not even allowed
to be here with me..

934
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,156
mister prosecutor.

935
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:06,535
It's Ledda's
testimony, Gustave.

936
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:10,330
There's nothing I can do,
especially if he has real proof.

937
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:13,000
I'm sorry. There's
nothing I can do for you.

938
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:16,920
There has to be a solution.

939
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:20,215
Not while Ledda's alive.

940
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:28,557
He's stable now, but..

941
01:37:29,099 --> 01:37:32,311
the problem is they waited
too long taking care of him.

942
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:35,230
We might have to
amputate his arm.

943
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:38,734
- And the Alzheimer's?
- Hard to predict.

944
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:42,988
One moment he'll be
lucid, the next he won't.

945
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:44,781
If he has to testify..

946
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:48,243
I hope this case won't
be dragged out too long.

947
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:52,289
- Is he deteriorating that fast?
- He's seriously ill.

948
01:38:07,804 --> 01:38:08,764
Are you okay?

949
01:38:11,475 --> 01:38:14,436
Yes. Thanks.

950
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:21,401
We have a problem, Ledda.

951
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:23,862
Tell me about it.

952
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:29,076
It's not certain that
you'll make it to the trial.

953
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:36,542
The baron will be pleased.

954
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:40,254
If you tell me
where the tape is..

955
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:43,173
I'll make sure
it won't get lost.

956
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,555
We have a problem.

957
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:52,683
The tape is already lost.

958
01:38:53,141 --> 01:38:56,019
I forgot where I put it.

959
01:38:57,062 --> 01:39:00,899
I don't even remember if I
wrote down where I put it.

960
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:10,325
If only you knew
how empty my head is.

961
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:21,503
Sorry. It might
come back to me.

962
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:32,306
Vincke? Would
you do me a favour?

963
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:36,393
Next time you come,
bring Stimorol.

964
01:39:38,604 --> 01:39:39,938
And a pita.

965
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:42,733
My last wish.

966
01:39:43,775 --> 01:39:46,111
- A pizza.
- No.

967
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:50,490
A pita! With a
t from 'too slow'.

968
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:11,595
I made my will, Joseph.

969
01:40:11,803 --> 01:40:15,140
Don't try to break
my concentration.

970
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:19,102
With Jean gone, only you
and your wife are in it.

971
01:40:23,982 --> 01:40:27,027
Your appointment as judicial
psychiatrist of Ledda..

972
01:40:27,236 --> 01:40:29,655
signed by prosecutor Bracke.

973
01:40:30,364 --> 01:40:33,784
You want me to declare
Ledda of unsound mind?

974
01:40:34,451 --> 01:40:36,870
That man wants to
testify against me.

975
01:40:37,663 --> 01:40:39,915
If they believe him, I'm lost.

976
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:45,212
And then what? One countercheck
and they blow me away.

977
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,923
They'll find out
that we're friends.

978
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:56,640
Psychiatrists don't just
talk to their patients, do they?

979
01:40:57,057 --> 01:40:59,852
This leaves no traces,
so I've been told.

980
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,984
You can remove
me from your will.

981
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:11,530
It's not just about the will.

982
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:14,241
It's also about your wife.

983
01:41:14,992 --> 01:41:17,870
She's so sensitive.
Would she understand it?

984
01:41:18,078 --> 01:41:20,664
The parties, the young girls.

985
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:27,462
Do you really think Jean never
told me anything?

986
01:41:46,857 --> 01:41:48,442
Joseph Vlerick,
judicial psychiatrist.

987
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,527
We know.

988
01:41:58,035 --> 01:42:00,954
- It's okay.
- Sure?

989
01:42:01,163 --> 01:42:02,122
Yes.

990
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:27,606
Shouldn't you
disinfect it first?

991
01:42:28,106 --> 01:42:30,859
Yes, of course.
Absent-minded.

992
01:43:24,872 --> 01:43:27,583
- So?
- He's out and has a hostage.

993
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:30,085
- Victims?
- He let the guards go..

994
01:43:30,294 --> 01:43:32,045
but he has their guns.

995
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:34,298
- Where is De Keyzer?
- There.

996
01:43:37,134 --> 01:43:38,093
There he is.

997
01:43:39,219 --> 01:43:40,846
Ah, Vincke.

998
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:46,435
He must have a
reason. What happened?

999
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:49,438
All we know is that
he has a hostage.

1000
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:55,068
He demands an armoured
car and two passengers.

1001
01:43:55,277 --> 01:43:56,695
You and Verstuyft.

1002
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:00,949
- Who's the hostage?
- A doctor.

1003
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:03,619
The judicial psychiatrist.

1004
01:44:15,672 --> 01:44:18,300
A BMW! It couldn't be worse.

1005
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:20,511
Coemans!

1006
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:24,932
If I don't come back,
look after her well.

1007
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:31,540
He's not going to collect
the car. Mark my words.

1008
01:45:57,357 --> 01:45:59,735
Keep going, keep
going! Come on.

1009
01:46:15,626 --> 01:46:17,294
Alfa, Bravo, go!

1010
01:46:20,047 --> 01:46:21,006
Damn!

1011
01:46:39,066 --> 01:46:40,526
Vincke, feedback!

1012
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:45,322
Feedback? You
shot the hostage.

1013
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:49,368
Turn that off. Turn that off.

1014
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:54,456
All units, block! Now!

1015
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:58,210
You don't keep
your word, chief.

1016
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:01,588
You're no better than
that asshole over there.

1017
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:04,675
Go lay next to him,
while he's still warm.

1018
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,429
I didn't know about
this, Ledda, really, I swear.

1019
01:47:25,612 --> 01:47:28,448
Do you know what the difference
is between you and me?

1020
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,993
You believe in people.

1021
01:47:32,202 --> 01:47:34,329
That's very dangerous.

1022
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:59,605
We can still solve
this together.

1023
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,784
We're on the way,
the three of us.

1024
01:48:16,788 --> 01:48:19,458
On the way to
the light.

1025
01:48:23,837 --> 01:48:25,130
Ain't that true, shooter?

1026
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:29,051
- Or don't you know any French?
- I do, Ledda.

1027
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:32,596
The light.

1028
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,891
Nirvana, the great light.

1029
01:48:37,226 --> 01:48:38,185
Well done!

1030
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:48,654
You're so quiet, chief.

1031
01:48:49,196 --> 01:48:51,782
Are you afraid
of your friends?

1032
01:48:54,493 --> 01:48:59,248
- You're not a believer anymore, are you?
- We have to believe.

1033
01:48:59,456 --> 01:49:01,875
There are children
that count on us.

1034
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,901
Keep searching,
Vincke, and you'll find.

1035
01:49:29,778 --> 01:49:31,864
Ledda! Ledda!

1036
01:51:00,994 --> 01:51:02,538
Did you give the order?

1037
01:51:02,746 --> 01:51:05,541
We judged the situation
and acted accordingly.

1038
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:07,876
And that's it? Case closed?

1039
01:51:08,085 --> 01:51:12,464
I'm glad you're alive. I
don't care about the rest.

1040
01:51:14,216 --> 01:51:15,884
Are you sure of that?

1041
01:51:17,219 --> 01:51:18,136
Of what?

1042
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:22,015
That you're glad
we're still alive.

1043
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:26,895
This friend of De Haeck,
the judicial psychiatrist..

1044
01:51:27,354 --> 01:51:29,022
appointed by you?

1045
01:51:29,231 --> 01:51:31,692
I'm fed up with
your nagging, Vincke.

1046
01:51:33,569 --> 01:51:36,363
Better be a bit more careful.

1047
01:52:20,657 --> 01:52:22,826
We're on the way,
the three of us.

1048
01:52:23,493 --> 01:52:25,829
On the way to the light.

1049
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:32,794
Keep searching,
Vincke, and you'll find.

1050
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:43,096
The light. The neon. Wise guy.

1051
01:52:46,099 --> 01:52:48,852
Freddy, he did know
where the tape was.

1052
01:52:49,061 --> 01:52:51,939
The light was a hint.
The neon, of course.

1053
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:04,785
Pita with a t from
'too slow'. He knew.

1054
01:53:04,993 --> 01:53:07,204
He did know! Torch.

1055
01:53:40,362 --> 01:53:42,906
- It's a pack of filthy lies.
- Lies?

1056
01:53:43,115 --> 01:53:45,951
It's the truth, baron.
And I can prove it all.

1057
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:48,704
I'll destroy you, Van Camp.

1058
01:53:59,965 --> 01:54:01,842
What do you think, Vincke?

1059
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:05,053
We'll see.

1060
01:54:07,264 --> 01:54:10,267
Will it work, or is he
going to get away with it?

1061
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:14,271
We'll see, I said.

1062
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:35,000
