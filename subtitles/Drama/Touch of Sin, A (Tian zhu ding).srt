1
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:09,363
<BR> Here. Thank you.

2
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,019
<BR> Here. Thank you.

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,682
<BR> Thank you.

4
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:40,059
<BR>- Here. Thank you. - Thank you.

5
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,954
<BR> Your mother was a volunteer teacher here.

6
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:51,496
<BR> Every single brick in this school was built<BR><BR> because of her.

7
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,652
<BR> How long ago was this?

8
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:55,967
<BR> Probably the year before you were born.

9
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,567
<BR> The year before?

10
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,603
<BR> Principal, you must have gotten it wrong.

11
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,676
<BR> My parents were already married then.

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,601
<BR> Ji Fan.

13
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,356
<BR> Actually, your birth father...

14
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,642
<BR> was this volunteer teacher from the university.

15
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:12,314
<BR> He has a very lively personality.

16
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:15,168
<BR> Just like you.

17
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,076
<BR> I don't believe you.

18
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,828
<BR> When your mother was pregnant with you,

19
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:28,953
<BR> this university student got into an accident.

20
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:32,776
<BR> Because of you,<BR><BR> your mother had no choice but to marry Director Ji.

21
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,736
<BR> Director Ji was really good to your mother.

22
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,636
<BR> He also treated you as his own son.

23
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:42,289
<BR> It was just that your mother <BR><BR> had found it hard to forget this volunteer teacher.

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,983
<BR> Soon after, she left home and came here.

25
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:48,156
<BR> Until she fell ill and passed away.

26
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:50,176
<BR> Ji Fan.

27
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,109
<BR> The reason why your father never told you this

28
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,057
<BR> was because he didn't want to destroy<BR><BR> the image you had of your mother.

29
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:01,356
<BR> But this is really too unfair to him.

30
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,636
<BR> So,

31
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:05,369
<BR> I should tell the truth to you now.

32
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:33,721

47
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:51,476
<BR> So the person who could fish out <BR><BR> several billion at one go would come too?

48
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:53,830
<BR> I am really anticipating this.

49
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,276
<BR> The person you are anticipating is here.

50

<BR> He's here.

<BR> Everyone, excuse me.

53
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,144
<BR> Director Ji, can we talk about

54
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,756
<BR> your acquiring of RA Group shares.

55
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,035
<BR> Is it because of Xin Yue Company?

56
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,579
<BR> What is your real motive?

57
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,662
<BR> Can you say a few words for our TV viewers?

58

<BR> Stand back!

<BR> Every injustice has its perpetrator!

65
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,225
<BR> Everyone, stand back.

66
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:24,868
<BR> Don't come over!

67
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,236
<BR> Mister, don't be impulsive!

68
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,716
<BR> Stand back, or I'll kill him.

69
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:29,656
<BR> Don't be impulsive!

70
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:30,476
<BR> Every injustice has its perpetrator!

71
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,152
<BR> Mister!!

72
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:32,996
<BR> Don't be impulsive!

73
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,249
<BR> I'll kill him if you come over!

74
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:35,716
<BR> Mister, don't be impulsive!

75
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:37,396
<BR> Let's talk!

76
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:38,886
<BR> Let's discuss about this.

77
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,436
<BR> Don't hurt our Director.

78
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,161
<BR> Go!

79
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,676
<BR> Don't hurt our Director.

80
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:43,396
<BR> Mister.

81
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:47,996
<BR> Hurry!

82
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:49,876
<BR> Go!

83
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,476
<BR> Put down your knife.

84
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:52,476
<BR> Go.

85
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,636
<BR> Listen to me...

86
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:55,436
<BR> You better not fool around!

87
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:57,996
<BR> How is uncle?

88
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:58,756
<BR> Uncle?

89
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,114
<BR> Yes. The guy who got attacked on TV.

90
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,461
<BR> You know Ji Peng Wei?

91
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,576
<BR> I don't care who Ji Peng Wei is.

92
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:06,036
<BR> Tell me how is Uncle Ji.

93
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:08,556
<BR> Looks like she doesn't know anything.

94
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,116
<BR> He had dragged him <BR><BR>into the conference room on the 5th floor.

95
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,076
<BR> 5th floor?

96
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,476
<BR> You never thought this day would come.

97
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,056
<BR> You acquired organisations <BR><BR> and made me suffer an injustice.

98
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,276
<BR> It is your fault that my wife left me

99
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,476
<BR> and my family have broken up!

100
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:20,676
<BR> Uncle Ji!

101
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,436
<BR> Stand right there!

102
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,116
<BR> How dare you bring the police here?

103
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,956
<BR> Get out. Otherwise, I'll kill him.

104
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,416
<BR> It's dangerous here. Get out.

105
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,056
<BR> It's alright.

106
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,276
<BR> - I'll talk to him. - Get out!

107
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,052
<BR> Please watch your own safety.

108
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,116
<BR> Uncle Ji.

109
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:33,816
<BR> Stand right there!

110
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,278
<BR> If you come over, I'll kill him.

111
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,176
<BR> I'll come in exchange for him.

112
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,356
<BR> You?

113
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:38,616
<BR> Who do you think you are?

114
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,376
<BR> Me? I am his daughter-in-law.

115
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,176
<BR> Tong Tong.

116
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:42,136
<BR> Get out of here.

117
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,676
<BR> It is dangerous here.

118
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,236
<BR> No.

119
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,896
<BR> I want to accompany you here.

120
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,036
<BR> I know!

121
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,636
<BR> Both of you have conspired to lie to me.

122
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:49,516
<BR> What daughter-in-law?

123
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,256
<BR> I heard you calling him "uncle".

124
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,064
<BR> What nonsense is this?

125
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,684
<BR> You can't come in here.

126
00:05:58,956 --> 00:05:59,836
<BR> He is Mr. Ji's son.

127
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:00,996
<BR> Let him in.

128
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:03,576
<BR> Uncle Li, what is the situation now?

129
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,371
<BR> Miss Le is in there.

130
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:06,596
<BR> I did not lie.

131
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:07,795
<BR> Hasn't it always stumped you why

132
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:09,516
<BR> he acquired the entire organisation

133
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:10,996
<BR> because of a small company?

134
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:11,916
<BR> The reason is me.

135
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,576
<BR> I am the one who begged him to do that.

136
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:14,836
<BR> I...I don't believe you.

137
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,316
<BR> That is the truth!

138
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,676
<BR> Let him go. Take me instead.

139
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,336
<BR> That way, you can control his son.

140
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:19,996
<BR> Too late.

141
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,536
<BR> It is too late to say these things now.

142
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:23,716
<BR> I know that there are police outside.

143
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,996
<BR> As long as we do not sue you,

144
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:26,396
<BR> you would not be charged.

145
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,716
<BR> If I can't live,

146
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,876
<BR> you guys won't leave here alive either.

147
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,316
<BR> Don't!

148
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:33,016
<BR> Tong Tong, don't be afraid.

149
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,605
<BR> If he really wanted to kill someone,

150
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,776
<BR> he would have done that a long time ago.

151
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:36,496
<BR> You!

152
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,636
<BR> Do you think I really don't dare to?

153
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:39,516
<BR> Don't!

154
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:40,676
<BR> I believe that you dare to.

155
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,956
<BR> But you never thought of <BR><BR> the consequences of your actions.

156
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:46,293
<BR> I can't consider so much now.

157
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:47,408
<BR> You can choose to not think about it.

158
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,008
<BR> But have you considered your daughter?

159
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,149
<BR> This has nothing to do with my daughter.

160
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:54,992
<BR> Your daughter.

161
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:58,660
<BR> Her name is Fang Dan, right?

162
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:00,829
<BR> She is your precious daughter.

163
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,933
<BR> How...how did you know that?

164
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:05,055
<BR> Before I acquired the organisation,

165
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,738
<BR> I made a background check<BR><BR> on all relevant personnel.

166
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,085
<BR> I know that

167
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,289
<BR> you dote on your daughter very much.

168
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,154
<BR> Your daughter is also very proud of you.

169
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:18,337
<BR> She thinks that you are a good father.

170
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,830
<BR> Have you considered that

171
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,716
<BR> when this matter is broadcasted on TV,

172
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,753
<BR> what will your daughter think of you?

173
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:25,310
<BR> I...

174
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,375
<BR> I believe that my daughter will understand.

175
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,854
<BR> Even if she understands,

176
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,083
<BR> would her classmates understand?

177
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,334
<BR> People in school <BR><BR> will point fingers at your daughter

178
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:38,088
<BR> saying that she is the daughter of a murderer.

179
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,264
<BR> Would you have known that?

180
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:41,850
<BR> I... then...

181
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,986
<BR> What should I do then?

182
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:45,843
<BR> Put down your knife.

183
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:47,508
<BR> Go out together with us.

184
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,216
<BR> I will make sure that the reverberations<BR><BR> of this matter will be as little as possible.

185
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,552
<BR> Moreover, I won't sue you.

186
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:59,172
<BR> I definitely won't kick aside <BR><BR> all the old guards of this organisation.

187
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:03,685
<BR> I have already made adequate arrangements for you.

188
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,418
<BR> You...

189
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,161
<BR> Uncle Ji.

190
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,251
<BR> Will you really let me go?

191
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,409
<BR> I will ask for pardon from the police.

192
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:13,902
<BR> Fine. I...

193
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:15,195
<BR> I will believe you one more time.

194
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,492
<BR> I will go out with you.

195
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,489
<BR> Get up.

196
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:22,833
<BR> Uncle Ji.

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,737
<BR> Mr. Ji.

198
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,419
<BR> Mr. Policemen,

199
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,541
<BR> He has already surrendered.

200
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,895
<BR> He has surrendered.

201
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:29,450
<BR> Uncle Ji...

202
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,937
<BR> You are not allowed to hit him.

203
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:31,819
<BR> Who are you?

204
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,509
<BR> I'm his son.

205
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,424
<BR> Dad, are you alright?

206
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:38,599
<BR> I'm alright.

207
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:40,410
<BR> Ji Fan.

208
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,482
<BR> You finally call me "Dad".

209
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,187
<BR> I'm sorry...

210
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,566
<BR> We will be holding a press conference later.

211
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,988
<BR> All thanks to Miss Le.

212
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,882
<BR> Otherwise, things would have gotten ugly.

213
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:51,820
<BR> Not at all.

214
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,506
<BR> It was what I should have done.

215
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,139
<BR> Miss Le.

216
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:00,087
<BR> Were what you told that man the truth?

217
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:00,690
<BR> I...

218
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,277
<BR> What did she say?

219
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:03,159
<BR> She said...

220
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,156
<BR> she's my daughter-in-law.

221
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,671
<BR> I only said that in the heat of the moment...

222
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,032
<BR> I understand...

223
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,419
<BR> Looks like our Ji Fan doesn't have the luck.

224
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:25,086
<BR> Sorry. Let me take this call.

225
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,123
<BR> Tong Tong, where are you?

226
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,655
<BR> I have something on.

227
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,803
<BR> Later, I would like you to accompany me <BR><BR> to take a look at the grounds of the wedding party.

228
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:43,508
<BR> Tonight?

229
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,762
<BR> Yes.

230
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:46,109
<BR> Why? You have something on?

231
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:49,367
<BR> Didn't you always hoped to have<BR><BR> an unforgettable wedding ceremony?

232
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,790
<BR> Fine then.

233
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,794
<BR> Wait for me at home then.

234
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,388
<BR> OK. See you later.

235
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:02,354
<BR> Tong Tong.

236
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,940
<BR> I have something on. I have to go first.

237
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,208
<BR> Mr. Ji.

238
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,795
<BR> These are the details of RA Group's shares.

239
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,295
<BR> Take a look.

240
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,692
<BR> Later, I will hand it over to Ji Fan.

241
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:18,143
<BR> Now, it is time for him to take over.

242
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,713
<BR> Tong Tong.

243
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,162
<BR> Are you willing to stay for me?

244
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:31,802
<BR> We have already gone too far.

245
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:35,187
<BR> It is no longer possible now. Sorry.

246
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:57,733
<i>Subtitles by team Single Princesses and Blind Dates at Viki</i>

247
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:02,548
<BR> Colleagues.

248
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,499
<BR> Since I took over as Vice-Chairman,

249
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,510
<BR> our company's sales has improved.

250
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,461
<BR> So,

251
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,693
<BR> with the approval of Chairman Fang,

252
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:13,482
<BR> to increase another position of Manager <BR><BR> in the wedding planning department.

253
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,459
<BR> Upon several recommendations,

254
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,646
<BR> we will now invite the new manager <BR><BR> to say a few words.

255
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,990
<BR> Hello everyone, my name is Ge Lan.

256
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,136
<BR> Thanks to Chairman Zhao,

257
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,550
<BR> I was invited to take on the position of manager<BR><BR> of the wedding planning department.

258
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,292
<BR> Because of my wealth of experience<BR><BR> in going for blind dates,

259
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,743
<BR> I believe I will be able to give everyone <BR><BR> many good ideas.

260
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,482
<BR> [Delete Chang Sheng?]

261
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,749
<BR> Forget it.

262
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,007
<BR> No harm leaving him in my phone contact list.

263
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,708
<BR> Manager Ke.

264
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:46,602
<BR> Help me interview for the new assistant.

265
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:49,909
<BR> I really don't know what this new generation<BR><BR> that was born after 1990s, is thinking!

266
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,370
<BR> I'll be right there.

267
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,961
<BR> Did you bring your CV?

268
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:58,036
<BR> How old are you?

269
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,482
<BR> Which school did you graduate from?

270
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:02,719
<BR> Do you have any job experience?

271
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,420
<BR> What position did you take in your previous job?

272
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:07,370
<BR> Next.

273
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,082
<BR> How old are you?

274
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,322
<BR> 35.

275
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:28,129
<BR> So old and still come for interview?

276
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,202
<BR> An old cucumber painted in green?

277
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,482
<BR> Pretending to be fresh?

278
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:34,842
<BR> It doesn't matter.

279
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,215
<BR> As long as I can work with the girl I like,

280
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:41,122
<BR> it doesn't matter what I work as.

281
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,371
<BR> That...

282
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:50,947
<BR> Any work experience?

283
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,669
<BR> Does being a boss count?

284
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:56,482
<BR> Probably.

285
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,384
<BR> What company did you start?

286
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,692
<BR> I know. An inn run by crooks.

287
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:01,962
<BR> Right?

288
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,282
<BR> No.

289
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,365
<BR> It was a bar whose business was doing well.

290
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:09,205
<BR> Later, because I fell in love with an employee,

291
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,802
<BR> but she didn't reciprocate my feelings.

292
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:21,162
<BR> And then?

293
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:25,352
<BR> Later, in order to assauge the pain,

294
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,602
<BR> I visited the four famous mountains in Buddhism.

295
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,042
<BR> Mt. Pu Tuo, Mt. Wu Tai,

296
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,762
<BR> Mt. Er Mei, and Mt. Jiu Hua.

297
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:36,662
<BR> And confess my past crime <BR><BR> of being flirtatious to old monks.

298
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:38,209
<BR> I did that till my intestines turned green.

299
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,042
<BR> Really.

300
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,042
<BR> Then I thought they might take me in as a disciple.

301
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,245
<BR> But they said that

302
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,942
<BR> it's not time for me <br><br>to leave the mortal world for monkhood yet.

303
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,622
<BR> So I was allowed to come back<BR><BR> to settle matters of the heart.

304
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,454
<BR> You beancurd brain!

305
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,133
<BR> Why didn't you ask me along?

306
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,442
<BR> I will definitely convince them <BR><BR> to make you a monk.

307
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:56,322
<BR> But I still haven't made my final wish come true.

308
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,162
<BR> This is a little embarrassing...

309
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:09,282
<BR> I shall do my own accompanying music.

310
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,811
<i><BR> What colour</i>

311
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,994
<i><BR> What choice</i>

312
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,062
<i><BR> Full of memories</i>

313
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:25,162
<i><BR> Sadness or happiness</i>

314
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,081
<BR> Don't cry.

315
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:36,482
<BR> How many girls <BR><BR> have you deceived with this trick?

316
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,522
<BR> Never before!<BR><BR> This is the first time.

317
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:45,103
<BR> I do not know if it would work.

318
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:49,322
<BR> I am afraid that after I agree,

319
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,527
<BR> someone would still be flirting out there,

320
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,762
<BR> and mixing around with other women.

321
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:58,007
<BR> No. This time, <BR><BR> I have really turned over a new leaf.

322
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,882
<BR> If I really flirt around in the future,

323
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:09,282
<BR> you can use this

324
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,442
<BR> on me, once and for all.

325
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,045
<BR> Wouldn't you be a real monk then?

326
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:25,842
<BR> Can't bear to?

327
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:40,822
<i><BR> No salary, only tips.</i>

328
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:41,882
<i><BR> Work 6 days, rest 1.</i>

329
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:44,191
<i><BR> Security, bartending and assistant.<BR><BR> You'll do it all.</i>

330
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,762
<BR> Then.

331
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,982
<BR> Only salary, no tips.

332
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:48,802
<BR> Work 6 days, rest 1.

333
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:49,842
<BR> Cleaning, security,

334
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,122
<BR> customer service. All inclusive.<BR><BR> Will you do it?

335
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:55,162
<BR> Boyfriend, Husband, Dog.

336
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:56,882
<BR> I'll do it all.

337
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:33,722
<BR> Dad. Your arms and legs are moving together.

338
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,002
<BR> Don't be nervous.

339
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:35,922
<BR> Why should I be nervous?

340
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,722
<BR> I'm not nervous...

341
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,709
<BR> You are perspiring all over.

342
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:46,882
<BR> No air-conditioning. Warm.

343
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,322
<BR> It's warm.

344
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,339
<BR> At this time, we should move forward.

345
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,419
<BR> Two steps. Come.

346
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:28,271
<BR> One. Two. OK.

347
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,158
<BR> I will then read the blessing.

348
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,869
<BR> And then I will ask

349
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:43,946
<BR> if there is anyone who has reason <BR><BR> why this wedding should not continue.

350
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:46,972
<BR> Otherwise, they should forever hold their peace.

351
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,633
<BR> After that, I will first ask the bride.

352
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:51,894
<BR> Le Tong Tong.

353
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:56,585
<BR> Do you take this man <BR><BR> to be your lawfully wedded husband,

354
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,889
<BR> in sickness and in health,

355
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,182
<BR> and for whatever reason,

356
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,604
<BR> you will always love him, cherish him,

357
00:19:03,604 --> 00:19:06,351
<BR> respect him, accept him.

358
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:09,936
<BR> and be faithful to him

359
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,830
<BR> as long as you both shall live?

360
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,453
<BR> Tong Tong,

361
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,000
<BR> at this time, you should say

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,254
<BR> "I do."

363
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,473
<BR> I do.

364
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,502
<BR> Good.

365
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,345
<BR> During the official ceremony,

366
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:33,263
<BR> please be more focused.

367
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:35,632
<BR> Next, I will ask the bridegroom.

368
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,336
<BR> Fang Yan,

369
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:42,483
<BR> Do you take this woman <BR><BR> to be your lawfully wedded wife

370
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:45,888
<BR> in sickness or in health,

371
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:47,227
<BR> and for whatever reason,

372
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,271
<BR> you will love her, and cherish her,

373
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,321
<BR> respect her, accept her,

374
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,815
<BR> and be faithful to her

375
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:55,972
<BR> for as long as you both shall live?

376
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:57,119
<BR> I do.

377
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,123
<BR> Good. At this time,

378
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:01,638
<BR> you can put the ring on the bride.

379
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,296
<br>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, <BR><BR> and of the Holy Spirit

380
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:21,654
<BR> I pronounce you, Husband and Wife.

381
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:26,623
<BR> What therefore God has joined together,<BR><BR> let no man put asunder.

382
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,534
<BR> Le Tong Tong, Fang Yan,

383
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:35,618
<BR> I have great joy in witnessing as you <BR><BR>pledge your love to one another in holy matrimony.

384
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,765
<BR> I hereby announce you, husband and wife.

385
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:40,773
<BR> At this time,

386
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,062
<BR> the bridegroom may kiss the bride.

387
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,542
<BR> Good...

388
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,259
<BR> This is the entire process.

389
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,551
<BR> I hope that during the official ceremony,

390
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,658
<BR> you won't be too nervous.

391
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,144
<BR> Be more relaxed, ok?

392
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,002
<BR> Sure. Thank you, Father.

393
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,839
<BR> You're welcome.

394
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,965
<BR> Tong Tong, it would be our wedding <BR><BR>in a few days' time.

395
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:23,759
<BR> I am still busy with a few things on my side.

396
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,137
<BR> I can't accompany you.

397
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,016
<BR> I understand. Go get busy.

398
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,067
<BR> Uncle, Aunt.

399
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,218
<BR> I have something on. I'll leave first.

400
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,140
<BR> Let's go.

401
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,721
<BR> He's leaving just like that?

402
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,897
<BR> Your husband's career is too massive.

403
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,662
<BR> He's leaving us just like that?

404
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,016
<BR> He really is rather busy these days.

405
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:55,541
<BR> You must be more understanding.

406
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,623
<BR> Let me tell you.

407
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:59,310
<BR> Let Carry be your bridesmaid<BR><BR> during the actual wedding ceremony.

408
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,417
<BR> I have been one three times already.

409
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,368
<BR> If I do this again, <BR><BR> I would really not be able to get married.

410
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,961
<BR> Are you that superstitious?

411
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,173
<BR> Oh yes. Has Carry's book signing tour ended?

412
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:09,209
<BR> SHe has just come back.

413
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:09,819
<BR> Let me tell you.

414
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,213
<BR> We have prepared a special surprise for you.

415
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:16,399
<BR> We intend to hold <BR><BR> a wild bachelorette party for you.

416
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,225
<BR> Ba Mei.

417
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:21,979
<BR> You said you intend to hold a WHAT?

418
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:24,427
<BR> Aunt, don't worry.

419
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,452
<BR> This wild party only has females.

420
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,224
<BR> No men allowed.

421
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,942
<BR> In that case.

422
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,379
<BR> Oh yes.

423
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,239
<BR> Don't let it get too wild either.

424
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,862
<BR> Mom!

425
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,429
<BR> (If) it's not wild...

426
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,898
<BR> how can it be called a wild party then?

427
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,870
<BR> Cheers!

428
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,560
<BR> Tong Tong.

429
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,759
<BR> Fang Yan just left you there<BR><BR> to do his own stuff.

430
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,229
<BR> Aren't you angry?

431
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:58,133
<BR> Tell us the truth.

432
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,594
<BR> Do you still think of Ji Fan?

433
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,420
<BR> She's hesitating!

434
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,378
<BR> That means you are still thinking of him.

435
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:07,616
<BR> Ji Fan and I are very good friends.

436
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:11,252
<BR> But Fang Yan doesn't want me<BR><BR> to meet up with him.

437
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:13,342
<BR> So petty?

438
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,257
<BR> Then after your wedding,

439
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,179
<BR> does it mean you can't have contact<BR><BR> with any members of the opposite sex?

440
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,461
<BR> I don't wish for it to be this way either.

441
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,590
<BR> But...

442
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,308
<BR> Enough...

443
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:23,745
<BR> Let me announce some happy news to you.

444
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:24,659
<BR> Firstly,

445
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,446
<BR> Tong Tong is about to marry <BR><BR> the handsome guy, Fang Yan.

446
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:30,975
<BR> Also, Carry's nationwide book-signing tour<BR><BR> is now complete.

447
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:34,086
<BR> I have good news for you too.

448
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:37,769
<BR> I have been accepted into<BR><BR> the foreign university that I applied for.

449
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,581
<BR> Moreover,

450
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,135
<BR> it is a full scholarship!

451
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:44,171
<BR> Congratulations!

452
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,471
<BR> - Thank you! - I'm envious!

453
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:46,765
<BR> Wait.

454
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,483
<BR> I have good news too.

455
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:52,862
<BR> No. You already have a good husband.<BR><BR> What other good news do you have?

456
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:53,777
<BR> I know.

457
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,439
<BR> Your husband has bought something nice for you?

458
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,249
<BR> No... I know!

459
00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:59,879
<BR> You must have lost a pound or two?

460
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,679
<BR> Losing a pound or two isn't considered good news.

461
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:04,969
<BR> Sou Sou.

462
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:06,330
<BR> Ignore Ba Mei.

463
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,434
<BR> She is jealous that you got married before she did.

464
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:10,054
<BR> I...

465
00:24:10,054 --> 00:24:10,658
<BR> OK.

466
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,679
<BR> Tell us your good news.

467
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,780
<BR> I'm pregnant.

468
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:17,839
<BR> Really?

469
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,046
<BR> Be careful...

470
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:20,875
<BR> Sit down.

471
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,711
<BR> Don't hurt the womb.

472
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,454
<BR> This...

473
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,358
<BR> I want to be the kid's god-mother.

474
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:26,879
<BR> No. Only those who are married<BR><BR> can be a god-mother.

475
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,391
<BR> Who said so? That's unfair.

476
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:29,899
<BR> Who said single girls can't be god-mothers?

477
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:31,663
<BR> Carry, am I right?

478
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,799
<BR> I have no comment.

479
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,607
<BR> Even if I am unable to get married in the future,

480
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,504
<BR> it's alright with me.

481
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:40,479
<BR> What's wrong, Carry?

482
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,019
<BR> You're not happy?

483
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,838
<BR> No.

484
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:48,692
<BR> I just felt that<BR><BR> everyone seems to have a good partner.

485
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,519
<BR> I am the only one who is single.

486
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,293
<BR> Who said so?

487
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,018
<BR> Sister Huang Ye too.

488
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:53,939
<BR> Please.

489
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:55,079
<BR> Don't bring me into this.

490
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,659
<BR> I willingly gave up.

491
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,559
<BR> She must be still thinking of <BR><BR> Li Xiao Yao.

492
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,219
<b> Don't mention him.</b>

493
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,250
<BR> I get angry when you mention him.

494
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,919
<BR> I have known him for so long. <BR><BR> Yet he is still so immature.

495
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:11,839
<BR> But his love for you <BR><BR> is very mature.

496
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,439
<BR> What is the use of that?

497
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,643
<BR> Love.

498
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,519
<BR> I don't even know where he is.

499
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,759
<BR> You can go after him.

500
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,679
<BR> Jia You!

501
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:28,559
<BR> Coming...

502
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,861
<BR> Stop pressing!

503
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,119
<BR> Where's Xiao Yao?

504
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:35,359
<BR> Xiao Yao? Xiao Yao has moved. <BR><BR> You know that.

505
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,779
<BR> He even changed his phone number.

506
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:40,779
<BR> That.

507
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:44,799
<BR> Perhaps he wants to start a new life.

508
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,319
<BR> Start a new life?

509
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,759
<BR> Can you please tell me where Xiao Yao is?

510
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,159
<BR> I'm sorry.

511
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,482
<BR> I really don't know where he's gone.

512
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,839
<BR> Looks like the two of us are really not fated.

513
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,438
<BR> I can see that Xiao Yao was serious about you.

514
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:09,759
<BR> But you kept making things difficult for him.

515
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,746
<br>Ji Fan.

516
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:15,486
<br>If you see Xiao Yao,

517
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,322
<br>please tell him

518
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:17,761
<br>that I came to look for him.

519
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:22,916
<br>Thanks.

520
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,046
<br>Carry, Carry, Carry.

521
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:31,972
<br>This week's edition of "Fashion Magazine".

522
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:33,551
<br>Take a look.

523
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,083
<br>It's written pretty well.

524
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:39,402
<br>Oh, especially page 100.

525
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,010
<br>Photographer: Li Xiao Yao

526
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,576
<br>That, um...

527
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,641
<br>I'm here to apply to be an assistant.

528
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:41,857
<br>Books say that

529
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:42,932
<br>"When you're in a bad mood

530
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,047
<br>eat a piece of chocolate".

531
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:45,765
<br>Books also say that

532
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:46,972
<br>"When you can't think of an idea

533
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,040
<br>eat a piece of chocolate

534
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,184
<br>and your thoughts will become clear".

535
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:52,034
<br>Thank you.

536
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:52,917
<br>No problem.

537
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,217
<br>It's expired.

538
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,492
<br>Just kidding.

539
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:08,567
<br>Continue working. <br><br>Continue working.

540
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,239
<br>Don't holler in the office.

541
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,211
<br>Carry. Carry.

542
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,558
<br>Don't drink so much alcohol.

543
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,393
<br>Alcohol is bad for the body.

544
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,647
<br>It'll make you older more quickly.

545
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:17,901
<br>I'm already 30. You're 20.

546
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,248
<br>This is a fact.

547
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:19,852
<br>If the attitude is young.

548
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:20,966
<br>The person would also become young. Yeah!

549
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,010
<br>My attitude is even older.

550
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,403
<br>It's about 50 years old.

551
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,610
<br>Why are you still here?

552
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,236
<br>Did you do this?

553
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,861
<Br>It's not bad.

554
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,115
<br>It's pretty late.

555
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:31,647
<br>Have you eaten yet?

556
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:40,843
<br>No.

557
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:43,861
<br><i>Say, I deserve</i>

558
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:49,520
<br><i>to be praised, to be cherished.</i>

559
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:53,242
<br>Got it!

560
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:54,496
<br>What's wrong...!

561
00:28:55,564 --> 00:29:00,069
<br><i>The utmost, memorable.</i>

562
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:02,830
<br>Last night...

563
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,691
<br>I have already thrown away

564
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,248
<br>the word "Love",

565
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:05,316
<br>ten years ago.

566
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:06,152
<br>Also, what happened last night

567
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:07,313
<br>doesn't count as anything.

568
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,289
<br>We really have nothing going on,

569
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,403
<br>right?

570
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,366
<br>Do you need me to say it twice?

571
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,806
<br>I don't like flowers.

572
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,553
<br>Useless actions.

573
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,846
<br>Stop thinking of tricks

574
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,239
<br>that appease little girls.

575
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,004
<br>I won't fall for them.

576
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,159
<br>33 presents.

577
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:33,784
<br>This way

578
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:35,642
<br>it doesn't matter it was birthdays before I met you

579
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:37,685
<br>or after.

580
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,796
<br>I would have celebrated for you.

581
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,555
<br>I'm the older sister. He's the little brother.

582
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:46,973
<br>Also

583
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:47,925
<br>he's younger than me by a lot of years.

584
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:48,296
<br>Why

585
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:49,040
<br>didn't you tell him just now

586
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,968
<br>that I was your boyfriend?

587
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:50,851
<br>Can you not

588
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,019
<br>always lose your temper like a kid?

589
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,684
<br>It makes me very tired!

590
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:57,724
<br>From today onwards,

591
00:29:57,724 --> 00:29:58,281
<br>I will use

592
00:29:58,281 --> 00:29:59,628
<br>the rest of my life

593
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:01,671
<br>to prove my sincerity to you.

594
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,024
<br>Please accept

595
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:05,688
<br>my marriage proposal.

596
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:06,385
<br>I always wished that

597
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:08,382
<br>we would be together in the future.

598
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:11,230
<br>But I was wrong.

599
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,772
<br>Our relationship

600
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:13,397
<br>was definitely a mistake.

601
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,069
<br>No.

602
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:18,552
<br>You're not wrong. I was wrong.

603
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:20,503
<br>I was completely wrong about you.

604
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:21,903
<br>Let's break up.

605
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,998
<br>Carry, just hold on a little longer.

606
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,413
<br>We'll be there soon. Hold it in!

607
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:38,521
<br>Careful!

608
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:40,890
<br>Are you an idiot?

609
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,772
<br>Donating that much blood.

610
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:43,497
<br>Do you think you're a "Blood Oxen"?

611
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:44,430
<br>I'm fine.

612
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,005
<br>My body is very healthy.

613
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:46,880
<br>As long as you're fine,

614
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,770
<br>no matter how big the sacrifice

615
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,645
<br>it's definitely worth it.

616
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:50,689
<br>What are you laughing at?

617
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,507
<br>Seeing me sick, are you happy?

618
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,061
<br>No, I...

619
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,310
<br>Happy birthday to you!

620
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:07,082
<br>Happy birthday to you!

621
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:12,608
<br>Happy birthday to Carry!

622
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:18,970
<br>Happy birthday to you!

623
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,571
<br><i> One orange balloon</i>

00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,828
<br>Xiao Yao, come karaoke with me.

648
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,757
<br>No, I asked first!

649
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:38,011
<br>I said it first! <br>I said it first!

650
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,497
<br>Alright, alright. <br><br>Don't argue.

651
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:41,308
<br>We'll eat first, then go karoaking after.

652
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:42,284

00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,692
<br>You just come and go.

656
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:49,157
<br>You didn't even tell me

657
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:50,782
<br>that you change your number.

658
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,664
<br>Hey, who do you think you are?

659
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:53,476
<br>Why are you so mean to our Xiao Yao?

660
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,510
<br>Xiao Yao, she's your older sister right?

661
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:02,253
<br>She isn't. She's...

662
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,830
<br>" Air".

663
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,454
<br>Do you know what "Air" is?

664
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,126
<br>"Air" means "doesn't exist".

665
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,705
<br>Also, you don't have to

666
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:12,144
<br>acknowledge her existance.

667
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,788
<br>But unfortunately,

668
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,878
<br>if there's no air,

669
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,340

00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:09,266
<br>Clear.

691
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,867

<br>And we have a difference of 10 years.

00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,794

<br>He can't take any mishap.

00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,888
<br>and the door opens,

778
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:29,817
<br>there would be a bodyguard

779
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,303
<br>rushing over there.

780
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:32,464

<br>You can't park here.

788
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:52,487
<br>The parking lot is over there on the left side.

789
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:53,130
<br>Okay?

790
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,338
<br>I'm really here to work.

791
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:55,313
<br>We are not hiring today.

792
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:56,149
<br>Take your helmet.

793
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,828
<br>Hurry and leave. <br><br>Wait...

794
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:59,167
<br>I'm making a phone call.

795
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,672
<br>Do you know him?

796
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,180
<br>He's Tong Tong's boyfriend.
