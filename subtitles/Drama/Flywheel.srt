1
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,154
All right, come on back.

2
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,773
Come on back.

3
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,905
Okay, whoa.

4
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,594
Yeah, it's good.

5
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:50,875
-What do I owe you?
-Forty's fine.

6
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:53,070
Here you go. Appreciate it.

7
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,502
-No problem.
-Thank you.

8
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,746
What is this?

9
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,582
1958 Triumph TR3,
two-door coupe.

10
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:08,717
Four in the floor, twin carburetor...

11
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,345
...electric overdrive.

12
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:12,904
How does it run?

13
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,999
It don't. At least, not yet.

14
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,303
That's what this man is for.
Gonna fix it up for me.

15
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,460
Jay, I知 your tune-up man.
I don't restore classic cars.

16
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:24,931
No, Max, you've worked miracles.

17
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,117
I know you can do it.

18
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,028
And he says that every time
he wants something he can't have.

19
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,608
It's a good car.

20
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,677
Clean interior, good stereo.

21
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:47,297
Low mileage for an '88 Honda.

22
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:51,465
What about the back end here?
Has it ever been wrecked?

23
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:52,906
No, I don't think so.

24
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,868
I think that was repainted
from scratches in the bumper.

25
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,004
I see that done pretty often.

26
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,266
You said you like the way it drives.

27
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,194
Yeah.

28
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,613
Tell you what.

29
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:13,747
You want the car,
I値l give you a tune-up and oil change...

30
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,265
...and a free car wash from my porter
any time you want it.

31
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,752
-All right, I値l take it.
-That's my man.

32
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:21,760
We can do the paperwork...

33
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,899
...you can show it off to your girlfriend
inside half an hour.

34
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,678
I don't have a girlfriend.

35
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,247
-Bernie.
-Jay.

36
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,218
Finally got a buyer for that Accord.

37
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:37,609
Hey, congratulations.

38
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,983
Didn't think that would stay
as long as it did.

39
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:41,578
Bernie, this is Scott.

40
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,268
Scott, Bernie Meyers,
one of our sales associates.

41
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:46,335
-Well, that's a great car.
-Thanks.

42
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,511
If I could get you to have a seat...

43
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,742
...and I need to see
your driver's license.

44
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:53,873
If you'll fill this form out,
just sign there, fill that out...

45
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,771
-...initial there and there.
-Driver's license.

46
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,691
Thank you. I値l be right back
while you do that.

47
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:03,507
I don't mean to be rude,
but what is this?

48
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,689
Oh, that's a retail-installment
contract...

49
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:08,056
...which says what you purchased
the car for.

50
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,538
Also a warranty disclaimer
and mileage statement.

51
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:14,336
Most people don't ask, they just sign.
You're smart to check before you sign.

52
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:15,532
Thanks.

53
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:18,620
This is really the first big purchase
I've ever made.

54
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,076
It痴 a good one.

55
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,204
You'll love it
and your friends will love you in it.

56
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,324
There's your driver's license.

57
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,702
Thank you, Scott. Congratulations.

58
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,789
-Thanks.
-You're the owner of a beautiful car.

59
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:33,720
-Take that girl for a ride.
-I don't--

60
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:35,991
Oh, right, no girlfriend.
At least not yet.

61
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,614
But a handsome guy like you,
a hot car like this...

62
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,053
...it's not gonna be long.

63
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,973
I know that's what my woman
always wanted.

64
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,138
A 1988 wrecked Honda.

65
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,988
Jay just sold the Accord.

66
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,616
-The wrecked one?
-Yup.

67
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,968
-Just cleared three on it.
-He did not.

68
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,467
Yeah, he did.

69
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,015
No way.

70
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,038
How does he do that?

71
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,148
Man, you are the king of cheese.

72
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:22,198
What does that mean?

73
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,472
-You just made $3000 off that car?
-That's why the sign says...

74
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,969
...Jay Austin Motors,
not Vince Berkley Motors.

75
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,761
Man, I didn't think we'd make
a thousand off that Honda.

76
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:32,094
Tell him it was wrecked?

77
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,402
No.

78
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,199
Man, you are slicker than snot
on an ice rink.

79
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,726
You're jealous.
You wouldn't have cleared two.

80
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,015
You amaze me.

81
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:46,496
Remind me to tell my friends
to never buy a car from this place.

82
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,800
All right, shut up and go sell a car.

83
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,191
Hey, Judy. Hey, Todd.
How y'all doing?

84
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,655
Hey, Bernie, Vince.
We're doing good, how are you?

85
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,220
Jay Austin Motors.

86
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,500
-What are y'all up to today?
-We're just out running errands.

87
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,858
We thought we'd see
if Jay needed something.

88
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,071
Have y'all eaten yet?

89
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,875
I just ate and Bernie,
he's always eating.

90
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,965
-If you want us to pick up something--
-No, no, no. Don't do that.

91
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,874
Thanks for the offer,
but Jay's the one who hadn't eaten.

92
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:17,306
Actually, me and Vince
were about to go outside.

93
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,666
-Dad?
-No, you--

94
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,376
You just do what you did last time.

95
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,605
See you, Judy. See you, Todd.

96
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,994
It's good to see you, guys.
Have a good day.

97
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,866
I致e already spent too much.

98
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,639
-Jay, what do you want for lunch?
-I don't care, just grab something.

99
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,776
No, do not do that.

100
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,305
I知 not spending any more
than my average.

101
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,393
How about a burger?

102
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,212
I don't care.

103
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,526
All right.

104
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,418
No. Don't let them do that to you.

105
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:46,919
You tell them you've already
gotten permission.

106
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,549
Doesn't matter. Make up something.

107
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,098
If he gives you a hard time,
you tell him to call me.

108
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:58,640
He can't deny you access to the lot,
he did it last year.

109
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,253
It doesn't matter.

110
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,761
How many you bringing back?

111
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,953
What year?

112
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:12,886
Yeah.

113
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,595
It is in good condition?

114
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:24,842
Fine. Look, when you come, just don't
get pulled over this time, all right?

115
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,503
Yes.

116
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,756
Good. Bye.

117
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:50,943
Vince, you gotta go get them.

118
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,531
That's why Bernie outsells you
every month.

119
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,374
I知 just honing my craft.

120
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,394
I値l be the main man soon.

121
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,811
Not by just standing around.

122
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,504
I知 not just standing here.

123
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:04,716
I知 watching the customer.

124
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:07,977
That way, I learn how to make
my best approach.

125
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:11,533
Every move I make is calculated.

126
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,308
Well, don't calculate too much,
all right?

127
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,900
All right.

128
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,924
Here's your lunch, Dad.

129
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,827
-Did you get me a burger?
-We got you a chicken sandwich.

130
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,227
I thought you were getting a burger.
Just put it on the desk.

131
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:03,482
Tell your mom I値l be home at 5.

132
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,761
I thought you were
coming home at 5.

133
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,072
I guess I知 late.

134
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:00,186
Does it not bother you
that you don't keep your word?

135
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:03,093
Don't start, Judy.

136
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,366
Guess not.

137
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,347
Why aren't you helping
set the table?

138
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,553
She asked me to do my homework.

139
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,631
Do your homework later.
Help your mother.

140
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:17,747
But Jeff's coming over.
He's spending the night.

141
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,199
Did you sell any cars today?

142
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,742
One.

143
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,543
Which one?

144
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,923
Black '88 Honda.

145
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:33,192
-The one that was wrecked?
-Yup.

146
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,463
How much?

147
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,139
-Does it matter?
-I知 just asking.

148
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,252
You don't wanna tell me.

149
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,926
-Six.
-Six thousand?

150
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,665
-You said that car wasn't worth three.
-Why do you care?

151
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,855
-It was worth 6000 to the buyer.
-The buyer know it was wrecked?

152
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,793
I致e had my mind on work all day,
I don't wanna talk now.

153
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,910
-No, you didn't tell him, did you?
-Why are you interrogating me?

154
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:59,750
-I知 a used-car salesman. I sell cars.
-At dishonest prices.

155
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,555
That's enough.

156
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,147
Shouldn't bother you.
I make more when I sell more.

157
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,449
You benefit from it.

158
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:15,177
Are we going to church tomorrow?

159
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:18,778
Did we go last week?

160
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,524
No.

161
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,111
We'll go tomorrow.

162
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,459
-E-5,
-Nope,

163
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:33,563
-C-3.
-Don't miss it,

164
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,268
Got one.

165
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,022
It's crazy,

166
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,293
'99 Chevy Blazer, 11,995,

167
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:43,941
Look, your dad's on TV again.

168
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,815
Yeah, I致e seen it.

169
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,224
'99 Ford F-150 T-cab, 14,995,

170
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,034
'02 Avalanche C-7 1, 25,995,

171
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,148
We're out of our minds,

172
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,322
Pick wheels,
I'll give you a deal,

173
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,371
Jay Austin Motors,

174
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,480
Is it weird seeing him on TV?

175
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:08,214
Not anymore. It used to be cool.

176
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:11,084
-So do you wanna sell cars too?
-I don't know.

177
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,828
It seems like it's hard...

178
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,652
...and I don't really wanna be
like my dad.

179
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,707
Why not?

180
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:20,491
Well, sometimes he lies to people.

181
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:21,674
What do you mean?

182
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,652
Well, sometimes
he doesn't tell them...

183
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:25,966
...if something's wrong
with the car and stuff.

184
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,994
-Like if the engine doesn't work?
-No, the engine works.

185
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,054
But it might have been wrecked
or have bad parts.

186
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:35,041
-And he sells them anyway?
-Yeah.

187
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,658
But they're used cars.

188
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:39,403
I know, but he makes people
pay too much.

189
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,895
I wanna do something different.

190
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:44,587
Yeah, I guess I would too.

191
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:00,612
Good morning.

192
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,926
Jeff, tell your mom I値l pick you up
after soccer on Thursday, okay?

193
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,634
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:09,234
-Jay Austin, it's good to see you.
-Morning, Reverend, how are you?

195
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,811
-Well. Judy, it's good to see you too.
-You too.

196
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,266
Todd, you're growing up.
Gonna be as tall as your dad.

197
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,974
-It痴 good to have all of you here.
-Thank you.

198
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:20,106
Jay, I知 getting ready to try to look
for a car for my daughter.

199
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:22,653
She's going to college.
Wonder if I could come by.

200
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:25,169
I got some sharp cars now.
Come any time you want.

201
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,346
-Thank you.
-Glad to.

202
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,389
Thank you.

203
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,314
Praise him, praise him

204
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,803
Jesus our blessed redeemer

205
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:53,229
-Todd, have you got your Bible?
-Yes, ma'am.

206
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,384
-What are we doing for lunch?
-Pizza at home...

207
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,340
...or we can grab something
on the way.

208
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,496
I'd rather do something else.

209
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:03,244
I wanna come back tonight
for the evening service.

210
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,406
I知 not coming back,
I致e got things to do.

211
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,859
On a Sunday? Jay.

212
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,888
I致e already tithed my time
to church this week.

213
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,596
Dad, what's a tithe?

214
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,383
It痴 when you give money
to help the church.

215
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:22,690
Or in our case, an empty envelope so
people think we give money to help.

216
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,403
Is that supposed to be funny?

217
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,600
You know,
I致e never thought it was funny.

218
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:28,041
We've given money before.

219
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:29,730
Oh, then I guess we're okay.

220
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,362
Your dad called tonight.

221
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,545
What did he say?

222
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:58,316
He wanted to know how we were.

223
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,921
What did you tell him?

224
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,065
I didn't know what to tell him,
to be honest, Jay.

225
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:06,709
Why didn't you just tell him
we're fine?

226
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,974
Are we?

227
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,857
Jay, your dad cares about you
very much.

228
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,659
He's never wanted anything
but the best for you.

229
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,500
You just need to talk to him.

230
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,706
My dad is still disappointed in me...

231
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:23,941
...and has been
since I was 18 years old.

232
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:27,753
That's because you were stubborn,
rebellious and never listened to him.

233
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:31,834
If he gave me the encouragement he
gives Joey, things would be different.

234
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,939
But your brother honored your father.

235
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:37,138
He at least showed him
enough respect to listen to him.

236
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,549
Okay, we're gonna talk about
something else.

237
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:49,608
Okay. When's the last time
you did something with Todd?

238
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,008
What do you mean?

239
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,312
Spending quality father-son time
with him.

240
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,014
I spend time with him.

241
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,594
I知 not talking about
when you're at the table.

242
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,033
I知 talking about investing time
with him, doing something worthwhile.

243
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,804
-Okay, why do you do that?
-Why do I do what?

244
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,916
Put me down
and try to embarrass me?

245
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:09,956
-I知 just asking a question.
-Well, I have a question.

246
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:13,294
You enjoy trying to embarrass me.

247
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:16,033
Is that a question or a statement?

248
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,547
It痴 a-- It痴--
Do you enjoy trying to embarrass me?

249
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,085
-See, that was a question.
-Okay, just forget it.

250
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,992
-No, I値l answer the question.
-I don't want you to answer.

251
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,396
-Then how about the statement?
-Forget it, Judy.

252
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,839
I知 just saying
you should make time for your son.

253
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:34,175
He looks up to you.

254
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:36,881
No, he doesn't.

255
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,119
Why would you say that?

256
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,893
-He said he doesn't.
-When?

257
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,071
Don't worry about it.

258
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,763
-Jay.
-What?

259
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:48,314
You're acting like you don't even care
about your own son.

260
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:54,357
He told Jeff that he did not want
to be like me...

261
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:59,305
...he did not wanna sell cars
and he did not think I was truthful.

262
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,991
Should he think you're truthful?

263
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,572
I知 not answering that question.

264
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,728
-Morning, Max.
-Jay.

265
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:31,554
You seen Bernie and Vince?

266
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,924
They went to test drive the Miata,
they'll be back in a few minutes.

267
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:38,512
Still working on this thing, huh?

268
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,066
You gave me quite a challenge
on this one.

269
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:45,474
Well, I知 wondering
if I made a mistake.

270
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:48,533
It just looked so good.
Price was right.

271
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:51,900
I was just hoping
we could get it going.

272
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,044
Give me a little longer.

273
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:56,651
Let me see what I can find.

274
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,526
We may have it running yet.

275
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,601
All right.

276
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,309
Just-- Move.

277
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:39,418
Man, I知 gonna
have to pry them out.

278
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,350
I got it.

279
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:49,235
You look like two marshmallows
trying to get out of a Hot Wheel.

280
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,032
That's not funny, Sam.

281
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,837
Yes, it is too.

282
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,008
Well, the good reverend
came after all.

283
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:14,330
-Jay, how's the car business today?
-We're making ends meet.

284
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:16,742
It痴 good to see you.
Tell me what I can do for you.

285
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:19,568
I知 looking for a car for my daughter.
She's our last one.

286
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:22,523
I wish she were here, but she's
out shopping with her mother.

287
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,616
I知 trying to find a good buy for her.

288
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:27,600
Well, let me commit
to giving you a good deal.

289
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:30,610
Hey, Bowers is having another sale.

290
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:32,348
So?

291
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,274
So I知 just saying.

292
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:35,940
Give me that last chip.

293
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:43,465
You fat, lazy, last-chip-eating punk.

294
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:45,943
Oh, like I gotta get on the ball.

295
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,781
You need to get on a treadmill.

296
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,239
What?

297
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,610
Hey, who's this guy?
I致e seen him before.

298
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:01,225
He's a minister, isn't he?

299
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:04,346
Oh, that's right.
He did Keith and Cindy's wedding.

300
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:05,437
Hey.

301
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,282
That would be my bag.

302
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,455
No, that's your bag.

303
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,882
Jay will probably give him a deal.

304
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:18,551
Twenty bucks says he doesn't.

305
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,663
You really think he's gonna stiff
a minister?

306
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:24,211
Twenty bucks says he will.

307
00:24:24,726 --> 00:24:26,693
You're on.

308
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:32,685
-These are pretty cars right here.
-You got a lot of nice cars today.

309
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:34,828
Jay, tell me about this Camry.

310
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,706
Camrys are good cars,
one of the most reliable on the road.

311
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,899
Lindsay has a friend that has one.
I know she's even driven it.

312
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,820
-Maybe we ought to take a look at it.
-It痴 open, let's look at it.

313
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:49,106
They're looking at the Camry.

314
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,291
I say he sells it to him.

315
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:53,713
Hey, what we get it for?

316
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,662
Sixty-five hundred.
It痴 got 89,000 miles on it.

317
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,448
He'll sell it for eight.

318
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:08,127
Seven.

319
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:11,312
I致e always liked the storage space,
dual airbags.

320
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,782
It痴 done real well in safety tests.

321
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:15,484
I know it's a really good car.

322
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,830
I知 just wondering if I should try
to find one with lower miles.

323
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,188
Camrys do real well.

324
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,998
Their early-'90 models
were doing a quarter million.

325
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:26,092
-Is that right?
-Yeah. Great retail value too.

326
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,229
I致e got $8500 in this car.

327
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,699
If you want it,
I値l give it to you for nine.

328
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,804
Would you let me take it out
for a drive?

329
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:36,225
Reverend, you can drive it all day
if you want to.

330
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,090
He's taking it for a drive.

331
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,346
This is where Jay
gets the papers ready.

332
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,701
Give me the forms
for the gold Camry.

333
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:51,012
Is he buying it?

334
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:53,750
He might.

335
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,428
You think he will.

336
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:57,926
I do.

337
00:25:58,134 --> 00:25:59,157
How do you know?

338
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,608
I sell cars for a living.

339
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,603
At what price?

340
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,631
We'll see.

341
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:13,983
Reverend, you bought a good car.

342
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,366
Thank you, I知 sure I did.
I know Lindsay will enjoy driving it.

343
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,037
I know she will.
I appreciate you coming to see me.

344
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,997
-Thank you.
-Let me walk out with you.

345
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,967
Thank you.

346
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,382
-Gentlemen.
-Good Reverend.

347
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:43,778
Good night.

348
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,634
-No way.
-Pay up, baby, I won.

349
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:48,599
You didn't say nine. You said eight.

350
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:51,566
-Closer than you were.
-We didn't say whoever's closest.

351
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,851
-You said he'd sell it for eight.
-I said he would stiff him, he did.

352
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:56,853
I知 not paying you a dime.

353
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,098
Well, then you're buying
me lunch tomorrow.

354
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:02,515
I知 not buying lunch either.
We both lost.

355
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,986
Well, I appreciate
all your help today.

356
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,482
I知 gonna go pick up Lindsay now,
she's gonna be excited to see this.

357
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:14,909
-She'll drop me off and I値l get my car.
-That's fine. Fine.

358
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,764
Jay, I thank you so much,
you've treated me so well today.

359
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:20,485
-I would like to do something for you.
-What's that?

360
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,379
I壇 like to pray and ask God
to bless you in your business.

361
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,766
-I壇 appreciate that.
-Let's pray.

362
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:30,267
Lord, today I come before you
and thank you for this day.

363
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,222
I thank you for Jay
and his business.

364
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:36,326
I thank you for this car for Lindsay
and I ask that you'll protect her...

365
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,913
...and give her grace
as she drives this car...

366
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:40,252
...and traveling mercies.

367
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:42,604
And, Lord, I ask that you treat Jay...

368
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,992
...just like he treated me today
in this deal.

369
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:48,756
-It痴 in your name I pray, Lord. Amen.
-Amen.

370
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,411
Thank you, Jay, for your help.

371
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:52,861
Appreciate it, Reverend.
Glad you came by.

372
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,570
Take care.

373
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:22,675
Maximus.

374
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,361
Bernie.

375
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:25,733
Max the Marvelous.

376
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:27,822
The Magnificent.

377
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:29,835
Max-a-roni.

378
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:32,597
You get it? Max-a-roni.

379
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,941
That was stupid.

380
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,999
What?

381
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:39,491
Now, there's the man.

382
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,858
Why are you always eating?
When was the last time you sold?

383
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:46,139
I sold two last week.

384
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:49,742
I got a guy coming in today
on the Jeep.

385
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:50,944
Looking or buying?

386
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:52,796
He might buy.

387
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:58,944
I didn't think you had it in you, Jay.

388
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:03,057
-What's that?
-The ability to stiff a minister.

389
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,120
You think I知 interested in making
the least amount of money we can?

390
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:10,279
Hey, I知 for making money.
I just thought you'd cut a deal.

391
00:29:10,588 --> 00:29:12,764
-And you would have?
-I壇 try to.

392
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:13,948
Bull.

393
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,569
Would you trust Bernie
to sell a car to your mother?

394
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,881
-To my mother?
-To your mother.

395
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,870
-No way.
-Oh, come on.

396
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:24,797
What's worse, overcharging
the reverend for a Camry, a good car...

397
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:27,119
...or squeezing that old lady
for the Marquis?

398
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,359
She wasn't that old.

399
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,887
-She was in her 70s.
-Late 50s.

400
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,068
Oh, please.

401
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,713
Maybe early 60s.

402
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:35,727
Don't wag your tongue
over the Camry.

403
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,753
You've ripped off more naive ladies
than anyone in Albany.

404
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,205
And stop judging me for something
you do yourself.

405
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,159
That old lady is probably
an honorable woman.

406
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:47,834
Husband probably served
in the military.

407
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,108
Or the ministry.

408
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:00,806
Jay Austin Motors.

409
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,008
This is Jay.

410
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:05,339
Mr. Austin, this is George MacDonald
from Franklin Bank and Trust.

411
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,327
I need to talk to you. Got a minute?

412
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,445
Yes, sir, what can I do for you?

413
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:18,419
I知 showing you're a month behind
on your payment for your lot...

414
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,436
...as well as your credit line.

415
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:24,104
And if I remember correctly, this is not
the first time this has happened.

416
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:26,048
Sir, we've had a pretty slow month.

417
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,402
Had extra expenses
we don't normally.

418
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:30,584
But I think we'll back
in a week or two.

419
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:32,231
I hope so.

420
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,147
It痴 not my intention to be cruel...

421
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:37,140
...but if you don't catch up
by the end of next month...

422
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:39,827
...we'll come get your cars
and close you down.

423
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,910
I understand, sir.

424
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:46,182
We're looking at a payment
of $32,400.

425
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:48,162
Yes, sir.

426
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,509
Thank you for your call.

427
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:52,062
Have a good day.

428
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:59,768
Todd, come to the table, please.

429
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,107
What is he doing?

430
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,095
He's building a volcano.

431
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:06,078
-A what?
-It痴 for his science project.

432
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,393
-He has to build--
-Todd, come to the table.

433
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,920
Jay, he's coming.
He's probably washing his hands.

434
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:12,108
We've got glue and paint
all over the place.

435
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:13,516
Glue and paint?

436
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,498
Yeah, you know,
you add baking soda...

437
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,089
...pour a little vinegar,
you get an eruption.

438
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,541
-You're not getting any on the carpet?
-No, sir.

439
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,627
Jay, we've got newspapers
and towels down.

440
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:24,104
He's being very careful.

441
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:27,327
We just finished paying for that carpet.
I wanna keep it clean.

442
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,048
Jay, will you stop worrying about
your precious carpet?

443
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,749
-Nothing's going to happen.
-What's with the attitude?

444
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:35,232
-I don't have attitude.
-You do have an attitude.

445
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:37,948
Should I not be concerned
about a $4000 investment?

446
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:40,373
Jay, just say the blessing.

447
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:43,194
Why don't you say the blessing?

448
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,753
Okay.

449
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,925
Dear God, thank you for this food,
your blessings...

450
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,279
...and the carpet
we're allowed to walk on.

451
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:55,329
May it serve us years to come
and be a beacon of hope...

452
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,154
...to all those who live in the house
after we're gone.

453
00:31:58,365 --> 00:31:59,935
Amen.

454
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:01,619
That was lame.

455
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,211
You're welcome to pray any time
you like.

456
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,089
Thank you for reminding me.

457
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:09,887
Dad, would you help me
with my project?

458
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,743
I知 getting tired of this
holier-than-thou attitude.

459
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:17,111
Mom, can I have cereal instead?

460
00:32:17,827 --> 00:32:19,066
Cereal?

461
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,313
Todd, honey,
I thought you liked pizza.

462
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:23,004
You want cereal over pizza?

463
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,410
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:26,769
I don't care.

465
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:30,060
Okay.

466
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:38,199
Did Reverend Michaels come by
to see you today?

467
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:40,848
He did.

468
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:43,466
And?

469
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,434
-And he bought a car.
-He did?

470
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,183
He did.

471
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,676
And you gave him a good deal,
right?

472
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:53,791
It痴 a good deal.

473
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,408
A good deal for him?

474
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,326
I see it's time
for my nightly interrogation.

475
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:01,082
Come on, you've never kept
this stuff from me before.

476
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,934
What did you charge him?

477
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,055
Nine thousand dollars.

478
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,242
And what did you get it for?

479
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,815
Sixty-five hundred.

480
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:15,777
-That doesn't sound like a deal.
-It was a deal for me.

481
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:19,071
Oh, great.
So now you're ripping off ministers.

482
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:24,081
I want you to shut up now.
The next time, you only open it to eat.

483
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,388
Do you understand me?

484
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,450
The best for your baby--

485
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:06,082
Listen, folks, Listen,

486
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,617
You're in the shape you're in today
because of the choices you've made,

487
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,946
Your marriage
is in the shape it is in today,,,

488
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:17,143
,,,because of the choices
you've made,

489
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,517
Your relationship with your wife
and with your children,,,

490
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:24,015
,,,is in the shape it's in
because of the choices you've made,

491
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,775
You're in financial bondage today
because of the choices you've made,

492
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,813
God's word would set you free
if you would read it,,,

493
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,448
,,,but you're in bondage
and you're trapped,,,

494
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:37,171
,,,and you're under all the dirt
and the stuff,,,

495
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:41,779
,,,and you feel like you're a slave
to your debt and to a relationship,,,

496
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:46,106
,,,because you've not listened
to the word of God,

497
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:49,507
And until you listen
to the word of God,,,

498
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,441
,,,you will make
the wrong choices,,,

499
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:55,306
,,,go down the wrong road,
lose your family, lose your home,,,

500
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,442
,,,lose your security,
your investments,,,

501
00:34:57,644 --> 00:35:00,941
,,,because God has a way
to live life,

502
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:06,040
And you and I cannot live life on
our terms and ask God to bless that,

503
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:09,639
And the reason that many people
that I'm talking to today,,,

504
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:12,863
,,,are in bondage
and in frustration and in defeat,,,

505
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:16,800
,,,is because you don't really
wanna know what God says,

506
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:21,668
And you don't wanna live it
God's way,

507
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:32,469
If any man is in Christ,
he is a new creation,

508
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:35,829
All things have passed away,

509
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:38,793
All things, not some things,

510
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,763
All things have become new,

511
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:35,415
When these came out,
no one could keep them.

512
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,632
I知 just telling you
they're great cars.

513
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,950
Well, you know that
or you wouldn't be interested in it.

514
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:45,432
Oh, I just love them.
They're so cute.

515
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,964
When we graduated two years ago,
my friend got one and she loves it.

516
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,850
I致e been amazed it has stayed
out here as long as it has.

517
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,096
Someone's gonna realize
what we've got...

518
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:56,386
-...and take it out of here.
-Really?

519
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:59,174
If I were able to get it,
you wouldn't have had a shot.

520
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,559
You're getting a corner
on an amazing vehicle.

521
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,230
I壇 like to get it, I just don't know
about the monthly payments.

522
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,876
You tell me you want this car...

523
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,086
...I will bend over to make it happen.

524
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,774
Oh, you're so sweet.

525
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,462
Hey, I just wanna see you get
the best car you can.

526
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:16,482
If I told you I could get the payments
under 250 a month...

527
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:19,579
-...would you be able to do that?
-Oh, well, actually...

528
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:22,671
...I was thinking
more like 150 a month.

529
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:26,862
I know it seems a lot, but I don't wanna
see you miss out on a deal like this.

530
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,494
It痴 rare to find one
in this good of condition.

531
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:31,197
I don't know.

532
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,023
Hey, let me see if I can get it
under 230 a month...

533
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:38,321
...throw in a free detail, fill it up.
We could be done the paperwork...

534
00:37:38,534 --> 00:37:41,787
...and you can be showing it off
to your boyfriend inside half an hour.

535
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,293
Okay. I mean, I guess I should take
advantage of this great sale.

536
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,642
Hey, that's right.
You've made a good decision.

537
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,010
I would have hated to see you
walk away from such a good deal.

538
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,911
I can't believe you sold her that car.

539
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,099
She told me she was just looking.

540
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,813
You're too nice to them, Vince.

541
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:28,695
I知 too nice?

542
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,257
Yeah, you gotta be
more aggressive.

543
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:34,921
Flatter the snot out of them
and just reel them in.

544
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:37,300
Hey, what did you clear?

545
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,501
-You wouldn't believe me.
-Bernie.

546
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,455
Five.

547
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,297
No, you didn't.

548
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,685
Bernie, tell me you didn't do that.

549
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:51,716
You made $5000 off that car?

550
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,991
I did. I知 bringing it in today, baby.

551
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:56,656
It痴 time for you to treat me
to a round of golf.

552
00:38:56,858 --> 00:39:00,825
You need to start selling some cars
like a big dog and buy your own round.

553
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:03,578
What's different about
that wall up there?

554
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,601
There was a clock there
or something.

555
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,887
Hey, Jay, did you take anything
off that wall?

556
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,176
You shouldn't have done that,
Bernie.

557
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:12,862
Shouldn't have done what?

558
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,678
Someone's gonna figure out
she got overcharged $4000...

559
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,138
-...and make an issue out of it.
-What?

560
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:21,862
Would you not kick the guy in the teeth
that overcharged your wife on a car?

561
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:24,323
-She's not married.
-That's not the point.

562
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,743
She's got a boyfriend, parents
or friends...

563
00:39:26,953 --> 00:39:28,994
...that are gonna figure out
she got sloshed.

564
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:32,630
Who you talking to? I just made a
profit and I知 getting slammed for it?

565
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:35,380
Bernie, it's not the profit,
it's the way you got it.

566
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,600
Since when did you become
a Boy Scout?

567
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,555
You don't think you did
anything wrong?

568
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,516
When Jay Austin pulls in a few
thousand, it's good business...

569
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:45,736
...but when Bernie Meyers does it,
it's ripping people off?

570
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,933
You grossly manipulated her.
s
571
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:49,948
You taught me how.

572
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,203
I don't know what game this is,
but you've got different rules.

573
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:00,642
All right, that's it.
We're not gonna talk about this now.

574
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:06,351
What the heck was that?

575
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:08,738
I don't know.

576
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,019
No, I知 not doing this.

577
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:13,911
If he starts unloading trash on me,
I知 out of here.

578
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:16,428
He's no saint.

579
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:03,089
You look like you just got out of a fight
where everybody had a stick but you.

580
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:07,608
-How's it going, Max?
-I don't know yet.

581
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,841
I keep thinking I got it figured out...

582
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:13,059
...but I keep being wrong.

583
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,737
That's true for both of us.

584
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,272
You got something
you can't fix either?

585
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,523
Several things.

586
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:25,106
At least I think I know how to fix them,
but I keep being wrong.

587
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,506
We both sound pretty pathetic.

588
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,727
Is that worth the time
you're putting in?

589
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:40,504
Well, I think the flywheel
may be stripped.

590
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,844
Don't tell me you don't know
what a flywheel is.

591
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:46,313
I don't.

592
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,423
How long you been selling cars?

593
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,425
Tell me what a flywheel is.

594
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:58,707
When you put the key in the ignition,
that sends power to the starter.

595
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,582
The starter engages your flywheel,
your flywheel turns your crankshaft...

596
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,190
...and your crankshaft starts
your engine.

597
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,763
Without your flywheel,
you're not going anywhere.

598
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:10,294
So can we get a new one?

599
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:11,840
Well, we may need to.

600
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,909
I hoped it was
something easier to get to.

601
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:17,786
Flywheel is sandwiched in between
the engine and the transmission.

602
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:20,327
I値l have to drop the transmission
to get to it.

603
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,770
Well, if there's anybody that can do it,
it's you, Max.

604
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:28,275
Then at least one of us
will have our problems fixed.

605
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:36,325
You seem to be carrying
a heavy load lately.

606
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,521
You okay?

607
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:46,578
Not really, to be honest.

608
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:55,006
I cannot remember the last time
I felt like my life was going right.

609
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,765
So I should pray for you.

610
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,783
Maybe you should pray for you.

611
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:04,858
I don't know about that.

612
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,621
Why not?

613
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,935
I don't think God will listen
right now.

614
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:12,541
What do you mean?

615
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:19,452
I mean, he knows
I知 not an honest man.

616
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:25,164
He knows I知 a lousy husband
and father.

617
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,011
He knows how selfish
and prideful I am.

618
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:40,127
I don't even like myself, Max.

619
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:46,914
I致e got friction with almost
every person in my life.

620
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,833
I owe money to the bank
that I don't have.

621
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,536
I知 an old man, Jay.

622
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:02,415
There's some things I wish
I壇 have gotten right decades ago.

623
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:04,716
But my pride got in the way.

624
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:07,555
But when I learned
to let the Lord run my life...

625
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:10,671
...my life got a whole lot better.

626
00:44:10,872 --> 00:44:13,141
I don't mean to preach at you...

627
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,477
...but I just know I needed him.

628
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,246
Frankly, I壇 say
that we all need him.

629
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:24,463
You know, this is a beautiful car.

630
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:27,336
Still got a good engine.

631
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:30,514
But until we get that piece
that fixes the engine...

632
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:33,119
...it's not going anywhere.

633
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:14,505
O Lord...

634
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:20,087
...I don't want your face
against me.

635
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,430
I need you.

636
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:30,973
I知 sorry.

637
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:48,053
Help me, Lord.

638
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,831
Help me get back in your will.

639
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:58,269
I want to be a good man.

640
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:03,358
Help me, Jesus.

641
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:09,296
You're in charge now.

642
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,011
You're the boss.

643
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:24,400
I didn't expect to see you home
so early.

644
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:26,900
Can we talk?

645
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,211
Sure.

646
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:32,151
Would you come sit with me?

647
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,217
I know I hurt you terribly last night.

648
00:47:50,148 --> 00:47:52,655
I was wrong to do that and I'm sorry.

649
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,447
You're apologizing to me?

650
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,821
I am.

651
00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:00,514
Is something wrong with you?

652
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,522
There is.

653
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,639
Jay, are you--? Are you dying?

654
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,689
No. No.

655
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:23,021
What's wrong with me is that
I have been living for myself.

656
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,197
I have not been the husband
I need to be.

657
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,773
I have not been the father
I need to be...

658
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:31,878
...the spiritual leader I need to be.

659
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,989
Today, I asked God to forgive me.

660
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:40,215
I have gotten myself in a mess
in almost every area of my life...

661
00:48:40,428 --> 00:48:42,761
...and I can't fix it.

662
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:45,564
I admit that I have not been worthy
of honor...

663
00:48:46,074 --> 00:48:49,705
...or respect,
or the love of my family.

664
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,343
But I want to be.

665
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:54,647
Jay....

666
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:57,915
Judy, I知 asking you to pray for me.

667
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:00,491
I need you.

668
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:03,627
I need you terribly.

669
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:08,635
I am resolving to let Jesus be
lord of my life.

670
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:10,107
Every day.

671
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,978
-You're serious.
-I am serious.

672
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:18,021
I will be honest in my business.

673
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:21,597
I will take responsibility
as the spiritual leader of my home.

674
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:27,977
I will love you, I will love Todd,
and I will love our baby.

675
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,814
So help me God, I will.

676
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:09,276
''Blessed is the man who does not
walk in the counsel of the wicked,,,

677
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:14,289
,,,or stand in the way of sinners
or sit in the seat of mockers,

678
00:50:14,493 --> 00:50:16,826
But his delight
is in the law of the Lord,

679
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:20,562
And on his law,
he meditates day and night,

680
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,901
He is like a tree planted
by streams of water,,,

681
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:28,643
,,,which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither,

682
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,788
Whatever he does prospers,

683
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,514
Not so the wicked,

684
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:36,822
They are like chaff
that the wind blows away,

685
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,936
Therefore, the wicked will not stand
in the judgment,,,

686
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,973
,,,nor sinners in the assembly
of the righteous,

687
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:46,306
For the Lord watches
over the way of the righteous,,,

688
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:49,748
,,,but the way of the wicked
will perish, ''

689
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:59,194
All right, Lord,,,

690
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,240
,,,this is your lot,

691
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,407
I will honor you with it,

692
00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:19,824
Max. I知 a little low
on transmission fluid.

693
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:22,231
How about hooking me up, man?

694
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,307
Where were you?

695
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:31,390
What are you talking about?

696
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,327
You said the Corner Cafe at 9:00.

697
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:36,009
No, I said be at the Biscuit Barn at 9.

698
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:38,378
-The Biscuit Barn?
-Yeah.

699
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:39,886
So where are the biscuits?

700
00:51:39,885 --> 00:51:42,900
I didn't feel like a biscuit,
so I went to Pearly's.

701
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,420
What did you get at Pearly's?

702
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,022
A biscuit.

703
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,275
You're a goober.

704
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:53,234
I know.

705
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:55,476
But at least I got a biscuit.

706
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,179
But I was there at 9 and you weren't.

707
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:01,905
I was at the Corner Cafe at 9.
And you better be there tomorrow at 9.

708
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:04,154
How about being at work
at 9 tomorrow?

709
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,267
Jay's cracking the whip again.
We better stop being lazy.

710
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,112
-You admitting that you're lazy?
-Well, no.

711
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,528
I know it may look like it sometimes,
but I like to think of myself...

712
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:18,181
...as a hardworking man
trapped in a lazy man's body.

713
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:20,792
I致e always thought of myself
as tan body builder...

714
00:52:21,093 --> 00:52:22,893
...trapped in a chubby man's body.

715
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,202
Sam, anything we should know?

716
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,893
I知 just a black man
in a black man's body...

717
00:52:30,096 --> 00:52:33,910
...working with a bunch
of strange white boys.

718
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,923
Would you mind getting Max?
I壇 like for us to have a talk.

719
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,964
Sure.

720
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,503
-With all of us?
-Yep.

721
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:44,850
What is this about?
Are we in trouble?

722
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:49,241
-I値l tell you when Max gets here.
-I知 planning to be here at 9 tomorrow.

723
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:50,847
I could get a biscuit earlier.

724
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:56,561
-Or I don't have to get a biscuit at all.
-It痴 not about the biscuits, Vince.

725
00:52:57,172 --> 00:52:59,947
If this is about Bernie scraping
the side of the Tahoe...

726
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:02,286
...that was an accident. I was there.

727
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:05,662
-He was only trying to park it--
-Vince, shut up.

728
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,182
-You gonna tell me about that?
-Of course I was.

729
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:15,401
Morning, Max.

730
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:18,684
Thanks for coming in,
this shouldn't take but a minute.

731
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:24,042
I壇 like to start by apologizing
to each of you.

732
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:26,824
Apologizing? For what?

733
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,559
This is my business.

734
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:32,744
For two years, I have not been
running it honestly or respectfully.

735
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:35,859
I wanna say I'm sorry
to each of you...

736
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:37,601
...for being a bad example.

737
00:53:37,903 --> 00:53:39,601
You've got to be kidding me.

738
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:44,893
I壇 also like to say that from now on,
we'll be selling cars at honest prices.

739
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,401
What does that mean?

740
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:49,108
It means you get a fair commission
off a fair sale.

741
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:51,918
Well, who determines
what fair means?

742
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:56,579
Well, if you bought the car that you're
trying to sell from another salesman...

743
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,812
...what would you feel okay
with him making?

744
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:01,896
That stinks.

745
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:03,733
What are you doing, Jay?

746
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,378
I知 changing the way we operate.

747
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,356
-By stripping our commissions away?
-Not necessarily.

748
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:10,499
So we're supposed to accept
your apology...

749
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,504
...while cutting our salaries in half?

750
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,185
Work hard, you can make
the same you're making now...

751
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,489
-...and with a clear conscience.
-Who cares?

752
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,107
I have to make a living for my family
and you're taking food off my table.

753
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:22,784
I知 not out to hurt your family.

754
00:54:22,985 --> 00:54:26,156
But I have every intention of running
an honest business from now on.

755
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:29,973
Jay, I sell cars for you,
I organize all your promotions.

756
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,122
I make you look good
in this community.

757
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:35,029
The last thing you should be doing
is cutting my salary.

758
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:38,408
I can make twice this right down
the road at any of your competitors.

759
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:41,319
-I don't disagree.
-Why are you shooting us in the foot?

760
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:43,661
Don't change anything.
We're doing fine.

761
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:45,570
I want a clean conscience
before God.

762
00:54:45,777 --> 00:54:47,840
Oh, come on. This isn't a church.

763
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:50,049
Bernie, I don't think this
is a bad move.

764
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:52,291
Of course you don't.
You two aren't salesmen.

765
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:54,378
Your income stays the same.

766
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,642
Yours could too, Bernie.

767
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:58,052
Only if I work my tail off.

768
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:01,331
So we're changing prices
on the cars?

769
00:55:04,354 --> 00:55:06,591
We'll be doing that today.

770
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:08,860
No. I don't like this.

771
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:12,448
Either you're gonna keep the same
commission on every car we sell...

772
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:15,655
...or you're gonna raise our salaries
to make up the difference.

773
00:55:17,674 --> 00:55:19,738
No.

774
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:30,824
Well, you just got one
less salesman.

775
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,347
-You're quitting?
-I知 quitting.

776
00:55:36,552 --> 00:55:40,556
I知 not playing this game anymore.
If you're smart, you'll quit too.

777
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,272
-You don't have to leave, Vince.
-Vince, don't be a fool.

778
00:55:44,484 --> 00:55:47,689
You will never make a living here.
He's gonna make it impossible.

779
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:49,528
You could still be successful here.

780
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:51,676
You've got opportunity
when Bernie walks.

781
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:56,524
Why waste time? We can make twice
what we're making here at Bowers.

782
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:59,441
Vince, you can stay.

783
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:01,774
Come on, Vince.

784
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:04,932
Vince.

785
00:56:06,777 --> 00:56:07,801
I知 sorry, Jay.

786
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:09,615
I can't do this.

787
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:20,718
You've wasted two years
of my life, Jay.

788
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:30,100
Sam?

789
00:56:30,301 --> 00:56:32,574
I told you those were strange
white boys.

790
00:56:39,157 --> 00:56:41,216
I値l tell you, Vince, Bowers is hiring.

791
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:45,416
I知 about to ride down there right now
and you better go with me.

792
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:48,684
-You think we did the right thing?
-Yeah, we did the right thing.

793
00:56:48,894 --> 00:56:51,864
Unless you wanna stay here
and work harder for less money.

794
00:56:52,064 --> 00:56:54,623
This ship is sinking, man.

795
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:04,498
Hey, did you hook me up?

796
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:07,430
Yeah, I hooked you up.

797
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:19,476
Where did you go?

798
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:22,089
Come to the window
if you wanna see the big show.

799
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:23,924
What?

800
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:26,761
What did you do?

801
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,089
-I left Bernie with a little parting gift.
-What's that?

802
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:32,097
I hooked his brake pedal
to his horn.

803
00:57:32,604 --> 00:57:34,594
No, you didn't.

804
00:57:47,225 --> 00:57:48,887
You guys are something else.

805
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:52,426
That's not funny, Max.

806
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:09,785
Sam, I need your help.
I知 gonna make you a car salesman.

807
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,790
I知 not a car salesman.

808
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,463
I値l give you a raise.

809
00:58:14,163 --> 00:58:17,967
Then again,
I might be a pretty good car salesman.

810
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:22,402
I知 not kidding.

811
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:24,581
Both of them quit and walked out.

812
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,270
So, what are you gonna do?

813
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:28,784
Sell cars by myself.

814
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,783
Sam will be able to help some.

815
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:34,216
-Are you nervous about all this?
-Yes.

816
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,726
But if I go under,
it's because God allowed it.

817
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:38,921
I told him it was his lot now.

818
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:41,435
Then don't worry about it.

819
00:58:41,837 --> 00:58:43,965
I知 trying not to.

820
00:58:44,174 --> 00:58:47,041
I need to stay until 7 today.
I gotta do some of Bernie's work.

821
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:49,214
Okay. I値l see you tonight.

822
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:52,181
I love you. Bye.

823
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:09,569
Hello, Papa? It痴 Judy.

824
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:11,179
Do you have a minute?

825
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:22,193
-That's a flywheel for a TR3?
-Yep. That's the real thing.

826
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,296
-Same model?
-Same model.

827
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:26,595
Where did you get it?

828
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:29,236
A friend of mine had it in his shop.

829
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,909
No charge.

830
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:33,539
All I had to do was ask.

831
00:59:55,703 --> 00:59:56,728
Dad?

832
00:59:56,937 --> 00:59:58,530
Hello, Jay.

833
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,368
What are you doing here?

834
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:02,907
I wanted to talk to you,
if you have a minute.

835
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:05,977
You drove down from Atlanta
to talk to me?

836
01:00:06,183 --> 01:00:07,613
I did.

837
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,482
-You wanna sit down?
-Yes, thank you.

838
01:00:15,221 --> 01:00:16,383
Is Mom okay?

839
01:00:17,725 --> 01:00:19,818
She's fine, son.

840
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:22,825
I wanted to come down
to see you today.

841
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,056
I got a call from Judy this morning.

842
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:28,565
She told me about
some decisions you've made.

843
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,663
She said you've made
quite a change in direction.

844
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,844
And you've even decided
to make Jesus lord of your life.

845
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:39,004
Yes, sir.

846
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:42,982
Jay, did you really mean that?

847
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,483
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

848
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:49,615
I have to admit I was thrilled
when I got that call.

849
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:54,254
Your mom and I have prayed
about this for a long time.

850
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:58,226
Dad...

851
01:00:59,168 --> 01:01:01,500
...I know I've been difficult...

852
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:04,501
...and I know I have been stubborn.

853
01:01:06,607 --> 01:01:08,576
You have been a good father to me.

854
01:01:14,413 --> 01:01:16,313
I知 sorry I was that difficult.

855
01:01:16,517 --> 01:01:18,677
Jay, I didn't come for an apology.

856
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:20,283
I came to encourage you...

857
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:23,684
...and to tell you
how proud I am of you.

858
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:42,340
Lord, I thank you for my son, Jay...

859
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:45,207
...and I thank you
that he's turned his heart to you.

860
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:49,373
Thank you for receiving him
and cleansing him...

861
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,882
...and directing his path.

862
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:55,783
I praise you, Lord,
for what you've done in him.

863
01:01:56,157 --> 01:01:59,060
Now, Lord, in your name,
I bless him with courage...

864
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,855
...with faith and with integrity.

865
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:08,659
Lord, I call him a man of strength,
of love and grace.

866
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,336
I ask as his earthly father...

867
01:02:10,535 --> 01:02:13,098
...that you would rain down favor
on him.

868
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:17,266
That he would know
that he is loved and treasured.

869
01:02:17,475 --> 01:02:20,378
That you would bless
whatever he touches.

870
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:24,139
This is my son, Lord,
and I give him back to you.

871
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,086
Lord, I love him.

872
01:02:27,287 --> 01:02:29,881
Keep him and bless him.

873
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,753
in Jesus' name. Amen.

874
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,396
I love you, son.

875
01:03:05,591 --> 01:03:06,559
What are you reading?

876
01:03:07,761 --> 01:03:10,025
A book on Vesuvius.

877
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:12,965
Vesuvius? What's that?

878
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:17,068
It痴 a volcano
that destroyed a whole village in ltaly.

879
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:20,805
I didn't know you were interested
in that. Why are you reading that?

880
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:23,366
It痴 for my science project.

881
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:42,817
When did you do this?

882
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:46,728
I致e been working on it for a few days.
Mom helped me.

883
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:51,600
It痴 incredible.

884
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:07,187
Todd...

885
01:04:09,122 --> 01:04:12,785
...I don't think that
I have been a very good dad to you.

886
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,289
And...

887
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,693
...well, I wanna be.

888
01:04:19,664 --> 01:04:25,128
So I have asked God
to help me do better.

889
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:28,236
And if it's okay with you...

890
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:31,606
...I壇 like to hang out with you
a little bit more.

891
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:33,410
Okay.

892
01:04:36,016 --> 01:04:37,143
Okay.

893
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:40,651
I知 impressed with your volcano.

894
01:04:42,924 --> 01:04:44,552
Good night, buddy.

895
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,835
I am really out of touch with my son.

896
01:04:57,336 --> 01:04:59,166
That can change.

897
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:02,833
It will change.

898
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,373
Will you be able to handle the lot
without more help?

899
01:05:08,582 --> 01:05:10,671
I can't afford more help.

900
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,944
I致e already given Sam a small raise
to help me sell.

901
01:05:14,756 --> 01:05:16,986
Unless there's some
hardworking guy out there...

902
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:20,283
...who'll wanna work for peanuts,
we're on our own.

903
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,818
Why don't you ask God
for someone like that?

904
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,760
Well, I can...

905
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:29,732
...but who would do that?

906
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:52,527
-Good morning.
-Hi, I知 looking for Jay Austin.

907
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:54,715
-You found him.
-Oh, hi, I知 Kevin Cantrell.

908
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:56,949
Hello, Kevin Cantrell.
What can I do for you?

909
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:59,465
Well, you can give me a job
if you have an opening.

910
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,311
-Looking for a job?
-If you're hiring.

911
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:04,522
Why don't you have a seat?

912
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,740
I知 between semesters
and I got about six weeks.

913
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:11,021
I致e always wanted
to see how I壇 do at sales.

914
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:14,476
-You're looking for a job for six weeks?
-Right.

915
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,060
Kevin, I could use some help
around here...

916
01:06:17,263 --> 01:06:19,170
...but I need it
for more than six weeks.

917
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:21,977
I understand,
but I知 a really fast learner...

918
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:25,570
...and I wanna have my own lot one
day, so I壇 work really hard for you.

919
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,846
-But six weeks.
-You could pay me minimum wage.

920
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:31,535
Come on. I wanna sell a car so badly,
I can taste it.

921
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:33,871
-Minimum wage?
-That's right.

922
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:35,520
Here's my resume and references.

923
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,998
I知 available
any time you can schedule me.

924
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:42,121
-Six weeks.
-Minimum wage.

925
01:06:49,028 --> 01:06:50,362
Come on.

926
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:57,759
That's good. All right, we're gonna
do the same thing with the Taurus.

927
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,512
-We're gonna put it right here.
-Okay.

928
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:10,530
I値l be right back.

929
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:56,447
So how long you been here?

930
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:59,684
-I致e been here about two years.
-You like it here?

931
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:02,578
I do.

932
01:08:02,785 --> 01:08:06,115
Albany's a good-sized city
that still has the feel of a small town.

933
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,639
I like the pace.
Just wish I could sell more cars.

934
01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:14,032
Speaking of selling cars,
I wanted to ask you.

935
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,770
You don't seem to be getting
as much as you could.

936
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,564
If I sold one for a little more,
could I keep the rest as commission?

937
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,698
Kevin, we're not gonna go that route.

938
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,555
We're gonna charge what
we'd feel good about being charged.

939
01:08:26,763 --> 01:08:28,588
I知 gonna stick
to the fair market value.

940
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:31,514
You can get away
with pushing a little bit.

941
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:33,115
I mean, don't you need money?

942
01:08:34,053 --> 01:08:37,482
I do, but I've gotta live
with how I run this place.

943
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:39,468
I just don't want any more regrets.

944
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,147
I知 sticking
to the highest standard I can.

945
01:08:42,445 --> 01:08:45,035
You treat people right,
it'll come back to you.

946
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:53,764
You're dying to drive that car,
aren't you?

947
01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:56,388
I am.

948
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:59,123
Why don't you take off?
I can lock up.

949
01:09:01,923 --> 01:09:04,009
You remember
how to do the paperwork?

950
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:07,275
I sold the Bronco yesterday
and I didn't have a problem.

951
01:09:09,352 --> 01:09:12,107
Okay, but if you have any questions,
you ask Sam, all right?

952
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:14,509
I値l be fine.

953
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,764
Just lock both doors
and don't forget the alarm.

954
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:03,083
Check out this '02 Yukon
for just 25,995.

955
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,451
It痴 phenomenal.

956
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:08,978
Or this '99 Mustang GT,
sliced down to 10,950.

957
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:13,536
How about this '02 F-250 diesel
for just 28,995?

958
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:17,192
And if you act now, we'll throw in a
free chassis-treatment undercoating...

959
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:19,197
...guaranteed not to rot, rust, bump...

960
01:10:19,403 --> 01:10:22,853
...chip, pop, stain, crack or peel,
unless it comes in contact with water.

961
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,087
That's a Butch Bowers
factory guarantee,

962
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,484
You won't find a better deal,

963
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:32,065
I'm Butch Bowers,
and you can bet on it,

964
01:10:36,894 --> 01:10:39,599
Well, I致e said so long
to Max and Sam.

965
01:10:41,081 --> 01:10:42,621
Well, Kevin, I hate to lose you.

966
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:45,435
Well, I知 just sorry
I couldn't sell more cars for you.

967
01:10:45,838 --> 01:10:48,181
I didn't sell many either.
But you kept your word.

968
01:10:48,384 --> 01:10:51,996
-Worked hard for me. I appreciate it.
-Well, thanks for the opportunity.

969
01:10:52,609 --> 01:10:57,155
You know, I have to admit,
working here has been a little bit...

970
01:10:57,364 --> 01:10:59,171
...different than what I expected.

971
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:01,820
-Well, what'd you expect?
-I don't know.

972
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:05,339
I guess I halfway expected
you'd be a little bit more strategic...

973
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,913
...with the way you sell cars.

974
01:11:07,116 --> 01:11:09,788
-Strategic?
-Okay, devious.

975
01:11:10,668 --> 01:11:11,899
I understand.

976
01:11:12,108 --> 01:11:14,987
Well, you're not a bad guy
and I知 glad I met you.

977
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,167
Well, I知 grateful for your approval.

978
01:11:17,802 --> 01:11:20,073
-Drop us a line sometime.
-I will.

979
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:22,354
Take care of yourself.

980
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:27,914
Jay Austin Motors.

981
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:31,528
Hello, Mr. MacDonald, how are you?

982
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:35,448
Yes. I realize that.

983
01:11:36,227 --> 01:11:37,793
That'd be fine.

984
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,185
You can come
whenever it's convenient.

985
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:44,300
Very good.

986
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:53,180
Twelve thousand dollars
is a good start, Mr. Austin.

987
01:11:53,385 --> 01:11:55,152
That's about a third of what you owe.

988
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:58,238
You're behind with your floor plan,
your mortgage...

989
01:11:58,443 --> 01:12:01,986
...your checking account's overdrawn
and your insurance is fixing to lapse.

990
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:06,614
Well, we didn't sell cars
like we normally do this time of year.

991
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:08,014
That's why I知 behind.

992
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:10,759
I don't suppose I can
talk you into a few more weeks?

993
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:15,327
Mr. Austin, the bank's been gracious
in giving you some extra time.

994
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,769
But unless
you have the money by Friday...

995
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:20,317
...I値l have to come get your cars.

996
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,289
I understand.

997
01:12:22,502 --> 01:12:25,970
I知 sorry it's come to this.
I wish you luck.

998
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:29,022
And I appreciate you
meeting with me today.

999
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,663
So, what's the plan?

1000
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,595
Max, I never thought
I壇 be saying this.

1001
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,123
We might not have a lot next week.

1002
01:12:55,726 --> 01:13:00,499
We'd have to sell almost every car on
the lot to pay all our debts and bills.

1003
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:03,227
I知 not sure what I知 gonna do.

1004
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:06,663
Well, I知 going fishing.

1005
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:12,796
Well, I gave this lot to the Lord.

1006
01:13:14,078 --> 01:13:16,629
I guess he can do
whatever he wants to with it.

1007
01:13:17,886 --> 01:13:21,835
Don't you quit yet.
Let's see what the Lord does.

1008
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,620
I wish I had more faith.

1009
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:37,356
''Trust in the Lord
with all your heart...

1010
01:13:37,563 --> 01:13:40,432
...and lean not
on your own understanding.

1011
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:43,962
in all your ways, acknowledge him
and he will make your paths straight.''

1012
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:47,763
See? It says to trust in the Lord
with all your heart.

1013
01:13:48,535 --> 01:13:50,364
That's not the part
that hits me so hard.

1014
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:53,197
It痴 the ''lean not
on your own understanding'' part.

1015
01:13:53,404 --> 01:13:56,859
You're not thinking about getting
another emergency loan, are you?

1016
01:13:57,072 --> 01:13:58,537
No.

1017
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:01,861
It痴 crossed my mind,
but I know that's not the answer.

1018
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:03,833
It痴 his lot, Jay.

1019
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,701
It痴 his lot.

1020
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:09,871
I知 tired of worrying about money,
anyway.

1021
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:12,404
That's because
it's always been our money.

1022
01:14:13,374 --> 01:14:16,104
What, instead of God's money
that he allows us to use?

1023
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:18,068
Now, there's a thought.

1024
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:20,902
That's the right mindset.

1025
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,774
It just feels so backwards
to think that way.

1026
01:14:24,843 --> 01:14:26,279
Or maybe it's the normal way...

1027
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,446
...and we've just been
doing it backwards this whole time.

1028
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:33,811
I致e been going backwards so long,
it's a rush to go forwards.

1029
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,131
This is from Psalms 3 7.

1030
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:52,170
''Delight yourself in the Lord...

1031
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:54,664
...and he will give you
the desires of your heart.

1032
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:58,407
Commit your way to the Lord,
trust in him, and he will do this.

1033
01:14:58,614 --> 01:15:01,204
He will make your righteousness
shine like the dawn...

1034
01:15:01,407 --> 01:15:03,995
...the justice of your cause
like the noonday sun.

1035
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:07,975
Be still before the Lord
and wait patiently for him.''

1036
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:14,263
The desire of my heart
would be to finish well.

1037
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:19,499
If I have to change jobs, I壇 wanna
do it in a more honorable way.

1038
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:23,136
instead of getting kicked out
because I couldn't pay my debts.

1039
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:26,238
All you have to do is be still.

1040
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:32,214
My car has rockets
coming out the back.

1041
01:15:32,422 --> 01:15:35,151
Oh, yeah?
Well, my car's got a missile on the top.

1042
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:38,126
Yeah, so? Mine goes faster.

1043
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:40,129
Let me see that.

1044
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:42,529
Hey, that's not bad.

1045
01:15:42,737 --> 01:15:45,203
-Where'd you learn to draw?
-I don't know.

1046
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:46,565
That's pretty good.

1047
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:49,642
I知 gonna have to put that on the wall
when you're done.

1048
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:53,246
You stay right here, okay?

1049
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:58,118
Hey, Mary, how are you?

1050
01:16:01,164 --> 01:16:04,624
-Fine.
-All right, Mary.

1051
01:16:13,746 --> 01:16:15,875
I知 not here to make a payment.

1052
01:16:17,252 --> 01:16:18,776
I知--

1053
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,786
I知 here to give the car back.

1054
01:16:26,466 --> 01:16:28,434
Can you tell me what's going on?

1055
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:32,005
I知 so far behind on payments.

1056
01:16:32,674 --> 01:16:36,511
-I can't get caught up.
-Mary, you only owe $1265.

1057
01:16:36,946 --> 01:16:38,678
I know.

1058
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:40,313
I just can't afford it...

1059
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:43,956
...because my husband's been out
of work for a couple of months, and--

1060
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,493
It just seems like every week,
there's a new bill.

1061
01:16:46,698 --> 01:16:49,495
One on top of another,
and we just can't get caught up.

1062
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,362
My son, he's sick...

1063
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:55,032
...and we're going back and forth
to the doctor in Atlanta...

1064
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:58,442
...and I don't know what else to do.
I don't know what we're gonna do.

1065
01:17:00,353 --> 01:17:02,407
The car's been great.

1066
01:17:03,387 --> 01:17:04,353
I just--

1067
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:07,320
I don't know what to say,
I知 so sorry.

1068
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:15,693
I mean, I just feel like I'm making
the right decision here. I really--

1069
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:36,899
Mary...

1070
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:43,140
...I believe you.

1071
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:45,475
I know you're behind...

1072
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:49,910
...but you have been
one of my best customers.

1073
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:54,889
And I just pray that God helps you
through what you're going through.

1074
01:18:03,873 --> 01:18:05,399
The title?

1075
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:08,678
The car is yours.

1076
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,410
You're paid in full.

1077
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:24,134
Excuse me.

1078
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:45,064
Your daddy's a really good man.

1079
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:09,594
Hey, honey.

1080
01:19:11,009 --> 01:19:13,540
If we took credit card offers
and put them end to end...

1081
01:19:13,754 --> 01:19:15,415
...they'd go to the moon and back.

1082
01:19:15,623 --> 01:19:17,787
Or you could take the cards
and buy me the moon.

1083
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:18,966
Would you want it?

1084
01:19:19,774 --> 01:19:21,801
Well, I don't know where I'd put it.

1085
01:19:22,009 --> 01:19:24,073
Probably just have to leave it
where it's at.

1086
01:19:24,287 --> 01:19:25,846
Yeah, and we'd never pay it off.

1087
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:27,994
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1088
01:19:29,705 --> 01:19:31,141
Hello?

1089
01:19:31,376 --> 01:19:32,779
Yes.

1090
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,193
No, actually we don't need
another credit card.

1091
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,505
Yes.

1092
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:44,852
Oh, it's a mind-blowing rate.

1093
01:19:45,052 --> 01:19:46,751
Unbelievable.

1094
01:19:47,224 --> 01:19:48,628
I知 still not gonna take it.

1095
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,267
Thank you.

1096
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,098
Thank you.

1097
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:55,042
Thank you.

1098
01:19:57,389 --> 01:19:59,866
We don't need any more calls
tonight.

1099
01:20:02,078 --> 01:20:03,876
So tomorrow's the day.

1100
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:05,979
It is.

1101
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:07,550
How you doing?

1102
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:11,444
I知 not sure.

1103
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:15,610
I致e got some anxiety.

1104
01:20:15,695 --> 01:20:18,422
But it's a peaceful sort of anxiety.

1105
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:22,281
A peaceful anxiety?
Can you have peaceful anxiety?

1106
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:23,785
Well....

1107
01:20:24,648 --> 01:20:28,299
What do you call it when you feel like
your life's turning upside down...

1108
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:30,391
...but you still think God's in control?

1109
01:20:31,116 --> 01:20:33,063
It痴 like a....

1110
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:35,583
A serene chaos.

1111
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,364
A serene--?

1112
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:40,350
What's the difference between
peaceful anxiety and serene chaos?

1113
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:42,127
Serene chaos is better.

1114
01:20:42,883 --> 01:20:44,691
Well, there you have it.

1115
01:20:58,157 --> 01:21:00,424
Look at the latest craze
in weight loss,

1116
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:04,293
With a growing number of new
energy-giving weight-loss drugs,,,

1117
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:07,198
,,,is the health risk going up
to trim down?

1118
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:11,434
For those stories and more
on the NBS Nightly News Watch.

1119
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:15,098
And now from our studios
in New York, here's Tom Jennings,

1120
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:20,152
Good evening, Our top story tonight
is about the car business,,,

1121
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:22,881
,,,or specifically,
the sale of used cars,

1122
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:26,026
Each year in America, over
half a million cars are sold,

1123
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:28,291
The number of used-car lots
in this country,,,

1124
01:21:28,498 --> 01:21:30,994
,,,has risen dramatically
over the last year,

1125
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:33,967
But how much do we really know
about buying a used car?

1126
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:35,832
Most Americans take for granted,,,

1127
01:21:35,942 --> 01:21:38,467
,,,that any markdown in price at all
is a deal,

1128
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,842
And although there are many deals
to be found,,,

1129
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:43,280
,,,experts say that most Americans
are unaware,,,

1130
01:21:43,485 --> 01:21:45,316
,,,of just how easy it is
to be deceived,

1131
01:21:46,222 --> 01:21:48,988
For the last six weeks,
NBS Nightly News has conducted,,,

1132
01:21:49,193 --> 01:21:52,719
,,,an undercover investigation
into the used-car business,

1133
01:21:52,898 --> 01:21:56,898
We have to begin with a warning,
you won't like what we found,

1134
01:21:57,104 --> 01:22:00,095
We decided to do an investigation
of six used-car lots,,,

1135
01:22:00,307 --> 01:22:02,504
,,,picked at random
across the United States,,,

1136
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:05,979
,,,and we begin tonight by taking you
to a lot in North Arkansas,

1137
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:09,673
Bud Morris Auto Sales has been
around for almost 30 years,,,

1138
01:22:09,886 --> 01:22:12,150
,,,with a seemingly solid reputation,

1139
01:22:12,353 --> 01:22:15,086
After an undercover reporter spoke
with a sales associate,,,

1140
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:18,423
,,,behind the scenes,
what we found was a different story,

1141
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:19,962
I mean, how do you do it?

1142
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,603
Is 8000 the most
you've ever cleared?

1143
01:22:22,806 --> 01:22:25,071
No, Bud got this lady
to pay 16,000,,,

1144
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,400
,,,for a Cadillac
that we'd just got for five,

1145
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:28,704
Sixteen?

1146
01:22:28,713 --> 01:22:30,746
Oh, yeah, we made 11,000
off of her,

1147
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:33,016
She left here
thinking she got a great deal,

1148
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:35,685
Does that happen very often?

1149
01:22:36,591 --> 01:22:38,817
We just end up making
about two or three grand,,,

1150
01:22:39,024 --> 01:22:40,251
,,,more than we ought to,

1151
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:41,827
On every car?

1152
01:22:42,033 --> 01:22:44,393
You can tell pretty quick
who's done their homework,

1153
01:22:44,598 --> 01:22:48,037
And if they don't know how much
a car should cost, we'll get them,

1154
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:50,298
And get them, they did,

1155
01:22:50,506 --> 01:22:52,771
After obtaining information
on a dozen cars,,,

1156
01:22:52,978 --> 01:22:54,740
,,,sold to unsuspecting customers,,,

1157
01:22:54,945 --> 01:22:57,280
...NBS Nightly News found that
on average...

1158
01:22:57,481 --> 01:23:02,250
,,,each car is sold for $3500
above the acceptable range,

1159
01:23:02,457 --> 01:23:04,286
Next, we go to the state of Utah,,,

1160
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:07,326
,,,where we had an undercover
reporter pose as a customer,,,

1161
01:23:07,528 --> 01:23:09,191
,,,with seemingly no idea,,,

1162
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,562
,,,as to what her car of choice
would cost,

1163
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:14,429
Experts say
this 1988 Chevrolet Blazer,,,

1164
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,540
,,,should run
between $1200 and $1500,

1165
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,840
But listen to what the salesman tries
to sell it for,

1166
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:23,312
This is a very, very popular car,
Great riding,

1167
01:23:23,517 --> 01:23:25,455
You drive it,
I promise, it's a great ride,

1168
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:27,623
Great stereo system,
It will hold its value,

1169
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:29,485
It's American made,

1170
01:23:29,693 --> 01:23:34,720
We've got 7 000 on this one,
but I can give it to you for about six,

1171
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:36,420
Six thousand dollars,

1172
01:23:37,237 --> 01:23:40,673
Even in great condition,
our experts say, ''That's a rip-off, ''

1173
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:43,966
As a matter of fact,
of the six lots we investigated,,,

1174
01:23:44,174 --> 01:23:47,980
,,,only one proved to deal honestly
all the time,

1175
01:23:48,185 --> 01:23:51,150
We now take you to South Georgia,
to the city of Albany,

1176
01:23:51,354 --> 01:23:53,949
Our undercover reporter
actually was hired and trained,,,

1177
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,625
,,,to sell cars at Jay Austin Motors,,,

1178
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:59,560
,,,a small car lot
with at most 35 cars,

1179
01:23:59,769 --> 01:24:00,753
Except this time,,,

1180
01:24:00,964 --> 01:24:03,867
,,,what he found
was a different story,

1181
01:24:04,067 --> 01:24:05,868
Speaking of cars,
I wanted to ask you,

1182
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:09,065
You don't seem to be getting
all that you could out of these,

1183
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:10,835
If I sold one for a little more,,,

1184
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,414
,,,do you think I could keep the rest
as commission?

1185
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:16,214
Kevin, I don't wanna go
that route,

1186
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,150
I'd rather charge what we'd feel good
about being charged,

1187
01:24:19,358 --> 01:24:21,451
I'm gonna stick
to fair market value,

1188
01:24:21,659 --> 01:24:23,823
But you'd get away
with pushing it a little bit,

1189
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:25,862
Don't you need the money?

1190
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,656
I do,

1191
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:30,536
But I gotta live
with how I run this place,

1192
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,500
I just don't want any regrets,

1193
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:35,179
I'm gonna stick
to the highest standard I can,

1194
01:24:35,644 --> 01:24:38,080
If you treat people right,
it'll come back to you,

1195
01:24:38,846 --> 01:24:42,482
That's a good philosophy
and one that he apparently lives by,

1196
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:46,819
In six weeks, the profit averaged out
at $1500 per car,,,

1197
01:24:47,026 --> 01:24:49,423
,,,an amount considered
completely acceptable,

1198
01:24:49,629 --> 01:24:52,291
In fact, Jay Austin Motors
even paid for repairs to cars,,,

1199
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,437
,,,that had problems
soon after being sold,

1200
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:57,507
A gesture not often seen
in the used-car business,

1201
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:59,973
And whereas he may not be rolling
in the dough,,,

1202
01:25:00,177 --> 01:25:02,375
,,,his honesty comes
as a refreshing reminder,,,

1203
01:25:02,579 --> 01:25:04,914
,,,to treat others
as you want to be treated,

1204
01:25:04,915 --> 01:25:06,509
When we return, we'll--

1205
01:25:06,622 --> 01:25:10,215
''Delight yourself in the Lord and he
will give you the desires of your heart.

1206
01:25:10,427 --> 01:25:13,988
Commit your way to the Lord,
trust in him, and he will do this.

1207
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:16,565
He will make your righteousness shine
like the dawn.

1208
01:25:16,767 --> 01:25:19,032
The justice of your cause
like the noonday sun.

1209
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:22,902
Be still before the Lord
and wait patiently for him.''

1210
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:28,445
I am so proud of you.

1211
01:25:28,648 --> 01:25:30,639
Did you hear me?

1212
01:25:30,852 --> 01:25:33,181
I am so proud of you.

1213
01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:36,120
I just wanted to finish well.

1214
01:25:36,324 --> 01:25:38,521
You may not be finished yet.

1215
01:26:41,784 --> 01:26:44,479
I saw you on the news last night
and I was gonna buy a car.

1216
01:26:44,685 --> 01:26:46,807
-What about this Tracker over here?
-Excuse me.

1217
01:26:46,816 --> 01:26:49,648
You were not the first one here.
I致e been here since 7:30.

1218
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,986
Okay.

1219
01:26:51,552 --> 01:26:52,849
Are you all here to buy cars?

1220
01:26:53,254 --> 01:26:55,154
-Yes.
-I am.

1221
01:26:56,021 --> 01:26:57,613
Okay.

1222
01:26:58,024 --> 01:27:00,483
Let me run in quick and open.
I need to make a call.

1223
01:27:00,592 --> 01:27:02,248
Would you mind staying
for a minute?

1224
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:04,255
Yeah, I ain't buying a car
nowhere else.

1225
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:06,891
Okay. Don't go anywhere.

1226
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:26,357
-Hello?
-Judy. I need a favor.

1227
01:27:26,563 --> 01:27:29,998
I need you to get Max and Sam,
get them up here as fast as possible.

1228
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,524
Well, what's going on?

1229
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:34,495
I致e got 30 people outside waiting
to buy a car right now.

1230
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:37,196
-Did you say 30?
-Thirty.

1231
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:39,566
-Thirty?
-Thirty.

1232
01:27:42,235 --> 01:27:44,327
Call them, get them up here
as soon as you can.

1233
01:27:44,637 --> 01:27:46,068
And I need your help, too, okay?

1234
01:27:46,271 --> 01:27:50,467
-What? I知 not a car salesman.
-Well, you are today.

1235
01:29:01,697 --> 01:29:04,491
I like this Oldsmobile.
How much for it?

1236
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,758
About $7000.

1237
01:29:08,733 --> 01:29:09,993
You take 6500?

1238
01:29:10,669 --> 01:29:12,096
-All right.
-You will?

1239
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:13,695
I guess so.

1240
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,031
If that's what you wanna pay.

1241
01:29:17,302 --> 01:29:18,765
Hang on now.

1242
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:20,831
How about 6000?

1243
01:29:21,336 --> 01:29:22,993
You done said 6500.

1244
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,634
I know you got it,
or you wouldn't have offered it.

1245
01:29:25,836 --> 01:29:27,061
I値l get the paperwork.

1246
01:29:29,472 --> 01:29:31,563
Oh, man.

1247
01:29:32,769 --> 01:29:34,032
-Miles?
-One-twenty.

1248
01:29:34,241 --> 01:29:35,228
-Highway?
-Some.

1249
01:29:35,437 --> 01:29:36,461
-Wrecked?
-No.

1250
01:29:36,674 --> 01:29:37,640
-Smoker?
-No.

1251
01:29:37,841 --> 01:29:38,965
-Cruise?
-Yes.

1252
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,300
-Price.
-Eight.

1253
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:42,736
-Seven.
-Seven-five.

1254
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,136
Done.

1255
01:29:46,444 --> 01:29:48,536
I like the way you deal.

1256
01:29:56,712 --> 01:30:00,372
Thirty-eight thousand,
four hundred and fifteen dollars.

1257
01:30:05,147 --> 01:30:08,013
And that's after covering the cost
of the cars.

1258
01:30:37,353 --> 01:30:39,115
-Mr. MacDonald?
-Yes.

1259
01:30:39,337 --> 01:30:41,065
-How are you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

1260
01:30:40,886 --> 01:30:42,942
I知 doing fine.

1261
01:30:43,961 --> 01:30:45,568
That's for you.

1262
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,776
I think that should about
cover what we owe.

1263
01:30:48,389 --> 01:30:50,193
Where's the cars?

1264
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:55,192
-Well, we sold them.
-What do you mean you sold them?

1265
01:30:56,482 --> 01:30:59,766
We had a real, real good day today.

1266
01:31:05,506 --> 01:31:06,935
Do you trust used-car salesmen?

1267
01:31:06,932 --> 01:31:08,758
They don't always have
great reputations,

1268
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:11,008
But one here in Albany
is earning respect,

1269
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:12,640
A national news organization,,,

1270
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:14,892
,,,recently investigated
Jay Austin Motors,,,

1271
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:18,318
,,,and found his prices and business
practices are always fair,

1272
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,768
After an undercover investigation
that lasted six weeks--

1273
01:31:21,979 --> 01:31:24,762
There's a new record for cars sold
in one day here in Albany,

1274
01:31:25,532 --> 01:31:29,382
Jay Austin Motors sold 32 vehicles
inside of eight hours,

1275
01:31:29,581 --> 01:31:31,699
The rush to buy cars came
after a story ran,,,

1276
01:31:31,906 --> 01:31:34,917
,,,which highlighted the honest
business performed by Jay Austin,,,

1277
01:31:35,126 --> 01:31:37,647
,,,who says it was an answer
to prayer,

1278
01:31:38,217 --> 01:31:40,470
So, what did your dad say?

1279
01:31:41,303 --> 01:31:44,087
He said we shouldn't be surprised
when God is faithful.

1280
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:45,277
He's right.

1281
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:47,308
Hey, I tried taping
those news stories.

1282
01:31:47,513 --> 01:31:49,801
And I keep getting the last half
of each interview.

1283
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,957
I致e got the last half of four stories.

1284
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,277
Do you know anyone
who can copy these tapes...

1285
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:56,909
...to give to your parents?

1286
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,125
Just take it to the church.
Don't the church media guys...

1287
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:01,755
...just sit around
and copy tapes anyway?

1288
01:32:01,957 --> 01:32:03,420
I don't know what they do.

1289
01:32:11,967 --> 01:32:14,171
This has been the craziest week
of my life.

1290
01:32:14,371 --> 01:32:16,909
Jay, I wanna ask you something.
God's blessed you...

1291
01:32:17,118 --> 01:32:20,346
...because of your faithfulness
and obedience in the last months...

1292
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:22,757
...but what about all the customers
before that?

1293
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,682
I know.
I致e been thinking about them.

1294
01:32:27,023 --> 01:32:29,755
I was reading about Zacchaeus
this morning.

1295
01:32:30,162 --> 01:32:32,897
He returned money to all those
people he took advantage of...

1296
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,038
...when he did his tax collecting.

1297
01:32:37,232 --> 01:32:39,202
That's a painful thought.

1298
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:42,106
I mean, not only would that take
a lot of money...

1299
01:32:42,317 --> 01:32:44,788
...I壇 have to eat more humble pie
than any man alive.

1300
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,484
It痴 not about you
escaping discomfort, Jay.

1301
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:50,609
It痴 about you honoring God
with what he's blessed you with.

1302
01:32:51,626 --> 01:32:54,132
That's two years of customers.

1303
01:32:55,215 --> 01:32:57,619
It痴 probably half of them I cheated.

1304
01:33:25,278 --> 01:33:28,732
Well, I知 done with the books.
Are you done with your project?

1305
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,041
This will take a lot longer
than you think to pay these people.

1306
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:33,909
-Why?
-We gotta have enough money...

1307
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,065
...for the mortgage and light bill.
If we skip a check for me...

1308
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:39,096
...I think we ought
to pay Sam and Max.

1309
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:41,973
But you're selling cars
as fast as you're getting them in.

1310
01:33:42,181 --> 01:33:44,205
You only have 12 cars
on the lot right now.

1311
01:33:45,021 --> 01:33:49,216
But our current profits
aren't gonna cover the $39,123.50...

1312
01:33:49,529 --> 01:33:51,349
...that I owe previous customers.

1313
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:54,977
-I think we need to do it in steps.
-How much did you say?

1314
01:33:55,455 --> 01:33:58,560
I致e made 39,000 more than
I should have over the past 2 years.

1315
01:33:58,574 --> 01:34:00,838
No, no, no.
What was the exact amount you said?

1316
01:34:01,044 --> 01:34:04,804
$39,123.50.

1317
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:18,189
-No way.
-I don't think it's a coincidence, Jay.

1318
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:20,257
This is after all our bills
and salaries?

1319
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:22,216
Yep. And I checked it twice.

1320
01:34:24,021 --> 01:34:26,353
-No way.
-What do you need?

1321
01:34:26,564 --> 01:34:30,684
A big neon sign above your head
that reads ''This is a sign from God''?

1322
01:34:34,254 --> 01:34:37,500
I知 supposed to give our profit away
while admitting that I知 a skunk?

1323
01:34:37,408 --> 01:34:41,338
If God keeps blessing you, that money
will be replaced in a matter of days.

1324
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:45,907
-What if we stop selling cars like this?
-Jay Austin, you gave this lot to God.

1325
01:34:46,115 --> 01:34:47,768
And he's gonna run it the right way.

1326
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:51,433
And it looks like it means
repaying all the people you ripped off.

1327
01:34:52,823 --> 01:34:55,390
I can't believe what I'm about to do.

1328
01:35:16,432 --> 01:35:17,992
-Yes, may I help you?
-Miss Wright?

1329
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,425
Yes.

1330
01:35:19,634 --> 01:35:22,824
I知 Jay Austin.
I sold a car to you about a year ago.

1331
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:26,084
-Yeah, I remember.
-And....

1332
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,182
Well, I overcharged you for that car.

1333
01:35:31,387 --> 01:35:32,351
What?

1334
01:35:32,552 --> 01:35:35,074
And I came to give you
a portion of that back.

1335
01:35:35,282 --> 01:35:37,908
And I wanted to say
I知 sorry for doing that...

1336
01:35:38,114 --> 01:35:41,100
...and to ask you to forgive me.

1337
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,277
This is $1500.

1338
01:35:43,477 --> 01:35:45,871
Right. I believe that's what
I would have owed you...

1339
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:51,362
...had I been honest about the sale.
I知 sorry about that.

1340
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:55,825
This is an answer to my prayer.
I got laid off my job today.

1341
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:58,117
Thank you so much.

1342
01:35:59,094 --> 01:36:01,954
Thank you so much.
Thank you, God.

1343
01:36:02,154 --> 01:36:05,049
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Thank you.

1344
01:36:42,882 --> 01:36:46,073
Oh, I won $1000! I won $1000!

1345
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:48,798
No, it's--

1346
01:36:49,007 --> 01:36:51,270
I致e never won anything before.

1347
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:55,361
-It痴 not a contest.
-I won $1000!

1348
01:36:55,571 --> 01:36:57,623
I won $1000!

1349
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:02,187
-You're giving me $1000?
-I am.

1350
01:37:02,396 --> 01:37:04,619
Why? I agreed to buy it at that price.

1351
01:37:04,824 --> 01:37:07,981
But the information I gave you
on the truck wasn't entirely accurate.

1352
01:37:08,191 --> 01:37:10,881
You bought the truck
on what you thought it was worth.

1353
01:37:11,085 --> 01:37:12,053
I apologize for that.

1354
01:37:12,256 --> 01:37:15,216
But it don't make sense that you just
give $1000 back.

1355
01:37:15,415 --> 01:37:16,539
Why would you do that?

1356
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:20,734
The best way to explain it is that I want
my life to be pleasing to the Lord.

1357
01:37:21,112 --> 01:37:24,506
So you're just giving us $1000 back,
no strings attached?

1358
01:37:24,707 --> 01:37:27,328
-Well, if you'll take it.
-Oh, we'll take it.

1359
01:37:27,538 --> 01:37:29,400
That ain't your money.
I bought the truck.

1360
01:37:29,602 --> 01:37:32,065
You better take it.
The man's trying to give it to us.

1361
01:37:32,266 --> 01:37:33,991
You watch your mouth.
This is business.

1362
01:37:34,196 --> 01:37:37,092
This ain't business.
He's trying to give us free money.

1363
01:37:37,297 --> 01:37:39,882
He's giving me free money.
You go finish the bean dip.

1364
01:37:40,092 --> 01:37:42,849
If you don't share, you're gonna
be making your own bean dip.

1365
01:37:43,055 --> 01:37:46,139
Woman, I could buy
$1000 worth of bean dip.

1366
01:37:46,351 --> 01:37:49,745
Well, I probably need
to go ahead and go.

1367
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:53,636
Man, I appreciate it. And I知 sorry for
calling you a scum-sucking maggot...

1368
01:37:53,844 --> 01:37:55,603
...when I bought my truck.

1369
01:37:56,173 --> 01:37:57,163
I don't remember that.

1370
01:37:58,705 --> 01:38:00,466
Well, I知 sorry anyway.

1371
01:38:01,401 --> 01:38:02,561
Well, I appreciate that.

1372
01:38:02,769 --> 01:38:05,696
-You guys have a great night.
-Yeah. You do the same, Jay.

1373
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:18,421
Judy. You would not believe
how easy this has been.

1374
01:38:18,622 --> 01:38:19,641
Yes.

1375
01:38:19,854 --> 01:38:22,213
People have been blown away
when I come to see them.

1376
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:25,275
It痴 been incredible. One girl--

1377
01:38:25,378 --> 01:38:28,535
One girl thinks
she still won a contest.

1378
01:38:29,442 --> 01:38:32,769
I thought I'd have to eat crow,
but this is cake.

1379
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,856
I知 not being prideful.

1380
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,554
I知 not being prideful.

1381
01:38:40,196 --> 01:38:43,286
You what? You cheated me?

1382
01:38:43,495 --> 01:38:44,858
I wasn't very honest about it.

1383
01:38:45,059 --> 01:38:48,387
So you think you can waltz right in
with a $1200 check...

1384
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,675
...and expect me to accept
what you've done?

1385
01:38:50,888 --> 01:38:53,576
-Well, I知 sorry for what I did.
-You better be sorry.

1386
01:38:53,781 --> 01:38:56,440
Do you know how hard it is
to make it in this world today?

1387
01:38:57,147 --> 01:39:00,008
The last thing we need
is a dishonest person...

1388
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:01,801
...taking advantage of old ladies.

1389
01:39:02,009 --> 01:39:04,096
-Ma'am, all--
-Don't you interrupt me.

1390
01:39:04,307 --> 01:39:07,934
I致e been working 40 long years
for every penny I got.

1391
01:39:07,938 --> 01:39:08,899
That's right.

1392
01:39:09,102 --> 01:39:11,932
Then a scam artist like you
tries to take it away.

1393
01:39:12,134 --> 01:39:15,094
-Tell him.
-You better give me an apology.

1394
01:39:15,294 --> 01:39:17,759
-Well, that's why I知--
-Don't you talk back to me.

1395
01:39:17,961 --> 01:39:24,046
I知 tired of the lies, the deceit,
the confections and everything else.

1396
01:39:24,252 --> 01:39:26,242
-The confections?
-Don't you sass me.

1397
01:39:26,453 --> 01:39:28,679
Keep your mouth shut
till I tell you to open it.

1398
01:39:28,887 --> 01:39:30,370
Amen.

1399
01:39:30,574 --> 01:39:32,206
-Now say you're sorry.
-I知 sorry.

1400
01:39:32,413 --> 01:39:34,379
Get out of here
and go get right with God...

1401
01:39:34,577 --> 01:39:36,301
...before I get you right with him.

1402
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:39,799
Bye.

1403
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,299
Oh, sweet Jesus, $1200.

1404
01:39:46,853 --> 01:39:49,369
So she threw you out?

1405
01:39:50,356 --> 01:39:53,110
So you're getting kind of cocky,
aren't you, Jay?

1406
01:39:53,959 --> 01:39:54,989
Hi there. How are you?

1407
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,370
-Hi, Mr. Austin?
-Yeah.

1408
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:59,471
-Hi. Hillary Vale, WALB News.
-I致e seen you on TV a few times.

1409
01:39:59,678 --> 01:40:02,186
Yes, well, we caught your story
on the national news...

1410
01:40:02,402 --> 01:40:05,187
...and we're wondering
if you'd give us an interview as well.

1411
01:40:05,396 --> 01:40:07,640
I don't know what I can say
that hasn't been said.

1412
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,018
You just leave that to us.

1413
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:12,351
What we would like to do
is a live remote from here tomorrow...

1414
01:40:12,558 --> 01:40:13,871
...for our 5:00 newscast.

1415
01:40:14,076 --> 01:40:15,575
-Okay, that'd be fine.
-All right.

1416
01:40:15,789 --> 01:40:17,900
We'll send the crew over
around 4:00 to set up.

1417
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:20,186
-I look forward to talking to you.
-Thank you.

1418
01:40:20,401 --> 01:40:22,074
-Thank you.
-All right.

1419
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,680
Well, who needs to advertise
when you got all this free publicity?

1420
01:40:26,889 --> 01:40:29,744
So we'll stay on the two-shot
until we cut to the video.

1421
01:40:29,951 --> 01:40:32,128
Mr. Austin,
we need to get a sound check on you.

1422
01:40:32,337 --> 01:40:34,082
Could you count to five for us,
please?

1423
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:38,285
-One, two, three, four, five.
-Are we good? All right.

1424
01:40:38,495 --> 01:40:40,136
So are you ready to do this?

1425
01:40:40,346 --> 01:40:42,458
-I guess so.
-Okay.

1426
01:40:43,811 --> 01:40:46,769
You're on in five, four....

1427
01:40:48,957 --> 01:40:51,539
Ben, we are live
at Jay Austin Motors in Albany...

1428
01:40:51,752 --> 01:40:54,936
...where things have been very busy
ever since that story broke...

1429
01:40:55,146 --> 01:40:57,969
...on national news
about their honesty policy.

1430
01:40:58,175 --> 01:41:00,424
Joining us now is the owner,
Jay Austin,

1431
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:03,248
So, Mr. Austin, have things
really been that different,,,

1432
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,802
,,,since this all happened?

1433
01:41:05,003 --> 01:41:06,348
That'd be an understatement,

1434
01:41:06,451 --> 01:41:08,265
One day we're just trying
to survive,,,

1435
01:41:08,371 --> 01:41:10,756
,,,and the next day,
they're lined up to buy cars,

1436
01:41:11,167 --> 01:41:12,871
I know about
the power of the press...

1437
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:16,336
...but it would seem like you already
had a good customer base.

1438
01:41:16,444 --> 01:41:19,300
Have you changed the way
you've been doing business at all?

1439
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:20,844
Well....

1440
01:41:22,233 --> 01:41:24,652
Well, you've been in business
for over two years now?

1441
01:41:24,857 --> 01:41:25,852
Right,

1442
01:41:26,265 --> 01:41:29,258
And you've always
run your business honestly?

1443
01:41:29,661 --> 01:41:31,612
What is she doing?

1444
01:41:32,541 --> 01:41:34,561
Well, Mr. Austin,
we had the opportunity...

1445
01:41:34,764 --> 01:41:37,937
...to speak with a gentleman
who claims that he worked with you...

1446
01:41:38,155 --> 01:41:39,751
...during your first two years.

1447
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:43,551
And his view of the operation
is quite different.

1448
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,469
Let's take a look.

1449
01:41:45,883 --> 01:41:47,410
Honest dealer?

1450
01:41:47,627 --> 01:41:49,474
That's not how I'd describe
Jay Austin,

1451
01:41:49,682 --> 01:41:52,214
I've seen him rip off tons of people,

1452
01:41:52,419 --> 01:41:55,081
Teenagers, young couples,,,

1453
01:41:55,293 --> 01:41:58,023
,,,old ladies, even a minister,

1454
01:41:58,234 --> 01:42:00,793
He even tried to teach us
how to rip people off,

1455
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:03,878
And that's why I left,
Because of his lack of integrity,

1456
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:06,138
What? You snake!

1457
01:42:06,755 --> 01:42:10,885
Mr. Austin, did this man, in fact,
work for you?

1458
01:42:11,101 --> 01:42:14,044
-Yes, he did.
-And is he telling the truth?

1459
01:42:14,152 --> 01:42:19,238
Did you, in fact, teach him
how to cheat your customers?

1460
01:42:20,684 --> 01:42:22,866
I知 ashamed to say this,
but, yes, I did.

1461
01:42:22,985 --> 01:42:26,912
So you're admitting
that you were dishonest in your sales?

1462
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,723
I admit I used to be dishonest,,,

1463
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:31,296
,,,but I have had a dramatic change
in my life,

1464
01:42:31,503 --> 01:42:35,366
Yes, sir. But why should the public
believe you now?

1465
01:42:37,775 --> 01:42:40,201
I知 not sure how to answer
that question.

1466
01:42:42,123 --> 01:42:45,876
Well, Ben, last week Jay Austin
was being praised for his honesty...

1467
01:42:46,084 --> 01:42:49,667
,,,but now a former employee says
that isn't the whole story,

1468
01:42:49,879 --> 01:42:52,857
I guess our viewers will just
have to decide for themselves,

1469
01:42:53,062 --> 01:42:56,955
This is Hillary Vale reporting live
from Jay Austin Motors in Albany,

1470
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,408
Back to you, Ben,

1471
01:42:58,617 --> 01:43:00,198
We're clear.

1472
01:43:00,989 --> 01:43:02,947
I知 sorry if I caught you off guard...

1473
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:06,033
...but it is my job
to report all the facts.

1474
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:09,655
I understand,
but that is not who I am now.

1475
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:12,221
Yeah.

1476
01:43:12,434 --> 01:43:15,647
All right, let's pack up and go.
We gotta get back to the studio.

1477
01:43:21,005 --> 01:43:22,495
Thank you.

1478
01:43:28,848 --> 01:43:31,716
Todd, let's pray for Daddy.

1479
01:43:45,237 --> 01:43:47,209
Lord, I知 angry.

1480
01:43:48,274 --> 01:43:50,403
I know I deserve this.

1481
01:43:56,424 --> 01:44:00,322
Would you help me, please?
I cannot defend myself.

1482
01:45:32,454 --> 01:45:36,157
Yes, we'll be there in 30 minutes.
Yep, not a problem.

1483
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:40,493
I'll have it packaged for the 11:00.
Okay, what's the address?

1484
01:45:42,471 --> 01:45:45,166
All right, we'll be there.
Yes. Thanks.

1485
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,966
Excuse me, Miss Vale?

1486
01:45:47,179 --> 01:45:50,112
I saw your report,
and I know you're just doing your job...

1487
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:53,443
...but you need to know
that ain't the whole story.

1488
01:45:54,187 --> 01:45:55,246
What do you mean?

1489
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:57,320
Jay Austin came to my house...

1490
01:45:57,526 --> 01:46:00,258
...and apologized
for the way he misled me.

1491
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:02,953
And paid me back $1200.

1492
01:46:03,169 --> 01:46:04,964
-He what?
-He did the same for us.

1493
01:46:05,168 --> 01:46:06,698
He gave us $1000 back.

1494
01:46:08,242 --> 01:46:11,039
-You've got to be kidding.
-No, ma'am.

1495
01:46:11,246 --> 01:46:13,977
This story ain't over
until you report that.

1496
01:46:52,636 --> 01:46:54,764
What are you doing in here, bud?

1497
01:46:56,947 --> 01:46:59,136
Complaining to God.

1498
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:02,681
Well, while you're in here yapping,
he's out here working.

1499
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:34,756
No, no, no. You stay right here.
You let the Lord fight for you.

1500
01:47:40,837 --> 01:47:41,811
Hey.

1501
01:47:43,977 --> 01:47:44,944
I'm Ben Roberts,

1502
01:47:45,146 --> 01:47:48,910
Our top story tonight is a follow-up
to a story we told you about at 5:30,

1503
01:47:49,116 --> 01:47:52,951
There's another side to the story
about used-car dealer Jay Austin,

1504
01:47:53,154 --> 01:47:56,094
We go live now to Hillary Vale
with the details,

1505
01:47:56,293 --> 01:48:00,254
Thanks, Ben, After our report
on Jay Austin just a half-hour ago,,,

1506
01:48:00,461 --> 01:48:02,332
,,,these customers
showed up at the lot,,,

1507
01:48:02,536 --> 01:48:05,507
,,,with yet another side of the story,

1508
01:48:05,711 --> 01:48:07,836
Miss Harris,
you say that Jay Austin,,,

1509
01:48:08,045 --> 01:48:10,238
,,,came to your house
and returned money to you?

1510
01:48:10,446 --> 01:48:11,414
That's right,

1511
01:48:11,615 --> 01:48:15,812
He said he overcharged me
and he gave me back $1200,

1512
01:48:15,821 --> 01:48:18,919
He apologized,
and for that, I commend him,

1513
01:48:19,295 --> 01:48:20,956
-Lord, thank you.
-Reverend, you say,,,

1514
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,687
,,,he returned money to you
as well?

1515
01:48:22,901 --> 01:48:25,959
He gave me back $2000
and apologized too,

1516
01:48:26,169 --> 01:48:28,835
-And what about you, Miss Carter?
-He gave me $1500 back,

1517
01:48:29,143 --> 01:48:32,135
-I'm so grateful for that,
-Thank you. Thank you, Lord.

1518
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:49,632
-He gave us back $1000,
-Thank you, Lord.

1519
01:48:50,038 --> 01:48:52,471
He said he wanted his life
to be pleasing to the Lord,

1520
01:48:52,674 --> 01:48:53,663
And I believe him,

1521
01:48:53,676 --> 01:48:56,370
What you need to be doing
is talking to Bernie Meyers,,,

1522
01:48:56,579 --> 01:48:59,242
,,,that used to work here,
the one accusing him,

1523
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:02,786
Jay met us on the lot,
but Bernie sold us that truck,

1524
01:49:02,986 --> 01:49:04,717
That's right! Yes!

1525
01:49:10,734 --> 01:49:12,827
Now, I have rebuked you.

1526
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:15,066
I have defended you.

1527
01:49:15,273 --> 01:49:20,109
Now it's time for you to stand up
and be a godly man worth defending.

1528
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:21,643
Do you understand me?

1529
01:49:21,846 --> 01:49:23,479
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1530
01:49:23,684 --> 01:49:25,517
All right, then.

1531
01:49:25,718 --> 01:49:27,987
May God bless you.

1532
01:49:37,472 --> 01:49:39,903
Oh, yes, Lord. Yes.

1533
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,267
Oh, yes, Lord.

1534
01:49:44,148 --> 01:49:46,206
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1535
01:49:46,419 --> 01:49:49,320
-What is it, Mama?
-Todd, get me the phone.

1536
01:49:49,521 --> 01:49:50,647
Oh, no.

1537
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:06,146
Hey.

1538
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:09,133
What?

1539
01:50:09,672 --> 01:50:11,238
Where are you?

1540
01:50:12,624 --> 01:50:14,696
No, I知 on my way.

1541
01:50:14,906 --> 01:50:16,139
Judy's in labor.

1542
01:50:16,345 --> 01:50:19,056
Get out of here. I値l take care of this.

1543
01:50:20,305 --> 01:50:22,982
Well, Ben, we've had
quite a turn of events here today,

1544
01:50:23,193 --> 01:50:25,066
According to these customers
behind me,,,

1545
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:27,304
,,,Jay Austin is a changed man,

1546
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:29,588
And to top it all off,
his wife just called,

1547
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:31,902
She's in labor
and they are now on their way,,,

1548
01:50:32,115 --> 01:50:33,885
,,,to have their baby at the hospital,

1549
01:50:34,093 --> 01:50:37,547
I'm Hillary Vale, reporting live
from Jay Austin Motors in Albany,

1550
01:50:37,748 --> 01:50:39,227
Back to you, Ben,

1551
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:45,896
Hey.

1552
01:50:48,103 --> 01:50:50,158
How you doing, Faith?

1553
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,335
Yeah.

1554
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:55,278
You look just like your mother.

1555
01:50:57,817 --> 01:51:00,318
You know why we called you Faith?

1556
01:51:02,269 --> 01:51:05,049
That's what Daddy was learning
when you were being born.

1557
01:51:09,509 --> 01:51:12,287
Hey, if you're gonna go get Todd,
you better leave now.

1558
01:51:12,503 --> 01:51:13,810
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

1559
01:51:14,017 --> 01:51:17,047
No, I知 fine. You need to go.

1560
01:51:27,665 --> 01:51:28,696
Hey.

1561
01:51:28,907 --> 01:51:31,412
-Okay.
-Hey.

1562
01:51:33,767 --> 01:51:37,521
Hey, sweetheart. Hey.

1563
01:51:38,461 --> 01:51:40,406
Thank you for watching her
so I could rest.

1564
01:51:40,609 --> 01:51:41,735
Well, I loved it.

1565
01:51:41,947 --> 01:51:44,451
Did you have fun with your daddy?

1566
01:51:44,665 --> 01:51:47,807
Did you have fun with your daddy,
sweet girl?

1567
01:51:48,017 --> 01:51:49,280
Okay.

1568
01:51:49,693 --> 01:51:52,228
Now, you know
we're gonna be gone until tonight.

1569
01:51:52,437 --> 01:51:56,122
Mom's coming over.
Faith and I値l be just fine, Jay.

1570
01:51:56,328 --> 01:51:58,605
This will make Todd's day.
You need to go.

1571
01:51:58,809 --> 01:52:00,147
Okay.

1572
01:52:00,354 --> 01:52:01,652
Hey.

1573
01:52:02,195 --> 01:52:04,102
-Hey.
-Okay.

1574
01:52:05,378 --> 01:52:07,355
Say, ''Bye-bye, Daddy.''

1575
01:52:15,907 --> 01:52:17,801
Go to the left....

1576
01:52:28,229 --> 01:52:29,356
You know me.

1577
01:52:29,564 --> 01:52:32,288
You know when I sit and when I rise.

1578
01:52:32,493 --> 01:52:35,355
You perceive my thoughts from afar.

1579
01:52:35,557 --> 01:52:38,815
You discern my going out
and my lying down.

1580
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:42,005
You are familiar with all my ways.

1581
01:52:42,552 --> 01:52:44,944
But before a word is on my tongue...

1582
01:52:45,149 --> 01:52:48,304
...you know it completely, O Lord.

1583
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,028
''She's also bulletproof.

1584
01:52:57,237 --> 01:52:59,928
I壇 be able to help the police
fight criminals and robbers.

1585
01:53:00,133 --> 01:53:02,687
The only thing she can't do is fly,
but that's okay...

1586
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,557
...she's still my favorite hero.

1587
01:53:04,766 --> 01:53:07,590
That's why
I would like to be like her.''

1588
01:53:08,162 --> 01:53:10,386
Thank you, Rachel.
You may be seated.

1589
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:11,818
Okay, who's next?

1590
01:53:12,024 --> 01:53:14,318
Todd Austin, you're up.

1591
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:20,473
''Well, I have many
favorite superheroes...

1592
01:53:20,685 --> 01:53:21,908
...that I would like to be.

1593
01:53:22,118 --> 01:53:23,410
But since they're not real...

1594
01:53:23,616 --> 01:53:25,910
...I thought about somebody
I could be like.

1595
01:53:26,111 --> 01:53:27,906
My real-life hero is my dad.

1596
01:53:28,109 --> 01:53:31,039
He's not perfect
and sometimes he makes mistakes...

1597
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,763
...but he says he's sorry.

1598
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:34,869
He is spending more time with me...

1599
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,694
...and sometimes takes me to work
with him on Saturdays...

1600
01:53:37,904 --> 01:53:40,592
...just so we can talk.
He's pretty smart too.

1601
01:53:40,799 --> 01:53:42,286
He knows a lot about cars...

1602
01:53:42,498 --> 01:53:45,721
...and he even has one
that looks like a superhero car.

1603
01:53:45,926 --> 01:53:49,083
He prays with our family now
and even helps my mom.

1604
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:51,084
I like spending time with him.

1605
01:53:51,288 --> 01:53:54,941
Even though he doesn't have
special powers or anything...

1606
01:53:55,154 --> 01:53:58,980
...he is still my favorite hero,
so that's who I want to be like.''

1607
01:53:59,481 --> 01:54:01,174
Very good, Todd. Thank you.

1608
01:54:01,379 --> 01:54:02,777
You may sit down.

1609
01:54:02,977 --> 01:54:05,499
Okay, next we'll have Joshua...

1610
01:54:05,709 --> 01:54:08,264
...then Anna, then Catherine...

1611
01:54:08,477 --> 01:54:11,495
...and if time permits,
we'll end with Caleb.

1612
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:20,126
You can get me out of school
like this?

1613
01:54:20,333 --> 01:54:21,398
Well, I got permission.

1614
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:23,683
-From my teacher?
-No, from your principal.

1615
01:54:23,893 --> 01:54:25,703
You went all the way to the top?

1616
01:54:25,909 --> 01:54:28,419
Well, if your principal's the top,
then, yes.

1617
01:54:28,633 --> 01:54:30,843
All right. Do we get to ride
in this car?

1618
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:32,180
Sure do.

1619
01:54:32,394 --> 01:54:33,837
Yes.

1620
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:39,248
Here you go.

1621
01:54:39,451 --> 01:54:41,592
-My hat.
-Oh, yeah.

1622
01:54:42,878 --> 01:54:44,254
You ready?

1623
01:54:47,682 --> 01:54:49,633
Is it the flywheel?

1624
01:54:50,977 --> 01:54:53,218
No, we got that fixed.
