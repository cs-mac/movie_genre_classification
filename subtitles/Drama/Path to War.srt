1
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,548
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

2
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,083
Just the beginning, Bob.

3
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,585
Sir! Mr. President!

4
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,854
Over here, please!
Thank you!

5
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,559
She is pretty.

6
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,562
- Having a good time, George?
- Great night, Mr. President.

7
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,299
- What a night.
- You bet, George.

8
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,635
Mr. Johnson!

9
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:43,738
Thank you, sir!
Mrs. Johnson!

10
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,645
Get him, girls.
Get him.

11
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,639
Senator Dirksen, the
president would be delighted

12
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,941
if you'd join him in the
Oval Office after the ball.

13
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:53,974
I will.

14
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:32,046
One thing I can say
about the Great Society...

15
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,748
It sure is crowded.

16
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,489
Up all night writing this one, Dick?

17
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,658
This is one speech I'll gladly disavow.

18
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,462
Got a clipping here.

19
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,898
Quotes my honorable defeated opponent,

20
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,633
Senator Goldwater.

21
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:57,271
Calls my secretary of defense
"an IBM machine with legs."

22
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,940
Outrageous!

23
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,592
Now, I stand here tonight to tell you

24
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:20,294
that I regard Bob McNamara here

25
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,731
as not only one of the smartest,

26
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,700
but one of the most humane men I know.

27
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,168
Yeah.
Over here.

28
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,640
Goldwater's history!

29
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,378
And that goes for all
my blue-ribbon men

30
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,013
you see here tonight.

31
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,114
Yep.

32
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,617
Never in our history has there been

33
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:45,587
such an abundance of brains and talent.

34
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,857
Why, I've got three or four Rhodes scholars,

35
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,860
four or five graduates of Harvard,

36
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,128
a couple from Yale.

37
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,497
And, why, there's even one here tonight

38
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,901
from Southwest Texas State Teachers College.

39
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:12,213
And don't you know,
that one rules the roost.

40
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,056
* The eyes of Texas are upon you *

41
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,360
* All the livelong day

42
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:30,064
* The eyes of Texas are upon you *

43
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:34,669
* You cannot get away

44
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:38,740
* Do not think you can escape them *

45
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,877
* At night or early in the morn *

46
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:47,048
* The eyes of Texas are upon you *

47
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,819
* Till Gabriel blows
his horn... *

48
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,688
Hey!
Thank you.

49
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,917
Watch broken, Jack?

50
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:25,019
- Timing it.
- Timing what?

51
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,722
The applause.
He'll ask.

52
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,894
* The eyes of Texas are upon you *

53
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:37,298
* Till Gabriel blows
his horn. *

54
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,202
In a land of great wealth,

55
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:47,041
families must not live in hopeless poverty.

56
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:50,178
In a land rich in harvest,

57
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,348
children just must not go hungry.

58
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:57,886
In a land of healing miracles,

59
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,556
neighbors must not suffer
and die unattended.

60
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,662
In a great land of learning and scholars,

61
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:11,532
young people must be taught
to read and write.

62
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,634
A bit more volume,
please, Mr. President?

63
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,838
I want to hear every brilliant word

64
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:20,208
that Dick Goodwin wrote
for your marvelous speech.

65
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,410
Goodwin? Who told you
Goodwin wrote that speech?

66
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,412
A dozen people work on my speeches.

67
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,147
Nobody more than I do.

68
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,515
Why, Jack here's been writing

69
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,650
some of my best stuff for seven years.

70
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,953
My penance for marrying away
his last secretary,

71
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:33,955
but thank you for the credit, Mr. President.

72
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,957
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, Mr. President.

73
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,092
- Good night, Senator.
- Good night, Jack.

74
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,961
With the resources I have had,

75
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,263
I have vigilantly fought against it.

76
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,268
Goodwin wrote maybe a word or two.

77
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,671
"Great" being one, "Society" the other?

78
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:54,242
Smart son of a bitch got that out of a book.

79
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,744
Now, listen to me, Ev.

80
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,546
And listen well.
You're a good friend.

81
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,849
I don't want to see you retire prematurely.

82
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,251
But as this reception plainly shows you,

83
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,786
the American people ain't gonna stand

84
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,988
for you fellas on the
other side of the aisle

85
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,090
dragging your feet on any of my programs.

86
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,659
Now, FDR passed a handful of bills

87
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,161
in his first hundred days.

88
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,896
I'm gonna pass a bucketful...

89
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,198
Poverty, education, health care.

90
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,667
And I'm gonna finish what I
started on civil rights, too.

91
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,636
I'm telling you, Jim Crow put
a collar on more smart men

92
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,173
sure as they were sentenced
to an Illinois chain gang.

93
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,675
I take offense, sir.

94
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,944
We are most humane to our condemned.

95
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,346
The Great Society is my beautiful woman, Ev,

96
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,448
and I'm taking her by the arm.

97
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,218
And as the greatest Republican
leader of this century,

98
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,587
Everett Dirksen is gonna
take her by the other

99
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,790
and help me escort that lady home.

100
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,557
Yes.

101
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,128
And knowing what is likely
thence to ensue, Mr. President,

102
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,463
that is where I shall take my leave.

103
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:52,000
Lyndon? I apologize for interrupting.

104
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,635
I thought perhaps you'd like some
sandwiches from the kitchen.

105
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:59,607
Mrs. Johnson,
my most abject apology.

106
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,742
I have kept your husband far too long

107
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,511
on this most festive occasion.

108
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,847
No.

109
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,982
Mr. President,

110
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:09,951
a heartfelt congratulations, sir.

111
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,485
Adieu.

112
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:14,789
- Good night.
- Good night.

113
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,125
If we fail now,

114
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:21,830
then we will have forgotten in abundance

115
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,265
what we learned in hardship.

116
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,969
Democracy rests on faith,

117
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:31,873
freedom asks more than it gives,

118
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,075
and the judgment of God...

119
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,677
It was a wonderful speech.

120
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,047
Full of such hope and promise.

121
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,548
Dick Goodwin asked what I thought,

122
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,517
and I told him it was a magnificent job.

123
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,321
And you delivered it so very well.

124
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,457
- Thank you, honey.
- Yes, you did.

125
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,392
Thank you.

126
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,407
9:00 p.m. unless
you hear from me.

127
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:21,765
- Morning. How are you?
- How are you, sir?

128
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,391
- Is that for me? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,434
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

130
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,160
Morning.

131
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:28,362
Good morning,
Mr. Secretary.

132
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,764
What have we got here?
A crisis in every capital?

133
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,633
Just one.

134
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,405
- This is one cable?
- Not quite.

135
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,541
Here's the rest of it.

136
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:50,651
The situation in Vietnam
is continuing to deteriorate.

137
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,387
We've been able to keep the noise
level down since your campaign,

138
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:56,424
but my guess is you'll be faced
with a tough decision soon.

139
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,059
How soon?

140
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,594
There are 19 million older
folks who can't see a doctor.

141
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,730
33 million under the poverty line.

142
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,499
I can't have Congress distracted.

143
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,870
Now, how soon, Bob?

144
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,007
Very soon,
Mr. President.

145
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,842
I hate to have to report this to you,

146
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,012
but Max Taylor says here
that Vietcong enlistment

147
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,680
is increasing rapidly

148
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,650
and that Saigon can't continue much longer

149
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,652
to provide security
for our advisors down there

150
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,055
and fight an insurgency at the same time.

151
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:30,124
Why not? How many men does South
Vietnam have out there fighting?

152
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,860
200,000.
VC have about 34,000.

153
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,030
Well, how the hell can 34,000 lick 200,000?

154
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:38,432
Well, historically,
a 10:1 ratio minimum

155
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,201
is required for a guerilla situation,

156
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,846
and there's no way that South Vietnam
can achieve that on their own.

157
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,705
Now, we've kept our powder dry

158
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,740
through the elections and the holidays,

159
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,285
waiting for some stability in the south,

160
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,944
waiting for the cycle of coups to end,

161
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:53,181
during which we've had five
killed in the attack at Bien Hoa,

162
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,049
two at our Saigon officers quarters,

163
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,519
and scores wounded with no
retaliation from us whatsoever.

164
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,821
Now, Wheeler, the other
chiefs, Westmoreland,

165
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,157
are fit to be tied, as you know,

166
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:05,759
and now this from Ambassador Taylor.

167
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,664
You might send Mac Bundy to
Saigon, have a talk with him.

168
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,166
I'd make another trip myself,

169
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,468
but I'm in the middle of the
defense budget right now.

170
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,105
I don't want to see the word
"Vietnam" in that damn budget.

171
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,407
Well...

172
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,209
you know I'd do that if I could.

173
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,577
In fact, it's becoming increasingly
difficult to conceal...

174
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:26,747
Bob, all I want to know is this.

175
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,983
What's it gonna take
to get Ho Chi Minh to quit?

176
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,019
That's all I want to know.

177
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,188
Mr. President,
it's clear to me now

178
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:39,360
that the answer is sustained
military action in the air.

179
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,196
And if that doesn't work,

180
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,598
on the ground.

181
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:47,768
This is the decision you are going
to have to face, Mr. President,

182
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,772
and as I said, very soon, I'm afraid.

183
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,012
Keep me up to date, Bob.

184
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,283
- Turn that thing off.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,784
This Medicare speech is shit.

186
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,486
Cut out the gobbledygook and sex it up.

187
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,197
Maybe Goodwin ought to take a crack at it.

188
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,898
Goodwin's got three months of assignments.

189
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,459
I just put the last of those
on your desk, Mr. President.

190
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,427
I'd be glad to look it over
if you'd like me to.

191
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,828
All right.

192
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,230
Put the music to it, Dick.

193
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,238
Jack, I want you to tell him

194
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,907
to stop taking credit
for every goddamn word I say.

195
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,510
- Absolutely, Mr. President.
- All right.

196
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,679
Come on, dog.
Up you go.

197
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,487
- Schedule me a haircut.
- Surely.

198
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,923
And see if you can get
Clark Clifford here for dinner.

199
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,831
Converting from Protestant
to Catholic is a big step.

200
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,767
Actually, Lyndon took it better than I did.

201
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,436
I was quite surprised.

202
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,371
Well, both you and Daddy
changed your religions.

203
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,773
From one Protestant denomination to another.

204
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,875
It was a matter of
convenience and schooling.

205
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,288
Well, I don't think religion
should be a matter of convenience.

206
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,979
And this is a private matter, Luci.

207
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,516
You're finishing up at
Texas, aren't you, Lynda?

208
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,860
- Next year, ma'am.
- She's dating George Hamilton, you know?

209
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,886
- The actor?
- Yeah.

210
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,257
- With the tan?
- And your sister may consider that a private matter, too.

211
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,293
Mother, you must be joking.

212
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,332
Come on now, damn it.
What's the reason this time?

213
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,268
I don't have the qualifications
to be CIA director.

214
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,036
I decide the qualifications.

215
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,872
You had all the qualifications to
be attorney general, didn't you?

216
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,875
To succeed Bobby Kennedy.

217
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,611
Yeah, and here I am stuck with
a friend of his... Katzenbach.

218
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,947
- He's excellent.
- Aw, well, look.

219
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,583
All right, you told me your
interest was foreign affairs.

220
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,694
Well, that's where I need
your help... foreign affairs.

221
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,388
What is CIA but foreign affairs?

222
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,523
I think my skills would better serve you

223
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,559
in foreign policy,
Mr. President,

224
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,362
not foreign intrigue.

225
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:57,531
I hear you billed
a million dollars last year.

226
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,300
First lawyer in the country to do that.

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,470
- True?
- Well, that's what 5% came to.

228
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,039
Well, hell, then you can
afford to take a hiatus

229
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,541
from all this moneymaking,

230
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,110
come serve your president.

231
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,446
I don't think you need
an attorney, old friend,

232
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,048
I think you need a magician.

233
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,351
- Magician?
- Yeah.

234
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:21,722
Someone who can make a small corner
of Southeast Asia disappear.

235
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,558
President Kennedy did not lose South Vietnam

236
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,627
and I'm not gonna lose South Vietnam.

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,128
I kept all these people on.

238
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:31,199
They assured me he was
determined to stick it out.

239
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:34,702
Now, that little son of a bitch
Bobby's just hovering to swoop down

240
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,205
and reclaim the mantle if I fail.

241
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,106
He'll hang me from my left ball,

242
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,974
Goldwater'll hang me from my right.

243
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,911
That is complete nonsense.

244
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,880
You humiliated Goldwater in the election.

245
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,782
The entire right wing is in disarray.

246
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:51,752
Bobby is a freshman senator with no record.

247
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,825
His brother was a no-record
senator, too, wasn't he?

248
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:57,558
And he came out of nowhere.

249
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,460
Daddy?

250
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,230
Would you like some dessert
or are you on your diet?

251
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:04,665
Now, you save some for me,
honey, if it's good.

252
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,510
- How about you, Mr. Clifford?
- No, thank you, dear.

253
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:08,536
No, he's not getting anything.

254
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,175
Now,

255
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,314
Jack Kennedy put 16,000 advisors in there.

256
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:21,449
I put in another eight.

257
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,417
We've got 24,000 now,

258
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,986
teaching them people
how to shoot and fly planes.

259
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,289
We got patrols and covert operations.

260
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,090
We got an alphabet soup of aid programs,

261
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,760
a lot of which I'd like to have right here.

262
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:36,163
And none of it's working
because of all this coup shit.

263
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,107
It's like building bricks
with no mortar down there.

264
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,402
There's nothing real to hang it on.

265
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,304
Now, Ho Chi Minh knows this,

266
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,840
and he's gonna keep his people
attacking till there's nothing left.

267
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,377
Now, if we call it quits
and continue as we are,

268
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,180
South Vietnam, maybe the whole of
Southeast Asia, goes Communist.

269
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,484
Now, even George Ball admits that.

270
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,619
Everybody else thinks
we ought to up the ante.

271
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,788
Bombing?

272
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,626
Look at this.

273
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,833
Bunch of sheds just outside Hanoi.

274
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,436
And they call that a military target?

275
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,237
There's a school right up the street.

276
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,739
Poles built it for 'em.

277
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,276
Hell, Clark, I could build
them a thousand damn schools.

278
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:28,649
I'd like you to start to follow
the situation down there.

279
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,784
Read some of these reports
they keep throwing at me.

280
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,387
I just don't know what to believe anymore.

281
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,122
Biggest damn mess.

282
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,327
You'd be on the outside.
You could take a fresh look.

283
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,094
I'll do everything I can to help.

284
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,931
Yeah, except come work for me.

285
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,666
Hey, what about the Supreme Court?

286
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:46,934
What if a seat opens up?

287
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,969
I'm an advocate.
I'm not a judge.

288
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,806
Hell, Clark, you're a hick
lawyer from Missouri.

289
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,309
Well, I may be a hick lawyer from Missouri,

290
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:56,844
but as you yourself pointed out,

291
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:01,349
I haven't made Missouri wages
for a long, long time.

292
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:06,153
You know, I ran saying I was for peace.

293
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,323
Now, sure as hell they're
telling me I gotta do

294
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,559
what I said I wasn't gonna do,

295
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,027
what Goldwater was gonna do.

296
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,073
Luci's converting to Catholicism.

297
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,875
Big decision for a young girl.

298
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,577
He told me.

299
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,912
He said when the press gets hold of it,

300
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,082
they'll make it sound as if she did
it as a tribute to the Kennedys.

301
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,888
I swear, I think he was only half joking.

302
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,995
Clark?

303
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,281
Hello?

304
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,784
I'm sorry, he's asleep.

305
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,028
He's just gotten over pneumonia.

306
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,655
I'd rather not wake him.

307
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,390
I... I know.

308
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:19,292
- Is it possible...
- Marg?

309
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,666
Sorry, Bob. Must be pretty
damn bad to keep you at home.

310
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,801
Let's just call it the Hanoi flu.

311
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,102
What the hell's going on here?

312
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,905
General. II Corps
Headquarters at Pleiku.

313
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,941
Vietcong cut through the wire.

314
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:37,277
Blew up our advisors' barracks,
planes, choppers on the runway.

315
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,079
- In Camp Holloway...
- Casualty report.

316
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,147
More of the same.

317
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,882
Advisors' compound next door.

318
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,852
VC got in with mortars
and grenade launchers.

319
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,787
There are eight dead,
120-plus wounded,

320
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,355
six choppers, one transport destroyed,

321
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,857
other aircraft severely damaged.

322
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,959
Mr. Secretary?

323
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:55,929
The National Security Advisor's
in Saigon, is he not?

324
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,766
Didn't the CIA say Hanoi
would connect Bundy's visit

325
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,267
with a decision on bombing?

326
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,303
Vietcong agents in Saigon
government probably leaked it out.

327
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,706
And knowing this, knowing this,

328
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,307
look what they did, Bob.

329
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,209
They blew up 128 people

330
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,944
just to thumb their noses at us.

331
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,413
Now what the hell are we gonna do about it?

332
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,853
Number 33, the North Vietnamese
barracks at Dong Hoi

333
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,089
just over the border in North Vietnam.

334
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,824
About 6,000 troops based there.

335
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,494
An isolated facility with
minimal civilian support.

336
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:27,995
What are our expected casualties?

337
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:30,598
3,600 troops, roughly 40 civilians.

338
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,365
How'd you come up with these numbers?

339
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,267
Sir, we take the approach,

340
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,236
look at the blast pattern,

341
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,839
the size of the blast, demographics.

342
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,476
Mr. President, it's as sophisticated
an analysis as I've seen,

343
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,045
unprecedented in aerial warfare.

344
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,115
But Ho Chi Minh's not gonna
turn tail overnight.

345
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:51,184
Saigon's gonna take a
shellacking for anything we do.

346
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,353
And if they go in now,
it'll be like sending in

347
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,856
a widow woman to slap Jack Dempsey.

348
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,391
Sir, we doubt Hanoi will slap back.

349
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,127
Didn't MacArthur say the same thing

350
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,963
when a million Chinese poured into Korea?

351
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,335
What does State think of this?

352
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:12,172
The risk of inaction means more aggression.

353
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,574
Ambassador Taylor concurs.

354
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,843
He's meeting with Saigon's leaders now.

355
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,011
Should be calling the
Situation Room momentarily.

356
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,647
They'll put him through to me.

357
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,448
Mr. President,
if I might.

358
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,552
I was in charge of bombing
surveys during World War II,

359
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,820
and bombing never wins a war.

360
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:30,123
Rather than erode the enemy's
will, it strengthens it.

361
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:33,060
We've seen this time and time
again... in the Blitz, Berlin.

362
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,704
The Blitz in Berlin
never would have happened

363
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,064
if we didn't lay down to Hitler in Munich.

364
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,242
And if we lay down now, it'll
be the same thing again...

365
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,102
An open invitation
to more of their aggression.

366
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,638
Mr. President, what we're
proposing with Rolling Thunder

367
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:47,675
is a strictly limited program
of sustained retaliation,

368
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,178
moving northward only if
Vietcong activity persists.

369
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:53,080
But it will persist, Bob.

370
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,824
We'll be bombing their cities
before we know it.

371
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:57,918
Now, do we expect Russia to
sit still for that? Or China?

372
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,588
Comparisons with Korea 15 years ago

373
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,590
are flimsy at best,
Mr. President.

374
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,559
- You are absolutely right.
- China has atomic weapons now.

375
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:07,136
They tested their first
bomb four months ago.

376
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,261
It was no dud.

377
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,798
We have no idea what will set them off.

378
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,266
I-I don't understand.

379
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,568
Why is this?

380
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,704
North Vietnam has secret treaties

381
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,739
with the Chi-Coms,
Mr. President.

382
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,109
We don't know what the flash
points are in their intervention.

383
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,945
We can take China out in 17 minutes.

384
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,814
They'd be crazy to take us on.

385
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:31,551
I agree, Bus, but why assume
they're as rational as we are?

386
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:35,355
Mr. President, 400 Americans
have died in Vietnam.

387
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,125
And now eight more in these atrocities.

388
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,861
There has to be a response
to this aggression.

389
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:42,362
Mr. President,
the Air Force

390
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:46,466
will be launching strikes
from the Da Nang airfield,

391
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,236
and that base will become a more
attractive target to the Vietcong.

392
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,872
General Westmoreland is requesting
a Hawk missile battalion.

393
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,908
- Is he asking for troops?
- No, no troops.

394
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,611
Saigon will be responsible for base defense.

395
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,648
But if the Vietcong activity intensifies

396
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,783
despite these measures,
they may need some help.

397
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,885
But it will intensify, Bob.

398
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,954
This is precisely
my point, Mr. President.

399
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,124
Yes?

400
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,994
- Mr. Secretary, Saigon.
- Ambassador Taylor.

401
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,495
Put him through.

402
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,999
Max, we're all here with the president.
Go ahead.

403
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,401
Mr. President, gentlemen.

404
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:24,705
Saigon has agreed to the
commencement of air strikes.

405
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,675
They say their army's ready for
any counterattack from the north.

406
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,877
All right, Max.
Thank you.

407
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,483
George...

408
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,753
your concerns are mine as well, as you know.

409
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:42,589
But we're nowhere near
the point you suggest.

410
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,491
Now, many here agree there's a good chance

411
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:48,696
that Ho Chi Minh will quit
if we start making him pay.

412
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,865
Now, is there anyone here
who does not agree with this?

413
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,466
I'm concerned about the press.

414
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,568
They're gonna view this
as a change in policy.

415
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,370
There is no change in policy!

416
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:00,407
But we haven't struck back since the
Tonkin Gulf affair six months ago.

417
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,976
That's right. That's why I
asked Congress for the power.

418
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,378
They gave me the power, and I'm using it.

419
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,915
But we're taking it slow.

420
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,151
I'm not going to Hanoi.

421
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:15,655
And I'm signing off on every target.

422
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:18,992
You're not gonna bomb the smallest
outhouse without checking with me.

423
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,493
You understand, General?

424
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,830
We understand,
Mr. President.

425
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,098
All right, Bob.
You better get going.

426
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,135
Now, anything else?

427
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,881
From Robert S. McNamara
to Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp,

428
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,051
Commander of Pacific Forces, Honolulu.

429
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:46,153
This is an execution order.

430
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:49,857
During daylight hours, 7
February, 1965, Saigon time,

431
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,026
conduct the following coordinated attack:

432
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,963
Number 33, Dong Hoi barracks.

433
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,145
- Good evening, Mr. President.
- Planes back?

434
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,290
Carriers weren't on station
when the order went out, sir.

435
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:16,083
The operation has been delayed.

436
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:18,118
- Delayed?
- About 90 minutes, sir.

437
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:19,753
We should have word shortly.

438
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,698
Stand at ease.

439
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,418
Well, what happened?

440
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:52,920
It's monsoon season there, sir.

441
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,855
Well, are they going or aren't they going?

442
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,224
You find out what the hell's
going on and you call me!

443
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,102
Get the White House operator
to put you through.

444
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,062
- You want me to wake you, sir?
- You won't wake me!

445
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,140
- Why are you up?
- Worried for you.

446
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:18,011
Those planes should've been back hours ago.

447
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,512
What's that?

448
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:22,582
It's a letter from a friend,
complaining about junkyards.

449
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,920
She says here,

450
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:30,090
"They're all up and down the highway now.

451
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:33,226
Through Dallas to San Antone, Houston"...

452
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,996
Right on the highway, or
away where people can't see?

453
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,932
No, right along the road,
defiling the countryside

454
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:42,269
through Waxahachie and Hillboro

455
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,038
and lovely San Marcos
where you went to school.

456
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:48,041
Love, don't.

457
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,843
Love.

458
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,047
Yes, Mr. President.

459
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:56,816
What are you doing about
junkyards on the highways?

460
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,518
- What?
- Junkyards!

461
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,763
Well, I'm sending something
over to your office right now.

462
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,455
You jump in your car in your jammies,

463
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,457
you might even beat it.

464
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:08,061
Yes?

465
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:11,098
I spoke with Honolulu.
They're cabling now.

466
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,532
Planes are back.

467
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,667
The primary was hit.

468
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,169
All the planes, they all get back?

469
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:19,306
No, sir. I'm afraid
we did lose one plane.

470
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,676
- What about the pilot?
- He went down at sea.

471
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,678
Search and rescue is looking for him now,

472
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,680
but I'm afraid it's not looking very good.

473
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,082
I'm sorry, sir.

474
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,119
All right.
Thank you, Bob.

475
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,187
Good night,
Mr. President.

476
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,923
Yes, Mr. President?

477
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,826
Lyndon.

478
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,663
I'm... I'm sorry.

479
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,800
Put this on Moyers' desk.

480
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,336
Yes, sir.

481
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,376
Honey?

482
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,411
We lost a pilot.

483
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,183
Sweetheart.

484
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:06,286
Sweetheart.

485
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,089
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

486
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:16,496
This isn't about junkyards, is it?

487
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,331
Shit, what time is it?

488
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:25,405
I told Sandra
I'd be home before 1:00.

489
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,876
She didn't call.

490
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,911
That's not a good sign.

491
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,116
How about you?

492
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,185
You coming or going?

493
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,752
He wants company.

494
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:45,125
We started bombing North Vietnam tonight.

495
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:47,094
Christ.

496
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:50,930
Are they talking about combat troops?

497
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:55,468
No.
Not yet, no.

498
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:59,472
Christ, I don't know what to tell the press.

499
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:02,209
We are backing into a war
here, for Christ's sake.

500
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,078
And it's a war he campaigned against.

501
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:09,449
But now he talks like he's putting
a paddle to Ho Chi Minh's behind.

502
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:12,552
Well, Johnson's
a deal-maker.

503
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,687
He's the best politician
this country's ever seen.

504
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,390
He'll find a way out of this.

505
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,827
Sure. He'll just get old
Uncle Ho down to the ranch,

506
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,196
serve him up some tasty barbecue

507
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,697
and then offer him a dam.

508
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:25,999
Or a federal judgeship.

509
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,137
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Good evening, Mr. President.

510
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,106
Congratulations on getting that
education bill out of committee.

511
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,541
Well, it hasn't passed yet, has it?

512
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:36,176
I want all you up there on the Hill,

513
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,978
day and night, getting me those yeas.

514
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:41,314
What is this?
Tapioca pudding?

515
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,050
Yes, sir.

516
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,351
Would you like it?

517
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,654
Now, voting rights.

518
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,056
That's the meat in the coconut.

519
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,657
Where do we stand?

520
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,127
At last tally, we are short 50 congressmen.

521
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,763
- But the Senate...
- Start with the House. Give me their names.

522
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:01,168
You want me to read
the roll, Mr. President?

523
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,735
All 435?

524
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,205
From Abbitt of Virginia
to Zablocki of Wisconsin.

525
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:07,674
Go.

526
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,887
Abbitt, Virginia, nay.

527
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,256
Abernethy, Mississippi, nay.

528
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,093
Where do you think you're going?

529
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,894
Home.

530
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:30,497
The hell you are. You're gonna
relieve him when he gives out.

531
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,835
Adair, Indiana, nay.

532
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,770
Adams, Washington, yea.

533
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,639
Addabbo, New York, yea.

534
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,641
Albert, Oklahoma, yea.

535
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,943
Boys, it doesn't look like

536
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,213
we're gonna be able to get
voting rights through.

537
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,814
Not this session.

538
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,084
Well, I must say, I don't understand, Mr.
President.

539
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:54,221
Only a month ago in your State of the
Union message, you made it perfect...

540
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:57,690
Reverend King, I have been to the well,

541
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:00,360
and the well has provided.

542
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,295
I got the votes on Medicare,

543
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,896
aid to education...

544
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,633
All these benefit the poor
and disenfranchised,

545
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,901
and you know who that is.

546
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,503
Please don't misunderstand.

547
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,105
We're very grateful,
Mr. President.

548
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,107
Attorney General Katzenbach here has written

549
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,476
a beautiful piece of legislation.

550
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:20,280
You think I wanna carry that
around in my ass pocket?

551
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,549
You see, it's this...

552
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:26,186
This problem I got in Southeast Asia,

553
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,587
the Vietnamese.

554
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,088
To them Southerners up on the Hill,

555
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,524
what are they but another
bunch of colored people?

556
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,663
And I go up there crawling for
more aid, as I must for Vietnam.

557
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:38,998
"Mr. President,"
old Wilbur Mills will say,

558
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,867
"you're gonna have to raise taxes,"

559
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,702
declare war, call up the reserves.

560
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,273
And by the way, that's gonna
cost you your War on Poverty,

561
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,708
"your voting rights
for Negroes."

562
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,711
Just like World War II killed the New Deal,

563
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,715
well, there ain't gonna be
World War III, I promise you.

564
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,851
I'm gonna nip this
in the bud. I am.

565
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,353
And as soon as I do,

566
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:03,956
I'll send that bill up
and more, I promise you.

567
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,126
There will be no delay.

568
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,230
Well, Mr. President,

569
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,632
we're going to be down in Selma,

570
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:15,101
marching for the vote,

571
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,869
and we expect you'll take notice

572
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,539
as to what we do down there.

573
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:21,908
During preparations for Martin Luther King's

574
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,010
second attempt to march to Montgomery,

575
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,513
four white men beat to death
a Boston clergyman,

576
00:32:26,546 --> 00:32:28,948
one of the 1,500 marchers.

577
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,850
The slain reverend, James Reeb,

578
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,353
had come to Selma in solidarity with Negroes

579
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,455
attempting to register to vote.

580
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:37,200
Amidst growing concern about increasing

581
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,091
racial violence in Alabama,

582
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,561
Governor George Wallace
is reportedly preparing a trip

583
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:44,564
to Washington, DC, to see the president.

584
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:48,768
Meanwhile, demonstrations continue
in front of the White House.

585
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,204
We demand justice!

586
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,005
Call them off!

587
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,683
Well, we didn't
organize it, Mr. President.

588
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,219
Call them off!
Get out there, both of you!

589
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:57,744
Call them off!

590
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,282
- Daddy?
- Why are you up?

591
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,417
Those goddamn agitators wake you?

592
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,486
No, I heard you yelling.

593
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,987
Sorry, honey.

594
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,189
How it can't be done.

595
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:12,625
It's still strange to us, though,

596
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,728
how millions of dollars
can be spent every day

597
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:18,398
to hold troops in South Vietnam,

598
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:21,434
and our country cannot protect
the rights of Negroes

599
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:24,704
in Selma and Marion, Alabama.

600
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,606
He's outrageous!

601
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,476
Now, now, now!
Everything's gotta be now!

602
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,913
What, they want the whole goddamn
world with a fence around it?

603
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,848
I just gave standby authorization

604
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:37,350
to federalize the Alabama Guard.

605
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,685
We just need your order.

606
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,186
You have to do it,
Mr. President.

607
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,821
Wallace won't protect those marchers.

608
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,556
You want me to send troops into Alabama?

609
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,358
Lose Stennis, Dirksen, Russell,

610
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:48,495
every conservative vote I got
hanging on a thread of spittle?

611
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,863
It'll be Reconstruction all over again.

612
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:55,768
Your friend Bobby Kennedy could
have given me that advice!

613
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:59,238
Martin Luther King and
his group of pro-Communists

614
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,274
have instigated these demonstrations

615
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:04,877
by lawless nigger mobs in Birmingham.

616
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,747
But the law-abiding citizens
of both races there

617
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,750
are fed up with this rioting and disruption

618
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,286
led by
so-called clergymen

619
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,722
and their Communist-inspired followers!

620
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:19,859
I am therefore sending 250
state troopers into that city,

621
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,830
supported by 500 other law
officers of this state.

622
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,333
I will meet our enemies
face-to-face.

623
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:27,967
I will not surrender!

624
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,879
Mr. President, Wallace
is only coming up here

625
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,071
in order to placate you.

626
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,906
He wants things to get so bad down there

627
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,542
that you have to put the troops in.

628
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,844
Then he'll lambaste you for
invading his sovereign state,

629
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:39,154
and that's how he'll save himself.

630
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,515
Goddamn runty little bastard!

631
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,817
I want his pecker in my pocket.

632
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:48,588
The thing we have to do... we have
to get him to ask for the troops,

633
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:50,590
to say he wants rights, he wants peace,

634
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:52,725
but he just can't control his own people.

635
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,599
Make it his failure.
That's what we have to do.

636
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:56,863
In an interview today,
Governor Wallace denies

637
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:01,033
that Alabama state troopers and sheriff's
deputies used unnecessary force

638
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,503
in routing Negro marchers in Selma.

639
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,338
Call the speaker.

640
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:08,007
Tell him I want to address Congress

641
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,209
on television.

642
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:14,180
That goddamn bill is going up now.

643
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,048
One more, Governor Wallace.

644
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,652
A little closer.

645
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:21,554
Thank you.

646
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,856
All right, thank you.
Sit down, Governor.

647
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,892
Over here.
That's it.

648
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:27,827
Over there...
Right in the corner.

649
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,896
The corner, Governor.
That's it.

650
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,066
Now, Governor, you wanted to see me?

651
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,768
Yes,
Mr. President.

652
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,904
I want to thank you
for agreeing to see me...

653
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,906
Goddamn demonstrators!

654
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,642
Keeping Lady Bird up,
disturbing my daughters' rest.

655
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:44,611
Turn that thing off!

656
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,046
Subversives, most of em.

657
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,358
- Communist Party's behind the whole thing.
- You know what I'd do?

658
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:50,993
I'd send some of them Secret Service boys

659
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,485
out there with itching powder.

660
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,654
Sprinkle it on the back
of some of their necks.

661
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,322
They'd drop them signs they're carrying,

662
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,957
scratch themselves raw.

663
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,494
That's a great idea.

664
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:03,463
I'm gonna get my people on that.

665
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,132
Better than that, Governor,
we ought to go out there.

666
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,934
We got all of those television cameras.

667
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,112
You see those television
cameras they've got out there?

668
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:11,604
Yes, sir.

669
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,073
Why don't we go out there and
we turn them cameras around,

670
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,575
and we'll announce that you decided

671
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,844
to register every Negro in Alabama?

672
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,080
Mr. President,
as much as I'd...

673
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,825
Nick, give me one of them
there Constitutions.

674
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,116
Yes, sir.

675
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,419
Nick's got the Constitutions.

676
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,855
Hey, thank you, Nick.

677
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,957
Now, Governor,

678
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm sure that somewhere in here

679
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,496
it says that Negroes have the right to vote.

680
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,666
Yes, Mr. President,

681
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:42,969
and... and they have the
right to vote in Alabama.

682
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,672
But it's the county registrars.

683
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,007
They... they...
Under Alabama law,

684
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,577
they independent,
and I don't have the power.

685
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,479
George.

686
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:57,016
Now don't you shit me about
who's got the power in Alabama.

687
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,953
- Well, Mr. President...
- Now come on, Governor.

688
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,689
You're a persuasive man.

689
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,925
Hell, I was watching you this
morning on all three networks.

690
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,694
You were attacking me.

691
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,696
I wasn't attacking you,
Mr. President.

692
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,699
- I was attacking the idea...
- Idea. Hell, you were attacking me, George.

693
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:17,003
And I'll tell ya, you're so damn
persuasive, I nearly changed my mind.

694
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,874
You have marvelous powers of persuasion,

695
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,511
don't you, Governor?

696
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:26,779
Governor Wallace,

697
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:28,848
you and I shouldn't be sitting here

698
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:31,851
thinking about 1965.

699
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:34,554
We ought to be thinking about 1995,

700
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:37,456
when you and I will be long in our graves.

701
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,768
Now, you've got a lot of poor
people down there in Alabama,

702
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,127
a lot of ignorant people.

703
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,996
People who need jobs,
people who need a future.

704
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,533
You can do a lot for 'em.

705
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:50,336
In 1995, Governor,
what do you want left behind?

706
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,172
You want a great big marble monument saying.

707
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:55,241
"George Wallace, he built,"

708
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,577
he protected the weak, the poor,

709
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,981
the impoverished people
of this great state"?

710
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,751
Or do you want a little
piece of scrawny pine

711
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:09,856
laying there in the harsh,
caliche soil saying.

712
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:14,193
"George Wallace, he hated"?

713
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,870
I'm sorry, Governor.

714
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,505
I interrupted you.

715
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,240
Now, you wanted to tell me something?

716
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:35,281
Mr. President,
I...

717
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:39,986
I've had the opportunity to reevaluate.

718
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,324
And, I think that...

719
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,562
I just may not be able
to get things under control

720
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:54,266
without some...
assistance.

721
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,737
Governor, I'll give you any assistance

722
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,706
that's mine to provide.

723
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:04,210
Now, what specific measures
would you suggest?

724
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:07,046
The president and I have spoken,

725
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,051
and I have assured him
that I abhor brutality.

726
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:15,087
And in my eternal commitment
to law and order,

727
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:18,324
I will do whatever it takes

728
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,927
to maintain the peace.

729
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:31,871
Mr. Speaker,

730
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:35,107
the President of the United States!

731
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:25,457
I speak tonight for the dignity of men

732
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,894
and the destiny of democracy.

733
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,199
There is no Negro problem.

734
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:36,168
There is no southern problem.

735
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:40,206
There is no northern problem.

736
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,342
There is only an American problem.

737
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,152
There is no cause for pride

738
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,321
in what has happened in Selma.

739
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:58,858
The cries of pain

740
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:02,661
and the hymns and protests
of oppressed people

741
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:04,897
have summoned into convocation

742
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:08,067
all the majesty of this great government.

743
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,671
Our mission is at once the oldest

744
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:16,876
and most basic of this country...

745
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:21,080
To right wrong, to do justice,

746
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,315
to serve man.

747
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:39,799
This Wednesday, I will send you a law

748
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:43,102
which will eliminate illegal barriers

749
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:46,338
to the most basic American right...

750
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:49,809
The right to vote.

751
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:52,511
Many of the issues of civil rights

752
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:56,248
are very complex and most difficult.

753
00:41:56,282 --> 00:42:00,252
About this, there can
and should be no argument,

754
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:03,155
for outside this chamber

755
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:07,026
is the outraged conscience of a nation

756
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:10,362
and the harsh judgment of history.

757
00:42:10,396 --> 00:42:13,065
The cause of the American Negro

758
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,101
to secure for himself

759
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:18,037
the full blessings of American life

760
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,007
must be our cause.

761
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,550
Because, really,

762
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:36,055
it is all of us who must overcome

763
00:42:36,088 --> 00:42:41,760
the crippling legacy
of bigotry and injustice.

764
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:45,031
And we shall overcome.

765
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,183
Dick, 93 million on TV.
It's a record.

766
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,285
- Congratulations, Dick.
- Thanks.

767
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:41,053
- Hey, Dick! Dick!
- Come over here.

768
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:42,554
Switchboard is jammed.

769
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:45,157
Haven't had this many calls
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

770
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:47,259
Good to know they don't
only call to complain.

771
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:49,595
Hey, Dick, sit down, sit down.

772
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,197
That was old Dick Russell.

773
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,399
Says I'm a low-down cur
and a turncoat,

774
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,434
but he wants me to know
that's the best speech

775
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,269
he ever saw any president give,

776
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,438
and that goes back to Lincoln!

777
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,940
Mr. President,
Dr. King.

778
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,342
Dr...
Reverend King.

779
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,577
That's kind of you to call.

780
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:07,313
Did you know I was on TV tonight?

781
00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:11,617
You saw it.
Yeah,

782
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,286
Okay, good.
All right.

783
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,855
All right.
Yeah. Bye.

784
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,724
You've got Arthur Krim on line three, sir.

785
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,226
No, no.
Not... no, I can't...

786
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:22,394
- No, no. No.
- Sir.

787
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:25,064
You know, boys,

788
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:27,533
I'm reminded tonight

789
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:29,936
of Texas Hill Country in the spring.

790
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:32,338
Lyndon, your guests are far too weary

791
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:34,006
to appreciate your poetry.

792
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,842
Now let me tell you boys about
the Hill Country in the spring.

793
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:40,346
- Good night!
- You see... no.

794
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:42,814
- Good night, all.
- Good night, Mrs. Johnson.

795
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:45,384
- Good night. Luci.
- Now, in the spring...

796
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:48,520
Luci, come with me.

797
00:44:48,554 --> 00:44:51,323
- Good night.
- Good night.

798
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:53,592
- Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
- Good night.

799
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,930
In the spring,

800
00:44:57,964 --> 00:44:59,898
in the Hill Country,

801
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:04,303
the sun is up earlier
and the ground gets warmer,

802
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:07,106
and you can see the steam rising

803
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:09,508
and the sap dripping.

804
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:13,980
And in his pen, there's my prize bull.

805
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,748
Now, he is the biggest...

806
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:24,823
best-hung bull
in Hill Country.

807
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,925
Well, in the spring,

808
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:29,828
that bull gets a hankering for them cows,

809
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:32,264
and he starts pawing the ground

810
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:33,932
and getting restless.

811
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:36,702
So I open up the pen,

812
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,870
and he goes down the hill

813
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:43,309
with his pecker hanging hard and swinging.

814
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,447
Well, those cows get so goddamn excited,

815
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,518
they get more and more moist to receive him,

816
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:55,621
and their asses just start quivering.

817
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:00,392
They start quivering over...
Every one of 'em is quivering!

818
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,931
And as that bull struts
into their pasture...

819
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:09,735
Boys, we had 'em quivering tonight!

820
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:21,280
Arriving in naval transports,
United States Marines

821
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:24,350
storm the beach in Da Nang,
Vietnam, in full battle gear.

822
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,485
These are the first
U.S. ground troops

823
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:29,555
to step foot on Asian soil
since the Korean War.

824
00:46:29,588 --> 00:46:32,624
They were greeted by
some lovely local ladies.

825
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:35,561
The Pentagon says that their
mission is a defensive one...

826
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:37,729
To protect the U.S. air base
from enemy attack

827
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:40,799
so Operation Rolling Thunder can roll on.

828
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:43,835
Speaking with reporters,
President Johnson emphasized

829
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,372
that these 3,500 Marines will free up

830
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:49,041
the South Vietnamese troops
now guarding the base

831
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:51,610
to go out and fight Vietcong.

832
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:54,580
Reports from the field, however,
indicate that Saigon forces

833
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:57,216
may be no match for full Vietcong regiments.

834
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:00,452
Recently, in one of the heaviest
attacks of the war so far,

835
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:03,222
the Vietcong inflicted major casualties

836
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:04,923
in Quang Nam Province.

837
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:08,127
Unofficial sources say that many
South Vietnamese army units

838
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,129
are near collapse.

839
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,265
My, my.

840
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:17,836
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

841
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,738
No, no, sit down.
Sit down, boys.

842
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:23,375
I heard you fellas were talking over dinner.

843
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,553
- Can I get you a plate of food, Mr. President?
- No, thank you.

844
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:27,179
- A drink?
- No.

845
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:33,319
Why?

846
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,854
Why do they want war with us?

847
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,790
To Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese,

848
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:41,460
this is just a continuation
of the war with the French

849
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:43,695
and the Japanese and the Chinese

850
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:45,431
a thousand years before that.

851
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:47,133
We never should have allowed the French

852
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,501
to reclaim their colonies in '45,

853
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:52,238
but we needed them allied
with us against the Soviets,

854
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,840
and that was their price.

855
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,376
Will we end up like the French?

856
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,844
A great power cutting and running

857
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,046
from a bunch of little men in black pajamas,

858
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,350
tucking our tail in defeat?

859
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,418
France didn't have the firepower we have.

860
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:09,121
But the bombing seems to have no effect.

861
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:10,956
Well, it appears now
that it won't stop them,

862
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:13,559
but it has slowed down their resupply.

863
00:48:13,592 --> 00:48:15,761
Hanoi's starting to send down large units,

864
00:48:15,794 --> 00:48:19,064
and the more of their men we can tie
up with repairing roads and bridges,

865
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,900
the fewer they can spare to fight the south.

866
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:27,105
What do we have there now?

867
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:30,108
Well, we've got the 3rd Marines at Da Nang,

868
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:33,745
Phu Bai, Chu Lai, the 173rd
Airborne at Vung Tau

869
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:36,482
for base defense and support
of the South Vietnamese units.

870
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:37,983
13 battalions in all.

871
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:41,353
Never mind battalions.
How many boys?

872
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:43,622
51,000 troops,
Mr. President.

873
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:45,691
And Westmoreland wants how many?

874
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,033
184,000.

875
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:58,404
And the authority to launch
offensive operations

876
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:00,172
under his own command.

877
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,645
The South Vietnamese
are useless, Mr. President.

878
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:08,518
They've lost four battalions
in the last month.

879
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:10,382
Desertions are at record levels.

880
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,726
They're losing, and they're losing fast.

881
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,319
I know they're losing!

882
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:16,188
I don't need a Phi Beta Kappa
key to know they're losing!

883
00:49:16,222 --> 00:49:18,357
Anyone smart enough
to pour piss out of a boot

884
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,925
knows they're losing!

885
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:30,001
How many casualties you think we'll take?

886
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:36,242
We could reach 500 a month
by the end of the year

887
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:39,110
if Hanoi hasn't quit by then.

888
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:41,447
500 a month?

889
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,317
You tell Westmoreland
he's got the authority.

890
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:47,253
Tell him to get out there and kill Vietcong.

891
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:49,788
Do whatever he has to do to hold them off.

892
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,557
Then you and Wheeler go and see him

893
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,893
and nail him down on what he needs
to get this thing over with.

894
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:57,963
Then damn it, let's get it over with!

895
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,103
Kid was setting fuses on the goddamn bridge.

896
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:06,638
Do you believe it?

897
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:08,274
I was five minutes away.

898
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:11,477
And that potshot, last time I was
here, he missed me by a mile.

899
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,381
Jesus, you'd think they'd put
their best sniper on the job.

900
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:16,748
I wish I could tell you

901
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:19,418
they were representative
of the enemy, Mr. Secretary.

902
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:26,157
My strategy for the war
is divided into three phases.

903
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:28,159
In Phase One,

904
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:31,997
employing the 184,000-man
level now being considered,

905
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,001
we would halt the losing
trend by the end of 1965.

906
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,469
In Phase Two,

907
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:41,473
for which an additional 100,000
troops would be needed,

908
00:50:41,507 --> 00:50:46,312
allied forces would gain the
initiative by June 30, 1966.

909
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:49,381
Pacification activities would be expanded,

910
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:52,618
aimed at winning the hearts and minds

911
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:55,554
of South Vietnamese peasantry.

912
00:50:55,587 --> 00:50:58,256
If the Communists do not then give up,

913
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,859
Phase Three of our strategy would kick in,

914
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:05,196
the win phase, which would
begin on July 1st, 1966,

915
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,435
and conclude by December 31st, 1967...

916
00:51:09,468 --> 00:51:13,439
The defeat of remaining
enemy forces and base areas.

917
00:51:13,472 --> 00:51:17,208
Additional reinforcements
will be needed for this phase,

918
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:21,980
following which allied forces
will begin to be withdrawn.

919
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:24,383
General, that's a marvelous plan,

920
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:27,553
but excessively abstract.

921
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:29,388
I want to see your numbers.

922
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:32,257
I want to see the percentage
of the country you now control

923
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,992
and the percentage you intend to control

924
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:36,662
with these 200,000 additional men.

925
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:39,498
I want to see rates of
infiltration and interdiction,

926
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:42,200
force ratios in each
of the tactical corps zones

927
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,470
and enemy casualties in battles fought

928
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:48,206
and in projected battles
against these added forces.

929
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,729
Mr. Clifford?
The president on line one.

930
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:14,065
Old friend, I need you here.

931
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:25,544
Whatever resources are lost
through bombing or capture,

932
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:27,345
China and Russia will make up with resupply,

933
00:52:27,379 --> 00:52:30,582
encouraging a friendly game of "I'm
more revolutionary than thou."

934
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:33,985
Our intervention will give them
a cause over which to unite

935
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:36,398
when it is in our interest to
deepen the breach between them.

936
00:52:36,422 --> 00:52:38,165
But wouldn't we lose credibility
throughout the world

937
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,591
if we give up as you propose?

938
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:42,027
Wouldn't this be
an irreparable blow, George?

939
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,529
A worse blow,
Mr. President,

940
00:52:43,562 --> 00:52:45,339
would be that the mightiest
power in the world

941
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,666
is unable to defeat
one of the most backward.

942
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:50,168
With the 71 battalions, with Westy's plan,

943
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,537
this war is winnable.

944
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,739
I say we go in and we get the job done.

945
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:55,441
But can we get the job done?

946
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:58,176
What if they put their stack in?

947
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,979
What makes you think if we put
in the numbers you're suggesting

948
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,482
that Ho Chi Minh won't match us man for man?

949
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:06,317
This means greater bodies
of men, Mr. President,

950
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,153
which will allow us to cream them.

951
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,155
Their firepower against ours.

952
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,791
Why does anyone think
that they will accommodate us

953
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,325
by fighting our kind of war?

954
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,795
Their tactics are terror and sniping.

955
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:19,097
They have better access to intelligence.

956
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,766
Why is this?

957
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,734
It's because the South Vietnamese government

958
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:26,905
is heavily infiltrated with
Vietcong agents, Mr. President.

959
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:29,074
What other road can we go?

960
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:30,876
Negotiations, stopping the bombing?

961
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:33,779
These make us look weak, with cup in hand.

962
00:53:33,812 --> 00:53:36,515
Better to lose now than after
committing 200,000 men.

963
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:37,883
I disagree.

964
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,585
We have to make a stand here.

965
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:42,588
And if we fail, it could be chalked
up to any number of things.

966
00:53:42,621 --> 00:53:44,656
Corruption amongst Saigon's
leaders, for instance.

967
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,091
Then we can get out.

968
00:53:46,124 --> 00:53:48,302
But this government will have
stood up to the Communists.

969
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:50,261
But we won't get out, Bob.

970
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:53,264
We will double our bets and get
massacred in the rice paddies.

971
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:55,400
So... so what's
your advice, George?

972
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,968
Cut and run?

973
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,871
Mr. President...

974
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,274
no great captain in history

975
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:05,844
ever hesitated to make a tactical withdrawal

976
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:08,179
when conditions were unfavorable to him.

977
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,453
Does anyone else here agree
with what George is saying?

978
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,928
I've asked Clark Clifford to join us.

979
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:26,732
Clark, do you have
any comments at this time?

980
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:31,837
I... I have a question
for General Wheeler.

981
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,071
Yes, sir.

982
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,874
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning.

983
00:54:35,907 --> 00:54:39,578
If the president proceeds with this plan,

984
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:43,582
what, in your view, would
constitute a victory?

985
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:46,818
What is the definition
of victory in this contest?

986
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,554
Yes.

987
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:51,222
A military victory in the traditional sense

988
00:54:51,256 --> 00:54:53,525
is not what we are seeking.

989
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,227
To eliminate every last Vietcong guerilla

990
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:59,765
could require as many as half a million men

991
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:01,633
and five years...

992
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:04,970
No one's considering those
kind of numbers, no one.

993
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:08,306
Our objective is to reach a stalemate

994
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,842
whereby we are attriting the enemy

995
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:14,345
faster than he can replace his losses.

996
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:17,348
This is the so-called
crossover point.

997
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:19,150
And how many men will this require?

998
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:21,553
A substantially smaller number,

999
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:25,791
depending on how the North
Vietnamese respond.

1000
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,960
Well, might they respond by sending in, say,

1001
00:55:28,994 --> 00:55:31,262
100,000 troops?

1002
00:55:31,296 --> 00:55:33,331
We regard this as unlikely.

1003
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:36,467
Well, this is less than half
the men they have under arms.

1004
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,169
Well, it's certainly possible.

1005
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:40,371
They already have 50,000 men down there.

1006
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:43,174
And to achieve
the ten-to-one superiority,

1007
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:45,343
which I understand is barely adequate

1008
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:49,414
for conventional forces
in a guerilla situation,

1009
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:51,717
how many troops would be required

1010
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,484
to meet this possible threat?

1011
00:55:54,953 --> 00:55:57,088
As I said, this would be unlikely.

1012
00:55:57,122 --> 00:56:00,291
One million troops,
is that not correct, General?

1013
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,729
You see?

1014
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:09,267
We would need one million men in Vietnam.

1015
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:19,377
Excuse me.
Clark.

1016
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,012
I can't tell you how grateful I am

1017
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,981
to finally have an ally at the barricades.

1018
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:25,917
Well, it's just what makes sense, George.

1019
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:28,987
Not to Bob McNamara, but to me.

1020
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,091
A million men was straight out of
your memo of October last year.

1021
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:36,061
An impressively persuasive
document, in my opinion.

1022
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:38,129
- All 67 pages of it?
- Well...

1023
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:40,966
I haven't shown much restraint
on the subject, it's true.

1024
00:56:40,999 --> 00:56:43,401
If he brought you in,
it must be because I'm like

1025
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,937
an old broken record now.

1026
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:47,673
Well, then there'd be two of us.

1027
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:50,208
Scratchy and irritating as hell.

1028
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:52,043
Good day, George.

1029
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,779
Yeah?

1030
00:56:53,812 --> 00:56:56,223
The VISTA volunteers are here for
the pictures, Mr. President.

1031
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,683
Tell 'em I'll be out in a minute.

1032
00:56:57,716 --> 00:57:01,252
And tell Valenti I wanna
see him right after.

1033
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:04,155
I called Marge as soon
as I heard you were safe.

1034
00:57:04,189 --> 00:57:05,824
Cowards.

1035
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,769
I really appreciated that.
She was pretty shaken up.

1036
00:57:07,793 --> 00:57:09,336
- Well...
- She hates when I go over there.

1037
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,296
Well, I hate sending you.

1038
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:13,464
The whole thing stinks to high heaven.

1039
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:17,235
What did you want to tell me in private?

1040
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:23,174
I've managed to keep
these Vietnam expenditures

1041
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,743
under wraps as you requested,

1042
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:26,845
but if you decide to move forward with this,

1043
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:30,281
it's going to be impossible to
keep up the guise indefinitely,

1044
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:33,451
and I strongly believe you should present
this bill to the American people.

1045
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:34,953
No, absolutely not.

1046
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:38,623
Mr. President, I can't continue
to hide these kinds of figures.

1047
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:41,359
Phase One of Westmoreland's program alone

1048
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:43,995
is going to run us $12 billion.

1049
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:47,032
12 billion?

1050
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:49,835
I can't ask Congress for $12 billion!

1051
00:57:49,868 --> 00:57:52,938
- Mr. President...
- Bob, it'll be unshirted hell if I go to the Hill

1052
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,639
asking for that kind of money.

1053
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,808
I'll never get another thing
out of 'em again.

1054
00:57:56,842 --> 00:58:00,111
Now, how much can you trim off that?

1055
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:03,414
Bob, I've got my ox in a ditch here.

1056
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:06,384
Now, what can you do for me?

1057
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:09,988
If we continue to use the maximum
transfer authority from other areas,

1058
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:11,565
I could probably cut these figures in half,

1059
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,158
but we'd still need a big appropriation

1060
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:15,493
to carry us through this year.

1061
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,796
But Westmoreland says if we put the men in,

1062
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:19,707
there's a chance they'll quit
by year's end, right?

1063
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:21,208
Well, that's certainly what we all hope,

1064
00:58:21,232 --> 00:58:22,433
but we can't count on West...

1065
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:24,435
Just do the number counting, will you, Bob?

1066
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,805
Yeah.
Get it as low as you can.

1067
00:58:28,907 --> 00:58:30,942
One more.

1068
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:37,248
All right. All right.
Thank you, thank you.

1069
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:41,352
Jack, I need a statement for next week.

1070
00:58:41,386 --> 00:58:44,222
I'm not sure yet if I'm gonna
use it, but I need it ready.

1071
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:45,723
All right, Mr. President.

1072
00:58:45,757 --> 00:58:48,126
You know, Jack, I want war
like I want polio.

1073
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,560
The shooting, the bombing...

1074
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:51,696
Goes against every bone in my body.

1075
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:54,232
You know that better than almost anyone.

1076
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,202
These young people here,
that's what I'm all about.

1077
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:59,404
That was me, in Cotulla,

1078
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:01,372
teaching Mexican kids living in hovels,

1079
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:04,609
treated worse than you'd treat a dog.

1080
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:07,412
But here I'd start
a billion-dollar bank for 'em

1081
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,314
in Southeast Asia, free money,

1082
00:59:09,347 --> 00:59:11,516
and Ho Chi Minh wants no part of it.

1083
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:14,419
I could have turned that place
into the Tennessee Valley.

1084
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:16,754
I read he said he's willing
to fight for 20 years.

1085
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:18,589
I know what he says, I know what I say,

1086
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:20,725
and I know what I must do
despite what I say.

1087
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,828
Damn it!

1088
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,964
I want to leave the footprint
of America in Vietnam.

1089
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:29,000
Schools, dams, hospitals.

1090
00:59:29,034 --> 00:59:31,536
Bomb craters, that'll be our footprint.

1091
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,939
That's what they'll remember me for.

1092
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:36,474
Not for health care or
civil rights or education.

1093
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:40,311
No, sir. It'll be Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.

1094
00:59:40,345 --> 00:59:42,580
20 bills I'm trying to get out of committee,

1095
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,016
and 12 out of 18 working hours every day,

1096
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,887
my head's stuck up that raggedy-ass
little fourth-rate country

1097
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,823
that doesn't even have
the fight to save itself.

1098
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,295
You get with McNamara.

1099
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:58,930
You know what it's got to say.

1100
00:59:58,964 --> 01:00:02,600
And tell Busby or Goodwin
to put the music to it, Jack.

1101
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,814
Why are you up?

1102
01:00:16,848 --> 01:00:18,716
You needn't ask me that each time.

1103
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:21,987
Tried not to wake you.

1104
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,255
Got the ringer so low, I can't hear it.

1105
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,457
Got the flashlight.

1106
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:29,694
Maybe you ought to sleep
in that other room you set up.

1107
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,130
What happened to that prime rib
from the Medicare meeting?

1108
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:33,764
Is that what you want?

1109
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,134
There's a nice chicken left
over from the Education lunch.

1110
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:39,004
I saw 'em put it away.

1111
01:00:39,037 --> 01:00:41,639
Darling, you've been so
good about your diet,

1112
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:45,210
- but I don't see any point in the middle of the night...
- I don't care about that now.

1113
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:48,313
Another heart attack might
be the answer to my problems.

1114
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:50,515
All right, you stop
that kind of talk, please.

1115
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:51,983
I worry enough about your health.

1116
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:54,152
I'll fix something for you if you sit down.

1117
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:55,887
- All right.
- Come on.

1118
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:57,989
All right.

1119
01:00:58,023 --> 01:00:59,724
I'm sorry, honey.

1120
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,737
Luci met a boy.

1121
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,274
When she went on that Chicago
trip with you last week.

1122
01:01:16,307 --> 01:01:18,609
What do you mean, she met a boy?

1123
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:20,778
Why didn't I know about this?

1124
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,713
That day she went to Milwaukee

1125
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,449
and visited the William Feldsteins.

1126
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:29,254
She visited Beth Jenkins at Marquette,

1127
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:31,889
and Beth had some friends over,

1128
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:33,591
all the students there,

1129
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:38,863
and among them
was this... boy.

1130
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:42,033
Patrick Nugent is his name.

1131
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:44,535
He's Catholic.

1132
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:50,241
So Luci will only date boys
who are Catholic now.

1133
01:01:50,275 --> 01:01:52,777
And she calls him "Paddy."

1134
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,414
- Thank you.
- So I am paying attention.

1135
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:58,883
"He's just tons,
Mother."

1136
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:02,387
She said to me that's the new expression.

1137
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,190
Tons.
Move your elbow.

1138
01:02:05,223 --> 01:02:06,391
Thank you.

1139
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:09,294
Now, you like the chicken?

1140
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:11,129
You remarked on it.

1141
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:15,800
I didn't know of it.

1142
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:19,104
You might have shown it to me this morning.

1143
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:22,207
And woken you again?

1144
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,110
Like a jackass in a hailstorm.

1145
01:02:25,143 --> 01:02:28,279
I guess I'll just have
to hunker up and take it.

1146
01:02:30,148 --> 01:02:34,252
I feel like I'm going down in a plane.

1147
01:02:34,285 --> 01:02:37,222
I can crash with it and burn up

1148
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:39,757
or jump and die.

1149
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:43,094
Where we were when I came in,

1150
01:02:43,128 --> 01:02:45,863
I'd... I'd trade
back to that.

1151
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:50,768
I'd trade back to the damn vice presidency

1152
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:53,204
to get out of this mess.

1153
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,485
Clark, the president would
like you and your wife

1154
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:09,320
to join him at Camp David this weekend.

1155
01:03:09,354 --> 01:03:11,156
- Thank you, Bill.
- Thank the president.

1156
01:03:11,189 --> 01:03:13,891
We'd love to, but we have
a prior engagement.

1157
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:16,161
Clark, is there any way you can make it?

1158
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:18,529
He's working on an escalation speech.

1159
01:03:18,563 --> 01:03:20,465
Has he made up his mind?

1160
01:03:20,498 --> 01:03:23,101
I say yes, but he's asking for you.

1161
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:25,503
And who else will be there?

1162
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,538
Bob McNamara.

1163
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,399
Hi, Bob.

1164
01:03:57,235 --> 01:04:00,305
Mr. and Mrs. McNamara, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Pat Nugent.

1165
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,706
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

1166
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:03,208
A pleasure.
My wife Marg.

1167
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:04,451
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

1168
01:04:04,475 --> 01:04:05,919
Air National Guard?
Where are you stationed?

1169
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:08,313
I'll be at Andrews with the 113th, sir,

1170
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:10,148
but down to San Antonio first for basic.

1171
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:12,417
Lackland Air Force Base, sure.

1172
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,185
Used to call it Kelly back in '42

1173
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:16,930
when I was going around helping to
build an Air Force in this country.

1174
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,565
You know, we only had a handful of planes

1175
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:20,925
when the Japanese attacked us,
spread all over the country.

1176
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,194
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1177
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,938
And Hap Arnold knew the name
of every one of 'em.

1178
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,997
I've got some Hap Arnold stories for you.

1179
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,999
Yeah. Hey.

1180
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,501
Sorry.

1181
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:31,745
We'll leave everything till tomorrow.

1182
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:32,937
We'll talk in the morning.

1183
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,573
- I look forward to it.
- Come on in.

1184
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,342
Hey, how are you?

1185
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:41,579
Let the best minds of our administration

1186
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,681
start looking for a way out

1187
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:47,718
and stop looking for a way
to win this unwinnable war,

1188
01:04:47,752 --> 01:04:50,455
because it is my considered opinion

1189
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:55,460
that continuing on that path
will lead us to catastrophe.

1190
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:02,833
Any unbiased jury would
give you your verdict, Clark,

1191
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,635
no question.

1192
01:05:04,669 --> 01:05:06,571
But?

1193
01:05:06,604 --> 01:05:10,408
But if it's true what Moyers says,

1194
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,743
that Lyndon's in McNamara's pocket...

1195
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:20,117
McNamara has such sway in there.

1196
01:05:20,151 --> 01:05:23,654
Truman took your advice
over George Marshall's,

1197
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:24,822
for heaven's sakes.

1198
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:26,657
Kennedy, too.

1199
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:29,460
Yeah, but Lyndon is another kettle of fish.

1200
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:32,663
Give him a new vision, Clark.

1201
01:05:32,697 --> 01:05:35,966
He'll hear you.

1202
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,204
Rinaldo, leave it there.

1203
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:48,713
So, these are the numbers.

1204
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,715
Now, you will not be held accountable

1205
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:52,950
for anything that has
happened up to this point.

1206
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:56,854
In fact, you will be admired
for the noble attempt

1207
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:59,357
you have made to honor
your predecessor's commitment,

1208
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,993
a commitment that has been
exploited by that corrupt

1209
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:06,464
and self-destructive regime
in South Vietnam.

1210
01:06:06,497 --> 01:06:09,467
The bombing might have
worked, but it hasn't.

1211
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,269
And to make it work,

1212
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:14,472
you would have to resort
to unconscionable measures

1213
01:06:14,505 --> 01:06:18,309
that would make you a hero to
those in this country you disdain

1214
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:21,045
and a criminal to those you have sought

1215
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:24,282
all your life to assist,
the young and the poor,

1216
01:06:24,315 --> 01:06:26,551
who are the ones who will
have to fight this war.

1217
01:06:26,584 --> 01:06:28,853
This... this is not
the last inning

1218
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:31,356
in the struggle against Communism.

1219
01:06:31,389 --> 01:06:33,624
We must pick those spots

1220
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:35,560
where the stakes are highest for us

1221
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:37,495
and where we hold the cards that'll give us

1222
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,130
the greatest opportunity to prevail.

1223
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:43,501
Ho Chi Minh told
the French... he said,

1224
01:06:43,534 --> 01:06:45,870
"You will kill ten of my men,"

1225
01:06:45,903 --> 01:06:48,739
and I will kill only one of yours,

1226
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:51,809
"but in the end,
it is you who will tire."

1227
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:52,843
And they did.

1228
01:06:52,877 --> 01:06:54,912
And 11 years ago, at Dien Bien Phu,

1229
01:06:54,945 --> 01:06:56,947
they just couldn't do it anymore.

1230
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:59,850
The North Vietnamese lost 500,000

1231
01:06:59,884 --> 01:07:02,620
in their war against the
French, and they did not tire,

1232
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:04,289
and they will not tire now.

1233
01:07:04,322 --> 01:07:08,225
Not after you commit 100,000,
not after you commit 500,000.

1234
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:12,330
And if you do not win
decisively after a big buildup,

1235
01:07:12,363 --> 01:07:14,932
it will be a huge catastrophe.

1236
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:18,503
It will destroy the American
people's faith in you

1237
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,671
and the Democratic Party

1238
01:07:20,705 --> 01:07:23,774
and their government for years to come.

1239
01:07:23,808 --> 01:07:26,511
Now, you have always stressed the economic

1240
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:29,280
and social dimensions of world problems.

1241
01:07:29,314 --> 01:07:30,981
And in this you are unrivaled.

1242
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:33,951
You have a unique opportunity here

1243
01:07:33,984 --> 01:07:37,388
to address this problem,
economically and socially.

1244
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:41,459
Not by war, not by killing people,

1245
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:45,229
but by helping them here and there.

1246
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:50,067
This is a year of minimum political
risk for you, Mr. President.

1247
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,604
You were elected by the largest
landslide in our history.

1248
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:58,909
The reactionary elements of this
society will not soon recover.

1249
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:02,880
I foresee little erosion
of your prestige and power

1250
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:07,017
if we cut our losses and get out of Vietnam.

1251
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:10,287
But I foresee nothing but disaster

1252
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:14,258
for you and this country if we don't.

1253
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,762
If we escalate this war,

1254
01:08:17,795 --> 01:08:20,965
I believe it will ruin us.

1255
01:08:20,998 --> 01:08:23,501
And I believe it will ruin you

1256
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:27,372
and all the great good
you have sought to do.

1257
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:38,883
Shit.

1258
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:42,186
It's a hot one already.

1259
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:44,555
You wish you were back
in Texas, Mr. President?

1260
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:49,159
Fellas, right now I'd rather be on the moon.

1261
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,168
Okay, Bob.

1262
01:08:59,804 --> 01:09:01,772
Mr. President,
Clark has suggested

1263
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:03,441
that the stakes aren't there in Vietnam.

1264
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:04,909
This is damn shocking.

1265
01:09:04,942 --> 01:09:07,545
Here are the stakes.

1266
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,714
National security.

1267
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:11,782
If we back down in Vietnam,

1268
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:13,451
it will only be a matter of time

1269
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:15,620
before we have to go in someplace else.

1270
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:18,155
The commitments we've made and
the price of breaking them.

1271
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:21,492
Our prestige before the world.

1272
01:09:21,526 --> 01:09:25,029
Could the stakes be any higher?

1273
01:09:25,062 --> 01:09:27,031
To elaborate on point one,

1274
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:29,166
if we withdraw, Laos, Cambodia,

1275
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,968
Thailand, Burma will fall,

1276
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,337
but the ripple effect will be far greater,

1277
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:38,275
with Communist agitation increasing
in Africa, India, even Japan.

1278
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,711
We will have to give up some bases.

1279
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:44,181
Pakistan will move closer to China.

1280
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:45,550
Point two.

1281
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,486
Our pledge is a pillar
of peace in the world,

1282
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:49,720
and if we break it,

1283
01:09:49,754 --> 01:09:51,656
our allies will lose faith in us.

1284
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:54,859
And three, because we have so persistently

1285
01:09:54,892 --> 01:09:56,694
and publicly committed ourselves

1286
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:59,864
to preventing a Communist
takeover in South Vietnam,

1287
01:09:59,897 --> 01:10:02,399
our failure to see that commitment through

1288
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:06,103
will be profoundly
devastating to our prestige.

1289
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:08,906
This is why I recommend the following...

1290
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:11,408
Put the men in.

1291
01:10:11,442 --> 01:10:13,310
Westmoreland's plan is sound.

1292
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:16,781
Every quantitative measurement
shows we can win.

1293
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:19,717
Call up the reserves
and extend tours of duty.

1294
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,719
Expand the bombing.

1295
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:25,089
In the north, remove restrictions
on bridge and rail lines,

1296
01:10:25,122 --> 01:10:26,557
mine the harbors.

1297
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:30,394
Expand Rolling Thunder from
2,500 to 4,000 sorties a month.

1298
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:32,597
In the south, tactical air strikes

1299
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:37,267
must be supplemented by increased
B-52 bombing of VC base areas.

1300
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,435
Now, to elaborate...

1301
01:10:45,543 --> 01:10:47,745
Clark.

1302
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:49,980
Clark, I think you scored
some terrific points in there.

1303
01:10:50,014 --> 01:10:52,416
I'm so glad you were arguing the other side.

1304
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,418
Bob...

1305
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,431
you believe what you've
said to the president?

1306
01:10:58,455 --> 01:10:59,890
You're certain we can win?

1307
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:02,760
Well, I sure hope there's no mistake

1308
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:04,270
in my confidence on the president's part.

1309
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:06,363
No, that's not what I'm asking.

1310
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:09,500
Clark, I've seen the charts,
I've run the numbers.

1311
01:11:09,534 --> 01:11:11,268
Everything else is...

1312
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,338
soft, speculation.

1313
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,041
I had dinner with President Kennedy

1314
01:11:17,074 --> 01:11:19,710
just after the Missile Crisis.

1315
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:22,479
And he told me that
if it had not been for you,

1316
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:25,282
keeping your head, facing down the chiefs,

1317
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,317
thinking clearly,

1318
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:29,854
we might not be alive today.

1319
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:32,189
Now, there were no charts and numbers then,

1320
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:34,058
just judgment.

1321
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:37,528
You're telling me that it is your judgment

1322
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:40,831
that this is the best course
of action for this country,

1323
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,700
for this president?

1324
01:11:44,702 --> 01:11:48,005
I can only give my best advice.

1325
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,340
That's what I did for Jack Kennedy.

1326
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:52,543
It's what I'm doing now.

1327
01:11:54,078 --> 01:11:55,646
I'll see you at dinner, Clark.

1328
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:15,365
You want to stop somewhere
and talk about it?

1329
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,101
I'm all talked out, honey.

1330
01:12:17,134 --> 01:12:18,803
I've done nothing but talk.

1331
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:20,705
At some point, the talking's gotta end.

1332
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:23,540
God help us when the talking ends.

1333
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:27,411
Lyndon..

1334
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:37,554
A hundred PhDs among 'em, 10,000 IQ points,

1335
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:39,890
and I can't get an answer I can sit with.

1336
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:41,792
And if it turns bad,

1337
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:43,837
they'll say this wouldn't have
happened under Jack Kennedy!

1338
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:46,563
No, sir!
'Cause he could do no wrong!

1339
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:48,565
He leaves a thousand on the beach in Cuba,

1340
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:50,067
and his numbers go up!

1341
01:13:00,945 --> 01:13:02,880
Lyndon.

1342
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:05,716
Now...

1343
01:13:08,152 --> 01:13:10,755
Lyndon, now, come on, honey.

1344
01:13:17,294 --> 01:13:19,596
What do you think of crashing
through that damn gate

1345
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,466
and driving back to Texas?

1346
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,903
Now you know you'd get no argument from me.

1347
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:28,839
You hate it that much?

1348
01:13:28,873 --> 01:13:32,810
Have you ever considered
the shoes I've had to fill?

1349
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,812
She didn't die with him.

1350
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:36,513
He didn't die.

1351
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,282
He's more alive than ever.

1352
01:13:38,315 --> 01:13:40,751
'Cause his half-size brother
with one and a half his brains

1353
01:13:40,785 --> 01:13:43,353
and a tenth of his scruples
ate his heart out

1354
01:13:43,387 --> 01:13:44,989
and took in his spirit

1355
01:13:45,022 --> 01:13:47,758
as sure as he was out of some Injun story.

1356
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,259
And me?

1357
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:51,061
I'll be President
What's-His-Name

1358
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,297
who came between the two.

1359
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,866
The president who lost America's first war.

1360
01:14:01,205 --> 01:14:03,607
Why must young Americans,

1361
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,811
born into a land exultant with hope

1362
01:14:06,844 --> 01:14:09,613
and with golden promises,

1363
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:13,017
toil and suffer and sometimes die

1364
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:18,355
in such a remote and
distant place as Vietnam?

1365
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:21,792
It is because in the fight for freedom,

1366
01:14:21,826 --> 01:14:24,528
the American people have learned

1367
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:27,297
that retreat does not bring safety

1368
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:31,769
and weakness does not bring peace.

1369
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:35,372
If we are driven from the field in Vietnam,

1370
01:14:35,405 --> 01:14:38,175
then no nation can ever again

1371
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:43,180
have the same confidence
in American promises

1372
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:45,716
or in American protection.

1373
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:50,821
We did not choose to be
the guardians at the gate,

1374
01:14:50,855 --> 01:14:54,458
but there is no one else.

1375
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:58,095
Nor would surrender in Vietnam bring peace,

1376
01:14:58,128 --> 01:15:01,331
because we learned from Hitler at Munich

1377
01:15:01,365 --> 01:15:05,770
that success only feeds
the appetite of aggression.

1378
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:09,073
I have asked the commanding general,

1379
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:11,075
General Westmoreland,

1380
01:15:11,108 --> 01:15:14,845
what more he needs to meet
this mounting aggression.

1381
01:15:14,879 --> 01:15:17,281
He has told me,

1382
01:15:17,314 --> 01:15:19,917
and we will meet his needs.

1383
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:23,453
I have today ordered to Vietnam

1384
01:15:23,487 --> 01:15:27,391
the Airmobile Division
and certain other forces

1385
01:15:27,424 --> 01:15:29,293
which will raise our fighting strength

1386
01:15:29,326 --> 01:15:36,100
from 75,000 to 125,000 men
almost immediately.

1387
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:39,336
Additional forces will be needed later,

1388
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,538
and they will be sent as requested.

1389
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,640
Yeah, but how many?

1390
01:15:45,075 --> 01:15:49,046
Now, I do not find it easy

1391
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:52,116
to send the flower of our youth,

1392
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:56,186
our finest young men into battle.

1393
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,956
I think I know how their mothers weep

1394
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:01,258
and their families sorrow.

1395
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:02,927
Mr. Secretary,

1396
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,463
Senator Morse has been calling
Vietnam "McNamara's War."

1397
01:16:06,496 --> 01:16:08,598
What is your reaction?

1398
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:11,601
This is a war of the
United States government.

1399
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,770
I'm following the president's policy

1400
01:16:13,804 --> 01:16:16,406
and working in close cooperation
with the secretary of state.

1401
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,144
Now, I must say I don't object to
it being called McNamara's War.

1402
01:16:20,177 --> 01:16:22,012
I think it's a very important war,

1403
01:16:22,046 --> 01:16:25,315
one that I'm pleased to be identified
with and to do what I can to win it.

1404
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:27,551
Appearing on "Meet the Press" yesterday,

1405
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:30,154
McNamara was asked to comment
on Hanoi's claim

1406
01:16:30,187 --> 01:16:32,957
that some 10,000 civilians have
been killed in the bombing,

1407
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,392
including thousands of women and children.

1408
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:37,027
Some loss of innocent life

1409
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:39,830
is unavoidable in an operation such as this.

1410
01:16:39,864 --> 01:16:41,465
I can tell you that we are taking

1411
01:16:41,498 --> 01:16:44,201
every possible precaution
in choosing targets.

1412
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:47,204
The risk of civilian
casualties is most assuredly

1413
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:50,007
one of several factors considered.

1414
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,520
So what target are you recommending?

1415
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:07,791
It's a cement factory
along a major rail line.

1416
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:11,095
General Wheeler feels
military value is marginal.

1417
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:14,831
But the monsoon has socked in
more valuable targets.

1418
01:17:14,865 --> 01:17:17,367
What's the output of the facility?

1419
01:17:17,401 --> 01:17:19,870
It appears to be small, sir,
even by their standards.

1420
01:17:19,904 --> 01:17:22,215
It couldn't produce enough for them
to rely heavily on the output.

1421
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,108
Let's give it a "C" for military value.

1422
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:25,609
What's your risk analysis?

1423
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:28,378
Risk to pilots is close to zero.

1424
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:30,280
There might be some small arms fire,

1425
01:17:30,314 --> 01:17:34,251
but recon shows no
antiaircraft emplacements.

1426
01:17:37,187 --> 01:17:39,556
No MIGs in the area?

1427
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,425
They'll be protecting more valuable targets

1428
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,660
and probably won't risk losing
them defending this one.

1429
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:46,196
Depending on cloud cover, we
may have to come in low enough

1430
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:49,366
to be in range of small arms,
but this is a small risk.

1431
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:51,635
Give it an "A" for risk
to pilots and aircraft.

1432
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,070
What's your flash point analysis?

1433
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,505
The target is more than
20 miles outside Hanoi,

1434
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:58,808
so there's little risk
of provoking China or Russia.

1435
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:01,745
Kosygin or Mao won't be down there

1436
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:04,214
touring the factory that day, will they?

1437
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:08,018
This isn't one of Russia or
China's friendship projects?

1438
01:18:08,052 --> 01:18:10,487
A gift from the motherland?

1439
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,422
Well, if I were Ho Chi Minh,

1440
01:18:12,456 --> 01:18:14,658
I would have returned this gift.

1441
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,460
Of course, catching one of them there

1442
01:18:16,493 --> 01:18:18,395
might have been a nice bonus for us.

1443
01:18:18,428 --> 01:18:20,230
Thanks, but I've already been to the brink

1444
01:18:20,264 --> 01:18:23,700
of nuclear annihilation,
and I'm not eager to go back.

1445
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:27,604
Give it an "A" for flash point risk.

1446
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:29,139
Next.
What about civilians?

1447
01:18:29,173 --> 01:18:30,840
We're clear of residential,

1448
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:33,243
except for one row of hooches
behind the facility.

1449
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:36,413
So what are these, houses
or storage shacks or what?

1450
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,682
Well, we can't be sure...

1451
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,350
Most likely the factory managers

1452
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,052
and their families live there.

1453
01:18:42,086 --> 01:18:45,455
I'm not too familiar with Southeast
Asian home construction, sir.

1454
01:18:48,192 --> 01:18:50,003
We can certainly use
someone who knows something

1455
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:52,429
about Vietnamese culture around here.

1456
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:58,235
So, what's the outside number of civilians?

1457
01:18:58,268 --> 01:19:02,372
Well, four hooches this size,
we use six per, so 24.

1458
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:07,477
- 24 for a target this size?
- That seems high.

1459
01:19:07,511 --> 01:19:09,980
That's how we figure it, sir.

1460
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:12,016
I mean, that seems a high number to lose

1461
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:13,583
for a target like this.

1462
01:19:13,617 --> 01:19:15,852
Give it a "D" for civilian casualties.

1463
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:19,456
Let's see what we've got.
C, A, A, D...

1464
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:22,692
Let's give it a solid C-plus and
put it before the president.

1465
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:24,328
- All right, what's the...
- Jesus!

1466
01:19:24,361 --> 01:19:26,930
There's a guy on the wall
at the river entrance!

1467
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:36,506
- My God.
- Hey, wait a minute! Stop!

1468
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:40,977
Don't! Don't!

1469
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:48,452
- Hey, get down from there!
- Get off!

1470
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:51,488
Please, please, the baby!
Stop! Stop!

1471
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:54,824
God! Please!

1472
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,427
Yes, Mr. President.

1473
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,396
You wanted to see me?

1474
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:35,265
- Yes, sir.
- You can come down now.

1475
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:42,332
Yes, Dick?

1476
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:46,670
Mr. President, as, Bill Moyers told you,

1477
01:21:46,703 --> 01:21:48,172
I've been offered a fellowship

1478
01:21:48,205 --> 01:21:50,474
at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.

1479
01:21:50,507 --> 01:21:53,243
Well, good for you.
That ain't easy to get.

1480
01:21:53,277 --> 01:21:55,745
No. No, I'm very fortunate.

1481
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:57,581
Well, don't wait too long to turn them down

1482
01:21:57,614 --> 01:21:59,983
so they can call the next guy on the list.

1483
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:04,454
Mr. President,
I have already accepted.

1484
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:07,424
No problem. You didn't know
you weren't free to go.

1485
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:09,826
Call 'em up. Put me on if
they give you any trouble.

1486
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:11,595
What do you mean, I'm not free to go?

1487
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:13,797
I mean you can't go.

1488
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,699
I can't get along without you.

1489
01:22:15,732 --> 01:22:17,467
That makes you a pretty big fella.

1490
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:19,869
How big a fella are you gonna
be with some fellowship?

1491
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:23,006
Well, you got along
without me before I came.

1492
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,345
You want more money?

1493
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:29,713
I got plenty of money.

1494
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:32,516
I'll arrange a payment
from the Johnson Foundation.

1495
01:22:32,549 --> 01:22:34,851
Money isn't the issue,
Mr. President.

1496
01:22:34,884 --> 01:22:36,520
This is something that I want to do.

1497
01:22:36,553 --> 01:22:38,322
Well, it ain't gonna be.

1498
01:22:38,355 --> 01:22:40,424
So make your call.

1499
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:49,266
Mr. President, I...

1500
01:22:49,299 --> 01:22:51,368
I'm very sorry.

1501
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:57,173
Now, Dick, you either stay here with me,

1502
01:22:57,207 --> 01:22:58,808
or you go over to the Pentagon

1503
01:22:58,842 --> 01:23:01,278
and get yourself a pair
of shiny, black boots.

1504
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,680
There's a statute.
I asked McNamara.

1505
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:06,450
Says we can draft specialists
vital to the national interest,

1506
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:08,885
and that's what I'll do.

1507
01:23:08,918 --> 01:23:11,120
If you won't serve here,

1508
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:13,223
you know where I can send you.

1509
01:23:13,257 --> 01:23:14,458
Will you make me a general?

1510
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:16,260
You won't want to be a general.

1511
01:23:16,293 --> 01:23:17,903
You'll want to be a private,
Marine infantry.

1512
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:19,629
That's where the action is.

1513
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:21,698
I know you like to be around the action.

1514
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:24,401
That's why you stayed here so long.

1515
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:28,037
Now, you listen to me, Dick.

1516
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:32,342
You go ahead and take your fellowship.

1517
01:23:33,877 --> 01:23:36,580
But your hands are all over this.

1518
01:23:36,613 --> 01:23:38,982
You and Moyers and Bundy and everybody else

1519
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:41,385
talking about jumping ship!

1520
01:23:41,418 --> 01:23:43,853
But most of all, you!

1521
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:46,823
You put your name
all over the Great Society,

1522
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:49,326
but you put the tune
to those words of war, too.

1523
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,395
And hiding out on some college campus

1524
01:23:51,428 --> 01:23:54,898
or anything else you ever do
is never gonna change that!

1525
01:23:54,931 --> 01:23:56,766
Dismissed!

1526
01:24:08,945 --> 01:24:11,180
An entire generation of North Vietnamese

1527
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:14,284
have been born and lived and died

1528
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:16,353
in the pursuit of one thing:

1529
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:20,056
A united Vietnam under Communist rule.

1530
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:21,691
The North Vietnamese

1531
01:24:21,725 --> 01:24:24,694
have never known anything but war.

1532
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:27,030
At CIA, we've just completed a study

1533
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,933
of their staggering recuperative abilities.

1534
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:32,068
Bridges.

1535
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:35,138
This one was knocked out in a morning raid.

1536
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:37,607
Two hours later, some bamboo planks

1537
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:39,509
across a bunch of wooden canal boats,

1538
01:24:39,543 --> 01:24:41,044
and there's foot traffic again.

1539
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:45,615
By 3:00 p.m.,
it's a pontoon bridge,

1540
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:48,718
strong enough for a fully loaded truck.

1541
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:51,321
A bomb knocks out a rail line,

1542
01:24:51,355 --> 01:24:53,957
they call up the bicycle brigades.

1543
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:55,859
500 men and women,

1544
01:24:55,892 --> 01:24:58,662
some as old as 70 or 75,

1545
01:24:58,695 --> 01:25:00,997
put the cargo on their bikes.

1546
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:04,901
Each one balances up to a
600-pound load across the frame,

1547
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,670
they wheel it across
a jerry-rigged bridge

1548
01:25:06,703 --> 01:25:09,506
to another train
waiting to move it on south.

1549
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:14,177
Filling a bomb crater to make
a road passable again.

1550
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,945
That's as routine to a school kid there

1551
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:18,815
as getting a malt
down at the corner shop here.

1552
01:25:18,848 --> 01:25:21,117
It's a first date.

1553
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:24,087
They have a brand of cigarettes, Mr.
President,

1554
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,222
called Dien Bien Phu.

1555
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:29,225
That's their Yorktown, their Waterloo,

1556
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:32,496
where they defeated the French in '54.

1557
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:34,364
Reminders of war

1558
01:25:34,398 --> 01:25:37,000
are in the most casual moments
of daily life.

1559
01:25:37,033 --> 01:25:39,769
In a smoke,
Mr. President.

1560
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:41,638
Their heroes,

1561
01:25:41,671 --> 01:25:44,307
the kid who was put to death
for trying to assassinate.

1562
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,343
Secretary McNamara last year in Saigon.

1563
01:25:47,377 --> 01:25:49,746
There's a song about him.

1564
01:25:49,779 --> 01:25:51,314
It's a top ten hit.

1565
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:54,551
And Norman Morrison.

1566
01:25:54,584 --> 01:25:56,185
Norman Morrison was the Quaker

1567
01:25:56,219 --> 01:25:58,422
who burned himself to death

1568
01:25:58,455 --> 01:26:01,458
in front of the Pentagon last month.

1569
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:04,694
A great hero.

1570
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:07,531
Hanoi just issued a postage stamp.

1571
01:26:07,564 --> 01:26:10,667
Thank you, John.
Thank you, Scott.

1572
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,803
A great hero.

1573
01:26:13,837 --> 01:26:16,506
He almost took his one-year-old
daughter with him.

1574
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,642
A baby!

1575
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:21,445
It's a miracle she was unharmed.

1576
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:24,514
The man was disturbed.

1577
01:26:24,548 --> 01:26:27,484
Three young children are fatherless.

1578
01:26:31,955 --> 01:26:33,490
Hero.

1579
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:38,628
So...

1580
01:26:38,662 --> 01:26:39,896
what do we do?

1581
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,699
Mr. President,

1582
01:26:42,732 --> 01:26:44,701
the most strategic targets in North Vietnam

1583
01:26:44,734 --> 01:26:48,605
remain intact because Hanoi and Haiphong

1584
01:26:48,638 --> 01:26:50,339
continue to be off-limits.

1585
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:53,710
We're not hitting their oil
supply, major power plants,

1586
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:55,244
rail links to China.

1587
01:26:55,278 --> 01:26:57,447
We're not mining the ports,
hitting the dikes...

1588
01:26:57,481 --> 01:27:00,450
CIA says hitting the dikes would
flood the whole damn country!

1589
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:02,719
Kill the rice crop!
Starve 'em to death!

1590
01:27:02,752 --> 01:27:03,720
Isn't that right?

1591
01:27:03,753 --> 01:27:05,522
Yes, sir.

1592
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:08,157
And I have one more problem
for your big computer.

1593
01:27:08,191 --> 01:27:11,260
Ask how long it'll take
500,000 angry Americans

1594
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:13,296
to climb that White House wall

1595
01:27:13,329 --> 01:27:14,798
and lynch their president

1596
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:16,071
if he does something like that!

1597
01:27:16,099 --> 01:27:19,435
This is why the chiefs and I
have been urging for months

1598
01:27:19,469 --> 01:27:21,437
that we take the next logical step

1599
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:23,272
and destroy their oil reserves.

1600
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:25,217
Nothing stopped 'em yet.
Why should that stop 'em?

1601
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,511
That oil goes in trucks,
Mr. President,

1602
01:27:27,544 --> 01:27:30,013
trucks that carry troops
and guns and bullets

1603
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:31,981
across the border to kill our men.

1604
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:34,350
They don't need damn trucks!

1605
01:27:34,383 --> 01:27:35,519
Weren't you watching?

1606
01:27:35,552 --> 01:27:39,388
They got hundred-year-old women
hauling crap!

1607
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:42,826
What do you want me to do, kill
everybody's grandmother in that place?

1608
01:27:44,494 --> 01:27:47,330
Mr. President,
Ambassador Dobrynin says

1609
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:50,333
that Moscow would try
to bring Hanoi to the table

1610
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:52,235
if we stop the bombing
for three or four weeks.

1611
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:55,338
This would be a grave mistake, Mr.
President.

1612
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:57,641
They'll send down everything they can.

1613
01:27:57,674 --> 01:28:00,009
Westy's against it, Admiral Sharp.

1614
01:28:00,043 --> 01:28:03,046
Bob, I know, opposes it
and every one of the chiefs.

1615
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:05,014
Look...

1616
01:28:05,048 --> 01:28:07,316
the North Vietnamese have
nine regiments down there.

1617
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,285
We thought they had three.

1618
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:12,822
VC has more than doubled
theirs from five to 12,

1619
01:28:12,856 --> 01:28:15,091
which is twice our buildup.

1620
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:19,596
And I just feel that we need to do something

1621
01:28:19,629 --> 01:28:22,599
before we send another
200,000 men over there.

1622
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:26,435
Yes, Bob. We can try bombing
them where it hurts.

1623
01:28:26,469 --> 01:28:29,573
The enemy lost over a thousand

1624
01:28:29,606 --> 01:28:31,240
in recent fighting, didn't they?

1625
01:28:31,274 --> 01:28:33,442
They lost 1,200 in the la Drang Valley,

1626
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:35,612
and we lost 300.

1627
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:36,789
But it's clear that they're willing

1628
01:28:36,813 --> 01:28:38,281
to take those kinds of casualties,

1629
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:40,349
which is something that
we were not counting on.

1630
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:41,685
Some were not counting on.

1631
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:44,453
Bob,

1632
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,489
are you now saying

1633
01:28:46,522 --> 01:28:49,092
that no matter what we do militarily,

1634
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,260
there's no sure victory?

1635
01:28:51,294 --> 01:28:53,096
I believe we may have been

1636
01:28:53,129 --> 01:28:55,231
overly optimistic about an early end.

1637
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:57,867
China, Russia, although they
do not want a general war,

1638
01:28:57,901 --> 01:28:59,836
have stepped up their aid.

1639
01:28:59,869 --> 01:29:01,537
Just a moment, gentlemen.

1640
01:29:01,571 --> 01:29:04,641
The president undertook this program

1641
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:08,144
because General Westmoreland
was confident we could win.

1642
01:29:08,177 --> 01:29:11,347
Why are we considering another 200,000

1643
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,683
if you now believe victory to be unlikely?

1644
01:29:13,717 --> 01:29:15,384
That's my question.

1645
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:19,589
I still believe we can win.

1646
01:29:19,623 --> 01:29:23,126
But if there is the slightest
chance of obtaining a settlement

1647
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:26,362
without sending over
hundreds of thousands more men

1648
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:28,998
and hitting their cities,

1649
01:29:29,032 --> 01:29:31,167
I think we should do it.

1650
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,070
Right now we are incurring
significant casualties.

1651
01:29:34,103 --> 01:29:35,138
If the buildup continues,

1652
01:29:35,171 --> 01:29:39,776
we may be facing a thousand per month.

1653
01:29:39,809 --> 01:29:42,211
And if Hanoi won't talk,

1654
01:29:42,245 --> 01:29:44,113
it will only make our position

1655
01:29:44,147 --> 01:29:46,115
with the American people stronger,

1656
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:49,085
and they will be more likely
to accept these kinds of losses.

1657
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:51,220
We could have a thousand casualties a month

1658
01:29:51,254 --> 01:29:52,889
if we do this,
Mr. President!

1659
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:55,825
It's my job to protect our troops.

1660
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:58,728
Every truck, every sampan that gets through

1661
01:29:58,762 --> 01:30:00,596
means more dead Americans.

1662
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:03,700
They'll send down missiles,
antiaircraft guns.

1663
01:30:03,733 --> 01:30:06,302
- It'll set us back a year!
- Wait a minute now.

1664
01:30:06,335 --> 01:30:08,204
Seems to me that if we're this pessimistic,

1665
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,815
winning battles yet predicting stalemates

1666
01:30:09,839 --> 01:30:11,574
just five months after going in,

1667
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:13,352
we should pause the bombing
and see what results.

1668
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,379
I'm sorry, George, but I must disagree.

1669
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:19,649
If we pause the bombing and it fails,

1670
01:30:19,683 --> 01:30:22,318
the president will be
under irresistible pressure

1671
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:26,690
from the right-wing hawks in Congress to
bomb Hanoi, to bomb the Red River dikes.

1672
01:30:26,723 --> 01:30:31,661
That'll flood the country and create a
civilian disaster of such magnitude.

1673
01:30:31,695 --> 01:30:34,731
I do not believe that
North Vietnam will talk

1674
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:36,499
until they come to the realization

1675
01:30:36,532 --> 01:30:38,902
that this will be a stalemate,
that they cannot win.

1676
01:30:38,935 --> 01:30:40,203
And they're not there.

1677
01:30:40,236 --> 01:30:41,871
Their unrelenting buildup in the south

1678
01:30:41,905 --> 01:30:44,407
clearly indicates
that they believe they can win.

1679
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:48,044
Are you now saying that we have no choice

1680
01:30:48,077 --> 01:30:50,613
but to continue to match 'em man for man?

1681
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:54,183
Well, you made that decision,
Mr. President.

1682
01:30:54,217 --> 01:30:56,485
We are there.

1683
01:30:56,519 --> 01:31:00,356
You have convinced the American
people that we should be there.

1684
01:31:00,389 --> 01:31:02,391
But I see no alternative

1685
01:31:02,425 --> 01:31:05,795
but for you to make your best effort to win.

1686
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:07,797
I couldn't believe my ears!

1687
01:31:07,831 --> 01:31:10,566
Clifford about-facing,
McNamara going soft!

1688
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:12,869
They're all changing their tune now.

1689
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:15,571
And old George McBundy
got with the Soviet ambassador,

1690
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,173
got a little vodka in him!

1691
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:20,609
And those Harvard types will believe
anything out of a diplomat!

1692
01:31:20,643 --> 01:31:23,279
I don't believe for a minute
that Moscow wants peace.

1693
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:26,315
You don't have to take his advice
if you believe it will fail.

1694
01:31:26,349 --> 01:31:27,917
Don't you know anything?

1695
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:29,294
Don't you know if I don't
call off the bombing,

1696
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:31,955
the Kennedys will shout
from the mountaintops

1697
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:34,423
that the Russians offered
a big, fat olive branch

1698
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:36,392
and I snapped it in two?

1699
01:31:36,425 --> 01:31:40,229
And now I've missed my chance for peace!

1700
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:50,173
So how's academic life?

1701
01:31:50,206 --> 01:31:52,108
Not nearly as challenging.

1702
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:55,979
But I can say I've been
getting a lot more sleep.

1703
01:31:56,012 --> 01:32:00,216
Well, someone has to deal with these things.

1704
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:03,219
You certainly have the floor space.

1705
01:32:03,252 --> 01:32:06,289
That I do.
That I do.

1706
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:12,561
You know the guy in that portrait?

1707
01:32:12,595 --> 01:32:14,063
James Forrestal.

1708
01:32:14,097 --> 01:32:15,598
That's right.

1709
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:18,534
Truman's secretary of defense.

1710
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:20,736
Guy went absolutely nuts.

1711
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,739
When Truman finally got rid of him,

1712
01:32:23,773 --> 01:32:26,109
he pinned him with a service medal.

1713
01:32:26,142 --> 01:32:30,046
He just stood there mute,
his throat clamped.

1714
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:33,682
God knows what demons
going through his mind.

1715
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:35,651
A couple days later,

1716
01:32:35,684 --> 01:32:38,454
he jumped out of the 16th
floor of Bethesda Naval.

1717
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:48,564
Sometimes you can wrestle too much.

1718
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:51,634
Bob,

1719
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:53,269
we both came in with Jack Kennedy.

1720
01:32:53,302 --> 01:32:54,703
We were around when this started.

1721
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:56,139
Vietnam started with Eisenhower,

1722
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:57,640
and neither of us were here.

1723
01:32:57,673 --> 01:33:00,877
I know, and it was Kennedy who put
in all those so-called advisors,

1724
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,445
but I can't believe that had he lived,

1725
01:33:02,478 --> 01:33:03,880
we'd be in this ditch.

1726
01:33:03,913 --> 01:33:05,390
You sound like you've been talking to Bobby.

1727
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:08,084
He's your friend.
What's he been telling you?

1728
01:33:08,117 --> 01:33:12,856
If you told the president
to stop the bombing,

1729
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:14,057
he'd stop it.

1730
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,993
We have stopped the bombing,
under my recommendation.

1731
01:33:17,026 --> 01:33:18,962
You've paused it.

1732
01:33:18,995 --> 01:33:22,398
Hanoi knows that you're gonna start
up again if they don't agree to talk.

1733
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:24,133
And they have said a hundred times

1734
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:25,568
they won't knuckle under to that.

1735
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,536
Now, if you told the president

1736
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:29,148
that you no longer believe
the bombing can work...

1737
01:33:29,172 --> 01:33:31,007
I never said I believed that.

1738
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,576
Bobby says you told him
it's not worth a damn.

1739
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,711
Well, that's between Bobby and me.

1740
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:38,081
And as far as my influence with
the president is concerned,

1741
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:39,648
I think you overestimate my pull.

1742
01:33:39,682 --> 01:33:42,852
I don't see how that's possible.

1743
01:33:42,886 --> 01:33:46,089
Peace talks.

1744
01:33:46,122 --> 01:33:48,624
That's the only way out of this thing now.

1745
01:33:53,596 --> 01:33:57,566
You stop the bombing for 30 days.

1746
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,203
The brass is ready to hang me.

1747
01:34:00,236 --> 01:34:04,207
God, I sure hope Hanoi wants
to take the bait because...

1748
01:34:08,577 --> 01:34:11,447
I just don't think we're going
to be able to beat these people.

1749
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,186
So are you going public with your views?

1750
01:34:25,461 --> 01:34:26,963
I'm thinking about it.

1751
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:33,402
Well, you are free to
do that now, aren't you?

1752
01:34:44,914 --> 01:34:46,315
Is that where it happened?

1753
01:34:46,349 --> 01:34:49,185
Yep.

1754
01:34:51,087 --> 01:34:52,688
Incredible.

1755
01:34:55,558 --> 01:34:58,861
Absolutely incredible.

1756
01:34:58,894 --> 01:35:00,930
For 20 days now,

1757
01:35:00,964 --> 01:35:03,166
we and our South Vietnamese allies

1758
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:06,835
have dropped no bombs on North Vietnam.

1759
01:35:06,869 --> 01:35:11,740
We seek neither territory nor bases,

1760
01:35:11,774 --> 01:35:16,845
economic domination or
military alliance in Vietnam.

1761
01:35:16,879 --> 01:35:20,016
We fight for the principle of
self-determination,

1762
01:35:20,049 --> 01:35:21,850
for the people of South Vietnam

1763
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:25,788
to be able to choose their own course,

1764
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:30,326
choose it in free elections
without violence,

1765
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:34,730
without terror and without fear.

1766
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:44,407
We have said all this,

1767
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,710
and we have asked and hoped,

1768
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:51,447
and we have waited for a response.

1769
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,582
None has come.

1770
01:35:53,616 --> 01:35:58,387
I believe that we can continue
the Great Society

1771
01:35:58,421 --> 01:36:00,990
while we fight in Vietnam.

1772
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:04,460
Yet there are those who cry out,

1773
01:36:04,493 --> 01:36:06,729
"We must sacrifice."

1774
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:09,332
Well, let us rather ask them,

1775
01:36:09,365 --> 01:36:11,400
"Who will they sacrifice?"

1776
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:14,770
Are they gonna sacrifice the children

1777
01:36:14,803 --> 01:36:16,705
who seek their learning

1778
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:19,842
or the sick who need medical care

1779
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:22,511
or the families that dwell in squalor

1780
01:36:22,545 --> 01:36:26,182
now brightened by the hope of home?

1781
01:36:26,215 --> 01:36:30,586
Will they sacrifice opportunity
for the distressed,

1782
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:35,758
the beauty of our land and the
hope of our poor?

1783
01:36:48,037 --> 01:36:51,207
"Vietnam has been fighting for its
independence for 4,000 years.

1784
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,376
"We have defeated the Mongols three times,

1785
01:36:53,409 --> 01:36:56,512
"and despite all of his bluster
and all his bombs,

1786
01:36:56,545 --> 01:37:00,983
Emperor Johnson is not nearly
as terrifying as Genghis Khan."

1787
01:37:03,086 --> 01:37:06,155
Ho Chi Minh's statement over
Hanoi radio this morning.

1788
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,597
37 days.

1789
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:17,566
37 days now.

1790
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,735
Not one bomb has fallen.

1791
01:37:21,104 --> 01:37:23,539
This is our answer.

1792
01:37:23,572 --> 01:37:26,442
This is our answer.

1793
01:37:31,046 --> 01:37:32,748
What now, Bob?

1794
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:41,557
Hanoi and Haiphong harbor.

1795
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:45,194
As you can see, they're in
very concentrated areas.

1796
01:37:45,228 --> 01:37:47,029
The tanks and refineries

1797
01:37:47,062 --> 01:37:50,333
are within a short distance
of residential sections.

1798
01:37:50,366 --> 01:37:52,268
What about the Russian oil ships?

1799
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:55,438
They off-load with a
250-foot floating pipeline.

1800
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:58,407
That's why we're targeting
the distribution tanks,

1801
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:00,776
some 1,500 feet from the vessels.

1802
01:38:00,809 --> 01:38:03,112
But still quite close
to the residential areas.

1803
01:38:03,146 --> 01:38:05,013
That's correct.

1804
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:06,758
And I understand that they purposely situate

1805
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:09,051
strategic targets close to neighborhoods.

1806
01:38:09,084 --> 01:38:10,953
What about those ships?
Can they shoot back?

1807
01:38:10,986 --> 01:38:14,022
No, sir.
They're unarmed.

1808
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:17,025
But the tanks are protected
by surface-to-air missiles.

1809
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:20,028
The Russians sent them down
during the bombing pause.

1810
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:22,030
How many planes will we lose?

1811
01:38:22,064 --> 01:38:24,733
20 to 25.

1812
01:38:24,767 --> 01:38:27,770
- How many casualties?
- 50.

1813
01:38:27,803 --> 01:38:30,306
50 to 300 is my estimate.

1814
01:38:30,339 --> 01:38:31,907
And if the bombs miss,

1815
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,676
it could go as high as 12,000,

1816
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:35,611
with 50% of these civilians

1817
01:38:35,644 --> 01:38:37,646
and 50% of those killed.

1818
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,217
Of course, we don't plan our
strikes to miss our targets.

1819
01:38:44,086 --> 01:38:46,889
But they do miss sometimes.

1820
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,692
And this time you could hit a Russian ship.

1821
01:38:49,725 --> 01:38:52,961
And the bomber pilot, it'll be a
kid from Johnson City, Texas.

1822
01:38:52,995 --> 01:38:55,631
And that'll be the kid that
starts World War III.

1823
01:38:55,664 --> 01:38:58,734
Thank you very much.

1824
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:00,203
All right.

1825
01:39:01,737 --> 01:39:04,773
So what great things will
result from this plan?

1826
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:06,275
With no oil,

1827
01:39:06,309 --> 01:39:08,211
their entire infiltration effort

1828
01:39:08,244 --> 01:39:09,345
will grind to a halt,

1829
01:39:09,378 --> 01:39:11,847
from manufacturing to transportation.

1830
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,717
Their war-making capability
will be destroyed,

1831
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,485
and they will have to negotiate.

1832
01:39:18,754 --> 01:39:19,755
Dean?

1833
01:39:22,858 --> 01:39:26,695
The Chinese and Soviets will step up aid.

1834
01:39:26,729 --> 01:39:30,032
And we could lose the support
of Canada, Japan,

1835
01:39:30,065 --> 01:39:33,269
and the Chinese representation
issue at the UN.

1836
01:39:33,302 --> 01:39:36,839
If a Russian ship is sunk,

1837
01:39:36,872 --> 01:39:39,174
we just don't know.

1838
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:42,945
The Chinese may send in troops.

1839
01:39:42,978 --> 01:39:46,148
But as Bus said, this could end it.

1840
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,550
What if it doesn't?

1841
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:49,218
What if, by God's grace,

1842
01:39:49,252 --> 01:39:51,554
we don't have a million Chinese
and nuclear war?

1843
01:39:51,587 --> 01:39:53,456
They still won't quit?

1844
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:54,866
What will you be asking me to hit next?

1845
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:59,995
Strategic targets closer to
the center of Hanoi.

1846
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:01,564
The Paul Doumer Bridge.

1847
01:40:01,597 --> 01:40:04,800
Four major rail lines cross it.

1848
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,035
The power plant, industry,

1849
01:40:07,069 --> 01:40:10,539
all within five miles of downtown.

1850
01:40:13,676 --> 01:40:15,210
Bob,

1851
01:40:15,244 --> 01:40:17,012
are you for this?

1852
01:40:19,582 --> 01:40:21,183
It might work.

1853
01:40:21,216 --> 01:40:23,051
So you're for it.

1854
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:25,588
- Mr. President.
- Walt?

1855
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:28,491
Since taking over for Mac Bundy,

1856
01:40:28,524 --> 01:40:30,926
I've had a chance to
evaluate our bombing policy,

1857
01:40:30,959 --> 01:40:32,828
and, well, I believe that

1858
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,063
our continued delay in attacking Hanoi

1859
01:40:35,097 --> 01:40:38,066
is causing Russia and China
to underestimate our resolve

1860
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,937
and that that may actually
encourage World War III.

1861
01:40:44,973 --> 01:40:47,910
Clark?

1862
01:40:47,943 --> 01:40:51,514
As always, I support any measure

1863
01:40:51,547 --> 01:40:53,549
that has a chance of ending this.

1864
01:40:56,619 --> 01:40:59,388
Anyone else?

1865
01:40:59,422 --> 01:41:02,257
George? Nothing to add?

1866
01:41:05,528 --> 01:41:07,530
This will not affect
North Vietnamese manpower,

1867
01:41:07,563 --> 01:41:08,931
which has proved to be limitless.

1868
01:41:08,964 --> 01:41:12,568
It will be hard for the Russians
and the Chinese to take.

1869
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:14,036
I'm concerned, as always,

1870
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:15,614
about the escalating level of violence,

1871
01:41:15,638 --> 01:41:19,608
but maybe this will finally
satisfy the hawks in Congress.

1872
01:41:19,642 --> 01:41:21,410
If we have to do it, let's do it now.

1873
01:41:21,444 --> 01:41:22,911
You know, George,

1874
01:41:22,945 --> 01:41:26,281
you remind me of a country schoolteacher.

1875
01:41:26,315 --> 01:41:28,584
Asked if he believes the world
is flat or round,

1876
01:41:28,617 --> 01:41:32,287
he says, "I can teach it
either way."

1877
01:41:32,321 --> 01:41:34,457
Hmph.

1878
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,491
Hmph.

1879
01:41:38,627 --> 01:41:40,162
How soon do we go?

1880
01:41:47,436 --> 01:41:48,904
It's the same as mine, you know.

1881
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:52,074
I'd just as soon forget about those 13 days.

1882
01:41:52,107 --> 01:41:54,109
He had them made at Tiffany's, didn't he?

1883
01:41:54,142 --> 01:41:55,778
He gave one to Jackie, too.

1884
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:57,689
She joked it's the only thing
he ever gave her from there

1885
01:41:57,713 --> 01:42:00,148
that wasn't ordered straight
out of their catalog.

1886
01:42:02,317 --> 01:42:03,552
A trying time.

1887
01:42:03,586 --> 01:42:04,696
You speak as if it's in the past.

1888
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,254
What?

1889
01:42:06,288 --> 01:42:09,858
The trying time.

1890
01:42:12,928 --> 01:42:14,296
Thank you.

1891
01:42:23,105 --> 01:42:25,974
Dick. Clark.

1892
01:42:26,008 --> 01:42:28,076
Johnson wasn't much of a poker player,

1893
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:31,213
but he loved the political conversation.

1894
01:42:31,246 --> 01:42:32,815
Can a whiskey convert a man, Clark?

1895
01:42:37,252 --> 01:42:38,787
Look at 'em.

1896
01:42:38,821 --> 01:42:41,289
You know what they remind me of?

1897
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,058
A flock of buzzards sitting on a fence

1898
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:45,260
discussing the price of carrion.

1899
01:42:45,293 --> 01:42:47,563
Buzzards.
George.

1900
01:42:47,596 --> 01:42:50,065
You could have had Bundy's job.
What was it, Clark?

1901
01:42:50,098 --> 01:42:51,376
You haven't socked away enough dough yet?

1902
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,569
That's unbecoming of you, George.

1903
01:42:53,602 --> 01:42:55,203
The basement office? What?

1904
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:57,139
You know I'd lose my freedom

1905
01:42:57,172 --> 01:42:59,107
to advise him on his presidency

1906
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:01,544
if I took a cabinet post.

1907
01:43:01,577 --> 01:43:04,513
George, the president
wants to get out of Vietnam

1908
01:43:04,547 --> 01:43:07,082
just as much as you do, in principle.

1909
01:43:07,115 --> 01:43:08,350
Principle?

1910
01:43:08,383 --> 01:43:09,985
There's a word that's been tossed about

1911
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:11,920
more than a dollar whore in a port of call.

1912
01:43:11,954 --> 01:43:13,456
How's this for principle:

1913
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:16,492
"150 more killed last week.
What a waste."

1914
01:43:16,525 --> 01:43:17,760
You know who said that?

1915
01:43:17,793 --> 01:43:19,194
No.

1916
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:20,896
McNamara. To me.

1917
01:43:20,929 --> 01:43:22,965
For all the principle around here,

1918
01:43:22,998 --> 01:43:25,601
we're in one hell of a mess,
don't you think?

1919
01:43:27,135 --> 01:43:28,971
Look at him.

1920
01:43:29,004 --> 01:43:32,107
His wife's got an ulcer,
his kid's got an ulcer.

1921
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:37,279
Everybody's got Bob McNamara's
ulcer but Bob McNamara.

1922
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:40,816
Sometimes I think it's all just a
goddamn academic exercise to him.

1923
01:43:40,849 --> 01:43:42,284
George,

1924
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:45,187
you mustn't give up on this, George.

1925
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,856
Christ, Clark!

1926
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,424
Marny.

1927
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:51,460
George.

1928
01:43:51,494 --> 01:43:53,529
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
Clifford. How are you?

1929
01:43:53,562 --> 01:43:54,563
We're fine, dear.

1930
01:43:54,597 --> 01:43:55,940
I'd like you to meet Charles Robb.

1931
01:43:55,964 --> 01:43:57,199
Clark Clifford.

1932
01:43:57,232 --> 01:43:59,334
Anyone who still thinks we
ought to be in Vietnam

1933
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,945
should take a detour from work and drive by

1934
01:44:00,969 --> 01:44:03,038
Arlington Cemetery every day for a week.

1935
01:44:03,071 --> 01:44:04,372
I don't think I'd trust anyone

1936
01:44:04,406 --> 01:44:06,542
in a policy-making position
to do that.

1937
01:44:06,575 --> 01:44:08,376
To do what, Bob?

1938
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:10,112
To face the consequences of his counsel?

1939
01:44:10,145 --> 01:44:12,915
Who needed a reminder
of what war was all about?

1940
01:44:12,948 --> 01:44:14,182
A reminder of what?

1941
01:44:14,216 --> 01:44:16,652
Our jobs in World War II, in the rear?

1942
01:44:16,685 --> 01:44:18,754
I pushed paper just like you, Walt.

1943
01:44:18,787 --> 01:44:20,155
We were all too damn smart.

1944
01:44:20,188 --> 01:44:22,501
I must've been sitting on my
brains, then, up in that B-25.

1945
01:44:22,525 --> 01:44:24,627
Two years in prison camps.

1946
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,638
That's right. Nick's the only
one here who saw combat.

1947
01:44:26,662 --> 01:44:28,531
You were probably picking his targets, Walt.

1948
01:44:28,564 --> 01:44:30,966
As I remember, we won that war.

1949
01:44:30,999 --> 01:44:32,477
Yeah, well, you can tell that to the 50,000

1950
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:33,845
dead men, women, and children of Dresden.

1951
01:44:33,869 --> 01:44:36,171
- Dresden...
- Is anyone ready for dinner?

1952
01:44:36,204 --> 01:44:38,774
Dresden was bombed for the rail lines.

1953
01:44:38,807 --> 01:44:41,476
Dresden was bombed to terrorize
the hell out of those people,

1954
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,212
which is precisely what our
B-52s are doing in Vietnam.

1955
01:44:44,246 --> 01:44:46,381
And if this keeps up, in another year,

1956
01:44:46,414 --> 01:44:48,259
we'll have dropped more there
than on all of Europe.

1957
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:49,251
Isn't that right, Bob?

1958
01:44:49,284 --> 01:44:51,353
Let's go inside, darling.

1959
01:44:51,386 --> 01:44:54,089
Isn't that what you told me
the other day? In private?

1960
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:56,058
Among some other things?

1961
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:58,561
Such as the fact that we've
destroyed so much of that country,

1962
01:44:58,594 --> 01:45:02,030
they can't even grow enough rice to feed
themselves, the rice bowl of the world.

1963
01:45:02,064 --> 01:45:04,332
- George.
- We've created so many refugees

1964
01:45:04,366 --> 01:45:05,577
that if we had the same proportion

1965
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:06,845
out of their homes in this country,

1966
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:08,937
there'd be 30 million people on the streets.

1967
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:09,938
Isn't that right?

1968
01:45:09,972 --> 01:45:12,908
Bob? Isn't that
what you said?

1969
01:45:14,276 --> 01:45:16,612
What was it Tacitus said about
the Romans at Carthage?

1970
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:23,986
You have made a desert and call it peace.

1971
01:45:29,324 --> 01:45:32,127
If you still can't reach him,
then get whosever on call.

1972
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,862
We need a doctor here.

1973
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:36,298
Christ, Marny.

1974
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:38,634
I'll be all right.
It was the liquor.

1975
01:45:42,204 --> 01:45:43,806
Hello.

1976
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:46,017
Mr. Secretary, it's Major
Wolfson of the Command Center.

1977
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:47,375
We just got a call from CINCPAC

1978
01:45:47,409 --> 01:45:49,177
saying the weather around Hanoi has cleared

1979
01:45:49,211 --> 01:45:51,479
and the fighter-bombers
are on their way.

1980
01:45:57,653 --> 01:45:59,121
Bob, it's me.

1981
01:45:59,154 --> 01:46:01,456
Mr. President,
the operations we discussed

1982
01:46:01,489 --> 01:46:03,225
will be going tonight.

1983
01:46:03,258 --> 01:46:05,728
They have perfect conditions.

1984
01:46:05,761 --> 01:46:07,362
Now-now, Bob,

1985
01:46:07,395 --> 01:46:09,965
these-these-these pilots

1986
01:46:09,998 --> 01:46:11,499
are said to be the cream.

1987
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:14,837
They're the best the Navy and
Air Force have, Mr. President,

1988
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:17,539
and they know you're counting on them.

1989
01:46:17,572 --> 01:46:18,907
All right, Bob.
Thank you.

1990
01:46:18,941 --> 01:46:21,343
I'm going to the Pentagon now.

1991
01:46:21,376 --> 01:46:23,779
I'll call as soon as I have
word, Mr. President.

1992
01:46:23,812 --> 01:46:25,513
Thank you.

1993
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:36,892
Forgive me for ventilating so freely.

1994
01:46:36,925 --> 01:46:38,269
I believe that you are only so worried

1995
01:46:38,293 --> 01:46:39,427
because you feel foolish

1996
01:46:39,461 --> 01:46:42,464
having waited so long to take this action.

1997
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:44,532
If you did it a year ago,

1998
01:46:44,566 --> 01:46:46,835
instead of using kid gloves

1999
01:46:46,869 --> 01:46:49,504
and giving them an extra month
in which to resupply,

2000
01:46:49,537 --> 01:46:51,373
it would have followed quite naturally.

2001
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:53,709
But now it seems to you
like one step too many.

2002
01:46:53,742 --> 01:46:56,311
The problem is, my good sir,

2003
01:46:56,344 --> 01:46:59,715
each step has been inches instead of yards.

2004
01:46:59,748 --> 01:47:03,051
We have been going to war by inches!

2005
01:47:03,085 --> 01:47:05,220
Tiptoeing apologetically

2006
01:47:05,253 --> 01:47:07,522
when we should be striding through

2007
01:47:07,555 --> 01:47:11,159
with our heads held high like Americans!

2008
01:47:12,227 --> 01:47:15,831
Why don't we hear from 'em?!

2009
01:47:23,038 --> 01:47:25,440
Yeah. Bob.

2010
01:47:25,473 --> 01:47:28,543
Mr. President,
they had some weather.

2011
01:47:28,576 --> 01:47:30,145
You said it was clear!

2012
01:47:30,178 --> 01:47:32,447
I'll call you the moment I know anything.

2013
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,682
Bob...

2014
01:47:33,716 --> 01:47:35,650
my life's in your hands here.

2015
01:47:35,684 --> 01:47:38,754
Yes, sir.

2016
01:49:46,381 --> 01:49:48,650
Our Father...

2017
01:49:50,685 --> 01:49:52,787
Our Father...

2018
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:56,358
Our Father...

2019
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:59,061
who art in heaven...

2020
01:49:59,094 --> 01:50:00,896
Who art in heaven.

2021
01:50:00,929 --> 01:50:02,931
Hallowed be thy name.

2022
01:50:02,965 --> 01:50:05,901
Hallowed be thy name.

2023
01:50:05,934 --> 01:50:07,069
Well, if you admit her,

2024
01:50:07,102 --> 01:50:08,712
you could run some tests on her, can't you?

2025
01:50:08,736 --> 01:50:10,005
God damn it...

2026
01:50:10,038 --> 01:50:11,573
Mr. Secretary,
Exec-com on one.

2027
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:15,143
You can see there that she's
in a hell of a lot of pain.

2028
01:50:15,177 --> 01:50:18,113
- Thy kingdom come.
- Thy kingdom come.

2029
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:19,882
Thy will be done.

2030
01:50:25,854 --> 01:50:27,689
I'm sorry.

2031
01:50:27,722 --> 01:50:29,791
- On earth...
- I'm sorry.

2032
01:50:29,824 --> 01:50:31,693
- On earth...
- On earth...

2033
01:50:31,726 --> 01:50:35,763
- As it is in heaven.
- As it is in heaven.

2034
01:50:38,566 --> 01:50:41,769
- Give us this day...
- Give us this day...

2035
01:50:41,803 --> 01:50:45,874
- our daily bread.
- Our daily bread.

2036
01:50:45,908 --> 01:50:49,177
And forgive us our trespasses.

2037
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:51,846
And forgive us our trespasses.

2038
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:55,350
As we forgive those who trespass against us.

2039
01:50:55,383 --> 01:50:59,321
As we forgive those who trespass against us.

2040
01:50:59,354 --> 01:51:02,290
Lead us not into temptation.

2041
01:51:02,324 --> 01:51:04,826
Lead us not into temptation.

2042
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:09,031
But deliver us from evil.

2043
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:12,867
Deliver us from evil.

2044
01:51:12,901 --> 01:51:14,269
Amen.

2045
01:51:14,302 --> 01:51:15,470
Amen.

2046
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,585
Go ahead.

2047
01:52:03,618 --> 01:52:05,954
Mr. President, I just
talked with Honolulu.

2048
01:52:05,988 --> 01:52:10,192
All the primaries were hit,
and no ships were struck.

2049
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:14,562
Now, we did lose two aircraft to antiair.

2050
01:52:14,596 --> 01:52:15,697
No Russian ships?

2051
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:17,765
We didn't hit any Russian ships?

2052
01:52:17,799 --> 01:52:21,736
No, but as I say, two pilots are down.

2053
01:52:21,769 --> 01:52:24,472
I won't know about civilian
causalities until we have the photos.

2054
01:52:24,506 --> 01:52:27,875
Now, if the weather holds,
we can send the RFs in

2055
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:29,387
to see just what collateral damage...

2056
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:31,079
All right, Bob.
Thank you.

2057
01:52:31,113 --> 01:52:33,281
Thank you.

2058
01:52:36,351 --> 01:52:39,021
Man, on TV: Pentagon sources tell "CBS News"

2059
01:52:39,054 --> 01:52:40,788
that General Westmoreland has been granted

2060
01:52:40,822 --> 01:52:43,591
even great authority
over the use of B-52s

2061
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:46,694
in Vietcong-controlled areas
in the south.

2062
01:52:46,728 --> 01:52:49,831
With the recent escalation of
bombing over North Vietnam

2063
01:52:49,864 --> 01:52:52,100
aimed at destroying the heart of the enemy's

2064
01:52:52,134 --> 01:52:54,436
urban industrial capacity,

2065
01:52:54,469 --> 01:52:56,338
the U.S. clearly wants
to force a change

2066
01:52:56,371 --> 01:52:58,906
in Hanoi's will to continue the war.

2067
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,976
Last year, the rate of
Rolling Thunder missions flown

2068
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:04,679
reached 1,500 per week.

2069
01:53:04,712 --> 01:53:06,981
Since then the rate of sorties has doubled.

2070
01:53:07,015 --> 01:53:10,018
Mr. President, it appears
that the air strikes

2071
01:53:10,052 --> 01:53:14,056
have had no effect on the
enemy's war-making capability.

2072
01:53:14,089 --> 01:53:16,058
The attacks were not successful?

2073
01:53:16,091 --> 01:53:18,826
Well, while we did destroy nearly 100%

2074
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:20,795
of their oil storage capacity

2075
01:53:20,828 --> 01:53:24,299
in our follow-up attacks
throughout the summer,

2076
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:26,801
a large portion of their
stock was put into barrels

2077
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:29,437
and dispersed in anticipation
of our strikes.

2078
01:53:29,471 --> 01:53:32,040
They've retained enough to
meet ongoing requirements.

2079
01:53:32,074 --> 01:53:34,042
Their buildup is continuing.

2080
01:53:34,076 --> 01:53:37,179
And Westmoreland is
requesting additional men.

2081
01:53:37,212 --> 01:53:38,880
How many?

2082
01:53:38,913 --> 01:53:40,982
The Program Three forces will bring us up

2083
01:53:41,015 --> 01:53:44,652
to 431,000 by the middle of '67.

2084
01:53:46,121 --> 01:53:47,522
What about the bombing?

2085
01:53:47,555 --> 01:53:51,359
We're looking at heavier B-52
strikes in the southern DMZ,

2086
01:53:51,393 --> 01:53:55,397
and in North Vietnam,
targets in the restricted zones.

2087
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:56,898
Downtown Hanoi.

2088
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:58,500
Yes, sir, and Haiphong,

2089
01:53:58,533 --> 01:54:00,668
and in the buffer zone with China.

2090
01:54:00,702 --> 01:54:02,036
The good news,
Mr. President,

2091
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:03,314
is that the naysayers were wrong.

2092
01:54:03,338 --> 01:54:05,773
Peking and Moscow stood still,

2093
01:54:05,807 --> 01:54:07,609
and they will very likely stand still

2094
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:09,644
even with intensified activity.

2095
01:54:13,448 --> 01:54:16,451
Are you recommending some of
these new targets for me today?

2096
01:54:16,484 --> 01:54:19,954
Yes, I am. You have the
evaluation sheets before you.

2097
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:21,789
I have some photographs here.

2098
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:25,260
The Van Dien truck depot.

2099
01:54:25,293 --> 01:54:28,230
That the one with the school up the street?

2100
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,538
As a matter of fact, yes,
the Polish Friendship School

2101
01:54:36,571 --> 01:54:38,740
across the highway, a half a mile up.

2102
01:54:38,773 --> 01:54:41,276
Mr. President,
as you may recall,

2103
01:54:41,309 --> 01:54:42,944
in order to avoid a tax increase,

2104
01:54:42,977 --> 01:54:46,214
we did not budget for the war
beyond this fiscal year,

2105
01:54:46,248 --> 01:54:48,750
which has cost us 20 billion

2106
01:54:48,783 --> 01:54:51,686
as opposed to the 12 billion projected.

2107
01:54:54,322 --> 01:54:57,825
We are over by eight billion?

2108
01:54:57,859 --> 01:54:59,594
Eight billion?

2109
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:06,701
Mr. President, if you
approve these new forces,

2110
01:55:06,734 --> 01:55:09,137
constraints on domestic programs

2111
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:12,106
will no longer be avoidable.

2112
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:14,542
It's all in a memo I sent over to you today

2113
01:55:14,576 --> 01:55:17,379
along with some recommendations.

2114
01:55:24,619 --> 01:55:25,787
Joe.

2115
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:29,691
I want to start working on
the State of the Union.

2116
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,663
You sit down with Bob and Walt and Fowler.

2117
01:55:35,697 --> 01:55:37,832
Yes, Mr. President.

2118
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:44,172
There's to be no mention
of the Great Society!

2119
01:55:59,754 --> 01:56:01,423
What is it you're looking for?

2120
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:03,358
Undersecretary of state?

2121
01:56:03,391 --> 01:56:06,928
I'll change the title to the
Holy Roman Emperor, right?

2122
01:56:06,961 --> 01:56:12,200
No, this is the best way
I can serve your presidency.

2123
01:56:12,234 --> 01:56:16,571
And I think Dean Rusk would feel undercut

2124
01:56:16,604 --> 01:56:19,207
if you were to fill George Ball's job

2125
01:56:19,241 --> 01:56:21,643
with a personal friend of yours.

2126
01:56:21,676 --> 01:56:23,578
I don't give a rat's ass what Rusk feels!

2127
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:25,780
I need you in that room, Clark.

2128
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:28,716
I need someone like George with
an ability to reason and argue.

2129
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,084
A devil's advocate.

2130
01:56:30,117 --> 01:56:34,088
George Ball was not
playing devil's advocate.

2131
01:56:34,121 --> 01:56:37,325
He believes every word he says.

2132
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:40,995
All right.

2133
01:56:41,028 --> 01:56:42,430
All right.

2134
01:56:46,968 --> 01:56:48,936
Moyers wants the job.

2135
01:56:48,970 --> 01:56:52,106
My press man thinks if I make
him number two at State,

2136
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:54,942
I'll all of a sudden give a shit
what he thinks about Vietnam.

2137
01:56:56,110 --> 01:56:59,113
And McNamara.
McNamara sends me a paper.

2138
01:56:59,146 --> 01:57:01,583
Says we should cap the troops,
level off the bombing.

2139
01:57:01,616 --> 01:57:03,518
You know what happens if I stop bombing?

2140
01:57:03,551 --> 01:57:06,621
Ho Chi Minh runs five
more divisions up my ass,

2141
01:57:06,654 --> 01:57:09,324
that's what happens!

2142
01:57:09,357 --> 01:57:12,193
It was McNamara's program, the whole thing.

2143
01:57:12,226 --> 01:57:14,362
Now he's talking up a shitstorm with Bobby.

2144
01:57:14,396 --> 01:57:15,363
You don't know that.

2145
01:57:15,397 --> 01:57:17,299
I know everything.

2146
01:57:17,332 --> 01:57:20,468
I know who's saying what at those
fancy Georgetown dinner parties.

2147
01:57:20,502 --> 01:57:23,271
I know 'cause I had Hoover put
a couple of boys there, too.

2148
01:57:23,305 --> 01:57:24,406
I know.

2149
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:26,974
What they say doesn't matter.

2150
01:57:27,008 --> 01:57:29,611
You're not helpless in this situation.

2151
01:57:29,644 --> 01:57:31,446
Your approval ratings are down.

2152
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:36,318
You need to go out there on
the stump and sell the truth.

2153
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,219
Westmoreland is now saying

2154
01:57:38,252 --> 01:57:42,624
that a Communist military
victory is impossible.

2155
01:57:42,657 --> 01:57:45,593
You're finally winning in Vietnam.

2156
01:57:45,627 --> 01:57:47,429
We're winning, but we're losing.

2157
01:57:47,462 --> 01:57:49,631
We're killing 'em, and we're losing.

2158
01:57:49,664 --> 01:57:54,268
We're losing because this war
goes on and on and on!

2159
01:57:54,302 --> 01:57:55,937
I passed twice the number of bills.

2160
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:57,905
FDR got through in his first hundred days.

2161
01:57:57,939 --> 01:58:00,708
200 in the last two years!

2162
01:58:00,742 --> 01:58:03,545
There's never been an era in
American history like this,

2163
01:58:03,578 --> 01:58:06,848
yet there's so much left to do.

2164
01:58:06,881 --> 01:58:11,386
But this war has got to end!

2165
01:58:11,419 --> 01:58:14,922
Five years pussyfooting about in
that miserable little country.

2166
01:58:14,956 --> 01:58:17,359
$2 billion a month!

2167
01:58:17,392 --> 01:58:20,395
We could be feeding these
people, educating these people!

2168
01:58:20,428 --> 01:58:23,565
God damn it! Why won't that son
of a bitch let me help him?

2169
01:58:23,598 --> 01:58:25,132
Why?

2170
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:26,601
Why won't he lay down his arms

2171
01:58:26,634 --> 01:58:31,739
and stop killing off his sons
in the flower of their youth?

2172
01:58:31,773 --> 01:58:33,941
I do not understand.

2173
01:58:33,975 --> 01:58:36,878
I just do not understand.

2174
01:58:40,448 --> 01:58:43,918
Mr. President...

2175
01:58:43,951 --> 01:58:46,354
Moyers.
Get me Moyers.

2176
01:58:46,388 --> 01:58:49,457
And get me General Westmoreland
on the other line.

2177
01:58:49,491 --> 01:58:50,792
Can I help you,
Mr. President?

2178
01:58:50,825 --> 01:58:53,595
Get your bags packed.

2179
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:59,634
Call the press together.
We're going to Vietnam.

2180
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:14,348
Dean?

2181
01:59:17,919 --> 01:59:19,587
Are they ours?

2182
01:59:19,621 --> 01:59:21,188
I fucking hope so.

2183
02:00:03,164 --> 02:00:06,333
Present arms!

2184
02:00:08,803 --> 02:00:11,939
Order... hut!

2185
02:01:03,758 --> 02:01:05,226
Where you from, son?

2186
02:01:05,259 --> 02:01:06,427
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

2187
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,496
- Kentucky?
- Yes, sir.

2188
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:10,273
Have you reached majority age yet, Corporal?

2189
02:01:10,297 --> 02:01:12,767
I was 21 last month, sir.

2190
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,913
My mom and my girl sent me a big old chocolate
cake, and it came just in time, sir.

2191
02:01:15,937 --> 02:01:19,240
- Good. Bill, get 'em out.
- Yes, Mr. President.

2192
02:01:19,273 --> 02:01:22,677
Well, they've given me
the honor, Corporal McCaffrey,

2193
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:26,581
of pinning you with this Purple Heart here.

2194
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:27,882
There.

2195
02:01:27,915 --> 02:01:29,350
You'll be home right soon,

2196
02:01:29,383 --> 02:01:30,628
and on the first Tuesday of November,

2197
02:01:30,652 --> 02:01:32,353
you got a congressional election.

2198
02:01:32,386 --> 02:01:34,622
I want you to vote.

2199
02:01:34,656 --> 02:01:36,290
Yes, sir.

2200
02:01:36,323 --> 02:01:39,160
You'll be able to get to your polling place?

2201
02:01:39,193 --> 02:01:41,195
I don't know where it is,
but I'll get a ride, sir.

2202
02:01:41,228 --> 02:01:43,598
All right.

2203
02:01:46,033 --> 02:01:47,101
Make sure you vote now.

2204
02:01:47,134 --> 02:01:49,003
Yes, sir.

2205
02:01:51,138 --> 02:01:53,875
We're all behind you, sir.

2206
02:01:53,908 --> 02:01:56,811
Every one of us.

2207
02:01:56,844 --> 02:02:00,214
We won't let you down.

2208
02:02:00,247 --> 02:02:01,215
All right, son.

2209
02:02:01,248 --> 02:02:04,351
Thank you.

2210
02:02:04,385 --> 02:02:06,621
And I won't let you down!

2211
02:02:06,654 --> 02:02:09,557
You'll get everything you need.

2212
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:12,860
I thank you.
I salute you.

2213
02:02:12,894 --> 02:02:15,597
May the good Lord look
over you and keep you safe

2214
02:02:15,630 --> 02:02:18,700
until you come home and nail
that coonskin to the wall.

2215
02:02:18,733 --> 02:02:21,836
Three cheers for the
president! Hip hip...

2216
02:02:21,869 --> 02:02:23,237
Hooray!

2217
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:24,238
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

2218
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:26,507
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

2219
02:03:21,863 --> 02:03:24,231
Certainly the bombing of the north

2220
02:03:24,265 --> 02:03:26,701
makes the war more costly and more difficult

2221
02:03:26,734 --> 02:03:29,971
and more painful for North Vietnam.

2222
02:03:30,004 --> 02:03:32,606
It is a harsh punishment indeed.

2223
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,476
But we are not in Vietnam to play the part

2224
02:03:35,509 --> 02:03:37,812
of an avenging angel pouring
death and destruction.

2225
02:03:37,845 --> 02:03:42,183
Kennedy, McCarthy

2226
02:03:42,216 --> 02:03:44,852
haven't done a thing for this country!

2227
02:03:44,886 --> 02:03:47,254
Not a fucking thing!

2228
02:03:47,288 --> 02:03:49,590
And look at all I've done!

2229
02:03:49,623 --> 02:03:51,534
It should be clear by now that
the bombing of the north

2230
02:03:51,558 --> 02:03:54,862
cannot bring an end to the war in the south

2231
02:03:54,896 --> 02:03:56,563
and that indeed at the present time

2232
02:03:56,597 --> 02:03:59,200
it may well be prolonging that war.

2233
02:03:59,233 --> 02:04:00,702
Our troops are being killed

2234
02:04:00,735 --> 02:04:03,537
by the bullets and the mines of the south.

2235
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:05,406
If by ending the bombing of the north,

2236
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:08,075
we can bring peace to South Vietnam,

2237
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:10,244
we will save the lives of thousands of...

2238
02:04:10,277 --> 02:04:12,279
I don't know why you're
worried about Kennedy

2239
02:04:12,313 --> 02:04:14,949
and your second term.

2240
02:04:14,982 --> 02:04:16,383
Because I don't think your health

2241
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:19,353
will survive your first term.

2242
02:04:19,386 --> 02:04:21,455
Where you going?

2243
02:04:21,488 --> 02:04:23,190
I want to be useful to you.

2244
02:04:23,224 --> 02:04:25,359
And I would listen even
as you rant and rave,

2245
02:04:25,392 --> 02:04:27,028
but I have worked far too hard

2246
02:04:27,061 --> 02:04:30,865
and borne far too much to
watch you destroy yourself.

2247
02:04:37,171 --> 02:04:39,974
Major political elements of South Vietnam

2248
02:04:40,007 --> 02:04:42,977
to participate in their
choice of leadership...

2249
02:04:46,047 --> 02:04:49,150
The bridge is a major target,
and we've never hit it.

2250
02:04:49,183 --> 02:04:51,685
The chance of civilian deaths
will be almost zero.

2251
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:54,288
I say 100 to 500, possibly more.

2252
02:04:54,321 --> 02:04:55,990
Which is it, 500 or zero?

2253
02:04:56,023 --> 02:04:58,559
Mr. President, the Stennis
Committee is up in arms

2254
02:04:58,592 --> 02:05:00,627
over our holding back on these targets.

2255
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:02,263
Bob's testimony is coming up,

2256
02:05:02,296 --> 02:05:03,831
and it might take some heat off him

2257
02:05:03,865 --> 02:05:06,300
if some of these can be cleared
up before his appearance.

2258
02:05:06,333 --> 02:05:08,535
I can take the heat
without padding my resume

2259
02:05:08,569 --> 02:05:09,804
with more bombing missions.

2260
02:05:09,837 --> 02:05:11,148
This is a heavily defended target

2261
02:05:11,172 --> 02:05:12,940
in a very populated area.

2262
02:05:12,974 --> 02:05:14,842
The photos are right here,
Mr. President.

2263
02:05:14,876 --> 02:05:16,010
The photos are meaningless.

2264
02:05:16,043 --> 02:05:17,745
The target is heavily defended.

2265
02:05:17,779 --> 02:05:19,046
The pilots jettison their bombs

2266
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,281
when they're under attack.

2267
02:05:20,314 --> 02:05:21,816
Now, I've been asking for two years

2268
02:05:21,849 --> 02:05:23,360
why they don't come straight up the river.

2269
02:05:23,384 --> 02:05:24,661
That way, if they dump the bombs,

2270
02:05:24,685 --> 02:05:26,163
they go in the water and not on the people,

2271
02:05:26,187 --> 02:05:27,364
and I still haven't got an answer.

2272
02:05:27,388 --> 02:05:30,157
Coming in from the gulf involves
an extra turn,

2273
02:05:30,191 --> 02:05:32,359
with our backs to those heavy defenses.

2274
02:05:32,393 --> 02:05:36,330
If it is so well defended,
should we risk the pilots?

2275
02:05:36,363 --> 02:05:39,066
Men dying is a relative thing.

2276
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:41,869
The effect of the air
campaign is cumulative.

2277
02:05:41,903 --> 02:05:44,772
Every blow makes the enemy
stretch his resources.

2278
02:05:44,806 --> 02:05:46,974
Stretching is a relative thing.

2279
02:05:47,008 --> 02:05:49,911
Mr. President, we shouldn't be
bombing for punitive reasons,

2280
02:05:49,944 --> 02:05:51,454
but there just doesn't seem
any point to this anymore!

2281
02:05:51,478 --> 02:05:53,014
Hit it!

2282
02:05:53,047 --> 02:05:54,681
Hit the goddamn bridge.

2283
02:05:54,715 --> 02:05:56,750
What's next?

2284
02:05:56,784 --> 02:06:00,955
Number 309, sir, the, railcar repair shop.

2285
02:06:04,892 --> 02:06:06,560
Marg?

2286
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:10,697
Marg?

2287
02:06:11,732 --> 02:06:14,301
Jesus.
Jesus.

2288
02:06:14,335 --> 02:06:16,703
Come to me.
Come on.

2289
02:06:16,737 --> 02:06:20,774
I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

2290
02:06:33,054 --> 02:06:35,222
I don't know what I'm gonna do, Marg.

2291
02:06:38,125 --> 02:06:39,994
Rostow, the chiefs,

2292
02:06:40,027 --> 02:06:42,396
they're gonna drive this
thing straight to hell.

2293
02:07:31,913 --> 02:07:34,281
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

2294
02:08:21,062 --> 02:08:22,829
One, two, three, four,

2295
02:08:22,863 --> 02:08:24,898
we don't want your fucking war!

2296
02:08:24,932 --> 02:08:26,600
One, two, three, four,

2297
02:08:26,633 --> 02:08:28,735
we don't want your fucking war!

2298
02:08:28,769 --> 02:08:30,671
One, two, three, four,

2299
02:08:30,704 --> 02:08:32,606
we don't want your fucking war!

2300
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:34,641
One, two, three, four,

2301
02:08:34,675 --> 02:08:36,510
we don't want your fucking war!

2302
02:08:36,543 --> 02:08:38,545
One, two, three, four,

2303
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:40,447
we don't want your fucking war!

2304
02:08:40,481 --> 02:08:42,449
One, two, three, four,

2305
02:08:42,483 --> 02:08:44,451
we don't want your fucking war!

2306
02:08:44,485 --> 02:08:45,852
One, two, three, four...

2307
02:08:45,886 --> 02:08:49,690
Hey, hey, LBJ! How many
kids did you kill today?

2308
02:08:49,723 --> 02:08:53,394
Hey, hey, LBJ! How many
kids did you kill today?

2309
02:08:53,427 --> 02:08:56,863
Hey, hey, LBJ! How many
kids did you kill today?

2310
02:08:56,897 --> 02:09:00,034
Hey, hey, LBJ! How many
kids did you kill today?

2311
02:09:00,067 --> 02:09:03,937
All right, take formation, spread out!

2312
02:09:03,971 --> 02:09:06,007
Stop the war in Vietnam!

2313
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:07,741
Bring the troops home now!

2314
02:09:07,774 --> 02:09:09,710
Stop the war in Vietnam!

2315
02:09:09,743 --> 02:09:12,246
Bring the troops home now!

2316
02:09:12,279 --> 02:09:14,982
Let's go! Let's go!
File in, move it up!

2317
02:09:15,016 --> 02:09:16,950
Hell, no! We won't go!

2318
02:09:16,984 --> 02:09:18,919
Hell, no! We won't go!

2319
02:09:18,952 --> 02:09:20,721
Hell, no! We won't go!

2320
02:09:20,754 --> 02:09:22,489
Hell, no! We won't go!

2321
02:09:22,523 --> 02:09:25,792
No rifle is to be loaded
without my permission.

2322
02:09:25,826 --> 02:09:27,761
I'll have the commanders
go down the line again.

2323
02:09:27,794 --> 02:09:29,630
Not one bullet, damn it!

2324
02:09:58,692 --> 02:10:01,428
Get off me!
Let me go!

2325
02:10:01,462 --> 02:10:04,598
Let me go!
Just let me go!

2326
02:10:06,967 --> 02:10:09,336
Look at that.

2327
02:10:12,473 --> 02:10:15,342
There he is!
There's McNamara!

2328
02:10:15,376 --> 02:10:17,544
There's McNamara!

2329
02:10:33,327 --> 02:10:36,297
Secretary McNamara, on behalf
of the subcommittee,

2330
02:10:36,330 --> 02:10:39,600
let me thank you for your
appearance here today.

2331
02:10:39,633 --> 02:10:44,338
I have, from the beginning, and do today,

2332
02:10:44,371 --> 02:10:48,742
fully support the objectives of the bombing

2333
02:10:48,775 --> 02:10:51,178
to interdict men and supplies

2334
02:10:51,212 --> 02:10:54,181
and hinder the enemy's ability
to wage war in the south.

2335
02:10:54,215 --> 02:10:58,852
In this I am 100% behind the joint chiefs,

2336
02:10:58,885 --> 02:11:00,421
Admiral Sharp,

2337
02:11:00,454 --> 02:11:03,357
General Westmoreland and his commanders,

2338
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:05,659
as they are fully aware

2339
02:11:05,692 --> 02:11:07,894
and as the president is aware.

2340
02:11:07,928 --> 02:11:11,732
We are all greatly encouraged
to hear that, Mr. Secretary.

2341
02:11:11,765 --> 02:11:15,202
You are the last to testify, as you know,

2342
02:11:15,236 --> 02:11:18,205
and the overwhelming view

2343
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:19,840
from General Wheeler and the others

2344
02:11:19,873 --> 02:11:23,344
is that there has been excessive
interference from your office...

2345
02:11:23,377 --> 02:11:26,480
If I'd be permitted to finish
my statement, Senator Stennis.

2346
02:11:26,513 --> 02:11:29,850
There are copies available
outside the hearing room.

2347
02:11:29,883 --> 02:11:34,121
Our greater objective, however,
was, and remains,

2348
02:11:34,155 --> 02:11:36,323
to persuade the leaders of North Vietnam

2349
02:11:36,357 --> 02:11:38,992
that they cannot prevail.

2350
02:11:39,025 --> 02:11:42,196
In this we have been unsuccessful.

2351
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:44,565
This is due to the fact that North Vietnam

2352
02:11:44,598 --> 02:11:46,900
can sustain its forces in the south

2353
02:11:46,933 --> 02:11:49,903
with a mere 100 tons of supplies a day,

2354
02:11:49,936 --> 02:11:52,005
85 of which they can acquire

2355
02:11:52,038 --> 02:11:55,809
through corrupt elements in the
South Vietnamese government.

2356
02:11:55,842 --> 02:11:59,079
Out of 359 targets
recommended by the chiefs,

2357
02:11:59,112 --> 02:12:01,215
only 57 remain unstruck.

2358
02:12:01,248 --> 02:12:03,617
Two are battery plants

2359
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:06,753
manufacturing a total of 600 tons a year,

2360
02:12:06,787 --> 02:12:10,090
not enough to fill the corner of a
Sears-Roebuck regional warehouse.

2361
02:12:10,123 --> 02:12:11,758
Just a moment,
Mr. Secretary.

2362
02:12:11,792 --> 02:12:14,628
There's a rubber plant
producing 30 tires a day.

2363
02:12:14,661 --> 02:12:17,030
The service station where I fill my car

2364
02:12:17,063 --> 02:12:18,675
could supply the output of this facility.

2365
02:12:18,699 --> 02:12:22,669
Hitting these targets
will cost us in pilots,

2366
02:12:22,703 --> 02:12:25,406
planes and hard cash,

2367
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:29,443
and they will kill more and more civilians.

2368
02:12:29,476 --> 02:12:32,179
The military knows this.

2369
02:12:32,213 --> 02:12:34,648
They think it's worth it.

2370
02:12:34,681 --> 02:12:36,317
I do not.

2371
02:12:37,884 --> 02:12:39,320
Order!

2372
02:12:39,353 --> 02:12:41,054
You know what he did to me out there?

2373
02:12:41,087 --> 02:12:42,323
It's like selling your house

2374
02:12:42,356 --> 02:12:44,057
and your son takes the buyer aside

2375
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:46,693
and tells him there's leaks in the basement.

2376
02:12:46,727 --> 02:12:49,996
Now Hanoi knows we're divided,
and they'll never stop.

2377
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:51,765
I've gotta get rid of that son of a bitch.

2378
02:12:51,798 --> 02:12:54,601
You can't just get rid of him.

2379
02:12:54,635 --> 02:12:56,437
The Republicans will play up the disunity.

2380
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:58,004
Bobby will have a field day.

2381
02:12:58,038 --> 02:13:00,207
Bobby's clamoring for him to
resign, don't you know,

2382
02:13:00,241 --> 02:13:03,477
to go public against me
for doing what he advised!

2383
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:06,313
Look, we'll find a job for McNamara

2384
02:13:06,347 --> 02:13:08,114
where he won't be able to snipe at you.

2385
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:10,817
I'll help you fill his post
with someone you can trust.

2386
02:13:10,851 --> 02:13:13,454
I'll do anything I can
for you, Mr. President.

2387
02:13:13,487 --> 02:13:16,122
But we have a reelection campaign to start,

2388
02:13:16,156 --> 02:13:18,992
and you do not have a policy
to end this war.

2389
02:13:21,428 --> 02:13:25,999
Clark, you'll do anything you can?

2390
02:13:34,308 --> 02:13:36,076
They're ready for you,
Mr. President.

2391
02:13:36,109 --> 02:13:39,079
Yeah. I'll be out
in a minute.

2392
02:13:39,112 --> 02:13:40,814
Sit down, Bob.

2393
02:13:46,487 --> 02:13:49,122
I'm sorry you found out
from the "Washington Post."

2394
02:13:49,155 --> 02:13:52,626
I'm sure Fowler told you,
or the bank people.

2395
02:13:52,659 --> 02:13:54,728
Nobody told me anything,
Mr. President.

2396
02:13:54,761 --> 02:13:57,464
I, mentioned to you in the spring

2397
02:13:57,498 --> 02:13:58,908
that I'd been approached by the World Bank,

2398
02:13:58,932 --> 02:14:01,835
but I thought if you were
going to nominate me,

2399
02:14:01,868 --> 02:14:04,237
you would have said something yourself.

2400
02:14:04,271 --> 02:14:07,173
Doing fine work there.
Humanitarian work.

2401
02:14:07,207 --> 02:14:08,485
I know that's of interest to you.

2402
02:14:08,509 --> 02:14:11,412
Yes, but only if it's what you want.

2403
02:14:11,445 --> 02:14:13,780
If I can no longer be of service...

2404
02:14:13,814 --> 02:14:15,549
Service?

2405
02:14:15,582 --> 02:14:18,452
Who's been of more service to me than you?

2406
02:14:18,485 --> 02:14:21,455
Why, you've served longer than any
defense secretary in history.

2407
02:14:21,488 --> 02:14:23,624
Look what you've had to shepherd us through.

2408
02:14:23,657 --> 02:14:26,360
The Cuban crisis...
Two Cuban crisises,

2409
02:14:26,393 --> 02:14:28,762
Berlin, Dominican, Middle East.

2410
02:14:28,795 --> 02:14:32,132
Hell, that's a tough
enough job in peacetime.

2411
02:14:32,165 --> 02:14:34,935
And look what you've had to deal with.

2412
02:14:34,968 --> 02:14:37,504
Mr. President,

2413
02:14:37,538 --> 02:14:39,640
the point is...

2414
02:14:39,673 --> 02:14:44,778
I don't have to leave
until you want me to leave.

2415
02:14:44,811 --> 02:14:46,647
Bob,

2416
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:49,149
Joe Fowler asked me for three nominees.

2417
02:14:49,182 --> 02:14:51,952
McNamara.

2418
02:14:51,985 --> 02:14:54,955
There were tears in the
treasury secretary's eyes

2419
02:14:54,988 --> 02:14:57,157
'cause he was hoping he'd be my choice.

2420
02:14:57,190 --> 02:14:59,259
And with tears in his eyes,

2421
02:14:59,292 --> 02:15:01,795
he said he had to submit
three names to the bank.

2422
02:15:01,828 --> 02:15:05,832
I said, "Okay. McNamara,
McNamara, and McNamara."

2423
02:15:05,866 --> 02:15:07,300
You ask him.

2424
02:15:07,334 --> 02:15:10,637
Now, the bank directors vote today,

2425
02:15:10,671 --> 02:15:13,774
but it's, it's just a formality.

2426
02:15:13,807 --> 02:15:16,443
Now, Bob, I better get over

2427
02:15:16,477 --> 02:15:18,945
to Lady Bird's beautification awards.

2428
02:15:18,979 --> 02:15:20,514
It's important to her.

2429
02:15:20,547 --> 02:15:23,684
Your wife's the same with her
reading program, I know.

2430
02:15:23,717 --> 02:15:26,820
Yes, although with her condition,

2431
02:15:26,853 --> 02:15:28,021
it's been difficult.

2432
02:15:28,054 --> 02:15:31,091
No improvement since surgery?

2433
02:15:31,124 --> 02:15:35,261
My son...

2434
02:15:35,295 --> 02:15:37,297
he has them as well.

2435
02:15:38,932 --> 02:15:41,101
You deserve whatever you want
from this government.

2436
02:15:41,134 --> 02:15:43,770
My obligation is to help you,

2437
02:15:43,804 --> 02:15:46,006
and this was within my power to grant you.

2438
02:15:49,376 --> 02:15:54,047
People have an obligation to the president,

2439
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:56,216
not the other way around.

2440
02:16:02,489 --> 02:16:06,159
"May your selfless service,
spent in defending freedom,

2441
02:16:06,192 --> 02:16:08,361
"bring even greater rewards

2442
02:16:08,395 --> 02:16:10,263
"in the larger work that you now undertake

2443
02:16:10,296 --> 02:16:12,165
to promote freedom throughout
the world."

2444
02:16:12,198 --> 02:16:15,936
Signed, Lyndon B. Johnson,
President.

2445
02:16:20,974 --> 02:16:23,844
This is the Medal of Freedom,

2446
02:16:23,877 --> 02:16:26,747
the highest award a president can bestow

2447
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:30,383
upon a citizen of the United States.

2448
02:16:30,417 --> 02:16:35,055
I award it now to a loyal,
brilliant, good man.

2449
02:16:35,088 --> 02:16:38,592
Robert McNamara, the very best we have.

2450
02:16:41,895 --> 02:16:43,263
Thank you, Mr. President.

2451
02:16:43,296 --> 02:16:45,566
This is an almost impossible
situation to respond to.

2452
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,200
You're used to impossible situations.

2453
02:17:22,569 --> 02:17:23,570
Thank you.

2454
02:17:33,379 --> 02:17:35,882
Now, I stand here tonight to tell you

2455
02:17:35,916 --> 02:17:39,219
that I regard Bob McNamara here

2456
02:17:39,252 --> 02:17:41,922
as not only one of the smartest,

2457
02:17:41,955 --> 02:17:45,726
but one of the most humane men I know.

2458
02:17:45,759 --> 02:17:47,728
Thank you.

2459
02:17:50,597 --> 02:17:55,101
Put the men in.

2460
02:17:56,603 --> 02:18:00,874
Call up the reserves and
extend tours of duty.

2461
02:18:02,175 --> 02:18:07,047
Expand the bombing.

2462
02:18:18,024 --> 02:18:21,895
Mr. President...

2463
02:18:21,928 --> 02:18:24,665
I cannot...

2464
02:18:26,967 --> 02:18:31,838
find the words to express
what lies in my heart today.

2465
02:18:31,872 --> 02:18:35,642
And...

2466
02:18:35,676 --> 02:18:38,545
I think I better respond at another time.

2467
02:18:39,913 --> 02:18:42,482
Bob.

2468
02:19:01,234 --> 02:19:02,502
One question, please!

2469
02:19:02,535 --> 02:19:04,905
- Over here!
- Mr. Clifford!

2470
02:19:04,938 --> 02:19:06,740
Mr. Clifford,
does your acceptance

2471
02:19:06,773 --> 02:19:08,575
of the job of defense secretary

2472
02:19:08,609 --> 02:19:11,578
signal your interest in elected office?

2473
02:19:11,612 --> 02:19:14,247
It signals only my desire

2474
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:18,351
to serve a great president
and a longtime friend.

2475
02:19:18,384 --> 02:19:21,254
I am 61 years old,

2476
02:19:21,287 --> 02:19:23,657
and I'm sure this will finish me off.

2477
02:19:26,793 --> 02:19:28,662
John.

2478
02:19:28,695 --> 02:19:31,732
It's been observed that in
your views on Vietnam,

2479
02:19:31,765 --> 02:19:33,600
you've changed from dove to hawk.

2480
02:19:33,634 --> 02:19:34,968
Which are you?

2481
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:37,671
I am not conscious of falling under

2482
02:19:37,704 --> 02:19:40,573
any of those ornithological divisions.

2483
02:19:40,607 --> 02:19:42,676
I'll tell you this, he's no ostrich.

2484
02:19:44,745 --> 02:19:46,355
I know of no man who will call it as it is

2485
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:49,650
with such candor and judgment
as this man, Clark Clifford.

2486
02:19:49,683 --> 02:19:51,918
We got a light at the end of the tunnel now!

2487
02:20:01,327 --> 02:20:03,764
It's probably a small attack,
Mr. President.

2488
02:20:03,797 --> 02:20:06,132
The embassy compound's been hit before.

2489
02:20:06,166 --> 02:20:07,801
Mr. Secretary,
it's not just the embassy.

2490
02:20:07,834 --> 02:20:10,236
The palace, legislature, airport, too.

2491
02:20:16,276 --> 02:20:19,179
- Secretary Rusk.
- Put it on the speakerphone.

2492
02:20:21,648 --> 02:20:23,750
Go ahead, Ben.

2493
02:20:23,784 --> 02:20:26,586
Dean, I've got the duty officer
at the embassy, Alan Brandt.

2494
02:20:26,619 --> 02:20:30,456
Mr. Brandt!
Mr. Brandt, can you hear me?

2495
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:33,193
They're standing right outside,
Mr. Secretary.

2496
02:20:33,226 --> 02:20:34,928
Outside of the embassy compound?

2497
02:20:34,961 --> 02:20:36,329
Inside.

2498
02:20:36,362 --> 02:20:38,498
They blew through the wall.
They're at the door.

2499
02:20:38,531 --> 02:20:40,266
Rostow, casualty report.

2500
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:43,136
Do you have something to defend
yourself with, Mr. Brandt?

2501
02:20:43,169 --> 02:20:45,338
I'm at the window.
They're below me.

2502
02:20:45,371 --> 02:20:47,640
They see me.
They're looking right at me.

2503
02:20:47,674 --> 02:20:49,109
I've got to go.
Mr. Secretary.

2504
02:20:49,142 --> 02:20:51,044
Small attack?!

2505
02:20:51,077 --> 02:20:53,179
These are desperation moves,
Mr. President.

2506
02:20:53,213 --> 02:20:54,180
We've got them on the run.

2507
02:20:54,214 --> 02:20:56,616
It's not just Saigon.

2508
02:20:58,151 --> 02:21:00,029
Man, on TV: The Vietcong have
launched surprise attacks

2509
02:21:00,053 --> 02:21:03,957
on 36 of the 44 provincial
capitals of South Vietnam.

2510
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:06,793
From the streets of Hue near the DMZ

2511
02:21:06,827 --> 02:21:09,262
to the U.S. embassy
compound in Saigon,

2512
02:21:09,295 --> 02:21:13,133
the casualty count on both
sides has been unprecedented.

2513
02:21:13,166 --> 02:21:16,069
The U.S. military says
it is successfully

2514
02:21:16,102 --> 02:21:18,271
beating back the Vietcong attacks,

2515
02:21:18,304 --> 02:21:21,107
but clearly they are
paying an enormous price.

2516
02:21:21,141 --> 02:21:24,377
The enemy's well-laid plans
went afoul.

2517
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:27,280
They tried to ignite a revolution
in the south, and they failed.

2518
02:21:27,313 --> 02:21:30,817
If this is a failure, God help
us when they have a success.

2519
02:21:49,235 --> 02:21:52,138
I've given 'em all the men,
the planes, the guns,

2520
02:21:52,172 --> 02:21:53,706
the bullets he said he needed.

2521
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:55,541
I thought we were winning this thing!

2522
02:21:55,575 --> 02:21:58,644
Now Westmoreland says he wants
206,000 more troops!

2523
02:21:58,678 --> 02:22:00,713
206,000!

2524
02:22:00,747 --> 02:22:02,883
We'll have 750,000 there.

2525
02:22:02,916 --> 02:22:05,752
Three-quarters of a million men in Vietnam.

2526
02:22:05,786 --> 02:22:07,487
Light at the end of the tunnel.

2527
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,831
Hell, we don't even have a tunnel.

2528
02:22:08,855 --> 02:22:10,656
We don't even know where the tunnel is!

2529
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,325
I want you to get Westmoreland here.

2530
02:22:12,358 --> 02:22:14,427
Get your people together
and look at this thing.

2531
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:16,062
We'll give 'em the boys if we have to,

2532
02:22:16,096 --> 02:22:17,597
but on your recommendation.

2533
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:18,698
You'll wait.

2534
02:22:18,731 --> 02:22:20,733
I'll wait, but not for long.

2535
02:22:20,767 --> 02:22:24,404
If he needs 'em, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

2536
02:22:24,437 --> 02:22:28,608
Old friend, get me an answer.

2537
02:22:28,641 --> 02:22:31,845
Give us these troops so we
can seize the initiative!

2538
02:22:31,878 --> 02:22:33,713
But it will just be more of the same!

2539
02:22:33,746 --> 02:22:36,149
The enemy's taken 200,000 killed,

2540
02:22:36,182 --> 02:22:37,717
and he'll take 200,000 more!

2541
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:39,152
We've lost a tenth that many,

2542
02:22:39,185 --> 02:22:40,854
and Americans are rioting in the streets.

2543
02:22:40,887 --> 02:22:41,955
They should be cheering.

2544
02:22:41,988 --> 02:22:44,825
The Vietcong lost.
We were victorious.

2545
02:22:44,858 --> 02:22:46,326
That's true, Walt, but remember

2546
02:22:46,359 --> 02:22:49,029
they only committed
175,000 men to this offensive,

2547
02:22:49,062 --> 02:22:50,997
holding enough back to strike again.

2548
02:22:51,031 --> 02:22:52,975
That's right, damn it,
and it could happen at any time.

2549
02:22:52,999 --> 02:22:54,467
I say put the men in.

2550
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:57,270
There are no more trained men.

2551
02:22:57,303 --> 02:22:59,873
We would ship raw troops
and train them in the rear.

2552
02:22:59,906 --> 02:23:03,643
What rear? There is no
rear in Vietnam anymore.

2553
02:23:03,676 --> 02:23:06,679
I would hope we've at least
learned that from this victory.

2554
02:23:06,712 --> 02:23:08,849
With 206,000 more men,

2555
02:23:08,882 --> 02:23:11,317
we could go into Laos,
Cambodia, North Vietnam

2556
02:23:11,351 --> 02:23:13,786
and cut out their supply
routes once and for all.

2557
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:16,522
We have never been given that authority!

2558
02:23:16,556 --> 02:23:18,324
Excuse me, General.

2559
02:23:18,358 --> 02:23:21,527
Dean, you said the enemy committed

2560
02:23:21,561 --> 02:23:24,030
175,000 men to the offensive.

2561
02:23:24,064 --> 02:23:25,465
That's right, Clark.

2562
02:23:25,498 --> 02:23:28,401
And General Westmoreland says
that they suffered 45,000 killed,

2563
02:23:28,434 --> 02:23:31,237
with a 1-to-3.5
killed-to-wounded ratio.

2564
02:23:31,271 --> 02:23:33,173
It's right here in my report.

2565
02:23:33,206 --> 02:23:36,042
We beat the pants off them.

2566
02:23:36,076 --> 02:23:38,544
Then how in hell do we justify to the public

2567
02:23:38,578 --> 02:23:40,981
sending hundreds of thousands more men?

2568
02:23:41,014 --> 02:23:42,782
We tell them this.

2569
02:23:42,815 --> 02:23:45,151
That we're within inches of victory.

2570
02:23:45,185 --> 02:23:46,686
Inches.

2571
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:49,489
45,000 killed, yes, General?

2572
02:23:49,522 --> 02:23:50,924
Yes, sir.

2573
02:23:50,957 --> 02:23:53,293
And three and a half times that
number are out of action?

2574
02:23:53,326 --> 02:23:54,995
It's in the report, Clark.

2575
02:23:55,028 --> 02:23:57,297
If there's 45,000 dead

2576
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:59,799
and three and a half times that number...

2577
02:23:59,832 --> 02:24:01,367
160,000.

2578
02:24:01,401 --> 02:24:06,907
157,500 wounded, plus 45,000 dead...

2579
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:11,878
General, according to you
and General Westmoreland,

2580
02:24:11,912 --> 02:24:17,183
we have killed and wounded
120% of the enemy.

2581
02:24:22,788 --> 02:24:25,858
It's becoming more and more evident

2582
02:24:25,892 --> 02:24:28,628
that an out-and-out
military victory

2583
02:24:28,661 --> 02:24:33,066
cannot be achieved with any strategy.

2584
02:24:33,099 --> 02:24:36,469
So, these are my recommendations.

2585
02:24:36,502 --> 02:24:41,374
Send Westmoreland only those forces

2586
02:24:41,407 --> 02:24:44,244
that will satisfy his immediate needs.

2587
02:24:44,277 --> 02:24:46,479
Wheeler has agreed to 22,000

2588
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:48,581
plus the units previously approved

2589
02:24:48,614 --> 02:24:50,716
and already scheduled for deployment.

2590
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:53,153
This would stave off immediate defeat

2591
02:24:53,186 --> 02:24:56,022
while we move to negotiations.

2592
02:24:56,056 --> 02:24:59,825
We realize that the settlement
will not be favorable for Saigon,

2593
02:24:59,859 --> 02:25:02,395
and they would fight it.

2594
02:25:02,428 --> 02:25:05,298
The bombing.

2595
02:25:05,331 --> 02:25:08,734
Wheeler, the other chiefs and Walt Rostow

2596
02:25:08,768 --> 02:25:11,804
all advocate hitting the remaining targets

2597
02:25:11,837 --> 02:25:13,339
in Hanoi and Haiphong

2598
02:25:13,373 --> 02:25:15,741
and mining and bombing the harbors.

2599
02:25:15,775 --> 02:25:18,344
With the support of everyone else,

2600
02:25:18,378 --> 02:25:20,680
I recommend a bombing halt.

2601
02:25:20,713 --> 02:25:24,350
I told you, I'm not gonna stop the bombing.

2602
02:25:24,384 --> 02:25:26,219
It keeps the lead out of our boys.

2603
02:25:26,252 --> 02:25:28,388
There's little evidence
to support that, sir,

2604
02:25:28,421 --> 02:25:31,624
and the bombing is going to be
the single greatest issue

2605
02:25:31,657 --> 02:25:33,293
in the presidential campaign.

2606
02:25:33,326 --> 02:25:36,929
The perception is evolving out there

2607
02:25:36,963 --> 02:25:39,732
that Eugene McCarthy is the peace candidate,

2608
02:25:39,765 --> 02:25:42,969
and you are the war candidate.

2609
02:25:43,003 --> 02:25:46,439
If McCarthy has a good
showing in New Hampshire,

2610
02:25:46,472 --> 02:25:48,508
I think Bobby will throw his hat in.

2611
02:25:48,541 --> 02:25:51,444
But he can't beat you if you're
sitting at the peace table.

2612
02:25:51,477 --> 02:25:53,113
Peace table!

2613
02:25:53,146 --> 02:25:54,747
Sell out South Vietnam?

2614
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,616
This is your advice?

2615
02:25:56,649 --> 02:26:00,020
If I could lay a plan
to win the war before...

2616
02:26:00,053 --> 02:26:01,421
I gotta go on TV in three weeks

2617
02:26:01,454 --> 02:26:03,723
and explain all this to the American people!

2618
02:26:03,756 --> 02:26:06,226
And you're telling me to
cut and run, admit defeat.

2619
02:26:06,259 --> 02:26:08,995
That 20,000 American boys
have died for nothing!

2620
02:26:09,029 --> 02:26:11,998
That 20,000 American mothers
weep for nothing!

2621
02:26:12,032 --> 02:26:14,334
The situation has changed since Tet.

2622
02:26:14,367 --> 02:26:16,602
Yes, it has!
Tet was a failure!

2623
02:26:16,636 --> 02:26:18,238
The enemy has failed to overrun us.

2624
02:26:18,271 --> 02:26:20,240
We are poised to win,

2625
02:26:20,273 --> 02:26:21,841
and now it's only you and your people

2626
02:26:21,874 --> 02:26:24,277
who are advising against
the extra effort it'll take

2627
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:27,513
to turn three years of
miserable war into victory!

2628
02:26:27,547 --> 02:26:31,017
And I'm telling you there is
no victory to be had!

2629
02:26:31,051 --> 02:26:33,986
Not without measures that'll
tear this country apart

2630
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:35,688
and bring down this administration!

2631
02:26:35,721 --> 02:26:38,491
I told you to get out of Vietnam
three years ago, Lyndon...

2632
02:26:38,524 --> 02:26:40,793
What about two years ago, and one?

2633
02:26:40,826 --> 02:26:42,628
You shot down every bombing pause,

2634
02:26:42,662 --> 02:26:44,197
backed every troop increase!

2635
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:45,631
Don't you dare!

2636
02:26:45,665 --> 02:26:47,133
Excuse me, Mr. President!

2637
02:26:47,167 --> 02:26:49,635
My counsel has not deviated one whit!

2638
02:26:49,669 --> 02:26:52,738
My every word, then as now,

2639
02:26:52,772 --> 02:26:55,275
has been informed solely by my commitment

2640
02:26:55,308 --> 02:26:57,277
to preserve your presidency

2641
02:26:57,310 --> 02:27:00,113
and establish your place in
this country's history!

2642
02:27:00,146 --> 02:27:02,715
I should have cleaned house November '63.

2643
02:27:02,748 --> 02:27:04,250
Got rid of all of 'em.

2644
02:27:04,284 --> 02:27:06,986
McNamara, Bundy, Connally.

2645
02:27:07,019 --> 02:27:09,822
Warned me those fucking Kennedy lovers

2646
02:27:09,855 --> 02:27:11,624
would be disloyal to me!

2647
02:27:11,657 --> 02:27:13,693
All of 'em!

2648
02:27:21,267 --> 02:27:26,139
They all may have
advised you, Mr. President.

2649
02:27:26,172 --> 02:27:30,042
You decided.

2650
02:27:30,076 --> 02:27:33,246
Against all your natural instincts.

2651
02:27:33,279 --> 02:27:36,682
Against the whole of your life experience.

2652
02:27:38,884 --> 02:27:40,986
You decided.

2653
02:27:45,525 --> 02:27:49,061
Man, on TV: Senator Eugene
McCarthy, a dove on Vietnam,

2654
02:27:49,095 --> 02:27:52,732
who was virtually unknown to voters
of this state two months ago,

2655
02:27:52,765 --> 02:27:54,434
has finished in a virtual tie

2656
02:27:54,467 --> 02:27:56,345
with the sitting President
of the United States,

2657
02:27:56,369 --> 02:27:58,304
Lyndon Johnson.

2658
02:27:58,338 --> 02:28:00,740
Since polls taken only a week ago

2659
02:28:00,773 --> 02:28:03,376
predicted Johnson would win
two-thirds of the vote

2660
02:28:03,409 --> 02:28:05,345
and McCarthy only 11%,

2661
02:28:05,378 --> 02:28:07,380
the senator's surprisingly high turnout

2662
02:28:07,413 --> 02:28:08,948
has shocked the country.

2663
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:12,452
I run because it is now unmistakably clear

2664
02:28:12,485 --> 02:28:17,457
that we can change these
disastrous, divisive policies

2665
02:28:17,490 --> 02:28:21,561
only by changing the men who
are now making them.

2666
02:28:21,594 --> 02:28:26,031
I run because I am convinced
that this country

2667
02:28:26,065 --> 02:28:28,201
is on a perilous course

2668
02:28:28,234 --> 02:28:32,037
and because I have such strong feelings

2669
02:28:32,071 --> 02:28:34,174
about what must be done,

2670
02:28:34,207 --> 02:28:38,444
and I feel that I am obliged
to do all that I can.

2671
02:28:38,478 --> 02:28:40,580
I was there.

2672
02:28:40,613 --> 02:28:42,758
I was there when you told your
brother to go into that place.

2673
02:28:42,782 --> 02:28:44,150
I was there.

2674
02:28:44,184 --> 02:28:45,818
And now I'm paying for it,

2675
02:28:45,851 --> 02:28:49,989
day after day after day
while you cut me to pieces!

2676
02:28:50,022 --> 02:28:54,660
There's blood on your hands, you traitor!

2677
02:28:54,694 --> 02:28:56,162
Our troops are being killed

2678
02:28:56,196 --> 02:28:59,365
by the bullets and the mines of the south.

2679
02:28:59,399 --> 02:29:01,167
If by ending the bombing of the north

2680
02:29:01,201 --> 02:29:03,369
we can bring peace to South Vietnam,

2681
02:29:03,403 --> 02:29:06,906
then we will save the lives of
thousands of our young men

2682
02:29:06,939 --> 02:29:09,609
and thousands of Vietnamese.

2683
02:29:27,427 --> 02:29:29,529
Yes, Mr. President?

2684
02:29:29,562 --> 02:29:32,131
I talked to Mills.

2685
02:29:32,164 --> 02:29:34,767
He won't back a war surtax

2686
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:37,837
unless we go on TV and announce deep cuts.

2687
02:29:37,870 --> 02:29:39,605
I want you to go up there

2688
02:29:39,639 --> 02:29:41,741
and talk to everybody at Ways and Means.

2689
02:29:41,774 --> 02:29:43,685
I'm meeting with five of them
in the morning, sir.

2690
02:29:43,709 --> 02:29:46,346
Take Ackley up with you
to back up the numbers.

2691
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:48,690
They don't believe anything
out of the White House anymore.

2692
02:29:48,714 --> 02:29:50,616
It's a good idea.

2693
02:29:50,650 --> 02:29:51,884
Anything else,
Mr. President?

2694
02:29:51,917 --> 02:29:53,853
I...

2695
02:29:58,057 --> 02:29:59,692
Are you all right,
Mr. President?

2696
02:30:02,395 --> 02:30:05,164
I'm all right, Joe.

2697
02:30:10,470 --> 02:30:12,071
Joe?

2698
02:30:14,707 --> 02:30:18,344
Senator Kennedy's speech,
who wrote it for him?

2699
02:30:21,414 --> 02:30:23,383
This guy Walinsky on his staff's

2700
02:30:23,416 --> 02:30:24,626
been writing a lot of his stuff.

2701
02:30:24,650 --> 02:30:28,388
I don't know.
Maybe Schlesinger, Sorensen.

2702
02:30:28,421 --> 02:30:29,689
Goodwin.

2703
02:30:29,722 --> 02:30:34,760
I think he was involved, yes.

2704
02:30:36,462 --> 02:30:38,364
All right, Joe.
Thanks.

2705
02:30:38,398 --> 02:30:40,433
Yes, sir.

2706
02:30:48,073 --> 02:30:50,410
Dr. King, on TV: I could
never again raise my voice

2707
02:30:50,443 --> 02:30:53,346
against the violence of
the oppressed in the ghettos

2708
02:30:53,379 --> 02:30:55,748
without having spoken first clearly

2709
02:30:55,781 --> 02:30:59,151
to the greatest purveyor
of violence in the world today:

2710
02:30:59,184 --> 02:31:01,387
My own government.

2711
02:31:09,629 --> 02:31:11,931
How many kids did you kill today?

2712
02:31:11,964 --> 02:31:17,370
Hey, hey, LBJ! How many kids
did you kill today?

2713
02:31:17,403 --> 02:31:19,147
Man, on TV: The largest
antiwar demonstration yet

2714
02:31:19,171 --> 02:31:21,140
brought hundreds of thousands of protesters

2715
02:31:21,173 --> 02:31:23,309
into the streets of American cities.

2716
02:31:23,343 --> 02:31:26,679
The radicals say that since peaceful
demonstrations won't end the war,

2717
02:31:26,712 --> 02:31:29,749
they're ready to move
from protest to resistance.

2718
02:31:29,782 --> 02:31:32,785
With talk of full-scale
rebellion sweeping the country

2719
02:31:32,818 --> 02:31:34,854
from college campuses to the inner cities,

2720
02:31:34,887 --> 02:31:36,856
the mood is turning ugly,

2721
02:31:36,889 --> 02:31:38,458
and there's a dangerous sense

2722
02:31:38,491 --> 02:31:40,025
that the nation's political life

2723
02:31:40,059 --> 02:31:41,427
is spinning out of control.

2724
02:31:41,461 --> 02:31:44,063
For it seems now more certain than ever

2725
02:31:44,096 --> 02:31:46,399
that the bloody experience of Vietnam

2726
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,568
is to end in a stalemate.

2727
02:31:48,601 --> 02:31:51,236
This summer's almost certain standoff

2728
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:54,940
will either end in real
give-and-take negotiations

2729
02:31:54,974 --> 02:31:57,309
or terrible escalation.

2730
02:31:57,343 --> 02:32:00,413
But it is increasingly clear
to this reporter

2731
02:32:00,446 --> 02:32:03,383
that the only rational way out, then,

2732
02:32:03,416 --> 02:32:05,017
will be to negotiate.

2733
02:32:05,050 --> 02:32:08,354
Not as victors, but as an honorable people

2734
02:32:08,388 --> 02:32:11,424
who lived up to their pledge
to defend democracy

2735
02:32:11,457 --> 02:32:14,193
and did the best they could.

2736
02:32:14,226 --> 02:32:16,662
This is Walter Cronkite.
Good night.

2737
02:33:25,465 --> 02:33:28,768
Well, say what you think.

2738
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:32,905
All right.

2739
02:33:32,938 --> 02:33:34,139
It's tough.

2740
02:33:34,173 --> 02:33:35,775
And effective.

2741
02:33:35,808 --> 02:33:41,447
But the music in it
is sad and sour to the ear.

2742
02:33:41,481 --> 02:33:43,616
And I don't know that any speechwriter

2743
02:33:43,649 --> 02:33:45,718
could have made it sing.

2744
02:33:47,987 --> 02:33:50,590
I got a hundred bills in committee.

2745
02:33:50,623 --> 02:33:53,092
They'll never see the light of day.

2746
02:33:53,125 --> 02:33:55,427
But I think I can pass a thousand bills.

2747
02:33:55,461 --> 02:33:57,296
More education, more health care,

2748
02:33:57,329 --> 02:33:58,864
more rights.

2749
02:33:58,898 --> 02:34:00,900
But it wouldn't matter.

2750
02:34:00,933 --> 02:34:03,268
'Cause it seems nothing I say,
no matter how I say it,

2751
02:34:03,302 --> 02:34:06,639
could ever bring this country
together again.

2752
02:34:08,173 --> 02:34:12,645
Then perhaps eloquence of speech

2753
02:34:12,678 --> 02:34:14,680
is no longer the answer,

2754
02:34:14,714 --> 02:34:16,782
but eloquence of action.

2755
02:34:26,526 --> 02:34:27,993
Mr. Secretary.

2756
02:34:28,027 --> 02:34:29,304
Would you be kind enough to make sure

2757
02:34:29,328 --> 02:34:31,564
that the president sees that this evening?

2758
02:34:31,597 --> 02:34:33,666
- Clark.
- Lady Bird.

2759
02:34:33,699 --> 02:34:37,202
I promised that he'd have those
budget figures by the end of the day.

2760
02:34:37,236 --> 02:34:38,938
He's right inside.

2761
02:34:38,971 --> 02:34:41,741
No, no, I won't disturb him.

2762
02:34:41,774 --> 02:34:43,208
Thank you. Good night.

2763
02:34:43,242 --> 02:34:45,277
Clark.

2764
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:49,248
Clark, I...

2765
02:34:49,281 --> 02:34:52,151
I got the speech here.

2766
02:34:52,184 --> 02:34:55,821
I need your help with it.

2767
02:34:55,855 --> 02:34:58,624
You know that I'm at your
service, Mr. President.

2768
02:34:58,658 --> 02:35:00,292
I know, old friend.

2769
02:35:58,951 --> 02:36:02,154
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

2770
02:36:02,187 --> 02:36:04,456
Tonight, I want to speak to you

2771
02:36:04,489 --> 02:36:08,661
of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

2772
02:36:08,694 --> 02:36:11,330
We are prepared to move immediately

2773
02:36:11,363 --> 02:36:14,133
towards peace through negotiations.

2774
02:36:14,166 --> 02:36:17,569
We are reducing, substantially reducing,

2775
02:36:17,603 --> 02:36:19,739
the present level of hostilities,

2776
02:36:19,772 --> 02:36:24,376
and we are doing so unilaterally
and at once.

2777
02:36:24,409 --> 02:36:30,549
Tonight, I have ordered our
aircraft and our naval vessels

2778
02:36:30,582 --> 02:36:34,286
to make no more attacks on North Vietnam

2779
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:38,357
except in the area north of
the demilitarized zone

2780
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:40,926
where the continuing enemy buildup

2781
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:44,664
directly threatens allied forward positions.

2782
02:36:44,697 --> 02:36:48,167
The area in which we are
stopping our attacks

2783
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:52,805
includes almost 90% of
North Vietnam's population

2784
02:36:52,838 --> 02:36:54,707
and most of its territory.

2785
02:36:54,740 --> 02:36:58,043
Our purpose in this action

2786
02:36:58,077 --> 02:37:00,045
is to bring about a reduction

2787
02:37:00,079 --> 02:37:02,815
in the level of violence that now exists.

2788
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:06,719
It is to save the lives of brave men

2789
02:37:06,752 --> 02:37:09,789
and to save the lives of
innocent women and children.

2790
02:37:09,822 --> 02:37:13,392
Now, as in the past,

2791
02:37:13,425 --> 02:37:16,929
the United States is ready
to send its representatives

2792
02:37:16,962 --> 02:37:19,932
in any forum at any time

2793
02:37:19,965 --> 02:37:25,938
to discuss the means of bringing
this ugly war to an end.

2794
02:37:25,971 --> 02:37:31,243
There is a division
in the American house now.

2795
02:37:31,276 --> 02:37:34,179
There is divisiveness among us all tonight.

2796
02:37:34,213 --> 02:37:38,283
With America's sons in the fields far away,

2797
02:37:38,317 --> 02:37:42,788
with America's future under
challenge right here at home,

2798
02:37:42,822 --> 02:37:46,325
with our hopes and the world's
hopes for peace

2799
02:37:46,358 --> 02:37:49,061
in the balance every day,

2800
02:37:49,094 --> 02:37:51,463
I do not believe that I should

2801
02:37:51,496 --> 02:37:54,099
devote an hour or a day of my time

2802
02:37:54,133 --> 02:37:57,703
to any personal partisan causes

2803
02:37:57,737 --> 02:38:02,607
or to any duties other than the
awesome duties of this office,

2804
02:38:02,641 --> 02:38:05,544
the presidency of your country.

2805
02:38:07,747 --> 02:38:11,516
Accordingly, I shall not seek,

2806
02:38:11,550 --> 02:38:13,452
and I will not accept,

2807
02:38:13,485 --> 02:38:16,088
the nomination of my party

2808
02:38:16,121 --> 02:38:21,193
for another term as your president.

2809
02:38:24,964 --> 02:38:28,433
But let men everywhere know, however,

2810
02:38:28,467 --> 02:38:31,103
that a strong and a confident

2811
02:38:31,136 --> 02:38:34,439
and a vigilant America stands ready tonight

2812
02:38:34,473 --> 02:38:36,441
to seek an honorable peace

2813
02:38:36,475 --> 02:38:38,577
and stands ready tonight

2814
02:38:38,610 --> 02:38:40,579
to defend an honored cause,

2815
02:38:40,612 --> 02:38:44,016
whatever the price, whatever the burden,

2816
02:38:44,049 --> 02:38:49,321
whatever the sacrifice that
duty may require.

2817
02:38:49,354 --> 02:38:52,324
Thank you for listening.

2818
02:38:52,357 --> 02:38:56,829
Good night, and God bless you all.
