1
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,451
-I'm sorry!
-Oh, my God! That's it!

2
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:19,809
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,815
You have no respect
for my privacy?

4
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,530
-Rachel, wait!
-No, you wait!

5
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:24,965
Can I just say one thing?

6
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:26,086
What?! What?

7
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:29,447
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your. . .

8
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,130
. . .nippular area.

00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:38,160
The One With the Boobies

00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,069
Honey, honey. . .

12
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:27,827
. . .tell them the story about
your patient. . .

13
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,227
. . .who thinks things are
other things.

14
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,469
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower. . . .

15
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,827
That's pretty much it.

16
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:40,463
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

17
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:41,617
Thanks.

18
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:45,420
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

19
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,258
Okay. I'll miss you.

20
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:50,259
Isn't he great?

21
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:52,733
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

22
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:53,852
I know. I know.

23
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,935
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

24
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,252
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky. You know?

25
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,376
Think you'll do it on his couch?

26
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:05,257
I don't know. That's a little weird.

27
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:06,816
It's vinyl. . . .

28
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,528
You guys want anything else?

29
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,207
-Could I have--
-We're all out.

30
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:15,642
Anybody else?

31
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,325
Did I miss something?

32
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:21,604
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

33
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,204
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

34
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,245
It was an accident.

35
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:30,408
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

36
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,798
Can we change the subject, please?

37
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,995
Because, hello? These aren't her
''boobies. '' These are her breasts.

38
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,442
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

39
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,833
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

40
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,196
''Nice''?

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,635
They were ''nice''?

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,519
That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice. ''

43
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,789
Rock, hard place. . .

44
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:57,793
. . .me.

45
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,424
You're so funny!

46
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,591
He's really funny!

47
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:11,548
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

48
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,670
Back up there, sparky.

49
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,064
What did you mean by that?

50
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,021
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues. . .

51
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,903
. . .that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

52
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,064
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

53
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,859
Only child, right?

54
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:36,413
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

55
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:39,977
How did you know?

56
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,729
It's textbook.

57
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:45,847
Hey, you guys.

58
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,577
You all know my dad, right?

59
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,373
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.

60
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:51,611
I got a job midtown.

61
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,006
I'm better off
staying with the kid. . .

62
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,365
. . .than going back and forth
on the ferry.

63
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:57,649
I don't know this one.

64
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,930
This is my friend Roger.

65
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,691
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

66
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:04,605
What happened to the puppet guy?

67
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,607
Dad!

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,165
Excuse me.

69
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,360
So, Ross, how's the wife?

70
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,161
0 for 2, huh?

71
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,963
Chandler, quick,
say something funny!

72
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,162
Gotta go.

73
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:28,357
I miss you too.

74
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,592
I love you,
but it's getting late now--

75
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,399
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma!

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,155
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

77
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:38,347
Excuse me?

78
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,195
Did you know this isn't Ma?

79
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:52,982
Her name's Ronni.

80
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,030
She's a pet mortician.

81
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,144
Sure.

82
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,139
So how long have you been. . . .

83
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:10,465
Remember when you were a kid, we'd
go see the big ships in the navy yard?

84
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:11,615
Since then?

85
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,340
No, it's only been six years.

86
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:16,136
I wanted to give you
a nice memory. . .

87
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,455
. . .so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

88
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,251
Joe, have you ever been in love?

89
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:26,889
I don't know.

90
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,937
Then you haven't.

91
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,971
You're burning your tomatoes.

92
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:32,366
You're one to talk.

93
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,727
Your dad's in love, bigtime.

94
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,608
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

95
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:42,766
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

96
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,810
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

97
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,647
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out. . .

98
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,883
. . .your dad was
leading this double life.

99
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:02,920
He's like actually some spy
working for the CIA.

100
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:04,752
That'd be cool!

101
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:06,917
This blows!

102
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:11,834
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

103
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,912
Why do they
have to become people?

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,991
Why do they have--

105
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,514
Why. . .

106
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,749
. . .can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

107
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,105
What?

108
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:28,510
What?

109
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,948
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

110
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,512
We're all adults here.

111
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:36,386
There's only one way
to resolve this.

112
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,071
Since you saw her boobies. . .

113
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,705
. . .you're gonna have to show her
your pee-pee.

114
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,095
You know,
I don't see that happening.

115
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,495
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

116
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:02,571
Well I'm not showing you my tat!

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,889
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

118
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,213
Come on up.

119
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:14,296
Oh, good! Rog is here!

120
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:18,533
-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

121
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,493
I hate that guy!

122
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:24,604
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

123
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,650
Come on, he's not that bad.

124
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,525
That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her. . .

125
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,450
. . .if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

126
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,683
I don't know.

127
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,567
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

128
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,677
Why? Why would I?
Why?

129
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,319
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

130
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:52,879
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.

131
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,276
Wait!
Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

132
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,080
Well, I don't know.

133
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,316
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage. . .

134
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:06,028
. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

135
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:13,344
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

136
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:18,587
-So you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

137
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,946
That's not what I was saying.

138
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,106
I thought you were on my side. . .

139
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,580
. . .but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .

140
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:27,858
. . .so they'd favor you.

141
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,377
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

142
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,260
You're right.

143
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:37,858
I mean, you're right!

144
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,693
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace. . .

145
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:46,458
. . .and the Weeble's Cruise Ship. . .

146
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:50,455
. . .which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

147
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,371
That's tough, tough stuff.

148
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:56,855
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

149
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,652
Feel better, okay?

150
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,653
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

151
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,493
Thanks for everything, Mon.

152
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:03,565
No problem.

153
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,606
It was great seeing you again.

154
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,966
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

155
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:13,247
Remember, they're just food. . .

156
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:14,810
. . .they're not love.

157
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:20,641
I hate that guy!

158
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,400
Good night, you guys.

159
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,839
Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.

160
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:36,991
Can we help you?

161
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,349
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

162
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,152
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

163
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,832
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

164
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:48,026
Oh, my God!

165
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,797
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

166
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,787
I'm Ronni.

167
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:58,862
Cheese nip?

168
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,223
Joey's having an embolism. . .

169
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:05,025
. . .but I'd go for a nip.

170
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:14,743
Most people,
when their pets pass on. . .

171
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,547
. . .want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

172
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:20,782
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

173
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:23,624
Like chasing their tail.

174
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,454
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

175
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,818
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

176
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,092
That's a good one!

177
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,778
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

178
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:41,256
Hello, babe!

179
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,291
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,128
You left your hair
at my place.

181
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:49,649
I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.

182
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:53,368
Thank you.

183
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,766
So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

184
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,117
Look, I. . . .

185
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,921
I shouldn't have come.

186
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,476
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

187
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,677
I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

188
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,603
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?

189
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:14,758
We'll go to a hotel.

190
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:16,992
We'll go to a hotel.

191
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:20,393
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

192
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,400
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,433
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

194
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,231
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

195
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,234
Right, mister!

196
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:32,038
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .

197
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,585
. . .you're gonna live by my rules.

198
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,827
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

199
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:43,987
Wow, he's strict.

200
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,621
Dad, you'll be in my room.

201
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,749
Ronni, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

202
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,260
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

203
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,425
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

204
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,782
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''

205
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:06,101
This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

206
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,732
-Six years is long enough!
-What kind of change?

207
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:10,859
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

208
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,615
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

209
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,734
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

210
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:31,767
Hey, kickie!

211
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:35,202
What are you doing?

212
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:36,771
Trying to get comfortable.

213
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,764
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

214
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:47,556
I've been thinking. . .

215
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,958
. . .about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls. . . .

216
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,956
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

217
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,401
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

218
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:03,361
I always figured, when
the right one comes along. . .

219
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,758
. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.

220
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,269
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--

221
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,788
You're not him, you're you.

222
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:16,346
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

223
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,024
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

224
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,189
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

225
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,666
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along. . .

226
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,702
. . .you'll have the guts to say:

227
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,264
''No thanks, I'm married. ''

228
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:38,937
You really think so?

229
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,176
I really do.

230
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,939
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

231
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,336
May I help you?

232
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,495
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

233
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:04,134
Who are you?

234
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:07,531
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

235
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:08,652
The mistress?

236
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,372
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

237
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,451
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

238
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:16,563
Say, Ronni. . . .

239
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,928
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

240
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,850
Like five minutes.

241
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,125
Perfect.

242
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,762
Fasten your seat belts. . .

243
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:28,526
. . .it's pee-pee time!

244
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,514
Hey, Mr. Trib.

245
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,359
Good morning, dear.

246
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:42,912
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

247
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:57,469
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

248
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:01,226
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing!

249
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,514
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

250
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,906
How's it going?

251
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,026
Good.

252
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,422
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,582
What's going on?

254
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:25,895
Nothing.

255
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,694
It's just that. . . .

256
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:29,694
It's Roger.

257
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,577
There's something about--

258
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,935
Basically, we just feel
that he's. . . .

259
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:36,171
We hate that guy!

260
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,576
We hate him!

261
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,260
We're sorry, Pheebs.

262
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,137
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive. . .

263
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,936
. . .that it freaked you out?

264
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,856
-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!

265
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:49,172
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,523
Ma! What are you doing here?

267
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,687
I came to give you this. . .

268
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,124
. . .and this!

269
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,768
Big ring!

270
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,922
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

271
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,681
. . .about making things right?

272
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:17,076
Things were fine the way they were!

273
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:19,885
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

274
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,883
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.

275
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:26,720
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:29,197
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

277
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,716
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,712
You should have heard
his cover stories.

279
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,109
''I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's. ''

280
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,508
I mean, what is that?
Please!

281
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,509
So then, how could you--?

282
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:43,105
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

283
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:47,394
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

284
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:51,183
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:52,865
Now he's happy.

286
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,580
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

287
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,267
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but. . .

288
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,101
. . .what the hell
are you saying?

289
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:07,580
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

290
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,500
Look, honey. . .

291
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,856
. . .in an ideal world. . .

292
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:15,181
. . .there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

293
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:19,054
And I'll tell you something else:

294
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:22,492
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along. . .

295
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,858
. . .he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

296
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,855
He's been more loving.

297
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,487
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

298
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:34,007
I'm happy for you. . .?

299
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:35,365
Well, don't be!

300
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,172
Because now everything's screwed up.

301
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:43,686
I just want it the way it was.

302
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,685
Ma, I'm sorry.

303
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,241
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

304
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:54,243
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

305
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,440
So tell me. . . .

306
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:00,835
Did you see her?

307
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,758
You're ten times prettier
than she is.

308
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,237
That's sweet.

309
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,196
Could I take her?

310
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,036
With this ring, no contest!

311
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,188
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing. . . .

312
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,835
What's wrong? Come on.

313
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,186
It's nothing. I'm fine.

314
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,271
It's just--
It's my friends.

315
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:35,073
They have a liking problem with you. . .

316
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:36,461
. . .in that. . .

317
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,030
. . .they don't.

318
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,624
They don't?

319
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,823
But you know. . .

320
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:47,741
. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

321
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,343
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

322
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,064
They think you're a little. . . .

323
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:54,781
What?

324
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:56,133
Intense and creepy.

325
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,650
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

326
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,930
I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

327
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,448
You're not?
That's why you're so great.

328
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,854
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .

329
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:16,090
. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

330
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,810
You know, this kind of codependent. . .

331
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:20,613
. . .emotionally stunted. . .

332
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:25,809
. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups. . .

333
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:29,249
. . .which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

334
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,928
And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

335
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,801
Love me! I need love! ''

336
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,805
So you talked to your dad?

337
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,918
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

338
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:46,639
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know.

339
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,523
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore. . .

340
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,719
. . .because he got
a restraining order.

341
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,992
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

342
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,628
Things have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

343
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:02,833
So Joey, are you okay?

344
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,506
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,907
It's just--
You know, they're parents.

346
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,989
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

347
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,794
Even if you know better. . .

348
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,383
. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

349
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:15,582
And just think. . .

350
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,829
. . .in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

351
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,391
Oh, please!

352
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:22,589
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .

353
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,224
. . .chasing after 20-year-old boys. . .

354
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,187
. . .or I'll end up like my mom!

355
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,574
How's it going?

356
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,940
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

357
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,893
Yeah, right!

358
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:45,617
What happened?

359
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,376
I don't know. I mean. . . .

360
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,013
He's a good person. . .

361
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,056
. . .and he can be really sweet.

362
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:55,411
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

363
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:56,612
It's just. . . .

364
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:57,972
I hate that guy!

365
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:08,607
What's going on?

366
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,366
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

367
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,329
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

368
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,683
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

369
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,362
Sorry, wrong boobies!

370
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,110
Hello, Joey!

371
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,749
Hello, dear!
