00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,469
{y:i} Mr. Drug Dealer

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,674
{y:i} In 1975
There was this chick named Janet

105
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,420
{y:i} A pregnant heroin addict
Who said she didn't plan it

106
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,840
{y:i} So never thought to stop
Or ever kick the habit

107
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,336
{y:i} Cos Kirby let her do it
And she knew he always had it

108
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,460
{y:i} Down in the cellar with Trevor
Another addict

109
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,052
{y:i} Who was at it like an asthmatic
Trapped in an attic

110
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,630
{y:i} Suckin' on an asthma pump

111
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,594
{y:i} Though you'd never know
By looking at him that's the cunt

112
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,635
{y:i} Who by 1983 was in the National Front

113
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,128
{y:i} He had a shaved head
But still got mashed on drugs

114
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,673
{y:i} So Kirby didn't mind him
Hangin' round that much

115
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,086
{y:i} Especially any time Janet
Came around to fuck

116
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,677
{y:i} Get her fix while her kid, Chris
Waited around

117
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,590
'A nine-year-old boy
Who was healthy and loud

118
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,170
{y:i} Considering when she was pregnant
She was smoking the brown

119
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,590
{y:i} She was lucky that he wasn't born
Disabled or Down's.

120
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,011
{y:i} Still, when you're too loud
You get a clap round your head

121
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,378
{y:i} Kirby ain't his dad
But he does what he says

122
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,548
{y:i} Stays downstairs
in the cellar with Trev

123
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,216
{y:i} While Kirby's upstairs
Giving Janet her meds

124
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,256
{y:i} At least that's what they told Chris
Still he ain't that dumb

125
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,844
{y:i} He knows Kirby's upstairs
Bangin' his mum

126
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,837
{y:i} While he's left in the basement
With some racist cunt

127
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,633
{y:i} Who's been waiting round for ever
For the motherfuckin' day to come

128
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,460
{y:i} What an environment to raise a kid

129
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,927
{y:i} Round crack dealers' houses
And racist pricks

130
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,420
{y:i} Trevor looted the place
As well as maiming Chris

131
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,673
{y:i} Left a permanent scar on his face
The same as his

132
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,669
{y:i} With a razor blade
Yeah, it takes the piss

133
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,086
Whether you're prejudiced or not
Man, he's just a kid

134
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,291
{y:i} But that's what Trevor done
No one ever saw him after that

135
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,045
{y:i} Six years pass now
Kirby's cookin' up the crack

136
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,044
{y:i} It's the new drug
Everybody's going crazy for

137
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,386
{y:i} 1989 the year Chris
started selling draw

138
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,379
{y:i} Picking up from Kirby
Scar there beneath his eye

139
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,798
{y:i} You'd think that after everything
That's happened he would treat him right

140
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,794
{y:i} Not par him off
With just another ounce of weed

141
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,261
{y:i} Cos a quarter of the bag
Is a bunch of fuckin' seeds

142
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,628
{y:i} Hundreds of 'em
And twigs the size of fuckin' trees

143
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,378
{y:i} But if he ever moaned
He'd get a slap across his cheek

144
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,673
{y:i} 1990 is the year that
really took its toll

145
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,292
{y:i} Cos that's the year his mother Janet
Took an overdose of heroin and died

146
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,090
{y:i} God rest her tortured soul

147
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,506
{y:i} Now he's left to fend for himself
All by his own

148
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,551
{y:i} It's 1995
Now that he's older

149
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,386
{y:i} Stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as bolders

150
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,127
{y:i} But he hides it from his olders

151
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,924
{y:i} He's been living on the far side
Since he was a yoot

152
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,501
{y:i} But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he did in the past

153
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,549
{y:i} Cos he's made his way out
From sellin' ounces to bars of weed

154
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,261
{y:i} Out in the streets
Where people do their nasty deeds

155
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,254
{y:i} He sees they're making money
So he wants a larger piece.. {y:i}

156
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:14,006
You fuckin' little cunt!
What do you think you're doing? Hey?

157
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,048
That's our bread and butter,
that is!

158
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,879
Take that. Here you are.
Go on. Fuck off!

159
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,340
It's all there.
And I've canned it an' all.

160
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,926
So, where was you last night?

161
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,215
I was groaning my fuckin' tits off!

162
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,880
Hurry up. He's getting the gear.

163
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,760
Get off me!

164
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,628
You're under arrest for the possession
of class-A drugs.

165
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,969
You do not have to say anything,
but it may..

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,094
Come on, Kirbs. Time to go.

167
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,385
Kirby!

168
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:46,089
Who's that?

169
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,343
He's in the back.

170
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,423
Let's sort it out.

171
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,381
- All right, Chris?
- What's goin', Kirbs?

172
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,049
- I've come for my stuff, bruv.
- Yeah. Cool, brother.

173
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,386
- You got it, yeah?
- Of course I've got it.

174
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,136
- You all right?
- Yeah, good. I always am, ain't I?

175
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,877
Always good.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,844
- Just put it down on the table.
- No, take it, bruv. Count it!

177
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,507
I don't touch money no more.
Put it down on the table.

178
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,260
You're too big for money now?

179
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,969
All right. So, come on, man.
I've gotta go.

180
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,632
Turn my back for five minutes, innit?
Cheers.

181
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,004
Hey! Just.. Cool.

182
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,755
Chris, what are you doin', man?
Don't fuck about with me. Give me my gear.

183
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,673
There it is! There it is! Oi!

184
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,798
Bruv, just give me my gear,
will ya?

185
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,261
- I thought you was in a rush, bruv-
- I am in a rush!

186
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,676
Listen. Listen, my friend.

187
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,422
I've been away a little while
and before I went away,

188
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,260
carrying the can for everyone,

189
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,960
I had people like you running round
selling twigs and seeds for me.

190
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,667
Do you remember runnin' round
with little batty boy and them?

191
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,635
Think!

192
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,833
Right, when I had you
running around for me, right,

193
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,926
did I take the fuckin' piss?

194
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,672
You might have been sellin' twigs
and seeds, but I still looked after you.

195
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,801
- Now give me the fuckin'..
- You cunt!

196
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,794
Kirby, just relax!

197
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,590
- Get the fuck..
- Kirby, relax!

198
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,669
- Get the fuck off me!
- Relax yourself!

199
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:37,126
- Get off me! You fucking little cunt!
- Just relax yourself!

200
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,880
Listen! Give me my fuckin' gear!
Let go of my fuckin' head!

201
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,209
- Give me my gear! I've got shit to do!
- Relax yourself!

202
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,052
Get off me, you cunt!
You're hurting my neck!

203
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,919
- Oh!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

204
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,919
Here you are, Kirbs!

205
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,919
- My fucking neck!
- Oh!

206
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,669
You fucking wanker!

207
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,795
- Kirby..
- What's wrong with ya?

208
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,835
Hey?

209
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,135
Funny, innit?

210
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,505
You'll be laughing the other side
of your fuckin' ugly mush.. soon enough.

211
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,968
Yeah?

212
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,297
Look what you've done to my glasses,
you cunt! I'm shaking like a fuckin' leaf!

213
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,465
'Yea“ funny, innit

214
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,886
- Oh!
- You're a cunt.

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,343
See ya later, Kirbs.

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,673
Marcel, come on, bruv..

217
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,299
Every fuckin' time, man.

218
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,136
- Wait.
- Where's the dough, bruv?

219
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,843
- I don't know.
- Hurry up.

220
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,585
I'll sort it, bruv. I'll sort it.

221
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,174
Come on, man.
I'll sort it out for you next time.

222
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,260
Where's the dough?
Where's the money?

223
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,084
Why you makin' me beg
every time I want my shit, man? Fuck!

224
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,587
- Remember you owe me money, yeah?
- I'll sort it out for you next time.

225
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,840
You! Come!
Fuck off, you! Fuck off!

226
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,212
Get over there!
What have I fucking told you?

227
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,758
What the fuck have I told you
about selling shit on my turf?

228
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,593
How many times have I got to tell ya?

229
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,261
Now get your fuckin' clothes off.
Get 'em off!

230
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,093
I can't take my clothes off, man.

231
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,382
Get your fucking clothes off!

232
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,380
What's wrong? Don't you understand
English or something? You little cunt!

233
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,968
Now get 'em off!

234
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,627
Get the fucking things off!

235
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,170
Pussy Clark, you.

236
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:37,760
That's it.

237
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,920
Come on. Get your boxers off.
Get 'em off!

238
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,010
Do it, man!
I wanna see your knob!

239
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,340
Is that what you fuckin' call it?
You cunt!

240
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,508
Go on. Fuck off! FUCK OFF! Go!

241
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,502
What's wrong with you?

242
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,676
Wanker!

243
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,926
Go on!

244
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,210
<i>Adios!</i>

245
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,584
'The mobile number
you have called may be switched off.'

246
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,796
How long you gonna
keep me in here for?

247
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,760
Open the door!

248
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,294
Open the fuckin' door!

249
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,960
You can't keep me in here this long!

250
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,758
Oi, mate, will you please shut up?
You haven't stopped all fucking day!

251
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:41,005
Who the fuck are you, cunt, eh?
I'll out your fuckin' throat, man!

252
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,843
Ooooh!

253
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,552
What you don't believe me?
I'm out of Brixton.

254
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,795
I'm out of fucking south-

255
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,339
Ooooh!

256
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,586
What, you making noises
now, yeah?

257
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,783
Is that all you can do?
Make fuckin' noises!

258
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:55,922
Make the noise again, cunt!
Go on!

259
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,129
Yeah, see. You fucking won't, will ya?
You know the-

260
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,002
Oooooh!

261
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,469
All right, that's it.
See, when I get out-

262
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,961
I'm gonna wait for you, mate.

263
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,962
Didn't your mummy and daddy
love you when you was a kid?

264
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,506
Are you
some fucking philosophiser, mate?

265
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,050
Siftin' here?
That's why you're so angry, mate!

266
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,667
Who are you talking to, mate?
Carry on, cunt! Go on!

267
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,669
Your mother was a prostitute!

268
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,545
Listen to me! Oi, fucking listen!

269
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,635
Open this fucking door!

270
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:33,922
Hey!
That's why no one fucking loves ya, mate.

271
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:38,798
Shut up! You fucking cunt!
I swear I'll get you.

272
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,461
Who do you send
the Father's Day card to?

273
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,005
You don't know him, do ya?

274
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,219
No one likes you!
No one loves you!

275
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,050
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!

276
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,754
Huh? Well, bell me when you
fucking see him then, innit, bruv?

277
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,253
Can you put your phone down?
We need to speak to you.

278
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,752
Oh, fuck's sake!

279
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,882
- All right..
- Put your phone down, please.

280
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,835
What?

281
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,131
- Hands out of your pockets.
- Don't fucking touch me!

282
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,218
Stop swearing and take your hands
out of your pockets.

283
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,335
I will tell you when we're done, OK?

284
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,211
- Hey, what's going on?
- Do you know this person?

285
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,382
- Yeah, I do. What's he done wrong?
- It's a routine check, OK?

286
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,674
- I ain't done nothing.
- Aaron, just shut up, all right?

287
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,377
And who are you exactly?

288
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,344
My name's Jo Lloyd.
I work in social care for the council.

289
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,381
And I used to be his social worker.

290
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,215
It looks like it's your lucky night.

291
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,132
Maybe your social worker
can teach you some manners.

292
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,672
Yeah.. Fucking pigs!

293
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,386
- Oi! Can you just shut up?
- What?

294
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,504
I'm standing here, making a fucking
phone call, minding my own business..

295
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,334
- They start harassing me for no reason.
- Yeah, all right. They've gone now.

296
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,926
What you doing here, anyway?

297
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,843
You were meant to be
meeting me today.

298
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,585
Oh, shit!

299
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:16,467
Some madness happened. I've been
sorting it. I've been stressed. Sorry.

300
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,837
Forget about it. That came for ya.

301
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,260
I don't want that.

302
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,762
You don't have to open it now, do you?
Just take it.

303
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,253
- I don't wanna open it ever.
- Please. Just take it.

304
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,173
One day you might feel differently.

305
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,010
Humour me. Take it.

306
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,172
Thank you.

307
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,511
Anyway, stay out of trouble, yeah?

308
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:44,342
Oh, and.. take that hat off. And maybe
the old bill will leave you alone.

309
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,843
Yeah, I doubt it.

310
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,552
- Fuck!

311
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,465
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,948

313
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,336

314
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,462
What the fuck are them lot doin'?

315
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,210

316
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,928
They charge you?

317
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,504
Nah. Still kept me overnight.
What's this?

318
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,378
- Just a little piece, innit?
- Where's the rest?

319
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,344
Back at the spot.
I ain't gonna fuckin' walk around with it.

320
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,759
- Let's fuckin' blitz, bruv. Got my phone?
- Nah, I'm getting' it now.

321
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,511
- What do you mean you're getting it now?
- Huh?

322
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,050
- Where's my phone, bruv?
- I let Kirby use it to make a call, innit?

323
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,510
So it's at Kirby's house?

324
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,003
Some crackhead
must have took it out of the house.

325
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,174
- Some crackhead took it out the house?
- Yeah. I know who she is.

326
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:42,216
I ask you to do one fucking thing for me
and you lost my phone?

327
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,542
- Just use my phone and-
- Why am I gonna use your phone, hm?

328
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,092
How are my cats gonna call your phone
when they don't know your number?

329
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,256
Kirby's bellin' me now. Yeah?

330
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,551
Yeah. Is it definitely her?

331
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,210
What's goin' on?

332
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,169
She better be there
when I come down.

333
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,797
What the fuck is going on, bruv?!

334
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,386
Safe. Bruv, it's there.
Shall we go and sort it out?

335
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,468
She's got my phone?
On her right now?

336
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,176
- Yeah, let's go!

337
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,879
- What have I fucking done to you?
- Don't fucking talk to me, bruv!

338
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,298
Don't fucking talk to me!

339
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,093
Like a half hour.

340
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,676
Look at all these fuckers.

341
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,760
We go back a week early
and they're all chillin', like..

342
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,343
- Oi, Jody..

343
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,256
- How old are you?
- 15. Why?

344
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,629
- One more year till I can fuck you then.
- Fuck off, man!

345
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,752
Fuck, man.

346
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,969
- Safe, man.
- All right. Cool, yeah?

347
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,799
- You get the dough?
- Yeah. It's my mum's.

348
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,294
I feel bad, innit?

349
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,834
- I told you I'll pay you back later.
- But how are you gonna to get the money?

350
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,926
I told you. I'll just rob someone, innit?

351
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,174
What if you don't find anyone?
My mum will be angry if I can't-

352
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:26,294
- Wanna get some weed or not?
- Yeah!

353
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,966
Well, then trust me, innit?
I'll only be a minute!

354
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,590
- You change your clothes?
- No.

355
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,216
Yes, you did. You was wearin'
the Black King tracksuit earlier.

356
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,470
I spilt something on it.
What's the problem?

357
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,631
I can't change my clothes.

358
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,003
- What did you spill on it?
- Nurishment.

359
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,172
Safe, man.

360
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:45,216
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Can't see I'm talking? You dickhead!

361
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,586
- What do you want?
- I want some weed.

362
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,840
Does it look like
a man's blotting over here?

363
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,461
Come on, man.
Why are you always darkin' me for?

364
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,881
- Where's the money?
- It's here, man.

365
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,760
What?

366
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,673
I want some weed, man.

367
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,261
- What weed?
- So why did you take the £20 then?

368
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,093
What £20? I didn't see no £20.

369
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,551
Hey, get off me, man!

370
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,967
He's a yoot, man. He's gonna start crying.
Give him a chance, man.

371
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,006
Allow me, man.
I just want my weed, man.

372
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,469
Allow it, man. Come on, man.

373
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,836
- All right. You want some weed, yeah?
- Yeah.

374
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,631
- You want weed?
- Yeah.

375
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,085
Where's your..?

376
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,301
Is he your 9'-IV?

377
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:40,341
Your guy over there.
Your guy with the beat-up Astroturfs.

378
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,667
That's not my friend, man.
That's not my guy.

379
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:47,383
I got him to steal the money from his mum
so I could pick up the draw, innit?

380
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,047
- So he's not your guy, no?
- No.

381
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,049
Go over there and smash him in
and I'll give you your weed.

382
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,961
He-he's not your guy. Go on. Do it.

383
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,510
Man, I can't do that, man.

384
00:24:56,625 --> 00:25:00,550
Bruv, he's done told you! Go smack
him up and you'll get your shit, man!

385
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,839
So you gonna do it?

386
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,795
Get the fuck out of here,

387
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:13,046

Cos you roll with man like that!
What the fuck do you think this is?

389
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,965
Just allow it, bruv. Look at him, man.

390
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,962
- Nah, man. He's been coming around..
- Come on, bruv. Look.

391
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,460
He's baitin' me up, bruv.

392
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,969
You got bait. Fucking bait..

393
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,302
Let's be honest now.
You lot, shut up, man.

394
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,676
<i>Hey-</i>

395
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,510
Have you got the weed?

396
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,085
Ooh!

397
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,670
'Bang him in the back!'

398
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,426
Bang him, man!

399
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,797
He's still runnin'! He's still runnin'!

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,502
You lot are hard.

401
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,879
That's what I'm talkin' about, bruv.
That's how we move.

402
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,088
Come on, man. Let's talk!
Yo, now you're rollin' with me, yeah?

403
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,627
April, come here.

404
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,382
- We gotta change these clothes, though.
- Why?

405
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,379
They're not working.
They're too bright. You stand out.

406
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,052
See why I'm always in black?
People can't pick me out.

407
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,802
Don't worry, man.
We're gonna go shoppin'.

408
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:46,251
Get you some new garms,
go to the shops and get you some pussy.

409
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,672
You feel me?

00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,798
{y:i} Playing with fire.. {y:i}

420
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,134

00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,260
Nah, fuck that, bruv.

423
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,961
Oi, what did you do with that girl.
Did you fuck her?

424
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,426
What girl?

425
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,385

'Look in the camera!'

Please, man..

437
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:25,001
You think you can pick up drugs off me,
long me off and go to someone else?

438
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,968
Where the fuck is my money?

00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,460
{y:i} So quick if you wear the wrong shoes
You'll slip

446
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,130
{y:i} Better keep up with the tempo
With the click

447
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,968
{y:i} Cos they on some sick shit, bruv

448
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,336
{y:i} Kidnapping wannabe rich-kid thugs

449
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:56,259
{y:i} And no doubt now Jake's only mission
Is to better his position in Marcel's gang

450
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,128
{y:i} It's a competition
To a little man with a disposition

451
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,138
{y:i} Holier than thou
he was born a Christian

452
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,050
All he worships now
is the nihilism

453
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,670
{y:i} Wise men will tell you
That with age comes wisdom

454
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,170
{y:i} And you can't be saved by religion
Unless you have faith

455
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:11,136
{y:i} So it makes no difference to the
youths That are raised in the system

456
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,254
{y:i} Who don't have age on their side
Or any positive role models in their lives

457
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,673
{y:i} That provide insight
So they ain't gonna listen

458
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:19,382
{y:i} As for Jake
He's already made his decision

459
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,586
{y:i} Now he's just another poster boy
For David Cameron's Broken Britain {y:i}

460
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,921
Shut up! Don't speak back!

461
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,844
You pussyhole!

462
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,426
Man up, fam!

463
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,711
Fuckin' pussyhole! Look at him!

464
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,130
Oi, come on. Let him have a drink.
His cousin's coming to bring the money.

465
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,459
Where's your fuckin' heart?
He's been here for fuckin' two days!

466
00:30:55,917 --> 00:31:00,718
It's fuckin' piss!
You fuckin' bitch! You fucking..

467
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,260
That's what I'm sayin'!

468
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,676
All right, all right!

469
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,044
{y:i} Playing with fire

470
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,670
{y:i} It doesn't burn

471
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:24,091
{y:i} The first time your hand

472
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,094
{y:i} Warm to the flame

473
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,677
{y:i} Playing with fire

474
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,178
{y:i} Bitter and sweet, oh, no

475
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:41,051
{y:i} Scorching skin now

476
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,002
{y:i} Hell on its way

477
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,004
{y:i} You're playing with
You're playing with fire.. {y:i}

478
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,672
Oi! Come here!

479
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:51,386
{y:i} It doesn't burn

480
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,468
{y:i} The first.. {y:i}

481
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,210
Sit down here, you.

482
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,340
Right, where you been?

483
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,465
- I've been round your house.
- In my house?

484
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,506
- Yeah.
- And where were you going to?

485
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,674
To get you that bio-carbonate stuff,
so you can wash your stuff.

486
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,552
- You ain't got it yet?
- So you can clean your stuff, man.

487
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,385
So you've cleaned the house, yeah?

488
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,049
Is that Michelle still there, is she?
Or did she go?

489
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,716
Erm.. She left after you.

490
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,343
Did she?

491
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:24,258
I don't trust her, though.
I think there's something about that girl.

492
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,382
What do you mean? What's wrong
with her? No one trusts you, do they?

493
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,676
No one trusts you!

494
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,511
You're a crackhead. She's crackhead.
No one trusts 'em.

495
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,878
And you're a smackhead crackhead
like her.

496
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,002
You're both like two peas in a pod.

497
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,674
So just leave her alone.
She's a good shag, anyway.

498
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,458
And you ain't, are ya?
Well, you're not, are ya?

499
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,132
Look at ya. You know where
the chemist is, don't ya?

500
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,506
- It's down the road.
- You're not with it, are ya?

501
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,172
- Yeah-
- Get a fucking grip!

502
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:53,011
What have you got to ask for?
Know what you're picking up?

503
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,049
- Bio-carbonate-
- Bio? Bio..

504
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,966
Bio-carbonate of soda,
so you can wash your stuff.

505
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,335
I'm just gonna fetch that.

506
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:04,042
"Bicarbonate" of soda. If you can't
even say it, how are you gonna get it?

507
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:07,137
You'd come back with washing powder,
wouldn't ya?

508
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,799
Bio-carb.. Bicarb soda.

509
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:16,589
I don't want any detergent, all right?

510
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:23,425
I want a simple thing, bicarbonate of soda!
It comes in a little fucking tin like that!

511
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:27,797
Not in a big box like that
with "Daz" written on it, or whatever!

512
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,253
OK? And if you don't fucking
sort it out..

513
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,924
Listen! It's no good
fucking laughing. Prick!

514
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,965
It's no good laughing!

515
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,420
You want another fix,
what you gonna fucking do?

516
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,136
- I'm clucking, Kirby.
- Get the fuck out of here!

517
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,003
Look, just drink your tea
and pick up what I want.

518
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,968
<i>- Bi..
- I'll get it!</i>

519
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,177
Carbonate.. of.. soda.

520
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,635
All right.

521
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,677
I don't want that.
He's breathed all over it.

522
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,344
Did you tell her we were here?

523
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,131
Obviously, bruv. She's my friend.

524
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,711
I'm goin', cos me and her
don't talk like that.

525
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,594
- Oi, don't go, man. Don't go.
- No, I can't be bothered.

526
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,260
Oi, what about your food, bro?

527
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,085
- Thank you.
- Who ordered this?

528
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,382
- She did.
- Just eat it, man. Don't worry about it.

529
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,968
Er, excuse me?

530
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,551
Oi, do I know you?

531
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,010
- No.
- Nah.

532
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,002
- You look familiar.
- Really?

533
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,295
You know what they say
about a familiar face.

534
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,714
What do they say?

535
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:34,709
They say they're the most beautiful people
in the world. Like models and all that.

536
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,298
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Thought of doin' any modeling?

537
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,465
- Nah.
- Why not? You've got the legs for it.

538
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,460
- You think so?
- Yeah! I know so!

539
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,666
And you have.
You'd be a win double, wouldn't ya?

540
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,510
Oh, that sounds nice!

541
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,627
- Yeah, my mate would like you.
- Oh, yeah?

542
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,085
Who's your mate?

543
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,337
Er, his name's Nigel.
He works for.. a modeling agency.

544
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,131
You gotta meet him.

545
00:34:56,458 --> 00:35:00,042
Harvey, got a pen and a piece of paper,
mate, please? That's my number.

546
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,083
- Don't give it out to anyone, all right?
- OK.

547
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,835
- You promise?
- Promise.

548
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,711
You'll be in trouble if you do..
Nah, only joking!

549
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,214
All right, see ya later.

550
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,676
- Promise?
- Promise.

551
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,510
You can't break a promise, you know.

552
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,301
Ooh, very nice.

553
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,947
Is that the bitch who
stole my phone, bruv?

554
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,500
Yeah, that's her.

555
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:41,710
It's warm right now. The feds are doin'
rounds up and down. Let me deal with it.

556
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:48,462
- Where the fuck is my boy's phone, huh?
- What phone?

557
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,666
Don't fucking "what phone?" me.
I saw you at fucking Kirby's.

558
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,796
You was there just before me.
Where the fuck is it? Bring it out.

559
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,796
- I mean, what type of phone?
- How many phones you rob today?

560
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,172
Had my shit out on the table.

561
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,216
When I put it back in my bag,
I must have picked it up by mistake.

562
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,631
- Where the fuck is it now?
- At my mate's house.

563
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:07,382
- Where?
- Just round the corner!

564
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,629
- All right! I'll take you now!
- Yeah! Come on then. Now!

565
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:18,044
Oi! What you fuckin' doin' up there?

566
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:23,011
Oi! What the fuck
are you doing up there?

567
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,334
- Paul, can I have the fucking phone?
- I ain't got it, mate.

568
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,677
Give me that phone!
Sit the fuck down, bruv.

569
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,339
Sit down, you cunt!

570
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,085
What the fuck you playin' at, huh?

571
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,427
- I put it in there!
- It ain't in there now, is it?

572
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,419
- Checked them downstairs?
- No.

573
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,260
Come on then!
What are you playin at?

574
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,966
My boy's a mad boy, you know!
I can't control him!

575
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,677
What's goin' on, bruv?
What the fuck is goin' on, bruv?

576
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,171
Start runnin' their pockets, innit?
Bring out a fuckin' silver phone!

577
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,091
- What the fuck is goin' on?
- I'm gettin' your phone back.

578
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,042
Come here!
You're getting my phone back, are ya, huh?

579
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,127
Sit the fuck down!

580
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,676
- I know someone.
- Oh, now you know!

581
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,419
Fuck that!

582
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,379
- She says she knows someone, all right?
- Oi, stand up!

583
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,636
Come on. Move that way.

584
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,635
Are you up for it?

585
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,177
Bruv, are you gonna let her
do this for you?

586
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:24,546
This was her idea.
How else is she gonna pay me back?

587
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,090
She's a fucking crackwhore, bruv.
Are you blind?

588
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,551
- I'm just sayin'.
- What?

589
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,680
Just sayin' we ain't
lickin' shots out here.

590
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:32,717
We're prostituting out a girl.

591
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,673
- Let's go.
- Yeah? Come.

592
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,386
Yeah? We'll just leave now
and you can pay me back.

593
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,969
You can have a grand for me
by tomorrow, yeah?

594
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,380
We'll do that then, yeah?

595
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,173
Oh, fuckin' hell!

596
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,378
He's not interested.
Let's just go somewhere else.

597
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,298
That dirty cunt's not interested?

598
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:55,091
- He's not up for it.
- Are you fuckin' mad?

599
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,673
What's the matter, boss?

600
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,176
You're not interested?

601
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,135
- What, she's no good?
- It's too much.

602
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,089
How much you got?

603
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,676
£20?

604
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,426
Fuck it. Give it to me.

605
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,676
Cunt.

606
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,131
Fuckin' cheapskate cunt!

607
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,176
- He's waitin' for ya.
- But he just said..

608
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,135
Get the fuck in there!

609
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,551
Fuckin' score, bruv!

610
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:41,004
Don't tell me you made her
go in there for 20 fucking pound?

611
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,923
That's all he was payin'. What?

612
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,966
{y:i} She was once a princess
But now she's a mess

613
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,635
{y:i} A fiend for a fix like the rest

614
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:01,212
{y:i} Soliciting sex from pocketless
But she was a sweet thing nevertheless

615
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,051
{y:i} Back in the day
Sexually abused as a child

616
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,676
{y:i} She was always likely to
End up this way

617
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,011
{y:i} The past lived
In the dark parts of her brain

618
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,219
{y:i} And only heroin was there
To take away the pain

619
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:13,213
{y:i} So she folded the foil and lit the
flame Inhale, exhale out once again

620
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,586
{y:i} She's on the game
They all know her face

621
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,965
{y:i} And the standard going rate
Just not her name

622
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,669
{y:i} With only herself to blame
She lives this hell

623
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,635
{y:i} But there's a million other girls
Just like Michelle

624
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,836
{y:i} Out in the streets
With nothin' else to sell

625
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:26,006
{y:i} To these desperate males
Other than themselves

626
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,002
{y:i} So it's no wonder
she's a thief to boot

627
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,298
{y:i} On a constant search
For things that she can loot

628
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,714
{y:i} What it's worth to her
And what it's worth to you

629
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,219
{y:i} And the other way round
Vice versa's true

630
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,301
{y:i} Cos she's an addict
And she's gotta support her habit

631
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,545
{y:i} And she'll resort
to all sorts of antics

632
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,169
{y:i} Thieving's an impulse
She's always at it

633
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:43,296
{y:i} It's automatic
She spares no thought about it

634
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:47,672
{y:i} I've been dragging myself
To the lowest low

635
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:49,544
{y:i} For such a while

636
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,544
{y:i} I just don't know

637
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,715
{y:i} That the path I take

638
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,673
{y:i} Is somethin' I can change

639
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,883
{y:i} But what gets in my way
Is the deepest shame

640
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,044
{y:i} Is the deepest shame.. {y:i}

641
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,677
What do you think of that, boss?
You like it?

642
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,339
Yeah. How much?

643
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,802
- £20.
- No, that's too expensive.

644
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,129
You know what? Fuck it.
£10 and a kebab, yeah?

645
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,923
Bring her through, man.

646
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,385
Come here!

647
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,715
What's the matter?
Are you shy now, hm?

648
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,502
Get the fuck in there, man!

649
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,674
Where's my money, man?
Take her through, man.

650
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,047
Where's the money, boss?

651
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,468
And where's my kebab?

652
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,256
Yo! Come through, bruv!

653
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:45,635
You hungry?

00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,169
- Eat up, bruv.
- Yeah, I'll eat.

655
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:50,635
What, man?

656
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,876
- You're gonna feed my friend, yeah?
- Give me a doner kebab, yeah?

657
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,670
- Doner kebab.
- Yeah. Chilli, mayo, a bit of onion.

658
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,255
Chilli, mayo and onions.

659
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,212
There's £800 here. There's meant
to be a grand. There's four of us.

660
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,676
There's five.

661
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,218
Jake!

662
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,085
- You've gotta be kiddin' me.
- Yeah.

663
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,718
Give that to them two.

664
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,086

667
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,631
You like how we roll, yeah?

00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,335
Yeah, definitely, man.

669
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,217
You see that P today?
That's nothing.

670
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,926
We make that every day.

671
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,635
More. Triple that.

672
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,006
You ready to roll, yeah?

673
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:38,044

Obviously, man. I'm down to ride in that.
No brainer, innit?

Yeah. So you're down, yeah?

Definitely, man.

678
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,968
Open the glove compartment.

679
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,006
Oh, that is somethin'.

680
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,465
Don't just stare at it. Pick it up.

681
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:02,926
Pick it up!

682
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,169
Hold that.

683
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,047
You feel that, yeah?

684
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,422
That's power.

685
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,877
You know who lives there?

686
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,381
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

687
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,510
I want you to do something. You on it?

688
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,840
On it, man. I'll do anything, man.

689
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:31,511
I'll just go in there
and give them the gun straight.

690
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,002
Give him the gun?

691
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:37,672
I want you to put a fucking bullet
in his head, not give him the gun!

692
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,210
Are you gonna do it?

693
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,382
I don't even know
if I'm gonna be able to do that.

694
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,344
What do you mean you dunno
if you're gonna be able to do that?

695
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,051
What the fuck do you think this is?

696
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,169
You think you can roll
round with me all day

697
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:58,636
and then when shit gets deep,
you wanna duck out?

698
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,712
What so you can run and tell
your pussyhole bredrens what I do?

699
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,344
You know what I'm about, bruv!
Yeah?

700
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,052
Go in there
and put a fuckin' bullet in his head,

701
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,670
or am I gonna have

702
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,544
That hurts.

703
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,340
I don't fuckin' care if it hurts!

704
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,541
Are you gonna do it?
Talk to me, bruv!

705
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,419

Don't worry about the food. Hurry up!

714
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,544
'Go in..

715
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,214
'Go in there..

716
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:20,592
'Go in there
and put a fuckin' bullet in his head!

717
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,385
'Bullet in his head.

718
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,301
'Or am I..

719
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:31,214
'Am I gonna to have
to fuckin' put one in you?'

720
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,093
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

721
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,877
For fuck's sake.

722
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,294
Oh, shit!

723
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,210
- Hello, girls!
- You all right?

724
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,927
Or should I say "ladies"? Look at you!

725
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:08,587
Yeah, go through.
Make yourself at home.

726
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,169
You got a nice place, don't ya?

727
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,841
- Have trouble geftin' here?
- No, not at all.

728
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:15,011
It's a bit dirty. I had
my mate clean it up.

729
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:17,088
We was partyin' last night.

730
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,926
Anyway, what can I get you to drink?

731
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,636
- I got.. I've got some vodka.
- I'll have a vodka.

732
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,632
- Do you want orange with it?
- Yeah, I'll have it with orange.

733
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,176
- And you? Vodka?
- Just water.

734
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:27,669
- Sure?
- Yeah.

735
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:30,386
I don't think I've got any ice.
Is that all right?

736
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

737
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,879
This guy's house, bruv.
I don't even wanna be here.

738
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,800
Look at this boozy gaff!
And you're telling me this is the guy?

739
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,295
This is the guy
that discovered Naomi Campbell?

740
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:45,466
He did not discover her. His bredren did.
What's wrong with you?

741
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,427
So you're tellin' me
his bredren's comin' here to see us?

742
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,544
- Why would he lie to us?
- Why would he lie?

743
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,170
Cos he's a fucking crackhead!
That's why he'd lie!

00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:44,251
Who the fuck are you talking to?
First, get your fucking hands of me.

892
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,548
Listen! Who's fucking holding
the money?

893
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:50,467
Not you! Yeah?
So whose money is it, hm?

894
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,258
Fuck her! She's a fucking crackwhore!
That's why she's in this mess, man!

895
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,677
- Get up! Get up!
- I didn't do anything!

896
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:59,211
- Lend it to me, innit?
- Lend this money to you?

897
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,051
If it's your money. That's fucked up!

898
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,840
Don't fucking move!

899
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,632
- You want me to lend this?
- That's your money.

900
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:08,678
Shut your fucking crying up!
Shut your crying up!

901
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:10,676
You're a fucking pussyhole!

902
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:14,126
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

903
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,627
- What the fuck!
- What?

904
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,052
- Take the money.
- I don't want no fucking money!

905
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:22,133
What if I wanna take her down a dark
alley and give her a fucking belting?

906
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,628
- What about that?
- She's dirty, bruv. Take it.

907
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,676
- Just take the money, yeah?
- You cunt!

908
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,135
Now, get UP-

909
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,673
Get up, get up, get up.

910
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,094
Yeah? Get the fuck out of here now.

911
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,635
Fucking pussy, man.

912
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:44,587
Any madness. Any given day
some next madness. You know that?

913
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,253
Why are you geftin' emotional, man?
Shut up.

914
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,672
Emotional?

915
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,837
You bring me here and do that shit
in front of me. Am I a dickhead?

916
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:57,256
You're some prick.
You're some pussyhole.

917
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:59,127
I'm a pussyhole
cos I'm not doing crack?

918
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,504
- Yeah.
- All right. Fuck it! Do your ting.

919
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,595
Do you wanna do it or not?
You ever done this before?

920
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:07,544
- Nah.
- All right. Just watch me, yeah?

921
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,710
Easy. Don't smoke it too fast.

922
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,469
Lift it up.
Don't tip the bloody rock out!

923
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,047
Did you get that?

924
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:27,294
It didn't kill me, did it?

925
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,926
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

926
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,670
Chanel! Chanel! Wake up, please!

927
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,381
No, please! No!

928
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:56,714
Yo.

929
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,670
Fucking hell!

930
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,548
Do you want some action?

931
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,420
- What you got on offer?
- I'm good for it, you know.

932
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:17,214
Bruv, you see that?

933
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:19,926
Bruv, you see that?

934
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,177
- Do you want me?
- How much?

935
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,794
- 50 quid.
- 50 quid?

936
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,798
We'll go round this corner.

937
00:57:58,417 --> 00:58:01,921
Bang it, bang it
Bump it, dump it, scorch it, torch it

938
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:03,840
Crash and burn it
Don't return it

939
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,131
Lost deposit, let 'em earn it
Who cares?

940
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,594
It's on the firm
It's a hire car, baby

941
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,051
Safe, dude.

942
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,215
- You all right?
- Course I'm fucking good.

943
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,218
Take those, will ya? Thank you.

944
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:38,669
All right, bruv. What you sayin'?

945
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:41,131
- What are you up to, then?
- Just jammin', innit?

946
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,629
Just jammin', yeah?
Not serving up gear in my pub?

947
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:48,292
- How am I serving up gear?
- What, you think I'm fucking stupid?

948
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,671
What, you're in and out of the toilet
like four times in ten minutes?

949
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:53,510
- I wasn't calling you stupid.
- No?

950
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,002
Search me. I'm not serving up.

951
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,802
Let's have a drink.
Let's talk about it.

952
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,968
I'm just giving my boy something..

953
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,090
Here's one I wrote
for a special occasion.

954
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,508
It's called 'Pity the Plight of Young
Fellows'. Do you wanna hear it?

955
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,669
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna hear it?

956
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,176
Yeah!

957
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,131
Pity the fate of young fellows

958
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:22,090
Too long a bed with no sleep

959
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,631
With their complex romantic attachments

960
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:27,052
Oh, look on their sorrows and weep

961
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,503
They don't get a moment's reflection

962
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:33,674
There's always a cloud in their eye

963
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:36,136
Pity the plight of young fellows

964
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,503
Regard all their worries and cry

965
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:42,341
Their Christian mothers were lazy perhaps

966
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,301
Leaving it up to the school

967
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:47,341
Where the moral perspective
Is hazy perhaps

968
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,211
And the climate oppressively cool

969
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,303
Give me one acre of cellos

970
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,636
Pitched at some distant regret

971
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,211
Pity the fate of young fellows

972
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,927
And their anxious attempts to forget

973
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,256
{y:i} These are the tears of a thug
Like murky water

974
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,798
{y:i} Crying tears as clear as mud
For his father's daughter

975
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,921
{y:i} His half-sister
He felt obliged to support her

976
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,423
{y:i} Since her mum was poor
And her dad died even poorer

977
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,544
{y:i} Separated until
she was eight years old

978
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:17,045
{y:i} He knew as soon as he saw her
That he adored her

979
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,960
{y:i} Now he's payin' for her blood
with a borer

980
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,131
{y:i} And an automatic weapon
Smith & Wesson

981
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,923
{y:i} Split a fucking hole in your chest

982
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:26,421
{y:i} He's looking to corner the
perpetrators Responsible for her killing

983
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,336
{y:i} He's gonna murder every single
fuckin' one of them, God willing

984
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:32,837
{y:i} It's eating him inside
Although you wouldn't be able to tell

985
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:34,960
{y:i} By just looking in his eyes
Cos his tears cry inwards

986
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,177
{y:i} Years of hiding his true feelings
From the streets

987
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:40,421
{y:i} Have left him incapable of showing
Any other emotion than anger

988
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:43,625
{y:i} So when Jody takes him
To Fat Mick's motors where Terry works

989
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:46,587
{y:i} He don't ask questions first
Just straight bangs up

990
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:50,046
{y:i} Mans with the butt of the gun
Turns it on Terry before he can run

991
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,965
{y:i} And demanding answers

992
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:55,337
{y:i} He knows Terry didn't kill Kirby
But he thinks he may have set him up

993
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:58,007
J' Why else would he have taken
The drugs afterwards?

994
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,298
{y:i} Terry tries to explain
They were already dead when he got there

995
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,670
{y:i} And the other girl, he can't remember
Her name but she was not there

996
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,302
{y:i} Not there when he came back
Was before he went out

997
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:08,671
{y:i} Chris stops him there
Arms stretched with the leng out

998
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:11,215
{y:i} He says, "I know about the other girl
How the fuck do you think I found you?"

999
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:14,174
{y:i} "And I know you're fuckin' lying
So say your prayers now"

1000
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:17,171
{y:i} You fucked with the wrong gangster
And now you've gotta pay

1001
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:20,045
J' That's when the blood-stained crackhead
He gun-butted on the way to Fat Mick's

1002
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:22,841
{y:i} Taps him on the shoulder
With a bust nose and fat lip

1003
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:25,045
{y:i} And says he knows
Who might have done it..

1004
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:28,171
I was geftin' a rock off Marcel
and I see Kirby behind the alley.

1005
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,885
Behind the barbershop in the alley.

1006
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,344
- What time?
- About midday. He pulled out a gun.

1007
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,586
He pulled out a gun! I
shit myself and I run!

1008
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,170
- You're lying!
- I'm not. I swear to God I'm not.

1009
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:38,885
I'm not. I swear to God.

1010
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,343
Get the fuck down!

1011
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,044
Fucking hell.

1012
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:48,132
- Fucking Marcel!
- Chris, it couldn't have been Marcel.

1013
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,503
How the fuck do you know
if it was Marcel or not?

1014
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,002
I met Marcel. I know him.

1015
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,633
- He's done my fucking nose, mate.
- Oh, fuckin' hell! Come on. Let's go.

1016
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:59,007
They guy who done it,
he was small. He was a kid.

1017
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:02,004
Fuck that! If he wasn't Marcel..
He's fucking involved!

1018
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:05,925
I'm not saying that. But he couldn't
have been the guy who pulled the trigger.

1019
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:09,672
The guy who done it, man,
he was a kid. He was small.

1020
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:13,042
- Couldn't have been much older than me.
- I'm gonna take you home.

1021
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:20,213
'Motion sickness. Cases have been
popping up all over since..'

1022
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,506
- Want anything from the shop?
- Nah, I'm good.

1023
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,422
What the fuck!

1024
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:40,091
- Who the fuck killed Kirby?
- I don't know who done it!

1025
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:42,051
Tell me or I'm gonna blow your head off!

1026
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:44,090
- It was Jake!
- Who the fuck's Jake?

1027
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:45,840
Some yoot, bruv. Some hyped yoot.

1028
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:49,132
- Why the fuck did he kill Kirby?
- Kirby must have boy'd him off, man.

1029
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,211
So why was you running down the road
naked the other day?

1030
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:56,212
I must have banged some yet
and her man come home. I had to duck.

1031
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,378
- I'll dead him if you want me to.
- You'll do what?

1032
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,628
- I'll kill him for you.
- I'll do that.

1033
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,301
- Yeah?
- All right.

1034
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:07,135
- Know where this boy's at?
- Yeah.

1035
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,594
- Have you got a ride?
- Yeah.

1036
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,551

1092
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:34,671
You done good, you know. Uh-huh.
You're a bad man now. Huh?

- I love you, man! Give me a chance!

1097
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:49,167
Look up to me properly!
Stop your fucking crying!

1098

a special occasion.

Plight of Young Fellows.

- Carol?
- Yeah, darlin'?

1109
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:48,719
I've only gone
and lost my fuckin' key, ain't I?

1110
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,378
Did ya? No, you didn't.
You left it in the door.

1111
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,922
- Did I?
- You did, yeah.

1112
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:56,467
Oh, thank God for that.
Oh, fuckin' hell!

1113
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:02,218
Listen, it's not half cold up there. Can
you drop an heater up to me or something?

1114
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:04,135
- Yeah, all right.
- Cheers.

1115
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:06,511

1121
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,548
- 10.15 in the house?
- Yeah?

1122

Approach with a cautious intent

1128

Take it or leave it in any event..

1129
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,132
Oh, bollocks! Yeah, it's karaoke, innit?

1130
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:02,510
Well, I'll be here then, won't I?

1131
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:06,421
Yeah, I'll have to be.
Listen, I gotta go, all right, babe?

1132
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:08,169
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

- Are You pluggin' drugs in my pub?
- Drugs?

1139
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,218
Come on! Don't take me for
a fuckin' idiot!

1140

I had one in here the other night
tellin' me he's not servin' up in my pub!

1141
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,504

Aaron and that other idiot, Ed.
Think I don't know what they're up to?

It ain't on, pal!

01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,549
{y:i} With the door unlocked
Ain't the smartest idea

1186
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,886
{y:i} When your runnings are illegal
And your cargo live in fear

1187
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,714
{y:i} Her path was now clear
But only for her exit

1188
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:07,383
{y:i} Cos although ahead was long
And full of unexpected twists and turns

1189
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,676
{y:i} She learned inadvertently how to cope
With life's little moments of uncertainty

1190
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,844
{y:i} Feelin' safe on the street
However absurd it seems

1191
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,928
{y:i} The mother and baby unit
Where she had disturbing dreams

1192
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:19,670
{y:i} Was the place she didn't
feel was safe And had to leave

1193
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,674
{y:i} It would only be a matter of time
before she had police asking her questions

1194
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,424
J' Finding out the truth
About her underworld connections

1195
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:29,126
{y:i} Sending her back to the brothel
Either that or simply just deporting her

1196
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,094
{y:i} She's met corrupted law before
She can't see them supporting her

1197
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,631
{y:i} So she goes along a road
That slowly starts destroying her

1198
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,632
{y:i} Not knowing where she's going
Or why God just keeps ignoring her {y:i}

1199
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:09,085
How much?

1200
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,676
50.

1201
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,835
Fuckin' 50?

1202
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,468
Fuckin' brassin' with a baby?

1203
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:23,211
Here you are. 40 notes.

1204
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,667
Why don't you buy the little fucker
a dummy or something? Shut it up!

1205
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,426
Fuckin' disgusting!

1206
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:54,256
Who the fuck are you?

1207
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,219
You're one of them illegal immigrants,
ain't ya?

1208
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:49,839
It's OK. Oh!

1209
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,677
Come here. It's OK.

1210
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,671
Yeah. It's OK.

1211
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:19,010
What's the baby's name?

1212
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,673
No name.

1213
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,879
Poor kid. She ain't got a hope in hell.

1214
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,051
What the fuck are you doin'?

1215
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,465
Oh, God!

1216
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,127
Were my eyes open?

1217
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:08,676
Are you going somewhere?

1218
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,051
Paddington.

1219
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:12,760
I'll take ya.

1220
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,218
I've got the tickets, all right?

1221
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:32,051
Look, I just need you to wait here
for two minutes. I'll be right back, OK?

1222
01:20:58,458 --> 01:20:59,710
It's her!

1223
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,840
{y:i} I'm still waiting for the sign

1224
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:48,835

1225
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:52,926

Oi, mister! Follow that car!

Oh, fuck!

1239
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:18,885
No problem, mate.

01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:36,460
Get those fucking bitches out of here!

1241
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,711
Come here, you fucking..

1242
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:44,260
You're fucking history!

Go!

1247
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,176
Ed!

1248
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:45,093
What the fuck is that?

1249
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:48,882
- It's a baby, innit?
- What, you stole someone's baby?

1250
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,843
Bruv, some woman left it on a train.

1251
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:52,835
And you're bringin' it here to me?

1252
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:56,545
Look, bruv, it's more complicated
than that, yeah?

1253
01:25:58,417 --> 01:26:00,636
Where the fuck did you get that? Hm?

1254
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,506
- Well, I found it, innit?
- Where?

1255
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,968
I just found it.

1256
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,882
Just like that, yeah?
So why you bringin' it to me then?

1257
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,334
I'm on the fuckin' train with the piece.
I got the reload on me, like.

1258
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,211
About 20 feds with sniffer dogs
pop out of nowhere.

1259
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:17,509
I fuckin' had to dash it somewhere.
I hid it in the pram with the baby, innit?

1260
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,753
- What, you hid it with the baby?
- Yeah, innit?

1261
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:24,296
That's the smartest thing you've done
in your dickhead life! What now?

1262
01:26:24,417 --> 01:26:28,047
What you gonna do with this?
Give it to the feds?

1263
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:30,010
- I can't give it to the feds.
- Why not?

1264
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,752
I popped past the feds with it once.

1265
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:34,261
Am I gonna go back
like I fuckin' changed my mind?

1266
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:36,503
I'll look like a paedo.

1267
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:40,675
Well, call social services then.
What? Hm?

1268
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:45,549
Nah, if we do that,
they're gonna put it in a home, innit?

1269
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,669
- So what?
- Nah, that's not the one, bruv.

1270
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,676
- We grew up in homes, man.
- Exactly.

1271
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,343
Exactly what, bruv?

1272
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:54,541
Some woman's just abandoned
her yoot on a train!

1273
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:56,840
And she obviously don't want it, man.

1274
01:26:57,417 --> 01:27:00,500
Bruv.. what the fuck is that smell?

1275
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:04,257
Hm? What the fuck is that smell, bruv?
It's disgusting, man!

1276
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,673
I'll have to change
its fuckin' nappies now!

1277
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:12,508
Give me the gun while you do that.
Let me look after it for you, innit?

1278
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:14,593
Is it? You gonna help me find its mum?

1279
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:18,376
Nah. I've got better things to do
with my time than run around like that.

1280
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,002
But you carryin' that, bruv..

1281
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,095
Just give me the gun
and I'll hide it somewhere for you, innit?

1282
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:27,127
Nah, it's all right. I'm gonna hold it.

1283
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,469
You don't want no help?
You're a prick, bruv.

1284
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,877
Come. Give me the tings.

1285
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,593
H S 7 h O..

1286
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,504
- Don't tell me you put it in there!
- I had to hide it somewhere!

1287
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,719
What you puttin' it in there for, man?

1288
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,636
Take it then!

1289
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,210
You'd better clean that.

1290
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:56,666
You're a prick, bruv.
When you're done fuckin' about, yeah..

1291
01:27:56,833 --> 01:28:00,588

1293
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:05,301

1294
01:28:05,417 --> 01:28:07,044

1295
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,210
Oh, for..

You take the piss. You know that? Oh!

1297
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,343
You laughin' at?

1298
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:42,215
Oh, man! Allow it.

1299
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,343
- I'm not even on it.

1300
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:48,090

Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,923

01:28:58,042 --> 01:28:59,385
Dickheads!

1305
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,173
Come with me, Jody. I need your help.

1306
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,215
- Can Ashley come?
- Nah.

1307
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:06,086
- All right. I'll call you later. Bye.

1308
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,551
Come here.

1309
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:09,590
They always fuckin' try it. Always.

1310
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:16,591
We're smashed in here, Jody.
I'll see you in a bit, yeah?

1311
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,843
- Oi..
- Yeah?

1312
01:29:20,417 --> 01:29:22,135
You're not gonna find her, you know.

1313
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:58,260
Yeah?

1314
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:01,387
'You still fuckin' about
tryin' to find that yoot's mum?'

1315
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:03,385
- Yeah.
- 'I've sorted it, man.

1316
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,300
'Come see me down the Essex, innit?
Bring the yoot with you, yeah?'

1317
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,045
I'm a bit nervous to be honest, love.

1318
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:13,046
What you got to be nervous about?
We'll sort this out.

1319
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:15,841
- How much is in there?
- It don't matter, does it?

1320
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,551
Come on.

1321
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:21,422
- I don't know. How old is she?
- I haven't got a clue, honey.

1322
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:24,261
All right? Thanks, darlin'.

1323
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,969
Oh, my God! She's lovely!

1324
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:28,926
- What's goin' on?
- She's gorgeous!

1325
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,012
- Come through, bruv.
- Take that, man. Take that.

1326
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:33,672
- Bruv..
- It's cool, man. Cool.

1327
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:36,962
- You want this mess sorted out, yeah?
- Yeah.

1328
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,835
Well, I was speaking to Vince..

1329
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:41,586
- She's lovely!
- And Carol can't have kids.

1330
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,719
That's a kid whose mother
doesn't want it, bruv.

1331
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:48,219
She does, man. Problem solved.

1332
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,093
What is this, bruv?

1333
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,176
What the fuck do you think
is in there?

1334
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:58,127
What the fuck you doin', bruv?

1335
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,423
Fuck that, bruv.
That's not your baby, man.

1336
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:02,340
Don't worry! Don't worry!

1337
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,756
- Bruv, that's not your baby.
- Come on, bruv!

1338
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,840
What the fuck is the matter
with you, man?

1339
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:09,336
Don't worry, darlin'.
Just give us a minute, yeah?

1340
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:13,417
- What you actin' like a little bitch for?
- Who the fuck are you, bruv, Jeremy Kyle?

1341
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:14,885
- What, you shook?
- Nah.

1342
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,379
- Think this is coming back to you?
- You can't give someone's baby away!

1343
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,548
And to fucking Vince and Carol?
Are you mad?

1344
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:23,591
We were fuckin' sellin' crackwhores
to him the other day!

1345
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,669
She's gonna look after it, not him.

1346
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:28,378
Can you see it over there, man?
She's gonna be lovin'.

1347
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,719
- See her fuss over it?
- That's not the real mum!

1348
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,673
Where is the real mum, hm?

1349
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,424
- Where's the real mum, bruv?
- I'm fuckin' lookin'!

1350
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:38,011
You been lookin' for her.
Have you found her yet, hm?

1351
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:41,208
Nah, bruv, you ain't found her
cos she don't wanna be found, man.

1352
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,756
Be real. She's gone.
She ain't coming back, bruv.

1353
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,885
So we've got two options now, yeah?

1354
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,678
Either we let them take this now, yeah?
Or we call social services.

1355
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,297
You wanna call social services?

1356
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:56,421
And they'll go and give this baby
to some other Vince and Carol.

1357
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:01,125
- Nah, man.
- What difference is it gonna make to us?

1358
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,968
Hm? To us?

1359
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,551
Apart from this.

1360
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:08,378
- I can't fuckin' take that, bruv.
- Open it up, bruv.

1361
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,593
Do you see that, bruv?

1362
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,669
This is so fucked up! You know that?

1363
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:19,916
Bruv, there's four grand there. Each.

1364
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,843
Yeah?

1365
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,006
- Come.
- Get off me, bruv.

1366
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:39,173
- Fuckin' hell.
- I told you I'd sort it, man.

1367
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:41,511
What am I gonna say to everybody?

1368
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:45,300
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Don't worry about that yet. Hello!

1369
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:47,590
Everythin' all right, yeah?
Is he all right?

1370
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:50,967
- Yeah, he's all right. All right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1371
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,502
Fuck!

1372
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:20,710
Fuck!

1373
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,628
- Where's my bag?
- What bag? What you talkin' about?

1374
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,301
My bag with my stuff in it!

1375
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:41,215
Look at the place! It's a shithole.

1376
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:44,386
- What you doin'?
- Just geftin' my stuff!

1377
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,173
You ain't got anything?

1378
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:49,546
I've got a little you can have,
but don't tell anyone we were here!

1379
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:51,260
- No, of course not.
- Here.

1380
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:55,261
All right, boss? £10 electric, yeah?

1381
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:03,338
You're gonna have half of that
and you give me the rest back.

1382
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:04,835
- Of course!
- Michelle!

1383
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:07,131
- What?
- Michelle!

1384
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,593
- Look!
- Who is it?

1385
01:34:08,667 --> 01:34:10,920
- Him, him, him!
- Come on.

1386
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:12,385
Come on!

1387
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:18,460
- Where is it?
- What the fuck!

1388
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,503
I can't believe you sold
a fucking baby!

1389
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:25,755
Actually.. yeah, I can.

1390
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:29,467
Fuck you! I've been walking around all day
looking for this one, all right?

1391
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:32,006
I told you
I couldn't bring it to the fucking feds.

1392
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,298
You didn't want it back before,
did you?

1393
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:36,927
It's done now. I'm sorry.

1394
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:40,672
What were you gonna fuckin' do? Take
the baby and go back to being a tramp?

1395
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:55,010
All right, listen, listen.

1396
01:34:55,125 --> 01:34:58,834
If I go through all this stress, I lose
my fucking money over it, everything,

1397
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:02,132
then you got to chat
to someone proper, yeah?

1398
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,707
Nice lady.

1399
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:08,087
She'll sort it all out. She knows people.
My social worker.

1400
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:10,627
That's how it's running.

1401
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:12,176
Deal?

1402
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,468
Deal.

1403
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,468
All right, then.

1404
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:25,262
All right, wait here.
Don't go fuckin' stealing anything.

1405
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,377
Shithousel

1406
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,173
So I'm fuckin' her, right?

1407
01:36:04,042 --> 01:36:07,967
This baby will not stop fuckin' crying.
It's givin' it the fuckin' big licks.

1408
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,632
Shut it up, yeah?
I'm losing my fuckin' hard-on here.

1409
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:13,882
She's like..
It's a baby. Babies cry.

1410
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:18,386
I'm like, "How about fuck off?"
Yeah? I'm doin' one.

1411
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:21,836
- Oi!
- Oh, hello! You all right?

1412
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:26,545
- What's goin' on there?
- I don't know.

1413
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,840
You wanna go and party? Yeah?

1414
01:36:44,042 --> 01:36:46,886
- Where's my fucking gun?
- What's the matter with you, bruv?

1415
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,129
Listen, listen. You've been storing drugs
in the pub, right?

1416
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,423
- What?
- In the toilet in the fucking pub!

1417
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:53,885
Yes, man.

1418
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:57,546
Either you or your idiot bredren have got
my fucking gun and I need it back.

1419
01:36:57,667 --> 01:36:59,010
Do you understand me?

1420
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,468
I need it back.

1421
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:05,130
You've got two hours to get me my gun back
or I'm gonna burn down people's houses.

1422
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:09,091
All right, man. All right.

1423
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:29,927
- Who's that?
- ..I dunno..

1424
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:33,461
- Hello.
- I'm gone.

1425
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:35,343
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

1426
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:37,835
You all right?

1427
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,502
Fuck!

1428
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:48,504
Come on. You'll be all right.
That's it.

1429
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:49,968
Carol?

1430
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:51,676
- Carol?
- Yeah?

1431
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,344
- Come here!
- Oh, bloody hell!

1432
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:57,667
He's always spoiling things, isn't he, eh?

1433
01:37:57,833 --> 01:38:00,256
- Carol!
- All right!

1434
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,424
Get the baby, put her in the bedroom
and stay in there, all right?

1435
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:04,589
All right!

1436
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:19,210
I'll be back in a minute.

1437
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,926
Are you fuckin' off your rocker or what?

1438
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:33,629
Pain in the bloody arse! Fuckin' hell!

1439
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:42,050
What you doin' bringing that fuckin' whore
in my pub with my missus upstairs?

1440
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,465
- I've got a good reason.
- It had better be!

1441
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:46,010
Let me sort it out then.

1442
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,298
What's goin' on?

1443
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:51,215
Oi, listen, I'll explain, yeah?

1444
01:38:51,917 --> 01:38:55,217
Basically, a bit of a..
Ed should never have sold you the baby.

1445
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:59,088
I didn't want to, but when I came down
here, I didn't know this was gonna happen.

1446
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:01,882
I spent the whole day looking for the mum
and that's her.

1447
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:07,131
And she wants the baby back.

1448
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:17,964
She was turning tricks with some heavy
fucking Russians who got her banged up.

1449
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:21,963
She thought they were gonna kill the baby.
So she fucking left it on the train.

1450
01:39:29,167 --> 01:39:33,047
Now here's the money and I'll give you the
rest of it when I get in touch with Ed.

1451
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:36,011
Now you've got to give the baby back
cos she ain't yours.

1452
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:37,513
She ain't havin' the baby back.
I'm sorry.

1453
01:39:37,526 --> 01:39:38,924
Yes, she is.

1454
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:44,416
You know what?
That is fucking brilliant, pal!

1455
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:48,046
A bit elaborate. You know what I mean?
You came in here three hours ago.

1456
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:50,090
I give you eight fucking bags for a baby

1457
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:53,046
and now you want the baby back
with half the money?

1458
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:55,131
What a fucking prize cunt or what?

1459
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:58,341
Look at her. Done up very well.
Yeah, looks good, innit?

1460
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:04,170
Russian gangsters, babies on trains
and where the fuck's Ed?

1461
01:40:04,292 --> 01:40:07,216
You walk in with Ed.
Am I gonna get four grand back off Ed?

1462
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:09,256
- I don't think so, do you?
- Yeah.

1463
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:11,628
- You do, do ya?
- That's half of it there.

1464
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:15,133
A load of bollocks, pal. You can shove it
right up your arse. No chance!

1465
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,673
- It's not your baby.
- What are you talking about?

1466
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,969
Don't worry.
It's a scam. Can't you see it?

1467
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:22,552
It's not a fuckin' scam, Vince,
and you know it!

1468
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:25,591
- It's her baby! She's the mother!
- Shut your mouth!

1469
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:28,511
Can't understand it
without a cock in your mouth, can ya?

1470
01:40:28,667 --> 01:40:31,466
It's all right when it's your fuckin' cock
in my mouth!

1471
01:40:31,583 --> 01:40:34,302
Hold on a minute.
What did she just say then?

1472
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:38,251
She's a brass. She's always got a cock
in her mouth. What did you think I said?

1473
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:41,094
No, she said your cock
in her mouth.

1474
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:47,672
Do I look like I'm fuckin' lying? And
if I am fuckin' lying, go get the baby.

1475
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,084
And give it to them,
cos that's what they fuckin' want!

1476
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:53,113
I ain't giving them
the fucking baby back!

1477
01:40:53,126 --> 01:40:55,042
Well, they ain't
getting it either!

1478
01:40:55,667 --> 01:40:57,385
You stupid bitch!

1479
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,093
Oi! Oi!

1480
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,461
Come here! Fucking.. Oi!

1481

Fuck off! Fucking slag!

1482
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:05,386
Settle the fuck down, all right?

1483
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:09,337
Right, now you, get the fuck upstairs
and get the baby!

1484

Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

What the fuck!

1488
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,510
What the fuck!

1489
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:21,673
Carol! It's the wrong fucking number!

1490
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:24,586
I think it's number eight!
No, number nine!

1491
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:33,919
Vince! Fucking hell!

1492
01:42:39,208 --> 01:42:41,256
Ed! Where the fuck is the gun, man?

1493
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,343
There's a fuckin' fire goin' on, bruv!

1494
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:46,462
That's Chris's fucking gun, man!
He knows you took it!

1495
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,836
- I had to bring her down!
- Where the fuck is it?

1496
01:42:48,958 --> 01:42:51,086
Bruv, top floor, man. All right?

1497
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:53,757
Wait. Where's the baby? Where is it?

1498
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:57,512
What room?
Ed, the baby's still up there, bruv!

1499
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,710
Fuck!

1500
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,006
Aaron!

1501
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,585
Ed! Here!

1502
01:43:54,667 --> 01:43:56,169
- Catch it, bruv!
- What is it?

1503
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:58,340
It's the bucky, bruv! Catch it!

1504
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:04,419
Aaron!

1505
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,593
What the fuck are you doing?

1506
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:11,511
Bruv, I can't breathe!
She can't breathe neither, man!

1507
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,502
You gotta catch her!

1508
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:21,844
- Aaron!
- Do it!

1509
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,297
It's OK!

1510
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,127
Ed!

1511
01:45:29,708 --> 01:45:31,585
Ed!

1512
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:49,298
Oi, Aaron, you've gotta go!
The gun! Aaron!

1513
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:54,881
Who else knows about this?

1514
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:57,880
No one.

1515
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:00,551
What do you mean no one?
What about Ed?

1516
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:02,505
He's dead.

1517
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:05,253
What the fuck do you mean Ed's dead?
How did he die?

1518
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:07,753
Don't worry how he fucking died, bruv.

1519
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,752
Just know that he died..

1520
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,877
Getting you this.

1521
01:47:19,292 --> 01:47:22,341
Bruv, where the fuck are you going, man?
Shut the door.

1522
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,718
Come work for me then, innit?

1523
01:47:39,583 --> 01:47:41,460
I'll bell you tomorrow.

1524
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,924
Take this, innit, for the funeral.

1525
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:31,114
They might not let you
cos you ain't family.

1526
01:51:31,127 --> 01:51:33,168
Tell them you're his
sister or something.

1527
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:34,635
Yeah, course.

1528
01:51:42,667 --> 01:51:44,010
Oi!

1529
01:51:45,417 --> 01:51:48,671
What flowers do you reckon
he'd have liked? In the hearse and that?

1530
01:51:50,958 --> 01:51:52,960
Don't know. Anything that you choose.

1531
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:57,511
White roses are nice, innit?

1532
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:01,551
Yeah.

1533
01:52:24,792 --> 01:52:26,135
Where's he goin' then?

1534
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:33,093
Are you fucking stupid or somethin'?

1535
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:39,091
Fuck you then! Fuck you!

1536
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,176
Pussy!

1537
01:53:12,125 --> 01:53:16,005
{y:i} Follow me as I descend
Into madness with gladness

1538
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:18,799
{y:i} For years I've been surrounded
By this badness

1539
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,426
{y:i} No time to waste

1540
01:53:20,542 --> 01:53:23,421
{y:i} It's high time I escaped
Out of the forest's gate

1541
01:53:23,542 --> 01:53:26,170
{y:i} Sorry, mate, but these ends
Are in a sorry state

1542
01:53:26,292 --> 01:53:29,671
{y:i} You can't relate? Yeah, well,
you can fuck off can't ya, mate?

1543
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:32,959
{y:i} Your heart is faint
Can't appreciate how this artist paints

1544
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:34,551
{y:i} My art is great

1545
01:53:34,667 --> 01:53:36,886
{y:i} It's my mind that's
in the darkest place

1546
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,209
{y:i} I can't erase the memories
I have of darker days

1547
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:42,131
{y:i} Darker days

1548
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:44,002
{y:i} That left a bitter aftertaste

1549
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:47,379
{y:i} I'm passed the stage
Of trying hard to mask this rage

1550
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,878
{y:i} I'm letting go, callin' out to God

1551
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,503
{y:i} To let him know
I'm fallin' on my own accord

1552
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,502
{y:i} Please don't attempt to save my soul

1553
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:56,093
{y:i} Get up off the ground

1554
01:53:56,208 --> 01:53:57,710
{y:i} Take a look around

1555
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:01,300
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

1556
01:54:01,417 --> 01:54:05,251
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around

1557
01:54:05,375 --> 01:54:08,504
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

1558
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:12,300
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around

1559
01:54:12,417 --> 01:54:15,717
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

1560
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:19,084
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around

1561
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:22,758
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

1562
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,544
{y:i} No backpack

1563
01:54:24,667 --> 01:54:26,340
{y:i} Just a tramp making tracks

1564
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:27,755
{y:i} I'm cool like Keith

1565
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:30,169
{y:i} Making friends with the rats

1566
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:33,667
{y:i} Observing how they act
They ain't beggin' for my scraps

1567
01:54:33,792 --> 01:54:35,339
{y:i} They ain't cats

1568
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:38,792
{y:i} They'd rather wait
Until I've turned my back, no turnin' back

1569
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:42,713
{y:i} Maybe now's the time
To turn to crack I've learnt the facts

1570
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,593
{y:i} Way before I learned to rap

1571
01:54:44,667 --> 01:54:46,010
{y:i} This place is mess

1572
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:49,504
{y:i} The people here they don't
pray success They hate it, yes.

1573
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:53,425
{y:i} They don't want you to progress
That's why they test

1574
01:54:53,542 --> 01:54:55,215
{y:i} Try to knock you to the ground

1575
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:58,257
{y:i} You pick yourself up
That's when they knock you back down

1576
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:02,084
{y:i} The university of lifeblood
That's where I got my schooling

1577
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:05,917
{y:i} I know that they can't knock me down
As long as I keep falling

1578
01:55:06,042 --> 01:55:09,421
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around..

1579
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:12,920
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- Yeah.

1580
01:55:13,042 --> 01:55:16,672
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around

1581
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:20,050
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

1582
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:24,092
{y:i} You get up off the ground
Take a look around

1583
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:27,666
{y:i} Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down..

1584
01:55:27,667 --> 01:55:30,716
- Bored today, gov?
- I'm not bored. It's just a routine check.

1585
01:55:30,875 --> 01:55:32,969
But you lot stopped me for no reason.

1586
01:55:33,083 --> 01:55:35,757
Well, not sure if you knew
you had a low tyre there.

1587
01:55:35,958 --> 01:55:37,960
How can you see my front tyre
from the back?

1588
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,922
Hope.

1589
01:55:43,042 --> 01:55:46,216
{y:i} I'm falling down

1590
01:55:47,417 --> 01:55:50,421
{y:i} I'm falling down..

1591
01:55:50,542 --> 01:55:54,001
- I've got good eyesight.
- It's cool. There's nothing in there.

1592
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,093
- What's your name, anyway?
- PC Madeira.

1593
01:55:56,208 --> 01:56:00,133
- Do you like wearing that uniform?
- What's this, Chris?

1594
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:15,169
{y:i} I'm falling down

1595
