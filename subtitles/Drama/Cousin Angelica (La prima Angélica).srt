1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,227
COUSIN ANGELICA

2
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,351
Chorus: "The Lord is my Shepherd"

3
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,981
That's because he rides in the back
seat. It won't happen up front.

4
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,679
Let him get some fresh air,
he'll get over it.

5
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,836
The cologne will freshen
you up, Luisito.

6
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,547
<i>Mom, I don't want to go to granny's.</i>

7
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:05,029
<i>I want to stay with you two.</i>

8
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,834
You said the same thing last summer.

9
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,915
And then you had a great time.

10
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,475
Don't you remember?

11
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,192
This year you've grown up
and won't cry ¿right?

12
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:21,220
I always want to be with you two.

13
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:25,469
It's not possible, son. We'll come
for you very soon.

14
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,058
A month flies by. Don't be silly.

15
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,931
Come on, Luisa. It's getting late.

16
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:37,681
You'll have a wonderful time.

17
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:41,263
Remember last year. You didn't
want to return to Madrid.

18
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,378
That's right, my boy. You'll have a
splendid time with those witches.

19
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:50,713
Feeling better?
Come on, get in.

20
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,474
No. Not the green one.

21
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:52,563
- Good morning. Doña Pilar Fuentes?
- Yes, this is the house.

22
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,472
Tell her it's her nephew Luis.

23
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,333
Come in. Come in.

24
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:00,993
Come this way.

25
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,145
Madam is expecting you.

26
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,523
Madam, your nephew Luis.

27
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,528
Luis...

28
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:24,170
- Is that you, Luis?
- Yes, aunt. How are you?

29
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:29,347
So many years...

30
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,454
- So many years...
- You look fine.

31
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,701
Yes, I'm fine.

32
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,922
Old... but fine.

33
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,843
And you? How are you?

34
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,784
- I'm also fine.
- Really?

35
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,536
Let me look at you.

36
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,084
A miracle.

37
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,245
Without a miracle, I couldn't
have seen you again.

38
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,218
Sit down, sit down.

39
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:09,989
- Do you still play the piano?
- No.

40
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,230
These won't obey anymore.

41
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,136
Aunt, I would have preferred to bury
my mother without troubling anyone.

42
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:24,313
But mother spoke of a family vault
and I need your permission.

43
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,941
What permission? She had every right.

44
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:33,607
Poor thing. Carrying her in the car
as if she was a piece of furniture...

45
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,606
It's just a change of
venue for her remains.

46
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,528
She died 20 years ago.

47
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:42,279
It's not my mother,
just what remains of her.

48
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,010
It's a...

49
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:48,433
I know.

50
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,886
I know.
Now come with me.

51
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,076
I'll fix your room.

52
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,518
I'm staying at the hotel, don't bother.

53
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,082
What do you mean at the hotel?
By no means.

54
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,544
- I'll fix your room.
- I'm fine at the hotel...

55
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,138
I don't want to trouble you.

56
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,786
What trouble? On the contrary,
you'll keep me company.

57
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:16,191
A hotel, for heaven's sake!
With this beautiful room here.

58
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:23,169
By the way...
Have you already seen Angélica?

59
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:27,332
- Angélica?
- Yes, Angélica. Your cousin.

60
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:32,755
Look at this room!

61
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,800
The camphor really smells! Truth is,
I overdo it with the camphor.

62
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:50,111
And how is Angélica doing?

63
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:53,296
See? You'll feel like a king here.

64
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:56,971
The camphor smell will go away fast.

65
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:01,498
Angélica? Angélica lives downstairs.

66
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,298
The apartment was vacant
and they bought it.

67
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:06,904
Just one thing...

68
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:10,445
Anselmo will take care of
the burial procedure.

69
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,141
I'm really grateful to you but
I prefer to stay at the hotel.

70
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:18,641
Let's see...

71
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:23,691
Do you recognize me now?

72
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,731
No. I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.

73
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:31,836
Let's see now...

74
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,161
The Salesian school!

75
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,463
Father Florentino?

76
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,876
London Eyes!

77
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:48,589
- London Eyes?
- Sure, that's it.

78
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:52,056
Sagun. Felipe Sagun.

79
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,985
We used to sit together.

80
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,209
He was quite a character.

81
00:14:57,174 --> 00:15:00,885
I'm sorry... but with that attire...

82
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,089
Care to explain what
"London Eyes" means?

83
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:07,763
It's a movie that the priests
used to show us at school.

84
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,315
These eyes would appear
in the walls, in the sky...

85
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,838
everywhere.

86
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:15,796
- It was really frightening, right?
- That's right.

87
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,071
Inquisitive blue eyes...

88
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:21,387
Cruel eyes...

89
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,262
Well, we can bury your mother
whenever you like.

90
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:27,998
No problem.

91
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:32,580
- Tomorrow at 11?
- No... I can't in the morning.

92
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,724
I have a union meeting.

93
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,035
It's all right, Anselmo.
I can take care of it.

94
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,942
No way. What's the family for?

95
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,114
Could it be in the afternoon,
around four?

96
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:47,686
Sure. At four o'clock, then.

97
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:51,182
So, where do you live now? Madrid?

98
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:52,624
No, in Barcelona.

99
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,862
- Isn't this the Roman music?
- Yes, sure.

100
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:59,378
- So, how's it going with you?
- Fine, very good.

101
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:03,382
Are you married?
Got any children?

102
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:05,894
None, I'm single.

103
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,348
Come on, let's get on with it.

104
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:27,053
You, Mr. Cayetano.
And the boy: Luis Hernandez.

105
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,153
Ready.

106
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,050
Now!

107
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:37,762
Remember, absolutely still. As if
you were made out of marble.

108
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:15,283
This is for Luisito.

109
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,307
Fine.

110
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:51,230
Aunt is coming!

111
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:59,469
Luisito, this letter is for you.

112
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:02,224
Who opened it?

113
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,655
Grandmother opened it.

114
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:09,421
You won't get upset about it, right?

115
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:16,780
- Did you get anything out?
- Can't do it.

116
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:21,530
- How about with a magnet?
- I don't have one.

117
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,572
<i>Madrid, July 5, 1936.</i>

118
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:31,253
<i>Dear son; we got your letter and we're
very happy to know you're all right.</i>

119
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:36,503
<i>At the end of the month, we'll go get
you so we can spend August together...</i>

120
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:41,659
<i>by the sea. So, in a few days,
we'll all be together, son.</i>

121
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,379
<i>We really look forward to seeing you.</i>

122
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:48,737
<i>You shouldn't say all those things
that you're saying, son.</i>

123
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,316
<i>I'm sure everyone is making
an effort so that you...</i>

124
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:57,834
<i>can have a good time and be happy.</i>

125
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,643
<i>You also have to make a small effort.</i>

126
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,949
<i>You have to be obedient and behave.</i>

127
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,106
<i>Until very soon, son.</i>

128
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,972
<i>Loads of kisses from your loving mother.</i>

129
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,251
<i>- This too?
- We have to see how it hangs.</i>

130
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,538
<i>Bend down.</i>

131
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:27,212
<i>Be careful.</i>

132
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:32,044
<i>Be careful with the sleeve.</i>

133
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,113
Hurry up! Shut it all up!
Come on!

134
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,871
What's going on?

135
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:56,642
Let's pray the Rosary.
In the name of the Father...

136
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,297
Mother, what's going on?

137
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:10,604
The power's out.

138
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:12,778
Must be the utility.

139
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:16,998
A disaster's coming.

140
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,691
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee;</i>

141
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:47,744
<i>blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

142
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,628
- Mother, I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid, darling.

143
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:02,784
What should we do?

144
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,859
- Should I open the door?
- No, Miguel. Don't do it.

145
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:13,955
I'll go.

146
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,855
<i>Things are getting complicated.</i>

147
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:56,142
- Heard any news?
- No. Did you hear any news?

148
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:59,782
Did you hear the shots?
I believe it's the U.G.T.

149
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,702
And the army? What are they doing?
What are they waiting for?

150
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,307
I don't know.

151
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,319
The radio!

152
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,383
Silence!

153
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,339
Not a single station.

154
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:40,705
A disaster. That's what's
in store for us.

155
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,245
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

156
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:49,168
<i>Our city has become part
of the Salvation Movement!</i>

157
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:52,969
- General mobilization has been decreed.
- Our side!

158
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:54,707
I'm so glad!

159
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,802
Open up the windows!
Let the sunshine in!

160
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:09,659
We have to celebrate.
Bring some cognac!

161
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,317
Luisito...

162
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:14,469
Now your father and his ilk will know
what's coming to them.

163
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:36,795
Angélica, serve your cousin
another drink.

164
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:40,110
- No, thanks.
- Come on, we have to celebrate.

165
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:41,279
Of course.

166
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:48,205
- Ice?
- No, thanks.

167
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,579
Aunt Pilar is looking well.

168
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,817
She'll end up much better
than my father.

169
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,900
She has deteriorated after she
stopped playing the piano.

170
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,246
Isn't that so, Anselmo?

171
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,935
Aunt Pilar? She's living the good life.

172
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,858
Every day, from home to church
and from church to home.

173
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:16,638
Listen, Luis, tell me something.
All this boom they're talking about.

174
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:19,270
This book avalanche.

175
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,740
Are the books selling or not?

176
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:26,671
We can't complain. We've sold
quite a few this year.

177
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,068
The impression I get is
that nobody reads.

178
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:33,407
I used to... Well, I've never
been a great reader.

179
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:37,047
But now it's impossible.
You need time to read.

180
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:42,313
And I'll tell you something else.
I prefer a magazine... or the TV.

181
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:46,569
Everything's already chewed and
digested. It enters through your eyes.

182
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,203
Who has time to read nowadays?

183
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,785
You like to read, don't you?

184
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:57,248
Depends. But yes, I like to read.
Poetry most of all.

185
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:04,369
"I dreamt that you were walking
me along a white path

186
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:09,258
"in the midst of a green field,
towards the blue hills

187
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:15,788
towards the blue hilltops,
on a calm morning. "

188
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,237
Did you write it?

189
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:20,967
It's pretty, mom, go on.

190
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,787
Don't know if I'll remember it.

191
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:26,119
Let's see.

192
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:30,973
"A calm morning... "

193
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:36,765
"I felt your hand in mine,
your friendly hand.

194
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:40,239
"The girl's voice in my ear...

195
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,832
"like a new bell...

196
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:47,808
like a virgin bell from a spring morn. "

197
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:52,481
But... how old were you
when you wrote that?

198
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:56,268
You must have been... 10 or 11.

199
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,844
What do you know? We have
a poet in the family.

200
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:03,576
No. I didn't write that.

201
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,590
I copied it from Antonio Machado.

202
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,852
Who did you say you got it from?

203
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:13,527
Antonio Machado, dad.

204
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,583
Oh, Machado. Right... Machado.

205
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,316
Madam, whenever you're ready.

206
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:24,991
- Ready for dinner?
- Whenever you say.

207
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,587
Let's go.

208
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:34,423
Luis... You probably want
to wash your hands, right?

209
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,035
OK. Thanks.

210
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,492
This way.

211
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,586
I'm really glad to have met you.

212
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:53,353
Your family here is a bit like...
You don't mind me saying it, do you?

213
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:57,000
- No.
- The black sheep in the family.

214
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:02,715
Crazy. Over thirty years have passed and
some people still remember the war.

215
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:07,180
Ask my daughter what she knows about
the war. Nothing, absolutely nothing.

216
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:09,188
It's natural, time erases everything.

217
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,912
We'd be in trouble if it wasn't so.

218
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:14,892
It's funny...

219
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:21,979
Me coming here...
all these forgotten things...

220
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:28,301
I'm seeing you on July 18, 1936...

221
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:31,956
shutting windows, nervous...

222
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:34,139
Me in 1936?

223
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:37,538
I was a little kid, and I was
in Burgos with my parents.

224
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,411
Are you serious?

225
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,914
- Here's a clean towel.
- I'm starving.

226
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,211
Your cousin is a five-star cook!

227
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,703
How are you, Angélica?

228
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:02,811
Fine... fine.

229
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,325
Glad to see you again.

230
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,371
So am I.

231
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:12,296
And your father? Didn't
he want to come?

232
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:14,896
No.

233
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:16,409
Of course.

234
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,739
May the Lord be with you.

235
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,356
Let's pray.

236
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,159
Forgive, O Lord, your
servant Luisa's sins.

237
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:42,408
So that she can find her place
among your chosen ones.

238
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:46,074
- In the name of Christ, our Lord.
- Amen.

239
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,062
Poor darling!

240
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:14,026
Luis, let's go.

241
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:50,172
But how could you confuse
Anselmo with my father?

242
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:00,082
Look.

243
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:04,091
Convince yourself. What did my father
and Anselmo have in common?

244
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,741
Obviously, nothing at all.

245
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,673
Like I told you, I have
some confusing ideas.

246
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:17,237
Let's see. How old were you in 1936?

247
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:21,592
In 1936 I was... 9 years old.

248
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,963
How could you be 9 years old?

249
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,588
Of course I was. I'll show you.

250
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,968
Look at me.

251
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:37,597
Who's this?

252
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:41,421
This is aunt Pilar when she was young.

253
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:45,513
This is my grandmother.
And this is my mother.

254
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:48,012
Your grandmother.

255
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:51,786
- Proust's cupcake.
- Whose cupcake?

256
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,614
Piles of papers have been written
about Proust's cupcake.

257
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,867
Proust, a writer, once dunked
a cupcake into a cup of tea...

258
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:06,858
suddenly, his mouth was filled with the
flavor of geraniums and orange blossoms.

259
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,864
- His grandfather's garden.
- You can come to the table.

260
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:11,576
The chocolate is ready.

261
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:22,176
It's true. Those things happen.

262
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:27,547
A fragrance... I don't know...
some music.

263
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:33,191
And in some new places you get
the feeling you've been there before.

264
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:42,220
I went on a school outing, and when
I reached the place I already knew it.

265
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,502
I had dreamt about it.

266
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:49,580
- It's good, isn't it?
- Excellent.

267
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:28,973
- I have to go, mom.
- Go, go.

268
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,244
Good bye, son. Behave.

269
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,246
Don't cause any trouble.

270
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:42,963
Pilar, take good care of him.

271
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:46,578
Don't worry. He'll behave really well.
Right, Luisito?

272
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:51,720
We'll take care of it. Any trouble and
he'll be going to mass every day.

273
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:55,678
A kiss.

274
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:59,417
Mom, I don't want to stay here.

275
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,736
I want to go with you two.

276
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:07,280
A month flies by, son. You'll have
a great time, I've already told you.

277
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,236
Goodbye, Angélica.

278
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,881
Bye, beautiful.

279
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:18,647
- Goodbye, mother.
- Goodbye, darling.

280
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,640
Good Lord.

281
00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:27,039
I'm sure you don't
go to mass in Madrid.

282
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,490
I thought so.

283
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,300
Why must this happen to us, Lord?

284
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:40,416
Why? Why?

285
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,987
Come on, Luisito. We have to
put away your clothes.

286
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:03,935
<i>A month flies by, Luisito.
You'll have a good time here.</i>

287
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:07,212
<i>Better than in Madrid, you'll see.</i>

288
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:36,723
Luisito...

289
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,037
What's wrong?

290
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,445
Are you going to cry?

291
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:53,481
Come on, don't be silly.
You're already a man!

292
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:55,418
Come on!

293
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,129
- Aunt.
- What?

294
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:21,453
My father would never come in
when he used to come here, right?

295
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:22,495
No.

296
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,496
All right. I'm finished.

297
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:31,630
Come on, Luisito.
Let's go pick some berries.

298
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:35,961
Coming or what?

299
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:54,758
Luis!

300
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,952
Where are you?

301
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:24,979
Warm!

302
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:33,272
Warm! Warm!

303
00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:41,738
Cold! Cold, cold!

304
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:44,120
Cold!

305
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:50,151
Angélica!

306
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:52,958
Angélica, wait for me.

307
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,839
You're dumb and dull.
You behave like a child.

308
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,847
Can I have a berry?

309
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,981
- Do you know what they were saying?
- No. What?

310
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:13,345
That if Pilar had married your father,
everything would be different now.

311
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:14,386
But why?

312
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,859
Because she met your father before your
mother did. Your mother stole him away.

313
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:22,141
- Didn't they tell you anything?
- Not to me.

314
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:27,698
My grandmother says that Pilar
could have changed your father.

315
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,862
And that your mother is a fool.

316
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,928
My mother's no fool.

317
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:36,109
If your father had married Pilar,
you would be her son now.

318
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:40,277
- What has your father done?
- Nothing!

319
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:42,169
He must have done something.

320
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,293
Something very bad. Grandma says that
when the Nationals reach Madrid,

321
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:47,620
he'll be shot.

322
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,503
My father?

323
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,368
<i>You said the same thing last summer.</i>

324
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,267
<i>All that crying. And then
you had a great time.</i>

325
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:29,082
<i>Don't you remember?
This year you're older.</i>

326
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,915
<i>You're not going to cry, right?</i>

327
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,659
I want to be with you two.

328
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,132
<i>It's not possible, son. We'll come
for you very soon.</i>

329
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:42,503
<i>A month flies by. Don't be silly.</i>

330
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:44,958
Come on, Luisa. It's getting late.

331
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,349
You'll have a wonderful time.

332
00:44:51,462 --> 00:44:54,893
Remember last year. You didn't
want to return to Madrid.

333
00:44:55,103 --> 00:44:59,737
That's right, my boy. You'll have a
splendid time with those witches.

334
00:45:00,753 --> 00:45:03,386
Feeling better?
Come on, get in.

335
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:03,772
Chorus: "Mary, Mother of God".

336
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:02,615
Come in.

337
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:09,072
- Good morning.
- Good morning, aunt.

338
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:12,462
- Did you sleep well?
- Splendidly, but, why did you bother?

339
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,095
I was going to get up.

340
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,644
No... you didn't miss
your bed, did you?

341
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:21,407
Not at all. On the contrary,
it's much better than at the hotel.

342
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:24,496
It's a spring mattress, of course.

343
00:49:25,686 --> 00:49:27,010
There's wool in here.

344
00:49:27,712 --> 00:49:31,119
Look, I've fixed you these toasts...

345
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,766
- but if you want something else...
- No, this is fine.

346
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:37,907
Yes? Try it. Try the coffee.

347
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:44,582
Very tasty.

348
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:50,390
Luis... Luis.

349
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:55,150
I'll leave you alone.
I know I'm a bore.

350
00:49:57,686 --> 00:49:59,470
Anything else to wash and iron?

351
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:02,583
No. But don't trouble
yourself, aunt. Really.

352
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:06,227
The mortified nun was there.

353
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:15,225
"The world perished,
and its concupiscence".

354
00:51:18,386 --> 00:51:19,827
There was a washbasin here.

355
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:24,504
They must have thrown it away.

356
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:33,174
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,106
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well, thanks.

358
00:51:40,704 --> 00:51:43,500
- Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, aunt.

359
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,018
Slept a while, didn't you?

360
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:13,272
Hi. Yes, I had a long sleep.

361
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:16,809
- Hi, Luis.
- Hi, Angélica.

362
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:19,891
You look busy.

363
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:25,877
Anselmo wants to know if you'd like
to come to the country on Sunday.

364
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:30,456
- To the country?
- Come on, come with us!

365
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,038
All right, fine.

366
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:46,129
This is the only classroom
still with the old kind of desks.

367
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:49,008
They've been replaced
elsewhere.

368
00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:06,671
So you're one of the old timers,
when I attended here.

369
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:10,715
Well, I couldn't say.
I've been here for 16 years.

370
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:15,414
But there was a very old teacher,
Father Florentino.

371
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:18,172
Father Florentino?

372
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,513
- A tall, strong man?
- I knew him as a sick person.

373
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:30,047
In bed.
A very old man, as I'm saying.

374
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:31,590
The chapel.

375
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:35,370
- Yes, sir. - May I?
- Of course.

376
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:58,459
- This hasn't changed much.
- I couldn't say.

377
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:03,415
When I was a child,
the janitor's name was Adrian.

378
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:07,111
Adrian? I haven't met him.

379
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:11,975
- Do they still ring the bell?
- Yes, yes. Always.

380
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:18,344
- The auditorium.
- No, the cinema.

381
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,156
No, no.
The auditorium.

382
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:28,981
In my time,
this was the cinema.

383
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:35,026
- Please, go on with your chores.
- Thank you.

384
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:37,134
London eyes.
The London Tower. The Thames.

385
00:56:39,537 --> 00:56:42,341
A lonely alley.

386
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,767
Wet cobblestones.

387
00:56:50,892 --> 00:56:53,449
A blackened brick wall.

388
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:57,171
Just like in a horror movie.

389
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,210
And all of a sudden...

390
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,789
those inquisitive,
disturbing eyes.

391
00:57:05,587 --> 00:57:10,220
Footsteps.
Footsteps getting closer.

392
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:17,811
And those beings,
chasing someone...

393
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,229
No, no... The worm...

394
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,441
The worm...

395
00:59:48,337 --> 00:59:49,378
The worm.

396
00:59:55,656 --> 00:59:59,010
Oh, no. Oh, no!

397
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,479
No! The worm!

398
01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:12,629
No, I don't want to!
I don't want to! No, no!

399
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:15,735
I don't want to!
She's taking me! She's taking me!

400
01:00:15,736 --> 01:00:19,455
She's taking me! No!
I don't want to, I don't want to!

401
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,530
- Luisito! - No! She's taking me!
- What's wrong? - She's taking me!

402
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,437
- Whos' taking you? - The nun!
- The nun?

403
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,722
The mortified nun!
There she is! Right there!

404
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:51,816
You're having a nightmare!
Wake up! Wake up!

405
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:02,028
It was just a nightmare.
I'm aunt Pilar.

406
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:04,005
You were dreaming.

407
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:09,876
Come on, calm down.
Come on, go to sleep.

408
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,066
I'll fix your bed.

409
01:01:19,534 --> 01:01:22,567
Poor darling...
You really got scared.

410
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:26,505
Never mind,
I'll change the sheets.

411
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:06,115
It won't stop like that.

412
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:09,876
- Raise your chin.
- Leave me alone, you brute.

413
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:13,339
- What side was it?
- The left side.

414
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:16,897
Then you must raise
your right arm.

415
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:21,164
Just like that.
Did it stop?

416
01:03:23,273 --> 01:03:25,521
It will stop even faster
if you lie down.

417
01:03:25,522 --> 01:03:27,084
Come on, lie down.

418
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,689
But keep your chin up.

419
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:43,658
I didn't mean to hurt you, I swear.

420
01:03:44,564 --> 01:03:45,604
You did it on purpose.

421
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:50,754
No. Really, I didn't mean to.

422
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:56,453
Did it stop?

423
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:20,553
Angélica...
- What?

424
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:31,511
I wanted to tell you something...

425
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:38,895
Go ahead, say it,
I won't bite.

426
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:46,575
No... It's nothing.

427
01:04:55,254 --> 01:04:59,424
- How about this, huh?
- What a silence.

428
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:02,555
You get to breathe
some real air, here.

429
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:12,550
- Sugar?
- Yes, one, please.

430
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:26,165
You see, when they told me,
I didn't doubt for a second.

431
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:30,857
One's fed up of the traffic,
the pollution...

432
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:34,078
your nerves bursting
with every day's stress...

433
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:39,147
You need some peace.

434
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,286
Don't think
this is just an investment.

435
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:46,116
A group of friends -
all great people, right?

436
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,938
We didn't think it twice.
Let's go buy!

437
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:58,654
Hey, listen. Where would you
place the swimming pool?

438
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,321
The swimming pool?

439
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:06,487
I don't know.

440
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:10,211
Let me explain.
Come, please.

441
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,754
- Anselmo, leave Luis alone.
- Let me show you.

442
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:18,098
Our plot goes up to there.
Up to the bunker. See it?

443
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:21,881
- Yes.
- And from here up to there.

444
01:06:21,882 --> 01:06:24,295
You see?
- Yes, of course.

445
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:27,906
I want to build the house over there,
and the swimming pool over here.

446
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:30,530
What do you think?
- What about the water?

447
01:06:30,531 --> 01:06:35,415
- Water? All the water you want!
- Sure, 150 feet deep...

448
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:38,605
Huh, your cousin and her jokes!
Ignore her.

449
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:41,573
Great water.
Warranted by a dowser.

450
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:43,825
You know, one of those
guys with a divining rod.

451
01:06:43,826 --> 01:06:45,725
- Yes...
- Those guys never fail.

452
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:49,029
Twenty thousand liters.
Not bad, huh?

453
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:52,753
Take my advice, Luis,
a great investment.

454
01:06:52,962 --> 01:06:55,827
You see, as we're
selling those lots over there...

455
01:06:56,188 --> 01:06:58,912
house and pool
come out almost for free.

456
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:03,523
Listen, should you want to buy,
of course you'll get a special price.

457
01:07:04,674 --> 01:07:09,445
But dad, why would he come all the way
from Barcelona just for weekends?

458
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:13,294
So what? An investment
is always an investment, right?

459
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:18,762
Right. Well, excuse me,
but there's a lady waiting for me.

460
01:07:20,443 --> 01:07:24,960
- You never take naps?
- Ah... no, I usually don't.

461
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:28,362
Well, you don't know what
you're missing. See ya.

462
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:33,720
- Good nap.
- Angélica, here. Here!

463
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:54,420
- He's crazy about his plot.
- What about you?

464
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:59,301
I'm happy too, but...
Turn around, my child.

465
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:02,867
Anselmo only sees
the advantages of living here.

466
01:08:02,972 --> 01:08:06,950
But I see a lot of inconveniences,
no services, no malls...

467
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:08,623
no schools for Angélica...

468
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:11,880
But of course,
the house isn't even built yet.

469
01:08:11,882 --> 01:08:14,590
- I'll need a motorcycle.
- A motorcycle?

470
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:17,338
How about that?

471
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:21,254
- Enough! - But...
- You're a bore!

472
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:28,629
- She acts like a savage!
- She's a wonderful child.

473
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:37,251
Dad... may I turn on the radio?

474
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:39,391
Yeah, no too loud.

475
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:09,570
After all, this family thing
is not a bad invention.

476
01:09:09,571 --> 01:09:13,217
Really? Ask me about it.
Aren't you happy just like that,

477
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:15,986
free, no worries,
no responsibilities...?

478
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:21,103
Free, yes. But alone.

479
01:09:21,313 --> 01:09:24,428
Instead, you look after your daughter,
your husband...

480
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:27,712
My husband...

481
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:35,323
What's wrong with Anselmo?

482
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:41,016
Is it something important?

483
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,463
I guess he's grown tired of me.
That's all.

484
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:53,521
D'you mean to say
he's cheating on you?

485
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:59,227
I'm not sure.
I guess he is.

486
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:04,576
Truth is,
I don't really care too much.

487
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,675
What are you doing?

488
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:11,514
- Come on, Luis, throw it!
- I don't know how...

489
01:10:11,596 --> 01:10:14,396
Of course you do!
It's so easy! Watch this!

490
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:18,746
Throw it!

491
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:23,475
See? Come on, let's play!
Hurry up, Luis!

492
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:27,517
Come play!
Here!

493
01:10:48,963 --> 01:10:51,860
Let's see, let's see...

494
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:56,472
As you know, Luis,
I'm an old family friend.

495
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,867
A united family,
exemplary.

496
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,697
Therefore I don't want you
to see me as a priest...

497
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,091
but as a friend.

498
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:12,388
- Right?
- Yes.

499
01:11:13,313 --> 01:11:16,130
Good.
In that case...

500
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:19,351
from friend to friend...

501
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,850
or better yet,
from man to man...

502
01:11:22,955 --> 01:11:26,636
Because you're already a man,
Luisito. A man...

503
01:11:26,637 --> 01:11:30,630
who can realize
the consequences of his actions.

504
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:36,231
So tell me: what have you and
your cousin Angélica done?

505
01:11:37,195 --> 01:11:39,722
Nothing.
We haven't done anything.

506
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:44,949
Come on, come on.
Don't you trust me?

507
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:49,708
I only mean to help you.
Oh, I see.

508
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:53,668
You love your cousin Angélica
just like you love your parents...

509
01:11:54,422 --> 01:11:58,454
your aunt, your grandmother...

510
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:05,399
And maybe, because of that love...

511
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:09,211
you've kissed her.
Is that right?

512
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:14,282
Just a simple kiss,
but quite disturbing it was.

513
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:20,681
After that disturbance,
and maybe without even noticing it...

514
01:12:20,682 --> 01:12:24,106
you've had some small chat
with an older boy.

515
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,795
A dishonest chat,
of course...

516
01:12:32,697 --> 01:12:33,842
Am I right?

517
01:12:35,973 --> 01:12:37,015
No!

518
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:43,225
You liar! And what was this
doing in your room?

519
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:47,814
Mother of God! Mother of God!

520
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:59,034
<i>That child is a bent twig!</i>

521
01:13:02,575 --> 01:13:05,131
<i>He needs some spiritual exercises!</i>

522
01:13:28,306 --> 01:13:32,642
- Where are you going?
- Come. I guess it was here.

523
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:41,687
- What are you doing?
- It will just be a second, wait.

524
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,181
- But what are you doing?
- It must be here, somewhere.

525
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:49,084
What are you looking for?

526
01:13:50,402 --> 01:13:53,075
There it is!
See?

527
01:13:53,652 --> 01:13:59,442
Angélica... Luis...
1938.

528
01:14:01,424 --> 01:14:04,063
- Your mother and I.
- Really?

529
01:14:04,618 --> 01:14:07,173
Do you have a pencil
and a piece of paper?

530
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,401
I don't know if a ball-pen will do.

531
01:14:34,326 --> 01:14:35,470
See?

532
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,288
- So you were sweethearts?
- Sweethearts, at twelve!

533
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:45,980
So what?
I go out with boys.

534
01:14:49,491 --> 01:14:53,023
- How did my mother look like?
- I don't know.

535
01:14:57,245 --> 01:15:01,002
- Was she taller than me?
- Yes, I guess she was.

536
01:15:01,275 --> 01:15:02,837
I'm not sure.

537
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,279
- She was not as thin as you are.
- She had larger breasts?

538
01:15:12,411 --> 01:15:16,360
Me, I have nothing. Nothing
up front and nothing behind!

539
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,785
- Boys always say that.
- She walked differently.

540
01:15:19,995 --> 01:15:21,557
Like this?

541
01:15:45,425 --> 01:15:47,048
- Luis!
- What do you want?

542
01:15:47,851 --> 01:15:49,829
Come,
I'll show you something.

543
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:59,095
- Let's see if you can guess what it is.
- I don't know.

544
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:01,738
It starts with a "b".
I'm wearing it...

545
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:03,917
I don't know.

546
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:06,707
You're so dumb!
Take a look.

547
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:10,723
My mother says
I have to wear it now.

548
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,582
Let me see it again!

549
01:16:22,325 --> 01:16:23,621
Show me!

550
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:30,053
Just for a second.

551
01:16:47,624 --> 01:16:50,364
Angélica! Luisito!

552
01:16:51,282 --> 01:16:53,366
I'm coming!

553
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:44,477
- How are you?
- Hi, how are you?

554
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:48,378
As usual.
Hello, mother.

555
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:54,341
Miguel!
What happened to you, my son?

556
01:17:55,363 --> 01:18:00,430
Nothing, some shrapnel.
Back to the front in a few days.

557
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:02,647
Oh Lord!

558
01:18:05,231 --> 01:18:08,327
- And the war, how is it going?
- It couldn't be better!

559
01:18:08,641 --> 01:18:11,528
- Madrid is about to fall!
- Well...

560
01:18:12,405 --> 01:18:17,526
- They don't tell us nothing here.
- Like a saint. And your hand?

561
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:26,003
Just the same, mom, just the same.
And now... the other one.

562
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:31,701
The doctor has great confidence
on these soakings, but... I don't know.

563
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:34,143
Does it hurt a lot?

564
01:18:36,559 --> 01:18:39,837
I rejoice in offering
my sufferings to the Lord.

565
01:18:42,877 --> 01:18:45,960
Let's hope He will accept them.

566
01:18:48,401 --> 01:18:50,824
And that He touches
your father's heart.

567
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:59,383
Daughter of mine!
Daughter of mine!

568
01:19:04,978 --> 01:19:10,918
- I bet you we won't find it.
- Anselmo, we'll be right back!

569
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:14,146
After all these years,
she can't have kept it.

570
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:17,484
She keeps everything.
Aunt Pilar is a magpie.

571
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:21,568
Magpies steal shiny objects
so they can find their nests, but...

572
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:24,450
I think we won't find anything.
- Nothing to lose by trying.

573
01:19:24,451 --> 01:19:27,799
- Ok.
- I even believe I saw them once.

574
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:30,575
D'you know what she keeps?
- What?

575
01:19:30,576 --> 01:19:35,334
Those old soda bottles,
the ones with those small balls?

576
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:38,083
She's got a full pack.
"Everything is useful... "

577
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:39,228
"It's a sin to trash things!"

578
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,461
Have you seen her apartment?
I call it The Museum.

579
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:48,809
Some rooms are
just like in those times.

580
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:53,340
- Really? - Sure, you don't notice
because you see them every day.

581
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:55,730
They must be somewhere
around here...

582
01:20:02,748 --> 01:20:05,833
I had an idea
that this was a lot larger...

583
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:08,310
What a mess, huh?

584
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:15,709
Look at this... Come, come!
Look at this mess.

585
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:19,442
It's preposterous!

586
01:20:21,824 --> 01:20:24,853
I know!
They're in the trunk!

587
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:28,861
This used to be in my room.

588
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:32,214
The washbasin?

589
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,204
Yes...

590
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:41,972
Luis, come. Come!
Help me with this stuff.

591
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:01,263
Isn't this funny...

592
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:11,939
Hey!
Just like I said.

593
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,243
HISTORY OF SPAIN

594
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:27,261
How hard it was to write
without blotting...

595
01:21:29,812 --> 01:21:33,738
You'd be so very careful,
and all of a sudden, poof!

596
01:21:35,449 --> 01:21:39,236
And when the pen got snagged?
Everything was perfect...

597
01:21:39,237 --> 01:21:43,868
and out of the blue, zap!
A mess! Blots everywhere!

598
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:47,546
But today, with ballpoints...

599
01:21:53,525 --> 01:21:55,606
"The city where you live"

600
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:02,999
"I live in a city and my parish church
is San Lorenzo...

601
01:22:03,368 --> 01:22:07,592
"My house is in front of a park
where we can play very well.

602
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:13,862
"The city has several churches
and a very important cathedral.

603
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:18,564
"I live with my grandmother
and aunts...

604
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:23,081
"because my parents aren't here. "

605
01:22:23,456 --> 01:22:27,241
Good! You've got your textbooks
and your notebooks!

606
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,801
Happy now?
- Yes, thanks a lot.

607
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:42,069
I'll have a great time reading them.
Really.

608
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:53,696
- Where are you going, Luis?
- Wait, I want to see something.

609
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:01,301
Some crazy idea!

610
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:09,351
You'll smash your head!
- It's all right. Come. Come!

611
01:23:09,976 --> 01:23:12,130
- You're crazy!
- Come, come!

612
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:14,942
- I can't go out there!
- It's very easy!

613
01:23:14,943 --> 01:23:16,779
- It's not easy!
- No danger at all!

614
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,323
Sure, not for you!

615
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:26,890
See how easy it was?
Very good!

616
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:30,305
Nobody will believe this.

617
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,835
- Sit down. - On the roof?
- Sure, come here.

618
01:23:44,418 --> 01:23:47,210
Now I know for sure you're crazy.

619
01:23:53,131 --> 01:23:57,338
This is so childish.
Somebody will see us.

620
01:24:13,285 --> 01:24:16,160
Those are the bells of the Clarisas.

621
01:25:05,387 --> 01:25:09,782
Luis!
Luis! Are you there?

622
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:12,070
Come down at once!

623
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:28,865
What were you doing on the roof?

624
01:25:35,783 --> 01:25:39,273
Angélica, where is she?

625
01:25:43,523 --> 01:25:47,794
Angélica! Angélica!

626
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,111
Come here at once!

627
01:26:57,273 --> 01:26:59,664
Keep on with that!

628
01:27:01,559 --> 01:27:04,069
Parra, come here!

629
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:17,303
Enough!
Go to your desk.

630
01:27:21,562 --> 01:27:24,329
Read this.
Only the underlined parts.

631
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:28,349
"... among all the innocent victims
sacrificed to the fury of the reds...

632
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,485
"the death of the child
José Angel Cerneda is maybe...

633
01:27:31,486 --> 01:27:34,843
"the one that causes the
greatest and deepest indignation.

634
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:39,031
"The eleven year old child
José Angel Cerneda...

635
01:27:39,032 --> 01:27:43,355
"was playing in his school's playground,
and was torn apart by the shrapnel...

636
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:46,686
of one of the bombs
of the criminal air raid. "

637
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:49,858
Go back to your seat.

638
01:27:57,371 --> 01:28:03,581
A village in the rearguard.
Just like the one we live in.

639
01:28:04,023 --> 01:28:10,247
A school,
just like the one we're in.

640
01:28:10,587 --> 01:28:14,823
A boy,
just like you.

641
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:23,524
The boy is eleven.
He's playing in the playground.

642
01:28:23,588 --> 01:28:29,378
Happy, blissful, joyful,
totally unaware...

643
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:35,223
that life can be lost in a second.

644
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:41,817
In the sky, a deep hum is heard.
The boy doesn't worry.

645
01:28:42,284 --> 01:28:46,633
He even rises his inquisitive eyes...

646
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:51,026
He's so used to seeing
airplanes fly by!

647
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:55,587
The boy's name is José Angel Cerneda...

648
01:28:56,323 --> 01:29:00,390
He's eleven years old.
And I wonder:

649
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:07,216
Is he in God's Grace?
Or has he lived in Sin?

650
01:29:08,747 --> 01:29:12,199
José Angel sees,
in the blue yonder of the sky...

651
01:29:12,558 --> 01:29:17,162
the tiny silhouettes of the aircraft.

652
01:29:18,501 --> 01:29:21,494
How long has it been
since his last confession?

653
01:29:21,883 --> 01:29:25,646
How has he lived
since his last confession?

654
01:29:25,997 --> 01:29:30,212
Does he fear God,
and has he avoided Sin?

655
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:35,502
Or, on the contrary,
at the last moment...

656
01:29:36,982 --> 01:29:39,730
he's fallen into Temptation?

657
01:29:40,195 --> 01:29:43,734
The roar of the aircraft's engines
is now awful!

658
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:48,925
All of a sudden, the earth shakes!
It trembles with the explosions!

659
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:54,017
The bombs spread fire,
destruction, death!

660
01:29:55,668 --> 01:30:00,769
One of them
reaches José Angel Cerneda.

661
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:05,659
Eleven years old. When he was
playing in the school's playground.

662
01:30:06,462 --> 01:30:12,612
Tears his flesh apart, disintegrates
his body. Takes away his life.

663
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:20,503
Just like that poor unlucky child,

664
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,748
you don't think about death.

665
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:29,942
However, death may come tomorrow,
tonight, within an hour...

666
01:30:32,392 --> 01:30:35,591
Even right now!

667
01:30:36,018 --> 01:30:40,785
Look into your souls, and if
you are in Sin, may God help you!

668
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:46,288
Because Sin would condemn you
to Hell for all the eternity.

669
01:30:46,631 --> 01:30:52,032
Eternity.
What do we mean by "eternity"?

670
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:58,364
Look a the blackboard.
Try reading that number.

671
01:30:59,242 --> 01:31:05,387
A one followed by zeros.
Suppose they are years.

672
01:31:05,492 --> 01:31:10,492
Or better, centuries.
Or, even better, millenniums.

673
01:31:11,027 --> 01:31:16,294
Well, when all those millennia
have passed...

674
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:23,736
it won't be more than
a millisecond of eternity.

675
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:35,533
"Mine are the heavens,
and mine is the earth...

676
01:31:35,534 --> 01:31:39,852
"Mine are the nations, the just
are mine but not the sinners...

677
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:42,769
"The angels are mine,
and the Mother of God...

678
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:46,725
"And all things are mine,
and God is mine and for me...

679
01:31:47,054 --> 01:31:49,565
"Because Christ is mine
and all for me. "

680
01:31:50,394 --> 01:31:52,875
"What do you ask then,
and seek, my soul?

681
01:31:52,876 --> 01:31:54,959
"Yours is all of this,
and all for you.

682
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:56,640
"Do not engage yourself
in something less,

683
01:31:56,641 --> 01:32:00,736
"nor pay heed to the crumbs
which fall from your Father's table.

684
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:02,581
"Go forth and exult in your Glory!

685
01:32:02,582 --> 01:32:04,568
"Hide yourself in It and rejoice,

686
01:32:04,569 --> 01:32:07,419
"and you will obtain
the deepest desires of your heart.

687
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:10,076
"... greatest love of God... "

688
01:32:51,306 --> 01:32:53,658
My leg! My leg!

689
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,717
- Hi! - Hi! Is Maruja in?
- No, today is Thursday.

690
01:33:56,718 --> 01:34:00,033
But of course!
I just need some flour.

691
01:34:00,465 --> 01:34:04,236
- Well, come in.
- Thanks!

692
01:34:12,542 --> 01:34:15,253
Don't mind me.
Get on with your business.

693
01:34:15,254 --> 01:34:19,800
- No, I wasn't doing anything.
- Where could the flour be?

694
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:23,282
I don't know where they keep it.

695
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:26,604
It's not here, either.

696
01:34:28,015 --> 01:34:29,370
Here it says...

697
01:34:31,158 --> 01:34:34,804
- That's right. Fool of me!
- And there is some, too.

698
01:34:34,968 --> 01:34:38,803
Yes! Thank you.

699
01:34:42,059 --> 01:34:44,894
Oh! I'm sorry.

700
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:52,449
- What's the matter with you?
- With me?

701
01:34:53,578 --> 01:34:55,896
Nothing. Why?

702
01:34:56,716 --> 01:34:58,823
You look nervous.

703
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:01,428
Nervous?

704
01:35:04,674 --> 01:35:07,241
How else could I be?

705
01:35:11,084 --> 01:35:12,644
Anselmo?

706
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:22,836
Wouldn't it be better
to face the situation?

707
01:35:25,973 --> 01:35:28,989
What for?
To get a divorce?

708
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:32,304
Why, yes. Why not?

709
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:45,599
Take this. My daughter asked me
to give it back to you.

710
01:35:55,714 --> 01:36:01,739
Oh, Luis! Luis!
I'm so lonely, Luis!

711
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:07,542
Luis! I'm all alone!

712
01:36:17,217 --> 01:36:18,258
Come on.

713
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,979
Calm down.

714
01:36:30,459 --> 01:36:33,701
You know you can count on me
for whatever you need.

715
01:36:37,003 --> 01:36:42,301
Forgive me.
I've got no right...

716
01:36:42,706 --> 01:36:46,459
to bother you with my problems.
- Angélica!

717
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:11,629
I must get out of here.

718
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:16,128
What am I doing here?

719
01:37:18,118 --> 01:37:19,159
Nothing.

720
01:37:27,652 --> 01:37:31,312
I'll never see you again.
I know.

721
01:37:31,313 --> 01:37:34,894
No aunt, I'll be back next summer.
You'll see.

722
01:37:34,895 --> 01:37:39,102
Sure, man. But let us know first,
we might be on vacation.

723
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:42,421
- Right.
- I'll miss you so much.

724
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:47,384
Son!
- So will I.

725
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:49,650
But I must go back to work.

726
01:37:49,651 --> 01:37:53,572
Luis. Luis, give me a hug!

727
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,391
Anything you need,
I'm at your service.

728
01:37:57,393 --> 01:38:00,528
I travel quite a lot to Barcelona.
I'll call you.

729
01:38:01,828 --> 01:38:05,102
Well, I'm planning to move
to a new apartment...

730
01:38:06,336 --> 01:38:09,383
I'll let you know when I've moved.
- That will be fine.

731
01:38:20,345 --> 01:38:23,797
Farewell, Angélica.
- Farewell, Luis.

732
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:33,050
- Goodbye, Luis.
- Goodbye.

733
01:38:36,596 --> 01:38:42,575
Luis...
Tell your father...

734
01:38:44,429 --> 01:38:49,727
No, nothing...
- Goodbye.

735
01:39:18,764 --> 01:39:21,882
- Leaving already? - Yes.
- A kiss.

736
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:28,073
Don't forget to write.
- Wait.

737
01:39:29,867 --> 01:39:32,857
Can I go for a ride? - Do you know
how to ride a bike? - Sure.

738
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:36,078
- It belongs to that boy.
- Ask him if I can.

739
01:39:36,183 --> 01:39:39,088
- Manolo! Manolo!
- What?

740
01:39:39,418 --> 01:39:42,092
- Can he go for a ride?
- Sure.

741
01:39:53,979 --> 01:39:56,593
- Wanna come?
- Why not?

742
01:40:19,091 --> 01:40:21,302
And what if you father
doesn't want me there?

743
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:23,637
He will. You'll see.

744
01:40:24,956 --> 01:40:28,023
- How big is Madrid?
- Huh, very big!

745
01:40:28,024 --> 01:40:30,106
I bet I'll like it.

746
01:40:31,518 --> 01:40:36,030
But my mother will be very lonely.
I bet she'll cry.

747
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:40,567
We'll send her a letter.
Are you happy?

748
01:41:03,651 --> 01:41:07,694
They're going to stop us!
- Why? - Because of the war.

749
01:41:07,884 --> 01:41:09,446
Hold on!

750
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:24,955
Hey, you, there!
Kids! Where are you going?

751
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:28,560
- Keep moving.
- Hey!

752
01:41:52,109 --> 01:41:55,623
I'm thirsty. Can I have a drink?

753
01:42:04,982 --> 01:42:09,048
- Still a long ride ahead?
- Quite long.

754
01:42:11,844 --> 01:42:14,852
Hey, you.
Come here at once.

755
01:42:15,637 --> 01:42:16,782
Come on!

756
01:42:20,337 --> 01:42:23,113
Why did you leave the road?

757
01:42:24,974 --> 01:42:30,523
- Because... because...
- We've not done anything wrong.

758
01:42:31,525 --> 01:42:35,005
Ok, come with me.
Come on.

759
01:42:44,144 --> 01:42:48,687
Angélica! Angélica, my child!
Look at yourself!

760
01:42:49,044 --> 01:42:52,577
- Thanks a lot, much appreciated.
- It's nothing. They're just kids.

761
01:42:53,427 --> 01:42:56,390
- Sure, just kids' mischief.
- Bye. - Thank you.

762
01:43:12,499 --> 01:43:15,249
- Anselmo, don't, please!
- You stay out of this!

763
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:18,565
Leave him,
he must learn his lesson!

764
01:43:24,525 --> 01:43:27,605
Take off your sweater.

765
01:43:44,007 --> 01:43:46,401
Get on your knees.
