1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,800


2
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,600
Jud?

3
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,000
What?

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,300
Yer'd better get up.

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,200
The alarm's gone off, yer know.

6
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,700
Do you think I don't know?

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,600
- Jud?
- What?

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,900
- You'll be late.
- Shut it.

9
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,100
- Clock's not fast, yer know.
- I said, shut it.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,900
- Give over. That hurts!
- Well, shut it, then.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,100
I'll tell me mam on you.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
Shut yer stinkin' mouth.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, Christ!

14
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,800
- Set clock on for me, Jud. For seven.
- Set it yerself.

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Go on, you're up.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Hands off cocks; on socks.

17
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,600
You rotten sod!
Just because you've to get up!

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,800
- Another few weeks, you'll be up with me.
- I'll not.

19
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,300
- Won't yer?
- No, cos I'm not gonna work down the pit.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
- Where are yer gonna work?
- I don't know, but not down the pit.

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
No. And have I to tell yer why?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
For one thing, you've to be able
to read and write before they set yer on.

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,500
And they wouldn't have
a weedy little twat like thee.

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,000
- Switch t'light out, then.
- Switch it out yerself.

25
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,000
Me billicking bike!

26
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,800
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Why? I'm not late, am I?

27
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,100
Very near.

28
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,600
- I nearly was, though.
- What do yer mean?

29
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,800
Our Jud, he's taken t'bike.

30
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
- What you gonna do, then?
- Walk it.

31
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,400
- How long d'yer think that's gonna take?
- It'll not take me long.

32
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,000
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job. Good lads, too, most of 'em.

33
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,000
- From up Firs Hill, round there.
- I haven't let you down, have I?

34
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,700
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'. Not very promisin'.

35
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,500
- A bit on the nippy side as well, I think.
- Aye.

36
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,300
- 20 Players tipped, please.
- Oh, right.

37
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,500
- I've not got 20. Will two tens do?
- Yes. That'll be quite all right, thank you.

38
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you. Right. Cheerio.

39
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,300
- Cheerio. Good mornin', sir.
- Good mornin'.

40
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
You know what they said
when I took you on?

41
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,800
"You'll have to keep yer eyes open now.
He'll take yer breath if you're not careful."

42
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,300
- I haven't taken owt of yours yet, have I?
- I haven't given you a chance, that's why.

43
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
You don't have to.
I haven't been nicking for ages now.

44
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
- Ah, well, don't stand about all day.
- I'm goin'.

45
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,300
- How tha goin' on?
- Not so bad.

46
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,500
Get one of these. Better than walkin'.

47
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,100
Only just. I could go
faster on a kid's scooter.

48
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Tha knows what I always say; third-class
ridin's better than first-class walkin'.

49
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,100
Third-class ridin'? In that ramshack?

50
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Ramshack? This is one of best models
t'dairy's got. Cheeky! Sithee tomorrow.

51
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,000
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Tha's got too much rattle, thee.

52
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,400
"Desperate Dan is stronger than all,
but this opponent makes him fall."

53
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,700
"- Right! Where do you want to fight?
- Right here!"

54
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,500
"SKlD."

55
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
"Down I go again!
What's making me fall?"

56
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,500
"Now's my chance to -
jump on his chest!"

57
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
"THUD."

58
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
"You won't catch me out this time,
you braggart!"

59
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
"A sock in the midriff
will settle your game!"

60
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
"SPLASH."

61
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,400
"What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!"

62
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,600
"- Give me that tube back!
- That's how he kept making me slip!"

63
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,300
"He was squirting
invisible grease under my feet!"

64
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,300
"You dirty twister!
It's time somebody taught you a lesson!"

65
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
"- Take that!
- CRASH!"

66
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,000
"- Where did he end up?
- In the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!"

67
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
- Evenin'.
- I told yer it wouldn't take me long.

68
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
What did you do?
Throw 'em over the gates?

69
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,400
- I know some short cuts ont' way back.
- I'll bet you do! Over other folk's property.

70
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,700
How many times d'yer want
tellin' where to put that bag?

71
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,100
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

72
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
ls it that late?

73
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,000
I wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

74
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,200
Oh, Mr Porter! Watch it, Mr Porter.

75
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Yer clumsy young bugger!
What yer tryin' to do? Kill me?

76
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
I lost me balance.

77
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,500
I wouldn't put it past yer, either.
I fair felt me heart go then.

78
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Just sit down here and
relax a couple o' minutes.

79
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,400
Are yer all right now?

80
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
- I'm bloody champion!
- I'll be off, then.

81
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
And don't be late tonight.

82
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,000
- Allot?
- Sir.

83
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,500
- Bowser?
- Sir.

84
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Bridges?

85
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,100
- Absent, sir.
- Absent, Bridges. Casper?

86
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,700
- Sir.
- Clegg?

87
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
- Sir.
- Fisher?

88
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
German Bight.

89
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
- Did you say something?
- I didn't mean to, sir.

90
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,000
Stand up, lad. What did you say?

91
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,800
- German Bight, sir.
- He's daft, sir.

92
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,600
- ls this your ridiculous idea of a joke?
- No, sir.

93
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,000
- What is the idea, then?
- When you said "Fisher", sir.

94
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,500
- What about it?
- Fisher. German Bight.

95
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,400
It's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

96
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,300
I like to hear it every night, sir.
I like t'names.

97
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,100
So you thought you'd enlighten me and
the class with your idiotic information?

98
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
- No, sir.
- Making a mess of my register.

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
- lt just came out.
- And so did you, Casper.

100
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,100
Just come out from under a stone.

101
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I said, quiet!

102
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,300
ls anyone else absent
besides Bridges and Fisher?

103
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,800
Any girls?

104
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,000
Right. Now, then,
it's time you were off to assembly.

105
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,600
One row at a time. This one, stand.

106
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,000
Move forward.

107
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Pamela, you're talking. Cut it out.

108
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,600
- Billy, what do yer mean, Germans bite?
- I'm sick of hearin' about "Germans bite"!

109
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,900
- Are yer comin' nestin' tomorrow?
- Ar.

110
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,900
- What time?
- About six.

111
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,700
Don't be late.

112
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
- Coming, Guth?
- Where?

113
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
- Nestin'.

114
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,800

115
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,600
- About six.
- Can't. Takin' t'girlfriend to Sheffield.

116
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,300
Excuses!

117
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400


118
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
What do you want
at this time in the morning?

119
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,600
Get your Mac up.

120
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,800
Hey, he's fast asleep.
I can't get him up at this time.

121
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,800
- Just get him up for me.
- His father, he'll be down to yer.

122
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm not bothered about his father.
I want your MacDowall.

123
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
- Bugger off, you little sod!
- Get him up, will yer?

124
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
- I'm not gettin' him up.
- He said I had to get him up.

125
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,100
He's fast asleep and he's not goin',
so just get off with yer.

126
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300


127
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,800
- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

128
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,200
Bugger off, then. It's private property.

129
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,200
- Can I get up to that kestrel's nest?
- What kestrel's nest?

130
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
- Up wall.
- No nest up there, so off tha goes.

131
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
There is. I've seen 'em come out.

132
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,000
What will tha do? Take all its eggs?

133
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,300
- They're young 'uns.
- Nowt to go up for, then, is there?

134
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Can I come to t'bottom, then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

135
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,000
Come on, then.

136
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
There it is. That big hole.

137
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,100
- It's nested there for donkey's years now.
- And I never knew.

138
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,400
- No, there's not many that does.
- Been watchin' from t'wood there.

139
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,100
Goes onto t'post, then hovers,

140
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,900
then swoops down onto t'prey,
carries it off to t'young 'uns. Looks great.

141
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
I've been gonna knock
that wall down for ages.

142
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,900
- What for?
- It's dangerous. I won't let her play near.

143
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,100
- lf I lived round here, l'd train a young 'un.
- Would yer?

144
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,300
Yer can train 'em.

145
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Do yer know how?

146
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
- Do you know?
- No. There's not many that does.

147
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,000
They're hard to train.
lf they're not kept properly, it's criminal.

148
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,700
- Do yer know anybody who's kept 'em?
- One or two.

149
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,100
But, er, they had to let 'em go
because they're hard to train.

150
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,100
Where can I find out about 'em, then?

151
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,400
Well, probably t'public library.
They'll have some books on 'em.

152
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,200
- Where's that?
- Down int' city.

153
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,800
Hey, are you a member?

154
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,400
- What do yer mean?
- Are you a member of the library?

155
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,200
I don't know about that.
I only want a book on falconry.

156
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,800
You have to be a member
to take a book out.

157
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,400
- I only want one.
- Have you filled one of these forms in?

158
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,600
- No.
- You're not a member, then.

159
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,600
You'll have to take one of these home
for your father to sign.

160
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,100
- Me dad's away.
- You can wait till he comes back home.

161
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,600
- I don't mean that. I mean he's left home.
- I see. Your mother'll have to sign it.

162
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,000
Ar, but she's at work
and she'll not be home till tea time.

163
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,900
There's no rush, is there?

164
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
I've never broke a book.
I haven't tore it, or...

165
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Look at your hands. They're filthy.
We'll end up with dirty books that way.

166
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,000
- I don't ready dirty books.
- I hope you don't. You're not old enough.

167
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Me mam knows someone who
works here. That'll help, won't it?

168
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,600
No, not at all.
You still have to have the back signed.

169
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,800
To be a member, you'll have
to have somebody over 21

170
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
who is on the borough
electoral roll to sign it.

171
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
- I'm over 21 .
- You're not over 21 .

172
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,900
- Ar, but I vote.
- You don't vote. You're not...

173
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,600
I vote for me mam.
She dun't like votin', so I do it.

174
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,300
- Just have to wait for it, won't you?
- Where would I find a book? In a shop?

175
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,000
You'd have to go down the street.
There's a second-hand bookshop there.

176
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,900
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes.

177
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm rather interested in Noël Coward's
autobiography, Present lndicative.

178
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
- What's tha got this for? Tha can't read.
- Give us it here.

179
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Get off! Falconry?
What's tha want to know about falconry?

180
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,600
Give it here!

181
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,000
- Where've yer got this from?
- I've lent it.

182
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,800
Stole it, more like.
Where've yer got it from?

183
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
A shop in town.

184
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,600
You must be crackers. I could understand
if it were money, but chuff me, not a book!

185
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,800
Have it!

186
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,500
Look what yer've done.
I'm lookin' after this book.

187
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,500
- And what better off will yer be?
- A lot. I'm gonna get a kestrel and train it.

188
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,100
Train it? Yer couldn't train a flea.

189
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,300
Anyway, where yer gonna get
a kestrel from?

190
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
- I know a nest.
- Yer don't.

191
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
- All right, then, I don't.
- Where?

192
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
- I'm not tellin'.
- I said, where?

193
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,200
- You're hurtin' me arm!
- Where, then?

194
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Monastery Farm.

195
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,800
Yer could have broke me arm then.

196
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,600
I'll have to see about
goin' round there wi' me gun.

197
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,800
- I'll tell t'farmer on yer.
- Why? What's he got to do with it?

198
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,400
- He protects 'em.
- Protects 'em?

199
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Hawks are a menace to farmers.
They eat all the poultry an' that.

200
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,000
Ar, I know. They dive down
onto t'cows and take 'em away.

201
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,400
- Funny bugger.
- Well, yer talk daft. They're only small.

202
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,700
They eat mice, insects,
and little birds sometimes.

203
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Hope I'll be watchin' a bird tonight. She'll
not have feathers. Not all over, anyway.

204
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,700
- Have you had any tea yet, Billy?
- No.

205
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Well, get some, then.
You where t'pantry is.

206
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,200
- How's yer horses gone on, Jud?
- Not bad. Two winners.

207
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
You haven't.
Might be gettin' tret tonight, then.

208
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,200
- Oh, somebody treats you every night.
- Shut it!

209
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,100
And don't you be comin' home
blind drunk again, Jud.

210
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,700
- Why? Are yer entertainin'?
- You're kiddin'.

211
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,200
lf I entertained as much as you,
I shall do all right, shan't I?

212
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,700
What tripe you've been
goin' out with lately. My God!

213
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,800
- Better'n that cripple you bring home.
- What cripple? Reg? He's not a cripple.

214
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,600
Will be if he comes in here tonight. At
least them I go out with are not tightfisted.

215
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,400
Who is? You chuck your bloody money
around like a Scotchman with no arms!

216
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,800
Have to use a spanner to get
a threepenny bit out of his hand.

217
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
Aye, because he's comin' wise to you.

218
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
Listen, what about him you're goin' wi'?
Tight as a camel's arse in a sandstorm.

219
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,100
Keep yer hand over yer mouth talkin'
about him, cos yer'll get into trouble.

220
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
- You're not too big for a hidin'.
- He can't do it.

221
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,300
Who can't? You might find that
he's bigger than what you think.

222
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
More chance of gettin' struck by lightnin'.

223
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,000
Shut yer face. I'm fed up of it. It's every
Saturday night. I get ready, you're at me.

224
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,200
And I always go out in
a bloomin' mess and all upset.

225
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,700
Gettin' too big for yer boots,
thinking you own t'house.

226
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,900
You don't own it yet, yer know.

227
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,400
- No. I will do one day, though, won't I?
- Over my dead body.

228
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,800
- That's what I says, I'll own it one day.
- I'm sick on it, Jud. I am, pig sick.

229
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,700
I work every day, and every Saturday
night I go for a drink and you upset me.

230
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
- I don't think I'll go, I'm that fed up.
- I'll not miss yer.

231
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,400
You'll not miss nowt, will you?
You'll be out there.

232
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
- Yeah.
- Aye.

233
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
By, what a smart-lookin' kid int' mirror.
Some bird's gonna be lucky tonight.

234
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,900
Listen to God's gift to woman.

235
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,300
Fancy buying me
a brandy and pep tonight?

236
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Aye. Hope it keeps fine for yer.

237
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,900
These could have done
with a bit of a polish.

238
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Still, never mind, it's gonna be dark soon.

239
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,300
What you gonna do
with yerself tonight, love?

240
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Read me book.

241
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,800
Oh, look at t'time. Five to seven.
I'm gonna be late again.

242
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,800
Listen, Billy, there's two bob here. Chuck?

243
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,700
Get yerself some pop
and some crisps. D'yer hear?

244
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Yeah.

245
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,100
- And don't still be up when I come in.
- No.

246
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
G'night, then.

247
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,400
# I came home unexpectedly

248
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,400
# And caught her crying needlessly

249
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,700
# In the middle of the day

250
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,800
# And it was in the early spring
when flowers bloom and robins sing

251
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
# She went away

252
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,600
# And honey, I miss you

253
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
# And I'm bein' good

254
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,700
# And l'd love to be with you

255
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,000
lf only I could

256
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Folks, thank you.

257
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,300


258
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Now a Tremeloes number.

259
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,800
Yer can have a good time up to a point,

260
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,700
but there comes a time
when you want to settle down.

261
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm gettin' a bit fed up
of workin' all t'time.

262
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,000
There's plenty of time
to settle down, in't there?

263
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,700
Depends what yer lookin' for, dun't it?

264
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,200
I just like to come home, get me meal,
get a bath, change and out, me.

265
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Not a care int' world.

266
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
When you've been married once
and yer marry a wrong 'un,

267
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,600
it makes yer a bit apprehensive
towards gettin'...

268
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,800
Well, you know, don't yer?
Cos he were never good.

269
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,400
But it makes yer a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

270
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
lf she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me.

271
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,900
She's old enough to know her own mind.

272
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
- Well, yeah...
- ..settle down.

273
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You can never tell with Billy. I sit
and wonder sometimes what he will do.

274
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Perhaps if he had been brought up
in a different environment

275
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,600
and had a better education, he would
have made more than what he has.

276
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,400
At the moment, he's hopeless.
He's a hopeless case, in't he?

277
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,800
# Oh, won't you please come back?

278
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,200
# Oh, won't you please come back?

279
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm happy as I am.
I doubt if I could be any happier.

280
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,300
My lads have got nowt.
I don't know what they're gonna do.

281
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't know whether
our Jud wanted to be a miner.

282
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,100
From my point of view, Reg, when
a woman gets to my age, you've two kids,

283
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
you want to be settlin' down
wi' a nice house

284
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,000
and somebody to come home to yer,
and be lookin' after 'em.

285
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,900
- Like I look after you.
- Ar, but you're not married to me.

286
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,100
- Never mind. Giz a kiss.
- Don't be so damned daft!

287
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
- He's had too much ale again.
- I haven't.

288
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
- Yer have.
- I haven't.

289
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Say, Mam, have you brought
that cripple wi' yer?

290
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,000
Keep it shut. Keep it shut.

291
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,700
Keep it shut, all right?

292
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Say, did everybody hear
about him when he got married?

293
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,100
He got confetti on elastic.
That's how tightfisted he is.

294
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,900
lf he wants trouble, I'll give him trouble.

295
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,700
# Oh, along the road there lives
a guy l'd like you all to know

296
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,100
# He grew a great big marrow
for the little flower show

297
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,100
# He showed it to a lady
who lived just along the way

298
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,700
# And when she saw the size of it
he heard the lady say

299
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
# Ooohhh!

300
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,300
# What a beauty!

301
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,600
# Oh, I've never seen one
as big as that before

302
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
# Ooohhh!

303
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,900
# What a whopper!

304
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
# lt must be 18 inches long or more

305
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,100
# It's such a lovely colour,
it's nice and round and fat

306
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,500
# Whoever thought a marrow
could grow as big as that?

307
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
# Ooohhh!

308
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,500
# Oh, what a beauty

309
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,300
# I've never seen one as big as it before

310
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200


311
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Billy, are tha asleep?

312
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,100
Bleedin' things.

313
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,400
Now, Billy!

314
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,600
- Give over.
- Billy!

315
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,200
Help me get these bleedin' trousers off.

316
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
Come on! Don't be all bleedin' night.

317
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
I'm fed up with this bloody game.

318
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,100
It's every Saturday night alike.

319
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Don't help, will tha?

320
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,000
Get back to sleep, yer... pig.

321
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,500
Hog. Sow.

322
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,900
Yer drunken bastard.

323
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,700
Tha dun't like bein' called a bastard,
does tha? Yer bastard!

324
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Yer pig.

325
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,600
Pig.

326
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Hog.

327
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Sow.

328
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,700
Drunken... bastard.

329
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,200
Bastard. Bastard.

330
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,800
Drunken... pig.

331
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,600
Pig.

332
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,000
Billy! Billy!

333
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,400
"Three good meals a day
I'll give him for about a fortnight."

334
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,100
"lf a piece of meat held between
the finger and thumb of the gloved hand

335
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,400
is offered to the hawk, it will probably
bend down and pull at it with its beak."

336
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
C'mon.

337
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,100
"As soon as the hawk
will come a leash length indoors,

338
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,000
she may be tried off a fence
or gatepost out of doors."

339
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,800
"lt is quite likely that although she was
coming to the fist promptly indoors,

340
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,100
she will now refuse to come at all."

341
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,200
"She will stand looking around her and
ignoring the meat and fist in front of her."

342
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
"When she will come
a leash length outside,

343
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,600
she can be called greater distances
by means of a creance,

344
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,000
a long cord which is attached
to the hawk to prevent her escaping."

345
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,100
"With luck,
she will not attempt to fly away."

346
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Come on, then.

347
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,800
Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

348
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, lass.

349
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

350
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,300
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

351
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,600
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

352
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Come on, then. Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

353
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, Kes.

354
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
(theme from "Grandstand")

355
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,300


356
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,600
Come on, boys, get ready!

357
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Get ready now, you.

358
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,800
Skiving again, Guthrie.

359
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,500
No, sir. Mr Farthing
has been talking to me.

360
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I'll bet that was stimulating
for him, wasn't it, lad?

361
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,400
- What does that mean, sir?
- The conversation. What do you think?

362
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,400
Does it mean "stimulate", sir?

363
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,800
Stimulating, you fool!
S-t-i-m-i-l-a-t-i-n-g. Stimulating.

364
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,400
Come on, get ready.
You're two weeks late already.

365
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,600
You three, get down,
before I come and put yer down.

366
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,200
Casper, what d'you think you're doing?
Get down. Why aren't you changed?

367
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,200
- I've no kit, sir.
- Casper, you make me sick.

368
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,100
Every lesson it's the same old story,
"Please, sir, I've no kit, sir."

369
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Every lesson for four years, you've
begged, borrowed, skived and scrounged.

370
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,700
Why is it, Casper, when all this lot
can provide kit, you can't?

371
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,600
Don't know. Me mam says
it's a waste of money now I'm leavin'.

372
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,400
You haven't been leaving
the past four years, have you?

373
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,600
No, sir.

374
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,600
- Use your spending money.
- Don't like football, sir.

375
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,800
- What's that got to do with it, Casper?
- Don't know.

376
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,600
- Anyway, I don't get enough.
- Get a job, then, lad. Get a job.

377
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,300
- I've got one, sir.
- They pay you, don't they?

378
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,700
Yeah, but I have to give it to me mam.
I'm payin' me fines, like...

379
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,600
You should keep out of trouble, lad!
Keep out of trouble.

380
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,200
- I haven't bin in trouble since last time.
- I'll get you some kit, Casper.

381
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,700
- Tha's had it now, Casper.
- Shut thi mouth!

382
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
Right, Casper. Get into those.

383
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,300


384
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,100
- They'll not fit me.
- You can get into them, can't you?

385
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,700
Yes, sir.

386
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,500
They'll keep your cobblers warm, Casper.

387
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,600
- Take your vest and underpants off.
- Don't wear 'em, sir.

388
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Casper, tuck 'em in.
Thi privates are showin'.

389
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,100
The muscleman o' t'year!

390
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,900


391
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,800
- He's just come back from Biafra.
- Pull them up, Casper!

392
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,800
- Pull them up!
- Like that, sir?

393
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,700
Pull them down, Casper.

394
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,900
You're too daft to laugh at.

395
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,200
Right. They'll do there.

396
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,600
You lot, come on, get changed.
Wasted enough time already.

397
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,300
I'll give you a sample
of my footballing skills.

398
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,400
A rare delight.

399
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,600
Watch yourself, Casper!

400
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,500
I won't tell you again, Crossland!

401
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Come on, move.

402
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,100
Off that goal post!

403
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Off that goal post.
I'll be up there in a minute!

404
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Come here, Tibbut.
We'll pick two teams. You're the captain.

405
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,300
Right, line up on the halfway line, quickly.

406
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,000
- I'll have first pick. Paget.
- That's not fair. You'll get t'best players.

407
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,900
D'you wanna play football,
or d'you wanna do some maths?

408
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,900
Paget, then. Come here.

409
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,400
- Speed.
- Walker.

410
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,800
- Clark.
- Crossland.

411
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,000
- Kelsey.
- Rowe.

412
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,400
Er... Clegg.

413
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Bloody hell, I'm frozen already.

414
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

415
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,200
- Ryder.
- Parker.

416
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,700
- Norton.
- Come on, Parker.

417
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,100
Casper, I've got to have yer. Come on.

418
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,800
Don't act the goat.
Come on, put 'em round your waist.

419
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,700
Now.

420
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

421
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,000
Paget, you're inside right. Come on.

422
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,400
- Who are you today, sir? Liverpool?
- Don't you know your club colours?

423
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,000
- Manchester United, this.
- Are you playing Denis Law, striker?

424
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,100
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for striker.

425
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,600
Charlton's not as quick
ont' turn as Law, is he?

426
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,000
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. l...

427
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,100
You trying to tell me? Anyway,
Denis Law's in the wash this week.

428
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

429
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,400
- Who's in the goals?
- Casper.

430
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,400
- Casper, what position are you playing?
- Don't know, sir. lnside left?

431
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,400
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? In the goals.

432
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,400
- I can't...
- Now's your chance to learn. In the goals.

433
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,700
Quick about it.

434
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,400
- We're Manchester United. Who are you?
- Spurs, then there's no clash of colours.

435
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,200
Right, then, it's Manchester United versus
Spurs in this cup tie here at Old Trafford.

436
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,700
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

437
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,400
Come on, Speed.
What you playin' at, lad?

438
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,600
Yer should be on the move, lad.
lt was at yer feet!

439
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,900
Cross it, Ryder. Quickly.

440
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
Where's t'rest of my team?

441
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,500
Come on, quickly, Casper. I've never
seen such slack work in my life.

442
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,300
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

443
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,800
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

444
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,400
I have to keep this shirt on after.

445
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,200
Cross the ball!

446
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,600
And Charlton goes through, and...

447
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh, never! Never!

448
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,000
- Penalty!
- Never.

449
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,600
Who do you think you are? Bremner?

450
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

451
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,400
Outside that semicircle.

452
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,400
- Shall I take it, sir?
- I take the penalties on this team.

453
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,800
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

454
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,300
Just watch this, Guthrie. Right, Clegg?

455
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,000
You moved. You moved. Put it back.

456
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,000


457
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,900
Penalty.

458
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,500
Behind the 18-yard line.

459
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,900
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else I'll drop tha.

460
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,300
- He moved!
- I didn't move, sir.

461
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,800
The referee's decision is final.

462
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
- You should have done it the first time.
- And that, boys, is how to take a penalty.

463
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
Look one way and kick the other.

464
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,200
Come on, Tibbut, lad.

465
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,700
And Bobby Charlton has
equalised for Manchester United,

466
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,700
and the score is one goal each.

467
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,700
That fat twat!
He wants bleedin' milkin'. That big fat git!

468
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,600
What did you say? What did you say?

469
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,800
- Nowt, sir.
- Get off! In that changin' room! Get off!

470
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,400
- I didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

471
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,700
- I won't tolerate that on a football pitch.
- That's our captain, sir.

472
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,300
I don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

473
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,600
Right inside!

474
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,400
An early bath for you, lad.

475
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,400
- I'll bounce the ball up.
- It's not fair! They never get sent off!

476
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,100
- I shall be up there in a minute!
- They never get sent off, sir.

477
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Off!

478
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,800
What d'you think you two are doing?

479
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,700
- What are you doing?
- Practising, sir.

480
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,800
Show me what you're doing.

481
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,300


482
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Casper!

483
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,600
Casper, what do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

484
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,900
- All he needs now is a banana.
- Get down. I'll make you red hot.

485
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600


486
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,200
Thank you. Now, for my next trick...

487
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,100
I'll show you a trick! Get back in that goal!

488
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,700
- What's up?
- That hurt. That ball, it's hard as iron.

489
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Ar, I know. It's like a stone, innit?

490
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,600
- I'm bloody freezin'.
- My feet are like blocks o' ice.

491
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,600
Me knees, look at 'em. They're goin' pale.

492
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,200
Look at t'colour. It's gone white.

493
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,800
Oh, I wish l'd brought a note.

494
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,600
- Great goal, that, sir.
- I'll give yer "great goal", lad.

495
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,000
- Spurs into the sixth round of t'Cup.
- Sixth round? I'll give you six of the best.

496
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,700
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

497
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,800
- Better luck next time.
- Disgusting!

498
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,900
- In a hurry, Casper?
- I have to get home, sir.

499
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,900
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

500
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

501
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

502
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,800
- What about the showers?
- I've had one, sir.

503
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,200
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- I'll just do that.

504
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,600
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

505
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,600
- Have you?
- No, sir.

506
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,600
- Have you?
- No, sir.

507
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,600
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- Who, sir?

508
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,000
- Casper.
- When, sir?

509
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,200
- Just now. Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

510
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,200
Has Casper had a shower?

511
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,200
What you fooling about at, lad?
Has Casper had a shower?

512
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,700
- I don't think so, sir.
- Speed, you'll get what Casper just had.

513
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,700
No one's seen you have a shower,
Casper. Cos you haven't had one.

514
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,600
- Me mam says I ain't to have a shower.
- Come here. What's your mother say?

515
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,700
I ain't to have a shower, sir.
I've got a cold.

516
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,000
- Where's your note, then?
- Can I bring it this afternoon, sir?

517
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,600
That's no good, lad. I want one now.

518
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,800
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education, or showers,

519
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,200
must, at the time of the lesson,
produce a sealed letter of explanation

520
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,100
signed by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

521
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,800
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

522
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,400
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

523
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,500
- I haven't a towel, sir.
- Borrow one.

524
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,100
- Nobody'll lend me one.
- Have a drip-dry, then. Shower, come on.

525
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,400
- MacDowall.
- Sir?

526
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,200
Come here, lad.

527
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,700
Come here. What's this?

528
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Our dog did it, sir.

529
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,600
- Your dog did it?
- Aye.

530
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,300
lt bit me while I were fightin' it last night.

531
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,200
A dog wearing nylons, lads.

532
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Bloody heck!

533
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
- Still in a hurry?
- Can I go now, sir?

534
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
- Have a proper wash.
- I've had one, sir.

535
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,300
- In the shower, lad. In the shower.
- I've got to get home.

536
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
ln the shower.

537
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,900
Ryder, Speed, come here.

538
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,400
Yes, you two. Come on.

539
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,000
Stay here and see that
he doesn't come out.

540
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,400
- Do what, sir?
- I said, stay there.

541
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,900
See that he doesn't come out.

542
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
Agh! Sir! It's gone cold!

543
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,700
Got a sweat on, Casper? I thought you
might need a cooler after your exertions.

544
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,300
It's not right, sir. I'll catch me death
of cold in here. It's not right.

545
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,600
Was it right when you
let that goal in deliberately?

546
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,900
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can stay there.

547
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,400
- We're servers.
- I don't care. They can serve themselves.

548
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,300
You shouldn't put me in goal.
You know I'm useless.

549
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
Now's your chance to learn.

550
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,400
Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold.

551
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,500
- He'll catch pneumonia.
- I don't care what he gets.

552
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,400
lf he thinks I'm running
my blood to water for 90 minutes,

553
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,900
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

554
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Sir, we've got to go for us dinner.

555
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,000
- Get down!
- He looks like a bleedin' snake!

556
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,500
Think yourself lucky.

557
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,200


558
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,200
- 'Ey up, Jud. How yer doin'?
- Rough, man.

559
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,500
Why? You should be on top of the world
on a day like today.

560
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Another ten minutes
and I'll be at t'bottom of it.

561
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:47,000
# Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love

562
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:53,000
# Fit us for perfect rest above

563
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,600
# And help us this and every day

564
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:06,600
# To live more nearly as we pray

565
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:12,200
# Amen

566
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:23,200
This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, chapter 18, verses 10-1 4.

567
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,600
"Never despise one of these little ones,
I tell you."

568
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,800
"They have their guardian angels
in heaven

569
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,400
who look continually
on the face of my heavenly father."

570
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,000
"Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.
lf one of them strays,

571
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,700
does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside

572
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,000
and go in search of the one that strayed?"

573
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,000
"And if he should find it, I tell you this,

574
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,400
he is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed."

575
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,300
"ln the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will

576
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,100
that one of these little ones should be
lost." Here ends this morning's reading.

577
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,000


578
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,100
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing.

579
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,700
Every morning alike. Clear your throats
on the way to school, not here.

580
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,400
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

581
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,200


582
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,500
Come out! Come out, that boy!

583
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,800
Who coughed? Mr Hesketh,
somewhere near you, I think.

584
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,800
Fetch that boy out!

585
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,200
MacDowall, it was you.
You were coughing.

586
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,200
- lt weren't.
- Yes, it was. I heard you.

587
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,000
- lt weren't, sir.
- Don't argue.

588
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,800
- lt weren't me, honest.
- Headmaster's study.

589
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,800
MacDowall! I might have known!
Get to my office!

590
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,900
- lt weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you.

591
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

592
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,700
Hands together, eyes closed.

593
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,300
Our Father...

594
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,200
Our Father

595
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,300
which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

596
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,700
Thy kingdom come.

597
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,900
Thy will be done...

598
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,200
- Does he bite yer?
- He's had a little kid's hand off nearly.

599
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,100
Has it? My, my, my!
What's it fastened on? A wire?

600
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,600
Aye. It's broke this off an' all.
Just darted at t'kid and got him.

601
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,400
Well, I don't know, I'm sure.
ls that what you've got t'glove on for?

602
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,300
- Yeah. Just in case it gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

603
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,900
- What d'yer call it?
- Kes.

604
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,800
Kes? Aye. He is a nice bird.

605
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,100
I shouldn't like to handle him.

606
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,600
Casper! Casper! Up, lad! On yer feet!

607
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,500
- You were asleep, weren't you, Casper?
- I don't know, sir.

608
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,100
I know! You were. You were asleep.

609
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,600
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

610
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,600
- Don't know, sir.
- I know why!

611
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,100
You were roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

612
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,200
See me in my office afterwards! I'll give
you something to sleep about! Sit!

613
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,000
Here are the announcements.

614
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,100
The youth employment officer will be
here today to meet the Easter leavers.

615
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,400
Your parents should have been told.

616
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,500
lf any boy has forgotten and thinks his
parents may wish to attend his interview,

617
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,600
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

618
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,500
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union

619
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,800
caught yesterday behind
the games storeroom,

620
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,500
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly,

621
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,800
when I will be pleased to see
and hear them pay their dues.

622
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,900
He'd better not stick me.
I'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

623
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What yer bringin' yer father down for?
He don't do nowt.

624
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,600
- How d'yer mean?
- Last time, he got stick an' all.

625
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,000
Shut up, will tha? I'm sick of hearin' yer.

626
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,200
When he came,
they were laughin' at him.

627
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,400
- Yer what?
- Yeah. Weren't they?

628
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,700
Don't say that about my father, right?

629
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,800
He's not gonna beat me, anyhow.

630
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,800
- What do you want?
- I've got a message for Mr Gryce.

631
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,700
Better wait in the queue, then.

632
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,300
He likes to keep yer waitin'.
He thinks it makes it worse.

633
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,500
He can keep me till four o'clock.
I'm not bothered.

634
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,200
l'd rather the cane than do lessons.

635
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,500
Come here, you.

636
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,400
Save us these till after
we come outta Gryce's.

637
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,000
He'll think I'm a smoker.

638
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,100
He'll not search you but he'll search us,
and if he finds 'em, we'll get two extra.

639
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,600
- I don't want 'em.
- You want some fist instead?

640
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,800
- You want to take them?
- You'd better, lad.

641
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,300
OK. But if I get caned,
you give me something.

642
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,200
Aye. Some fist if yer don't.

643
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,100
'Ey up, he's here - Gryce Pudding.

644
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,800
Single file.

645
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,800
Right. You lost, lad?

646
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,900
- Please, sir, I'm going...
- On yer way, form room.

647
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,200
You lot, inside.

648
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,000
Same old faces.

649
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,100
Same old faces.

650
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,000
Ten years this school's been opened,

651
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,800
and ten years have we seen, after
every assembly, a line of boys here,

652
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,300
and the same old faces.

653
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,400
- Sir, I've got a message...
- Shut up. Don't interrupt. Close the door.

654
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
I've taught in this city for over 30 years.

655
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,800
I taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowall -

656
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,200
in the old slum schools in the city,

657
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,100
before they built this fine estate,
and this wonderful school.

658
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,400
Things are no better now
than they were then.

659
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,000
I just can't understand this generation.

660
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,800
I thought I knew something
about young people.

661
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,000
I should be able to,
you know, with my experience.

662
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,200
But with you, no.

663
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,700
lt just seems a complete
waste of money and a waste of time.

664
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,700
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

665
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,000
- You're not listening, are you?
- Yes, sir.

666
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,700
You're not! Crossland,
you're not listening, are you?

667
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
- I am, sir.
- None of you are listening!

668
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,300
Look at that glazed expression
on your faces.

669
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,500
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens!

670
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,000
Cos we can never tell you anything.

671
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,600
You're the sophisticated ones,

672
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,800
with all your music, and your gear.

673
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,200
But, you know, it's superficial.
It's a sheen.

674
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,300
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

675
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,000
And why do I know this?

676
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,200
Why do I know there's been
no advance in discipline or decency,

677
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,400
or morals or manners?

678
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,900
Why do I know it? Because I still
have to use this to you boys every day.

679
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,600
Why? In the '20s and '30s,
I could understand it.

680
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,400
They were hard times,

681
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,900
but they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

682
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,800
I can be stopped in the street
by someone I taught then.

683
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,500
We'll talk about the old days, and we'll
laugh about the thrashings I gave him.

684
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,100
But what do I get from you lot?

685
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,800
A honk from a greasy,
pimply-faced youth

686
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,000
sitting at the wheel
of a big second-hand car.

687
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,400
I don't know. I just don't know.

688
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,000
No guts! No backbone!
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

689
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,800
Mere fodder for the mass media.

690
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,800
And so, until someone
produces a better solution,

691
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,300
I'll continue to use this cane,

692
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:42,100
knowing fully well that you'll be
back for it time and time and time again.

693
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,600
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

694
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,800
Will it stop you smoking? You're already
looking forward to smoking at break.

695
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
- What are you grinning about?
- Not grinnin'.

696
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,300
You are! I'll bet you're already
thinking about smoking at break.

697
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,200
Empty your pockets.

698
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,700
I bet they're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you, empty your pockets.

699
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,700
- Please, sir...
- Quiet. Empty your pockets.

700
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,000
- You don't understand.
- Empty your pockets.

701
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,400
Disgusting!

702
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,000
Please, sir.

703
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,400
You again? You again?!

704
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,400
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

705
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,800
- But, sir, I've got a message from Mrs...
- Empty your pockets!

706
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,900
I don't believe it.

707
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,600
I don't believe this.

708
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Empty your pockets, lad.
Empty your pockets when you're told!

709
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,800
Come on, lad.

710
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,700
Ah!

711
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,800
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

712
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,900
Yes, sir.

713
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,200
Put that rubbish away!

714
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,600
Now I hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

715
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,500
I don't suppose for one minute it will be.

716
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,800
I don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again

717
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,400
for exactly the same crime, smoking.

718
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,500
Perhaps, once in a while, it might sink in.

719
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,700
- Yes, sir.
- That you're wasting your money,

720
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,800
that it's your money you're burning,

721
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,600
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

722
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,000
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

723
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,200
- Been to see Mr Gryce, sir.
- For the stick?

724
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,700
- Yes, sir.
- How many?

725
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
- Two.
- Did it hurt?

726
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,000
- Not bad.
- Right. Hope it didn't.

727
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
Go on, sit down.

728
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
Right now, fact.

729
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,000
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

730
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,000
Don't give me a fact.

731
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,800
You know, don't say that Guthrie's
got a tatty head or anything like that.

732
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,800
A fact is something where
you find evidence out, like truth.

733
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,300
Something that you know
has actually happened.

734
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,400
This is a fact. All right?
Have you got that clear?

735
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,100
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

736
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,300
Tibbut, sit up straight.

737
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,200
And I want the rest of yer
to look at him - if you can bear it -

738
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,800
and tell me some facts about Tibbut.

739
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,000
- Wolstenholme?
- He's always tryin' to go wi' t'lasses.

740
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,700
ls he?

741
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,900
- He smokes.
- Do I heck!

742
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,500
- Tha does.
- Get knotted, Guthrie!

743
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,600
I'm not interested in what
he does out of school hours,

744
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,700
as long as he doesn't come into
the class smokin' a fag. All right?

745
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,500
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

746
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,500
Right, Julie.

747
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,600
I want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past,

748
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,600
that is true, and that you think
will interest the rest of the class. All right?

749
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,100
Well, er...

750
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,400
I went to this all-night party yesterday.
And, er...

751
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:29,800
about three o'clock,
we were dancin' int' garden -

752
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,200
me and her and all the rest,
can't mention names -

753
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,800
and, er, this woman
come across from t'road,

754
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,000
and, er, she tells us to...

755
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,200
to make less noise,
or she'd fetch t'police.

756
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,400
So, well... so we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

757
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,000
So she fetched 'em.

758
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,500
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

759
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,600
What about you, Casper?

760
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,700
- Casper!
- What, sir?

761
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,700
"What, sir?"
You'd know if you'd been listening.

762
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,300
What have we just been talking about?

763
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,000
- Stories, sir?
- What kind of stories?

764
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,300
- You haven't been listening, have yer?
- Yes. Some of it.

765
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Some of it?!

766
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Stand up!

767
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,800
You're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

768
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,400
- I don't know any, sir.
- Well, you stand there till yer do.

769
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,900
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

770
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,500
Just won't be interested,
doesn't matter what you do.

771
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,100
Just like you, Casper.

772
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,800
Come on.

773
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,800
I'll give you two minutes

774
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,600
to think of something, or the whole class
comes back at four o'clock.

775
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,800
- Come on, don't stand there like a nail.
- He is a nail.

776
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,000
Come on.

777
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,600
- I say... tell him.
- Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

778
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,200
lf anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make!

779
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
- Speed?
- He's got this hawk. He's mad over it.

780
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:21,300
He just goes wi' t'hawk all t'time.
He's crackers over it.

781
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,400
- Better than thee, anyroad.
- All right, Casper.

782
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
Sit down.

783
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:33,100
Now, come on, tell us about this hawk.
Where'd you get it from?

784
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,800
- I found it, sir.
- Where?

785
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,600
- lnt' woods.
- Where d'you keep it?

786
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,500
- In a shed.
- What do you feed it on?

787
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,800
Beef. Mice. Birds.

788
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,000
lsn't it cruel to keep it in a shed?
Wouldn't it be happier flying free?

789
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,400
I don't keep it int' shed all the time, sir.
I fly it every day.

790
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,600
- Doesn't it fly away?
- Course it don't fly away. I've trained it.

791
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,500
Are you gonna tell us about it?
How do you train a hawk?

792
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,400
You have to be right careful wi' 'em,
sir, right patient.

793
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,700
You've got to feed 'em
when they're hungry.

794
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,000
You can only do owt at feedin' time, sir.

795
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,400
- Yeah?
- Got these jesses on, sir, all t'time.

796
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,000
- These what?
- Jesses, sir.

797
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,200
- How do you spell that?
- J-e...

798
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,000
All right. Come out here.
You'd better show us on the board.

799
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,500
"Jesses". That's a new word to me.

800
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,500
Hands up those who've
heard of jesses before?

801
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,000
Nobody. Go on, write it up there.

802
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,000
Right. Now tell us what it is.

803
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,600
They're leather straps, sir.
And they attach to t'bird's feet.

804
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:43,200
Say I've got t'bird on me hand. Straps
come down there. Then there's t'swivel.

805
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,600
"Swivel". Write that on the board.

806
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:54,300
- Then you've got your leash.
- "Leash". On the board.

807
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,800
I fed it on me hand first.

808
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Then, when it got to know me,
I fed it on me glove.

809
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,800
And after a while,
I put it two inches away from its claws.

810
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,500
And, er... Like that, right?

811
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,400
lt started to jump for t'meat. When it
started to jump, I could move me hand.

812
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,000
- Hold your hand up, so we can see.
- I could move me hand away, like,

813
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,500
to four inches and six inches. And when it
were doin' that, I started it wi' t'leash.

814
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,200
Do they need water? When you've got
a budgie, you put water in the cage.

815
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,200
Do they need water like that?

816
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,700
Well, it, like, has a bath. lt has a bath
right early on int' morning, like.

817
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,800
When do yer feed it?
How many times a day?

818
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,400
To start off with,
three or four, to get it plump.

819
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,700
- You make it sound very exciting.
- lt is.

820
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,600
Most exciting thing was
when I flew her free first time.

821
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,800
- Do you wanna hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

822
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,800
Aye. Come on.

823
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:53,000
Well, l'd been using t'creance
for about a week,

824
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,700
and it had been goin' 30 or 40 yards.

825
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,400
And it says when birds
are goin' 30-40 yards, it says int' book,

826
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,900
it's time that it can start to fly free.

827
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,700
Well, l'd been...

828
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,700
l'd been wantin' to fly it free, but I daren't.
I were frightened it'd fly off or somethin'.

829
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,000
This had been goin' on
for four or five days.

830
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,800
And I keep on to missen,
sayin' that "Fly it free next day."

831
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Anyway, I got right mad wi' missen.
I says "Right, I'm flyin' it free tomorrow."

832
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,400
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night it were -

833
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,200
I didn't feed her up, so that
she'd be sharp set next mornin'.

834
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,600
And I went to bed that night, Friday night,
and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

835
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,200
I were frightened about t'bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

836
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,200
Anyway, when t'mornin' came,
I kept on sayin' to missen

837
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,500
"lf she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped."

838
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,800
So I took t'swivel off
and let her hop onto t'post.

839
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:52,200
There were nowt stoppin' her, she could
fly off. All that were on her were jesses.

840
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,100
I thought "She must fly off.
She's forced to fly off."

841
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,600
But she didn't.
She just stood there. I were terrified.

842
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,200
She was stood there, and I walked off
into t'field, and she were lookin' round,

843
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,600
and when I got about 70 yards from her,
in middle of t'field,

844
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,700
I called her.

845
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,900
"Kes. Kes. Come on, Kes. Come on, then."

846
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,200
Nowt happened. So I thought
"l'd better walk back and pick her up."

847
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:22,000
So while I were walkin' back,
I saw her flyin'. She came like a bomb!

848
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,300
About a yard off t'floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t'wings.

849
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,600
There weren't a sound from t'wings.
And straight onto t'glove. Wham!

850
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,100
And she grabbed me for t'meat.

851
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,800
I were pleased wi' missen,
and I didn't know what to do.

852
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,700
So I thought I better do it again,
just to prove it weren't luck.

853
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,300
So I took her back onto t'post,

854
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,600
and walked up into t'middle of t'field,
and called her again.

855
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:51,500
And she came just as good as first time,
straight onto t'glove, grabbin' for t'meat.

856
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,500
Well, that were it, sir. l'd trained her, sir,
and that were all I could do.

857
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,000
I think you've done enough.
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

858
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,200


859
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,500
- Got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

860
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:19,300
Tha never has. Tha just cadges. Casper
the Cadger, they ought to call thee.

861
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,600
- I wouldn't give thee owt if I had.
- I'll give thee summat.

862
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,000
What tha goin' for?
Don't tha like company?

863
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,800
They say thi mother does. Tha's
got more uncles than any other kid.

864
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,800
- Shut thi mouth!
- Make me.

865
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,200
- Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
- Your Jud's nowt.

866
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,300
What? He's cock of t'estate.

867
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,900
- I know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thi father?

868
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,500
- He in't even thi brother.
- What is he? Me sister?

869
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,500
They don't even call him Casper.

870
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,100
Course he's me brother!
We live int' same house, don't we?

871
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,100
Get him! Get him!

872
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,200


873
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,300
Fight!

874
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,500
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds, out of my sight!

875
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,800
One! Two! Three!

876
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,900
Right, come here, you two. Come on.

877
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,000
- What's goin' on?
- lt was him, sir. He started it.

878
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,100
- He's been chuckin' coal.
- Ah, shut up. Shut up!

879
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,800
It's always the same tale; somebody
else's fault, nobody's to blame.

880
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,900
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

881
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,100
- Casper, you're not dead yet.
- He will be when I've had him.

882
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:10,000
Oh, yes! You're a big lad, aren't yer? He's
just about your size, Casper, isn't he? Eh?

883
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,200
Pick on somebody your own size.

884
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,200
What if I rubbed your nose in the coke?
You'd say I was a bully, wouldn't yer?

885
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:20,600
And you'd be right. Cos I'm bigger
and stronger than you, aren't I? Eh?

886
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,300
- I'll fetch me dad.
- Oh, yes. And I'll fetch mine.

887
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,700
My dad's heavyweight
champion of the world,

888
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,200
so what will your dad do then, eh?

889
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,200
That's what it's like to be bullied.
You don't like it, do yer?

890
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,200
You'll like it a bit less if I ever catch
you at it again. Do you understand it?

891
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,300
Yes, sir.

892
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,300
Get it shovelled up. Come here a minute.
Have you been smoking?

893
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,100
- No, sir.
- You have! I can smell it on your breath.

894
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,200
- No, sir.
- See me afterwards. Get it done. Go on.

895
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,400
What's it all about?

896
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,600
He keeps callin' me names, and sayin'
things about me dad and me mam and...

897
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,100
All right, all right, all right. Calm down.

898
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,800
They all seem to pick on you. Why is it?

899
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,100
- Don't know.
- ls it because you're a bad 'un?

900
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,000
Maybe I am sometimes,
but I'm not that bad, sir.

901
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,800
I know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away wi' it.

902
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,400
Why else do you think, eh?
There must be some reason.

903
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,700
Well, take this mornin', sir.

904
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,700
I came in and just dozed off.
I weren't doin' nowt wrong.

905
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,300
l'd been up since six. I had to do t'papers,
then I had to rush home to look at t'bird,

906
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,400
and then run to school.
You'd be tired, wouldn't yer, sir?

907
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,400
l'd be exhausted.

908
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,200
You shouldn't be caned for that, sir.
And you can't tell Mr Gryce that.

909
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:53,100
And this little lad, sir. He'd only brought
a letter from a teacher, and he got t'cane.

910
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,400
It's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

911
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,500
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

912
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,800
lf we're 4C, they think
we're numbskulls, owt like that, sir.

913
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,300
They're always lookin' at their watches,
to see how long there's left of t'lesson.

914
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,200
They're not bothered about us,
and we're not bothered about them.

915
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,500
How are things at home these days?

916
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,900
All right, sir. Usual, I suppose.

917
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,300
- Been in trouble with the police recently?
- No, sir.

918
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,400
Not since I've been
without MacDowall's gang.

919
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,300
You know, they used to go into t'city
and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema,

920
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,100
but since I've been without them
I've been all right.

921
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,800
- It's all right now, innit?
- But when there's trouble on estate,

922
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,700
all the police come to our house.

923
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,900
Well, I shouldn't worry.

924
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,800
ln a couple of weeks you'll be starting
your new job, gettin' new friends.

925
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:50,400
Lookin' forward to that, are yer?
Eh? Have you got a job?

926
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,800
No, sir. I've got to see
t'employment bloke.

927
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,300
- What sort of job do you want?
- Anything'll do me.

928
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,600
But you want something that
you're interested in, don't you?

929
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,400
- I'll take what I've got.
- I thought you wanted to leave school.

930
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,000
- Not bothered.
- Thought you didn't like school.

931
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,400
I don't, but it dun't mean to say I'll like
work. Still, I'll get paid for not likin' it.

932
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,400
- That's one thing.
- I suppose it is.

933
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,400
I might be able to save up and buy
a goshawk. I've been readin' about 'em.

934
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,800
Have yer? When do you fly
this hawk o' yours?

935
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,500
- Dinner times.
- Where?

936
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,100
- Just outside our house, sir.
- Wood Lane?

937
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,600
- Yeah, it is, sir.
- I'll come round, then. lf it's OK.

938
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,200
Go on, then. Get yourself cleaned up.

939
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,600
"Five bob double.
Crackpot. Tell Him He's Dead."

940
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,500
"Jud."

941
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Bloody hellfire!

942
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,300
Kes! Come on, then.

943
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,700
Kes!

944
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,200
Come on, then, Kes.

945
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,900
Come on.

946
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Come on, Kes.

947
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,600
Casper?

948
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,000
Bloody hellfire!

949
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,400
- Hope I'm not too late.
- No. But you'll have to stand over there.

950
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,000
- I'll go by the fence, eh?
- It's all right.

951
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,200
- As long as you keep quiet.
- I'll not say a word.

952
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,700
Come on, Kes!

953
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Come on, Kes!

954
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,200
Kes!

955
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,400
Come on, Kes!

956
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,900
Come on, Kes!

957
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,000
Kes!

958
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:55,200
Well done, Casper. The most exciting
thing I've ever seen in me life. Great!

959
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,700
- Thrill of a lifetime, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

960
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,400
Let's have a look at it.

961
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,000
lsn't it beautifully marked, eh?

962
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,700
Look at the feathers on it.
Oh, it's not gonna eat that, is it?

963
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,500
Yes, sir. This bird's full of vitamins.

964
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,800
Oh, dear!

965
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,400
- Have any more birds before him?
- Stacks. Animals an' all.

966
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:26,100
A young fox cub once.
Reared it and let it go. A little blinder!

967
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,400
I've had magpies, jackdaws.
Had a young jay once.

968
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:35,200
- He's your favourite, though.
- Others weren't int' same street.

969
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,700
Come on, then. Come on.

970
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,100
- Come on, sir.
- Oh, dear me!

971
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,700
- Watch that mattress, sir. It's slippy.
- OK.

972
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,200
Look what's left, sir.

973
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,300
Only t'sparrow's leg.
Must have been hungry.

974
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,800
Must have been starvin'.

975
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,600
You hang on here. I'll put him ont' perch.

976
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,200
Come on, then.

977
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:32,500
You know, there's something
weird about it when it's flyin'.

978
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,400
- Hawks are t'best fliers there is.
- No, I didn't mean that.

979
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,500
When it's flyin', there's something
about it makes you feel strange.

980
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,000
- ls it cos everythin' goes quiet?
- That's it, aye.

981
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,500
Other folks have noticed that. I know
a farmer who says it's same wi' owls.

982
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,400
You know, when they get
his mice in his yard at night.

983
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,000
When they swoop down, he feels like
pokin' his ears to make 'em pop.

984
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,600
Cos it goes that quiet.

985
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,800
It's as if they're flying
in a pocket of silence.

986
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,300
Have you noticed
how quietly we're speaking?

987
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,000
As if we're frightened to raise our voices,
a bit like shouting in church.

988
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:13,100
- It's cos they're nervous.
- Oh, no. It's more than that.

989
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,500
It's instinctive. It's a sort of respect.

990
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,100
I know, sir. That's what makes me mad.
When I take her for walks, somebody says

991
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,200
"Look, it's Billy Casper and his pet hawk."

992
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,000
I could shout at 'em, sir. lt in't a pet.

993
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,300
Or if somebody comes up to me
and says "ls it tame?"

994
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:34,200
ls it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed.

995
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,900
They're manned. It's wild and it's fierce
and it's not bothered about anybody.

996
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,800
Not bothered about me, right.
That's what makes it great.

997
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,400
A lot of people wouldn't understand.
They like their pets to be fussed.

998
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,500
I'm not bothered about that.
I just want her for her looks and to fly her.

999
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,000
They can keep their talkin' budgies.
They're nowt compared wi' her.

1000
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,400
You're right, Billy. You're probably right.

1001
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:03,100
D'you know summat, sir? I think she's
done me a favour, lettin' me watch her.

1002
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,800
"Same price, 7-1,
number 12, Doorkeeper."

1003
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,700
What's he studyin' there?

1004
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,100
- Can I help you, son?
- No, thanks.

1005
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,000
Hey, mister, can you
tell me t'prices of these?

1006
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,100
What are they?

1007
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,600
Crackpot.

1008
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,400
Crackpot. 100-6.

1009
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,400
Tell Him He's Dead.
I've just been lookin' for this one meself.

1010
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,900
Tell Him He's Dead.
Second favourite, 4-1 .

1011
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
100-6, 4-1 .

1012
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,900
Would you back 'em?

1013
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,100
Tell Him He's Dead's a good horse.
Best horse int' race. Top weight.

1014
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,500
Don't fancy that one, though.

1015
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,500
No form. Hasn't even got a jockey on
here. No, shouldn't bother with that one.

1016
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,700
D'yer think they'll win, then?

1017
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,500
- How've you got them? Doubled?
- They're our Jud's.

1018
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Oh, he'll be all right if they do,
but I can't see it meself.

1019
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,400
Right. Ta.

1020
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,700
- A bob's worth o' chips, and a fish.
- Serve him, will you, Mary?

1021
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,400
- Yes, love? What do you want?
- Fish 'n' chips.

1022
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,200


1023
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,700
Stop kickin'. We only put that on today.

1024
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,400
- Got any scraps, missis?
- Yes, love. I'll put you some on.

1025
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,400
Two shilling, love. I'm gettin' rid of
these chips, Floyd. It's gettin' late now.

1026
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,300
Aye. But don't be goin' mad.

1027
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,400
Sixpence change, love.

1028
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,200
These kids. I don't know,
Mr Glover, they're just all the same.

1029
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,000
- Can I have a quarter o' beef?
- By, those smell good.

1030
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,400
Can I have a quarter o' beef?

1031
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,900
- Tha stilI got that bird, then?
- Yep.

1032
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,600
- Here, you can have them for nowt.
- For nowt?

1033
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,800
- They're only scraps.
- Another chip?

1034
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,100
- No. I'm goin' for me dinner in a minute.
- Right, then. See yer.

1035
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,000
See yer.

1036
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:04,500
Usual difficulty
over concentration. Hm?

1037
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,400
Three fives are 15, eh?

1038
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,300
We write 15 one, five.
You write five, one.

1039
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,800
Oi, tha fuckin' twat!

1040
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:24,300
lsn't that that illustrious
brother of yours, Casper?

1041
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:29,600
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

1042
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,100
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
- No, sir.

1043
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:38,000
- Do you want to go for a drink of water?
- No, sir.

1044
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:41,300
- Well, open the window.
- I'm all right, sir.

1045
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,100
Please yourself.

1046
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,600


1047
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,800
Right, now just pass your books forward,
will you? To the front.

1048
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,400
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

1049
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,800
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

1050
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,400
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way, then.

1051
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:50,000
- What's up with thee, Jud?
- It's that little bastard, our Billy.

1052
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:55,100
I left him with a bet for t'horses and he's
kept t'stinkin' money. I'll kill the little git!

1053
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,000
- What are you playing at?
- Goin' to t'toilet, sir.

1054
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,800
Hurry up, then.

1055
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,400


1056
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,700
- I'm on 'ere!
- Seen our Billy?

1057
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,900
- Aye. He's here wi' me.
- Tryin' to be funny?

1058
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,600
Cos I'll stick thi head down there,
old pal, and flush it.

1059
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:38,500
- I asked if tha'd seen him.
- I wouldn't tell thee if I had.

1060
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,100
- Look, I'm warnin' yer!
- Ow!

1061
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,700


1062
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,200
'Ey up, Tibbut, has tha seen our Jud?

1063
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,000
- They've been lookin' all over for thee.
- Who has?

1064
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,000
- Gryce Pudding.
- What for?

1065
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,900
Youth Employment.
Tha should have gone for t'interview.

1066
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,500
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah. He wanted to know where tha was.

1067
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,100
- Where the devil have you been?
- Nowhere, sir.

1068
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,300
Nowhere?
Who are you, the lnvisible Man?

1069
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,600
I felt sick, sir, so I went to t'toilets.

1070
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,500
What happened? Did you drop down it?
I've had prefects looking for you!

1071
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,800
- I went out for a breath of fresh air.
- Where are you going now?

1072
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,600
- Employment officer.
- For your interview? Get off, then, lad!

1073
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,700
And God help your future employer!

1074
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
- Sit up, Peter.
- I'm sat up.

1075
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,300
And don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

1076
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,200
Just tell him you're after a good job,
in an office or something like that.

1077
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,800
I'm not working in no office!

1078
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:17,400
- What are you after? A job on the bins?
- Can't you shut up?

1079
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,200
- Sit up.
- I'm sat up.

1080
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,400
- And straighten your tie.
- Tha's naggin'.

1081
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,600
Somebody's got to nag.

1082
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,800
ls it yer mam?

1083
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,200
- What job are tha after?
- Owt'll do me.

1084
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,200
- lt certainly won't.
- lt will.

1085
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,300
- lt won't.
- Right. Thank you.

1086
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,500
Will you send the next one in?

1087
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,600
- Pardon?
- Will you send the next one in, please?

1088
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,100
- lsn't it your turn to go in?
- Suppose so.

1089
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,600
Well, go on, then.

1090
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,500
Get out! Knock and wait.

1091
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:21,200
Come in.

1092
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,900
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

1093
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,300
- Sit down, Walker.
- I'm not Walker, sir.

1094
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,600
Who are you, then? On my list
it should be Gerald Walker next.

1095
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,000
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

1096
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,400
- I'm Casper.
- Casper.

1097
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,400
Oh, sit down, Casper. I should
have seen you earlier, shouldn't I?

1098
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:48,700
Well, then, Casper,
what kind of job had you got in mind?

1099
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,200
Well?

1100
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,700
I don't know, sir.
I haven't thought about it.

1101
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,900
You should be thinking about it. You want
to start off on the right foot, don't you?

1102
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,800
Right, then.
Would you like to work in an office?

1103
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:11,800
- Or would you prefer manual work?
- What's manual work?

1104
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,900
lt means working with your hands. Things
like farming, engineering, plumbing.

1105
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,500
Things like that,
as opposed to penpushing jobs.

1106
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,400
l'd be all right in an office.
I have a job to read and write.

1107
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,000
"Manual".

1108
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:34,600
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

1109
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:38,600
You know, as an electrician
or a bricklayer or something like that.

1110
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:43,400
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship,

1111
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,400
but you'll always have a trade
at your fingertips, won't you?

1112
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,700
Well, what do you think about it?

1113
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,400
As you've said, you feel better working
with your hands. Perhaps this is the best.

1114
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:59,200
Of course, you'd have to go to technical
college and study for examinations.

1115
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,800
Some lads do it. Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week,

1116
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,800
right from leaving school
right up to mid-twenties,

1117
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,400
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

1118
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,800
I say, lad. Are you listening to me?

1119
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,200
- Yeah.
- You don't look as though you are.

1120
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,800
I've other lads to see
before four o'clock, you know.

1121
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,900
lf nothing I've mentioned appeals to you,

1122
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,400
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and don't mind getting dirty,

1123
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,900
- there are good opportunities in mining.
- I'm not goin' down t'pit.

1124
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,300
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

1125
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,900
I wouldn't be seen dead down t'pit.

1126
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,900
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

1127
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,800
Do you like gardening, or constructing
Meccano sets, or anything like that?

1128
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:47,600
- Don't you have any hobbies at all?
- Can I go now?

1129
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:51,700
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down, I haven't finished yet.

1130
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,600
I've met some lads in my time,
but I've never met one like you.

1131
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:01,200
Half the time you're like a cat on hot
bricks, the other half you're not listening.

1132
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,100
Here. Take this form.

1133
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,400
lt gives you information about
leaving school and starting work.

1134
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,400
Things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages.

1135
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:14,500
At the back, there's a detachable form.
When you want your cards, fill it in...

1136
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
Come back, lad. I haven't finished yet.

1137
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,800
When you want your cards,
fill in that form, send it in. Got that?

1138
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,300
- Yeah.
- Don't forget. And listen, Casper.

1139
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,300
lf you do have trouble getting fixed up,
come in and see me.

1140
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,500
- Yeah.
- Send the next boy in.

1141
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,500
Kes!

1142
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,800
Kes!

1143
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,300
Kes!

1144
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,500
Kes!

1145
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,600
Kes!

1146
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,400
Jud?

1147
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,500
Jud?! Mother?!

1148
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,100
- Missis, have you seen our Jud?
- I haven't, love. Sorry.

1149
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,500
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Course I've seen him.

1150
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,800
- Doesn't look as though you've seen him.
- You've seen him, then?

1151
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,900
Course I've seen him. Come in here
playin' hell. Goin' to pull t'counter down.

1152
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,900
I had to fetch Eric Clough
to prove tha hadn't put t'bet on.

1153
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,900
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em. 100-6 and 4-1 .

1154
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,600
- He'd have won a tenner, I tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

1155
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,400
Kes!

1156
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,800
Come on, Kes!

1157
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,500
Come on, lass!

1158
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,300
Kes!

1159
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,000
Kes!

1160
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,600
Come on, Kes!

1161
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,800
Kes!

1162
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,000
Kes!

1163
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:18,300
- Where is it? What's tha done wi' it?
- Where've you been? Your tea's cold.

1164
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,800
I said, where is it?

1165
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,100
- What's tha starin' at?
- Thee, tha little pig!

1166
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,000
Don't call me a little pig!

1167
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,900
Hey! Hey!

1168
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,600
Jud, what's all t'bloody
pushin' and shovin'?

1169
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:36,400
- Ask him. He knows.
- Tha'd have known if l'd got hold o' thee.

1170
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,300
- Oh, get lost!
- Knows what?

1171
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,800
What's goin' off? What's up wi' him?

1172
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:44,200
lf he'd have put that bet on,
there wouldn't have been none of this.

1173
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,900
- He's put it on, hasn't he?
- Has he bloody hell!

1174
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,900
- I told him to. I asked you not to forget.
- He didn't forget. He spent t'money!

1175
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,500
How d'you know?

1176
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,400
What you gettin' so upset for?
Have they won?

1177
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,700
Have they won?! l'd have 16 quid
if he'd kept his thieving hands to hisself.

1178
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,500
- Look what you've done.
- Should have done it thissen.

1179
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,700
- I could have a week off work for that!
- Get lost, you big pig!

1180
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,100
Hey! Well, what's he upset for?

1181
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,100
Because he's killed me hawk instead,
that's why.

1182
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,800
- He never has.
- I know he has. Cos he couldn't catch me.

1183
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:19,800
- Jud! You have not killed this kid's hawk!
- So I have. What yer gonna do about it?

1184
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,900
Killing yerself, that's what you want!

1185
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,800
lt were its own fault.
I were only gonna let it go.

1186

Kept lashin' at me wi' t'claws.
I had to kilI it.

You're a big bastard! A big rotten bastard!

1188
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,500
Don't call me a bastard!

You're a big bastard!
A big bleedin' bastard!

1190
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:40,600

1191

Ar, no, yer wouldn't dare!

1197
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,000
Don't tempt me too much,

1204
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:03,600
You know what a lot he thought about it.
Take it away from t'table.

1205
