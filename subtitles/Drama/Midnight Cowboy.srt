Get along little dogies

00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:39,031
It's your misfortune
and none of my own

3
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,176
Whoopee-tee-yi-yo

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,352
Get along little dogies

5
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,392
For you know New York

6
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:48,888
Will be your new home

7
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:52,664
Whoopee-tee-yi-yo

8
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:55,064
Get along little dogies

9
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,777
It's your misfortune
and none of my own

10
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,465
- Where's that Joe Buck?
- Where's that Joe Buck?

11
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,745
Where's Joe Buck?

12
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,921
Get along little dogies

13
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:07,577
Where is our Joe Buck?
Look at this crap!

14
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,009
Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

15
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,082
- Where's that Joe Buck?
- Where's that Joe Buck?

16
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:14,650
You're due here at 4:00.

17
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:16,922
You know what you can do
with them dishes.

18
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:21,242
And if you ain't man enough
to do it for yourself...

19
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:23,162
I'd be happy to oblige.

20
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,458
I really would.

21
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,307
How ya doin', Ralph?

22
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,532
Four to midnight,
that's when you're due here.

23
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:49,988
Mr. Evers, I wonder
if you can have a word with me?

24
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:54,052
What are you doin' in that getup?
Grab an apron and clean up that crap.

25
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,236
He knows what he can do
with that crap.

26
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,245
- Ain't you come to work?
- I guess not.

27
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,701
I come to collect my pay,
tell you all I'm headin' up East.

28
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,365
You're headin' up East?

29
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,285
Yeah, I thought I'd say
good-bye to you.

30
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,429
Just come to look around
a little bit.

31
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:12,581
Cups!

32
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:16,741
Well...

33
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:19,654
good-bye.

34
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,350
Good-bye.

35
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:23,590
What are you gonna do back East?

36
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:28,422
Lot of rich women back there...
beggin' for it. Payin' for it too.

37
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:29,670
- Yeah?
- Hell, yeah.

38
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:31,814
The men are mostly tutti-fruttis.

39
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:34,151
I'll bet it's a mess back there.

40
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,911
I'm gonna cash in on some of that.

41
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,983
I don't know nothin' about it.

42
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,791
What do I got to stay around here for?
I got places to go.

43
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:02,184
Oh, that's nice.

44
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,585
Oh, lower.

45
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,785
That's real...

46
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,665
nice, honey.

47
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,411
Sure is a powerful mother, ain't it?

48
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah, sure is a powerful mother.

49
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,773
This is the shooting season.

50
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,885
It's time to go
to Lloyd's Discount Store...

51
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,837
for all of your gun supplies.

52
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,325
Listen to these values.
Remington shotgun for only...

53
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,774
You look real nice, lover boy.

54
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,422
Make your old grandma proud.

55
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:32,558
You're gonna be the best-lookin'
cowboy in the whole parade.

56
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,830
You'll be the best-lookin' one there.

57
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,303
Bye, honey.

58
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,895
I'll leave a TV dinner
in the fridge.

59
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,615
Your old grandma
got herself a new beau.

60
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:46,863
Bye now.

61
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:49,583
Excuse me, mister.

62
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,471
Do you have
another piece of gum for her?

63
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:54,544
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do. Here.

64
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,584
Take one for yourself too.

65
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:00,592
Thank you, no.
It's just 'til the Dramamine works.

66
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:02,544
She gets carsick.

67
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:04,624
I only get carsick on boats.

68
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:09,969
But it seems to me that's more
the fish smell than the bouncin'.

69
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,273
How far you headed?

70
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:15,313
- To Dallas.
- Up Dallas, are ya?

71
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:16,689
Where you goin'?

72
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:18,705
I'm headin' on
up New York City, ma'am.

73
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,212
Do you love me, Joe?

74
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,709
Do you love me?

75
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,237
Do you love me?

76
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,925
You're the only one, Joe.

77
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,165
You're the only one.

78
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,957
You're better than the rest of them.
You're better than any of them.

79
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:28,662
You love me, Joe?
You're better than all of them.

80
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,710
You're the best.

81
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,246
Love me, Joe.

82
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,286
Joe! Joe?

83
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:37,558
Joe.

84
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,503
Do you love me, Joe?
Do you love me?

85
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:47,607
Love me.

86
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,583
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

87
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,816
You're the best, Joe.
You're the best.

88
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,761
...broadcast of 'The Sunshine Hour.'

89
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:28,186
Oh, yes, sweet Jesus,
I tell you, faith healer.

90
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,546
I got a letter here from a sister
enclosing ten dollars...

91
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,130
and two malignant tumors she coughed up
during last week's prayer meeting.

92
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:36,890
Praise Jesus!

93
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:40,346
Now, before we join
in prayer for this poor sister...

94
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,211
Jesus wants to know how many sent in
five dollars for their home worship kit.

95
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,651
You want a cigarette?

96
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:47,931
No, thanks.

97
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,299
Chew tobacco.

98
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:51,771
Sing along with Sister Rosella.

99
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:54,427
You throw in Sister Rosella,
you got a deal, right, old-timer?

100
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:01,468
You ever run into a cowhand
by the name of Woodsy Niles?

101
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,964
Woodsy Niles, sir?

102
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,612
Not to my knowledge.

103
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,820
Friend of my grandma, Sally Buck.

104
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,478
I want it on.

105
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,877
77 Radio in New York.
This is Ron Lundy.

106
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,605
This is W-A-B-C.

107
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,741
That's New York talkin' there, ma'am.

108
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,861
- Hear that?
- What is your ideal in a man?

109
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:33,317
My ideal is Gary Cooper,
but he's dead.

110
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,878
Thank you. Ma'am, what is
your ideal in a man?

111
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,214
A man who takes pride
in his appearance.

112
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,350
- Consideration.
- Definitely tall.

113
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:43,814
Someone I can talk to in bed.

114
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:46,438
- A good sense of humor.
- Not afraid of sex.

115
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,742
- A Texas oilman.
- Aggressiveness.

116
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,631
- Outdoor type.
- A rebel.

117
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,359
- Young.
- You.

118
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,511
Excuse me, ma'am.

119
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:28,713
Thank you.

120
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,034
Shit!

121
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,578
...grand time talking to Mrs. Drevin...

122
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,819
who's going to give us
her remedy for insomnia.

123
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:54,315
Gosh, I sure will.
It's pretty unusual, but anyway...

124
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,715
I move furniture around.

125
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,795
Everything but the sofa,
you know?

126
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,675
And that's my remedy
for insomnia.

127
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,299
My remedy is you just dial
the hotel here.

128
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:05,707
Ask for Joe Buck.

129
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:08,364
- I iron my husband's shirts.
- Joe Buck.

Beg your pardon, ma'am.

137
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,381
I'm new here in town.
Just in from Texas.

138
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,301
I'm lookin' for
the Statue of Liberty.

139
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:40,085
Ma'am?

140
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:44,726
Were you serious?
About the Statue of Liberty?

141
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,190
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I mean business.

142
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,006
I'm sorry. I...

143
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,766
Well, the Statue of Liberty.

144
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,127
I think you take
the Seventh Avenue subway.

145
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,391
- No, wait a minute now.
- You sure are a pretty lady.

146
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,487
You're not looking for
the Statue of Liberty at all.

147
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,087
No, ma'am, I ain't.

148
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:11,063
Why, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

149
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,433
Come on, Baby.
Do it for mama.

150
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,569
Come on, Baby.
Mama's tired.

151
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,898
Baby, come on.

152
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,202
Do it for mama.

153
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:50,874
Hey, you little old dog.
How you doin' there, scutter?

154
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:53,754
They got you all gussied up

155
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,026
Pardon me, ma'am.

156
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,106

Hopin' to get a look at what?

159
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:03,419
Statue of Liberty.

160
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,939
It's up in Central Park
taking a leak.

161
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,275
If you'll hurry up,
you'll catch the supper show.

162
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,172
He's picking something up for me.

163
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,604
Hi. I just got your message.

164
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,525
How do you feel?

165
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,597
Oh, I had such a head.
I loved your friend Mr. Needleman...

166
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,869
the last of the great King Midases.

167
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,589
Go, go, go.
My God, it was exhausting.

168
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,053
It was beautiful...
Oh, God! Stop!

169
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,357
- I die from that!
- Who's there?

170
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,334
- Who you talkin' to?
- I was just talkin' to Baby.

171
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,046
I was talking to the dog, Morey.

172
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,406
Please, you're annoying me.
Don't start up again.

173
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,150
Why don't you say hello to Baby?

174
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:59,134
Baby wants to say hello to you.

175
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,303
I don't wanna say hello
to the dog.

176
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,263
Cass!

177
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:05,471
Daddy wants to
say hello to you, Baby.

178
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:09,439
Hello, Baby.
Hello, you goddamn dog!

179
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,775
Bow-wow-wow, Baby.

180
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,567
Am I gonna see you tonight?

181
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:16,063
- Where do you wanna eat?
- Wherever you say.

182
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,336
- Just you and me.
- Hey, that's great.

183
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,256
Catch an early supper
at Lindy's.

184
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,368
- What time?
- Like 5:30.

185
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,160
We don't have to rush.

186
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:25,920
My wife's away.

187
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,360
Beautiful, baby.

188
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:29,280
I can stay all night, Cass.

189
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,136
How 'bout a little kiss?

190
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,096
You got it.

191
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,753
A big wet one 'til I see ya.

192
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,513
Save some of that for tonight.

193
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,177
Love you.

194
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,457
Love you.

195
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,147
In our isolation booths...

196
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,403
- Is it because I'm a stable hand?
- One, two. One, two.

197
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,131
And rest.

198
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,731
Do you think God is dead?

199
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,652
Suppose we just don't
talk about it anymore.

200
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,380
One...

201
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,364
What if I want
to take my mother along?

202
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:26,180
- Oh, my God!
- It even makes black whiter.

203
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:28,292
- Bring your knees up.
- Come on out.

204
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,029
Hey, Cass.
You know what you got here?

205
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:44,421
You got yourself
a damn penthouse.

206
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,341
Real damn penthouse, Cass.

207
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:48,965
Don't look, baby.

208
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:56,454
Knock off a couple of pounds
and I'd really be a gorgeous chick.

209
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:59,814
Don't touch. I'm late already.
What time is it?

210
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,086
Oh, my God!

211
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:05,158
Straighten out the bed for me, Tex.

212
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,095
Say, Cass.

213
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,015
I sure have enjoyed bein' here.

214
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:15,239
It's as fine a time
as I've ever had in my life.

215
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,679
Me too, lover.

216
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,599
That's good 'cause...

217
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:21,384
the way you make me feel
at home here...

218
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,624
I almost hate
to bring up business.

219
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:26,696
Yeah, it's murder, isn't it?
What line are you in, sweetie?

220
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,648
Zip me up, will ya, Tex?

221
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:32,200
Morey's always complaining
about his ulcers.

222
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,696
I don't know what line Morey's in...

223
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,409
but myself, now,
I'm kind of a hustler.

224
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:40,137
A person's gotta make a living.

225
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,217
Pardon me, ma'am.

226
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,225
I said, 'A person's
gotta make a living.'

227
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,425
Are you sure you heard what I said?

228
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,441
Sorry, Tex.
My mind isn't all here.

229
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,618
I don't wanna be late
for my date with Morey.

230
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,538
Listen, sweetie.
Why don't you run along...

231
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:58,890
and take the number, and we'll get
in touch with each other real soon.

232
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:03,338
I forgot to get to the bank,
and now it's too late.

233
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:06,858
I have to take a taxi.
I need a few bucks.

234
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:09,931
Hate to ask you,
but you're such a doll.

235
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,347
You know, Cass, that's a funny thing,
you mentioning money...

236
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,099
'cause I was just about
to ask you for some.

237
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,019
You were gonna ask me for money?

238
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:23,980
Hell, why do you think I come
all the way up here from Texas for?

239
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:26,348
You were gonna ask me for money.

240
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,612
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

241
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:32,396
Some old slut on 42nd Street?

242
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,052
In case you didn't happen
to notice it...

243
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:37,228
you big Texas longhorn bull...

244
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:39,149
I'm one hell of a gorgeous chick!

245
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,621
Take it easy.

246
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:41,933
I'm 28 years old.

247
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:45,261
You think you can come up here
and pull this kind of crap?

248
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,597
- You're out of your mind!
- Come on.

249
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:51,213
I could kill you with my bare hands!
Will you get outta here?

250
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:53,933
Will you get outta here?

251
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,430
Oh, Cass, honey.

252
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,342
Cass, come on now.

253
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,278
Cass, you think I meant that?

254
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:08,078
Would I be after you for money with
a wad like I've got ridin' on my hip?

255
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,927
Stop your cryin'.
You are one gorgeous chick.

256
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,351
Guy gets horny just lookin' at you.
How much you want for that taxi?

257
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,335
How much you want now? Five?

258
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:19,503
You want ten?

259
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,983
Twenty?

260
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,312
There you go, girl.

261
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,098
Terrific shirt.

262
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,914
Are you speakin' to me?

263
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,058
I was admirin' that colossal shirt.

264
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:09,202
That is one hell of a shirt.

265
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,314
I'll bet you paid
a pretty price for it.

266
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,851
I ain't cheap.

267
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,067
Yeah. Birds.

268
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,987
It's an all right shirt.

269
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:17,267
I like birds.

270
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,531
I don't like to have
cheap stuff on my back.

271
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:22,451
- Sure.
- Hi, cowboy.

272
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,731
Got a cigarette?

273
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,971
Hey, sweetheart.

274
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,812
More goddamn faggots in this town.

275
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:32,020
- Oh, kiss it, Ratso!
- Up yours.

276
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,588
You gotta watch out for that.

277
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:35,924
You know the ropes.

278
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:37,876
I wish I'd bumped into you before.

279
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,324
I'm Joe Buck from Texas.

280
00:24:42,388 --> 00:24:44,501
Enrico Rizzo, from the Bronx.

281
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,421
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

282
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,637
Don't mind if I do.

283
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,429
Bartender, drinks all around...

284
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,285
and one for my friend here too.

285
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:55,221
I know when I
give her satisfaction.

286
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,589
You see what I'm getting at?

287
00:24:57,653 --> 00:24:59,606
She got a penthouse up there...

288
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,902
with a color TV and more goddamn
diamonds than an archbishop.

289
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,950
And she busts out bawlin'
when I asked for money.

290
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:05,910
For what?

291
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:07,926
For money.

292
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,366
Money for what?

293
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,726
Hell, I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?

294
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,791
How should I know that?
You gotta tell a person things.

295
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:18,711
I'm a hustler.

296
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,943
All right.
You're a hustler.

297
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,455
But your pickin' up trade
on the street like that...

298
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,671
That's nowhere.

299
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,976
You gotta get yourself
some kind of management.

300
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,856
You put your finger on it.

301
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,840
You know what you need?

302
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,792
You need my friend O'Daniel.

303
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:39,000
He operates the biggest stable
in town.

304
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:41,464
In fact, in the whole
goddamn metropolitan area.

305
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,384
It's stupid, a stud like you paying.

306
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:45,593
You don't wanna be stupid.
I mean, I understand.

307
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:48,153
A dame starts cryin',
I'd cut my heart out for her.

308
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:50,937
I'd call that
a very minor operation.

309
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,337
In fact, you just sit comfy...

310
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,377
and I'll cut it out
with my fingernail file, Ratso.

311
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,337
The name's Rizzo.

312
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,289
That's what I said. Ratso.

313
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:00,762
You heard him.

314
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:01,818
That's all right.

315
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:04,218
I mean, I'm used to these types...

316
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,202
that get their kicks
pickin' on cripples.

317
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:09,114
- The sewer's full of them.
- I wanna ask you one question, cowboy.

318
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,826
If you're sittin' here,
and he's sittin' over there...

319
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,714
how's he gonna get his hand
into your pocket?

320
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:18,619
- Let me work...
- I guess he's got that figured out.

321
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:20,219
Good night, sweets.

322
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,739
- Faggot.
- Provolone.

323
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:26,299
With these gals that wanna buy it...

324
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,827
most of them
are old and dignified.

325
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,196
Social register types,
you know what I mean?

326
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,812
They can't be trottin' down to Times
Square to pick out the merchandise.

327
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,532
They gotta have
some kind of middleman.

328
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,252
That's where O'Daniel comes in.

329
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:45,276
Hey, I'm walkin' here!

330
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,189
Up yours, you son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me that way!

331
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,621
Get outta here!

332
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:57,181
Don't worry about that. Actually, that
ain't a bad way to pick up insurance.

333
00:26:57,245 --> 00:27:01,981
It's crazy, a stud like you payin'
that dame that you told me about.

334
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,710
With proper management...

335
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:07,198
you could be takin' home $50,
maybe $100 a day, easy.

336
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:10,078
Hey, Brucey.
Hang in there, baby.

337
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:11,806
What's that?

338
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,742
Him I placed with O'Daniel
about two weeks ago.

339
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:18,143
He ain't much of a stud either,
from what I hear.

340
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:27,871
All right.

341
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:29,151
Hey, horse.

342
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:33,087
How about you take me to meet
this Mr. O'Daniel right now?

343
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,384
You're a nice guy, and actually
I'd be doin' both of you a favor...

344
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,080
but for what?

345
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:41,376
What am I draggin' my bum leg
around town for?

346
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,344
Tomorrow, some piece like that might be
scratching your back at the Plaza...

347
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,360
and where am I gonna be?

348
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:51,393
Hold on. You think I'm
that kind of a son of a bitch?

349
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:55,777
Just name your cut.
Whatever you want, you got it now.

350
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,961
It's all right.

351
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,881
What you want? Five? Ten?

352
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:02,337
Are you kidding me?
You know what I'd ask somebody else?

353
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,698
- There's ten right there.
- All right. Forget it.

354
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,426
I'll take the ten.

355
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,698
But when I take you over
to see Mr. O'Daniel...

356
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:13,730
I'm gonna have to have another ten
just to cover expenses, all right?

357
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:16,610
Come on. I'll buy you coffee.
On me.

358
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,963
Get outta here.
Bunch of creeps. Go to work.

359
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,499
He needs you tonight.

360
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,419
I got his tongue hangin' out.

361
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:31,587
His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.

362
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,539
Just came in from Texas.

363
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:36,036
He's new to the city.
He don't know the ropes...

364
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,108
but he's promising material,
if you know what I mean.

365
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:42,052
Fabulous. Right away.

366
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:44,804
What's your room number
there again, sir?

367
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,724
Right. Okay.

368
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:54,341
901. You got it?
Hold it a second.

369
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,221
Let's see how you look.

370
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,461
Fine.

371
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:00,901
You look fine.

372
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,325
Think I could have that other ten now?

373
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,886
Where can I reach you?

374
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,350
I'll make this thing right with you
once I get set up.

375
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,718
- Forget it.
- Where do you live?

376
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:13,990
The Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.

377
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,462
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.

378
00:29:16,518 --> 00:29:19,206
Get your ass in there now.
He's waitin'. Go ahead.

379
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,190
Come on. Are you on vacation?

380
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,928
You must be Joe Buck.

381
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,368
Yes, sir, I am.

382
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,288
Come in. Let's look at you.

383
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,888
Turn around.

384
00:29:50,952 --> 00:29:52,168
Turn around.

385
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,841
Good strong back.
You're gonna need it.

386
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,969
So you want help?

387
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:03,849
Sit down. Relax.

388
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,658
Cowboy, eh?

389
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,010
Well, sir,
I ain't a for-real cowboy...

390
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,994
but I am one hell of a stud!

391
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:20,778
Take it easy, boy.

392
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:26,283
Seems to me you're different
from most of the boys that come to me.

393
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,971
Most of those boys
are troubled and confused.

394
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:33,227
I'd say you know
exactly what you want.

395
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,435
You bet I do, sir.

396
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,036
But I'll bet you got one thing in common
with those other boys.

397
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,916
I'll bet you're lonesome.

398
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:48,172
Well, not too.

399
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:50,796
A little.

400
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,220
Lonesome!

401
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:58,413
'I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk.'

402
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:01,133
- 'I'm lonesome, so I'm a dope fiend.'
- Shut up!

403
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:03,117
'I'm lonesome, so I'm a thief.'

404
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:06,189
'I'm lonesome, so I'm a fornicator,
a whoremonger!'

405
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:08,909
- You phony!
- Poop, I say, poop!

406
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:13,518
I've heard it all,
and I'm sick to death of it!

407
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,054
I can see that.

408
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:16,174
Lonesomeness.

409
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,174
Lonesomeness is something
you take, you hear?

410
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,894
Damn it, you take it
and you go on with your work.

411
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,558
I'm rarin' to go, sir.

412
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,479
Yes, I believe you are.

413
00:31:26,543 --> 00:31:27,919
Cowboy, eh?

414
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,839
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

415
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,271
- Ready for hard work?
- I'm ready for anything.

416
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:36,719
I reckon it's gonna be
easier for you than for most others.

417
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:38,479
It's gonna be like money from home.

418
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:39,983
Money from home!

419
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,352
There's your strength, son, see?

420
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,840
You've got the way of putting things
earthy so anybody can understand them.

421
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,232
I warn you, Joe Buck.
I'm gonna use you.

422
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,792
I'm gonna run you ragged!

423
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,393
You're wonderful, boy.
We're gonna have fun together.

424
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,185
It don't have to be joyless.

425
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,273
Hell, no.

426
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:03,729
Why don't you and me...

427
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:06,705
get down on our knees right now?

428
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:08,977
How's that strike you?

429
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:12,273
- Where?
- Right here!

430
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:14,674
Right now!

431
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:16,978
Why not?

432
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,898
I've prayed on the streets.

433
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,850
I've prayed in the saloons.

434
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:22,514
I've prayed on the toilets.

435
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:25,906
It don't matter where,
so long as He gets that prayer!

436
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:27,955
See Him!

437
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,459
That's the ticket.

438
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:31,347
Just open your heart...

439
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,563
Don't be frightened, son!

440
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:39,699
I baptize thee, my brother,
in the name of the Father...

441
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,587
You shall be heard!

442
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,668
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

443
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,148
Don't run from Jesus!

444
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,664
Hey, you know that runty
little bastard I was with?

445
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:50,072
I don't know nothing.

446
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:57,944
Stop it!

447
00:33:58,008 --> 00:34:02,521
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

448
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,474
What's that monstrosity down there?

449
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,842
That's a toupee for dogs.

450
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,282
This is Fifi's wig.

451
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:22,842
That's for that dog?

452
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:26,234
I don't believe this dog.

453
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,306
There's something going on here.

454
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,098
Now, really, seriously...

455
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:35,579
isn't this really a case of conning
a lot of lonely people?

456
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,755
Yes. Who else would do it?

457
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,771
A woman with children
wouldn't have time.

458
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,683
When they have no children,
a woman who is alone...

459
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,979
There's a TV dinner in the fridge.
Expect me when you see me.

460
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,900
I'll leave you movie money.

461
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:52,380
I think that's sick.

462
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:54,972
Dressing up a dog
to look like a child?

463
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:56,924
In case she meets another...

464
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:59,420
That's terrible!

465
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:00,860
She looks terrible.

466
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:06,685
If I can find the hole...

467
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,911
Gold and silver and candlelight.

468
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:37,055
Wine and skyrockets...

469
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,319
and butterfly thoughts
that glitter in your mind.

470
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,487
You're special.

471
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:46,303
Give yourself special treatment.

472
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,831
Need money?

473
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:51,008
We love to lend it to you.

474
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,112
Why worry about your future?

475
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:57,440
What do you want
more than anything in the world?

476
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:59,456
Take it easy, but take it.

477
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:09,729
Key to room 514, please, sir.

478
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:22,562
Looks like you've been
locked out of your room, buddy...

479
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,514
'til you pick up the tab.

480
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:26,594
What about all my things?

481
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:30,178
We keep them nice and safe,
'til you get this thing settled.

482
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:33,346
You can keep all the rest
of the goddamn junk...

483
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,266
if you just let me have
the suitcase.

484
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,963
It means a lot to me.

485
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,203
We keep everything.
House rules.

486
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,150
You gonna eat them crackers?

487
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,242
I spilled some on my pants.

488
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:49,355
Can you tell me how
I get to Grand Central?

489
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:51,275
Surely.
You follow the green lights.

490
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:56,428
Officer.
How do I get to Grand Central?

491
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,068
You know what you gotta do,
cowboy?

492
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:49,039
Spacecraft to Earth Control.
Check trajectory.

493
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:51,407
We have a malfunction
of our instruments.

494
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,327
Captain Grace is investigating.

495
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,263
Orbital module has failed to separate
from upper stage booster as planned.

496
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:03,088
Earth Control to spacecraft.

497
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:06,896
You have 30 seconds before you are
ejected into lunar trajectory.

498
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,688
Only 30 seconds.

499
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:10,128
Do you read me?

500
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:14,705
Spacecraft to Earth Control.
I read you.

501
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,626
Chuck! I've lost you!

502
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,706
Spacecraft to Earth Control.

503
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,658
We've lost contact
with Captain Grace.

504
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:38,770
- Can you track him?
- Kiss me, Joe.

505
00:40:39,794 --> 00:40:43,506
Earth Control to spacecraft.
He's in free fall.

506
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:51,155
You're the only one, Joe.

507
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:56,915
Kissin' Crazy Annie. You better
drink a whole damn drugstore.

508
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:05,236
Kiss me, Joe.

509
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:12,596
Oh! You're the only one!

510
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:24,053
I'm awful sorry you're sick...

511
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,141
but you have to
give me that money.

512
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,806
I was lying.
I don't have it.

513
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,822
What are you gonna do to me?

514
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:39,766
- You ain't got no $25 on you?
- No.

515
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,790
- What are you gonna do to me?
- What do you think?

516
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:47,159
What do you want me to do to you?

517
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:49,815
- You wanna get beat on?
- No.

518
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,767
- How much you got in your pockets?
- Nothing.

519
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:54,487
Empty your pockets out
right over there.

520
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,695
- Take my books.
- I don't want your damn books!

521
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:02,232
How much is that worth?

522
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:05,112
Don't take my watch. Please.

523
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:08,568
Don't take it.
It's only a cheap watch.

524
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:11,352
It's not worth anything.
I can't go home without it.

525
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:14,488
My mother would die.
Don't take it.

526
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:16,664
I can't go home.
She'd die.

527
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,953
She would die. Please.

528
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:27,577
I don't want your damn watch.

529
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,770
Preparing for this brief
moment of glory at halftime.

530
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:41,434
A basic training as rigorous
as the star football players themselves.

531
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:43,898
Long hours
of precision choreography...

532
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,362
that would put the Rockettes
to shame.

533
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:50,619
Musical arrangements, rehearsals,
costume fittings.

534
00:42:50,683 --> 00:42:53,051
A production
in Hollywood's finest tradition.

535
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,291
You can spot the invaders easily
if they're by themselves.

536
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:06,684
They're dark, heavy
and have noticeable accents.

537
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:10,172
Every day they're working themselves
into more homes.

538
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:12,732
What can you do
about these invaders?

539
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,060
Enjoy them. November,
'Better Homes and Gardens'...

540
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,261
tells you about the invasion
of the stylish furniture from Spain.

541
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:22,013
Don't hit me. I'm a cripple!

542
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:25,181
I ain't gonna hit you.
I'm gonna strangle you to death!

543
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:27,581
- Wait.
- First, I'm gonna shake you out.

544
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:30,813
Where's my money?
Put it right there.

545
00:43:30,877 --> 00:43:32,733
All right. Here.

546
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,454
That's all I got.

547
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:36,862
That's all you got?

548
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,670
- What you got in your socks?
- Nothin'. I swear to God.

549
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:43,070
I swear on my mother's eyes.

550
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,150
Here, 64 cents. Go ahead.

551
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:47,070
I want you to have it.

552
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:49,214
It's sticky.
Did you slobber on it?

553
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:51,359
Here. Have a cigarette.

554
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,439
Come on.

555
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:56,415
Come on.

556
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:02,847
Sit down.

557
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,416
How do you like that O'Daniel,
flippin' out like that?

558
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:13,024
I tried to get in touch with you
when I heard...

559
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:14,944
but I was laid up with this cold.

560
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:21,825
You want some free medical advice?

561
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,481
You just keep your damn mouth
shut about that night.

562
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:25,729
Right. Fine. Okay.

563
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,169
Fine. Okay.

564
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:29,281
Another subject.
Where you livin' at?

565
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:31,201
You still at the hotel?

566
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:34,849
Why am I talkin' to you, damn it?

567
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:38,786
Hey, come on!

568
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:43,842
- Wait up!
- Keep away from me!

569
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:46,562
Come near me again,
I'll snatch you bald-headed.

570
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:49,954
I'm invitin' you.
If you're not located, I got a place.

571
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:54,211
- I'm invitin' you, goddammit!
- You're invitin'! Shit!

572
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:59,203
The 'X' on the windows means
the landlord can't collect rent...

573
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:01,315
which is a convenience
on account of it's condemned.

574
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:07,491
Front door. I don't care.
Actually, I prefer it that way.

575
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:09,764
Keeps the punks
and the creeps outta here.

576
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,700
Got my own private entrance.

577
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:20,100
You're the only one
who knows about it.

578
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:27,109
Watch the plank.
Break your goddamn skull.

579
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:29,029
No way to collect insurance.

580
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:37,413
There's glass there.

581
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,022
I've been meaning
to take that fridge up.

582
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:43,462
Get it, will you?

583
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:47,718
- Need any help?
- Not from you.

584
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,302
You okay?

585
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:53,382
It's not far.

586
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,831
It's just one more up.

587
00:45:57,895 --> 00:46:00,807
All the electric's off.
I don't mess with Con Edison.

588
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,535
Just another convenience.

589
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,415
The icebox will keep the roaches
from gettin' in the perishables.

590
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,879
Where did you steal this thing?

591
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:10,184
It's been sittin' down there
for weeks.

592
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:12,648
I don't mean now.
I mean before then.

593
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,152
Don't get a hernia.

594
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:23,080
Go ahead.
Just drop it anywhere.

595
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,609
It's not bad, huh?

596
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,930
There's no heat,
but by the time winter comes...

597
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:47,850
I'll be in Florida.

598
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,506
You wanna stretch out here?

599
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,538
Make yourself comfortable?

600
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:05,739
Go ahead.
Why don't you take a nap?

601
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:21,260
Would you like a cup of coffee?

602
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:49,550
Do you love me, Joe?

603
00:47:56,782 --> 00:48:00,335
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

604
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:32,049
I said stop that!

605
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:45,874
He's the one.
He's the only one.

606
00:48:56,658 --> 00:48:58,642
He's the one.

607
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:00,787
He's the only one.

608
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:22,228
...says there have been
429 American casualties.

609
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,244
429 on the death list.

610
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:27,828
This as opposed to 643 South Vietnamese
soldiers on the death list.

611
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:31,156
Wait a minute.
What's the mat...

612
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,725
What's the matter?

613
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,789
Where's my damn boots?

614
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,885
Over there.

615
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:46,677
How'd they get off me?

616
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,598
I took 'em off.

617
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:51,670
What for?

618
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,686
So you could sleep.

619
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,158
I mean, Christ.

620
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,590
I should haul my ass outta here.

621
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:04,503
What's wrong now?

622
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:08,663
You want me to stay here.
What are you after?

623
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,591
You don't look like no fag.

624
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:15,703
What's that supposed to mean?

625
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:19,512
Don't you want me to stay here tonight?

626
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,424
I'm not forcin' you.
Who's forcin' you?

627
00:50:22,488 --> 00:50:24,792
Oh, I'm sorry. I truly am.

628
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:26,712
I must've got
the wrong impression then.

629
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,328
Okay. Okay, boy.

630
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:36,857
I want you to stay, all right?

631
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,873
I goddamn invited you, didn't I?

632
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:44,953
I hope you know what you're in for.

633
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:47,449
I'm a truly dangerous person, I am.

634
00:50:47,513 --> 00:50:49,370
If someone does me bad like you...

635
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:52,602
If I'd have found you that night,
there would have been one dead Ratso.

636
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,842
You understand me?

637
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:56,282
You hear?

638
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:58,746
I'm impressed. You're a killer.

639
00:51:02,202 --> 00:51:05,371
If I'm gonna stay here a couple days,
I just thought you should know.

640
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,163
'Property of the YMCA.'

641
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,332
Sometimes you make me
wanna puke, Ratso.

642
00:51:27,772 --> 00:51:29,852
Joe, do me one favor, huh?

643
00:51:33,148 --> 00:51:35,228
This is my place.
Am I wrong?

644
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,021
No, you ain't wrong.

645
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:38,461
In my own place...

646
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:40,861
my name ain't Ratso.

647
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,221
It just so happens
that in my own place...

648
00:51:44,285 --> 00:51:47,773
my name
is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

649
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,166
I can't say all that.

650
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,494
Rico, then.

651
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,046
At least call me Rico
in my own goddamn place.

652
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,582
Okay, Rico.

653
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:02,942
Rico. Rico.
That enough for you?

654
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,342
That's fine. Give me a pillow.

655
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:07,263
Give me one of those pillows.

656
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,535
Keep your meat hooks off my radio.

657
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,376
Rico. Rico.

658
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:43,969
Are you here again?

659
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:46,625
Didn't I tell you once before
to keep away from here?

660
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:49,025
Every time you take stuff from me!
Get out of here!

661
00:52:49,089 --> 00:52:52,161
- That ain't nice, pickin' on a cripple!
- Cripple or not, I don't care!

662
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:55,010
Who the hell do you think you are?

663
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:08,771
The two basic items
necessary to sustain life...

664
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,875
are sunshine and coconut milk.

665
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:16,643
Did you know that?
That's a fact.

666
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:19,971
In Florida, you got a terrific
amount of coconut trees there.

667
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:23,587
I think they even got 'em
in the gas stations over there.

668
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,628
And ladies.

669
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:29,604
You know that in Miami you got...

670
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,940
Are you listenin' to me?

671
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:34,372
You got more ladies in Miami...

672
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:37,124
than in any resort area
in the country there.

673
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:39,909
I think per capita, on a given day,
there's probably...

674
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:42,533
three hundred of 'em
on the beach.

675
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,581
In fact, you can't even
scratch yourself...

676
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:47,653
without getting a belly button
up the old kazoo there.

677
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:50,085
It's hot. Let's go.

678
00:53:50,149 --> 00:53:51,845
Come on!

679
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:06,726
Smells worse hot
than it did cold.

680
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,606
All right, startin' tomorrow
you cook your own goddamn dinner...

681
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,295
or you get one of your rich
Park Avenue ladies to cook for you.

682
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,631
- I'm eatin' it, see?
- In her penthouse.

683
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:18,407
Look, I'm eatin' this shit, Ratso.
Mmm, good!

684
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:28,776
- It's good.
- I gotta get outta here.

685
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,176
I gotta get outta here.

686
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:45,033
Miami Beach,
that's where you could score.

687
00:54:45,097 --> 00:54:48,713
Anybody can score there,
even you.

688
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:53,161
In New York, no rich lady with any class
at all buys that cowboy crap anymore.

689
00:54:53,225 --> 00:54:56,585
They're laughin' at you
on the street.

690
00:54:56,649 --> 00:55:01,098
- Ain't nobody laughin' at me.
- I seen 'em laughin' at you, fella.

691
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:05,226
What the hell do you know about women?
When's the last time you scored, boy?

692
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,626
I only talk about that at confession.

693
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:11,306
-We're not talkin' about me now.
-Well, when'd you last go to confession?

694
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,923
That's between me and my confessor.
And I'll tell you another thing.

695
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:17,067
Frankly,
you're beginning to smell.

696
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:19,403
And for a stud in New York,
that's a handicap.

697
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,323
Don't talk to me about clean.

698
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:24,619
I ain't seen you change your underwear
the whole time I've been in New York.

699
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:27,403
- That's peculiar behavior.
- I don't have to do that in public.

700
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:30,508
- I ain't got no need to expose myself.
- No, I'll bet you don't!

701
00:55:30,572 --> 00:55:33,644
I bet you ain't never even been laid!
How about that?

702
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,660
And you're gonna tell me
what appeals to women.

703
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:38,444
I know enough to know that that
great big dumb cowboy crap of yours...

704
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:42,284
don't appeal to nobody
except every Jacky on 42nd Street!

705
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,525
That's faggot stuff!

706
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:47,853
If you wanna call it by its name,
that's strictly for fags!

707
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:52,397
John Wayne! Are you gonna
tell me he's a fag?

708
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:12,558
I like the way I look.
It makes me feel good. It does.

709
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:15,951
And women like me, goddammit!

710
00:56:16,015 --> 00:56:18,959
Hell, the only one thing
I ever been good for is lovin'.

711
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:21,135
Women go crazy for me.
That's a really true fact.

712
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:23,535
Crazy Annie,
they had to send her away.

713
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,151
Then how come you ain't scored once
the whole time you've been in New York?

714
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,647
'Cause I need management, goddammit!

715
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:31,632
'Cause you stole $20 off of me!

716
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:34,768
That's why you're gonna stop
crappin' around about Florida...

717
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:38,192
and get your skinny butt movin',
earn $20 worth of management...

718
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:40,752
which you owe me!

719
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:08,338
Signora, a woman in your condition
shouldn't have to do all this.

720
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,514
Boy, you have
a lot of laundry here.

721
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:26,419
It just ain't right cheatin'
from a pregnant lady.

722
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:28,947
- What did it cost her?
- What do you mean?

723
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:32,436
Get outta here. The laundry syndicate
lost a couple of coins. I'm cryin'.

724
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,548
- That's it, sir.
- All right.

725
00:57:34,612 --> 00:57:37,012
Sir, where's mine?
The black homburg.

726
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:39,924
- I brought it in at the same time.
- Well, I tell you, I don't know.

727
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:43,604
You no have a hat here, mister.
You gotta bring me the ticket...

728
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,452
What about that black homburg
right up there? Up in there.

729
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:49,205
Is that it right there?

730
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:52,501
A ticket? Here's my ticket.
It's right there on the corner.

731
00:57:52,565 --> 00:57:55,669
- You wanna get it, right over there?
- I'll look 'em over.

732
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,941
Keep goin'. Up to the top.

733
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,277
Right in the corner there.
The top one.

734
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:03,574
No, it not belong to yours.
It belong somebody else.

735
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:36,664
Hey, you're pretty damn good at that.
I bet you could make a livin' at it.

736
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:38,936
And end up a hunchback
like my old man?

737
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,232
If you think I'm crippled, you should've
caught him at the end of the day.

738
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:10,554
My old man spent 14 hours a day
down in that subway.

739
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:12,762
He'd come home, two, three dollars'
worth of change...

740
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:14,682
stained with shoe polish.

741
00:59:14,746 --> 00:59:19,162
Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out
from breathin' in that wax all day.

742
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:24,347
Even the faggot undertaker
couldn't get his nails clean.

743
00:59:25,403 --> 00:59:28,091
They had to bury him
with gloves on.

744
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:32,283
Okay, go ahead.
Come on. Take a look.

745
00:59:33,723 --> 00:59:35,643
Don't rush me, boy.

746
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:38,332
Gotta take your time here.

747
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:40,988
Get myself primed up,
like I was turnin' on the charm...

748
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,932
for some pretty little
blonde lady, you know?

749
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:46,396
Then when I'm feelin'
cool and good...

750
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,508
I spin around!

751
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:52,189
And there you are,
you handsome devil you.

752
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:54,461
Not bad.

753
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,157
Not bad.

754
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:00,669
For a cowboy.

755
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,437
You're okay.

756
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,574
You're okay.

757
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,846
The lady will
meet you in the lobby.

758
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:23,679
Taxi!

759
01:00:28,703 --> 01:00:32,063
Yes, sir. Oh, I think you got
somethin' on your shoulder there.

760
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,679
There, you got it.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

761
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:38,784
Say, you haven't got
a quarter, have you?

762
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,704
Just a quarter?

763
01:00:45,248 --> 01:00:48,512
- How do you like that cheap bastard?
- Let's see what the hell you got here.

764
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:52,416
I think we struck gold.
This is one high-class chick.

765
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,681
'Barclay Hotel For Women.'

766
01:00:55,745 --> 01:00:56,961
Women.

767
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,441
Is this the
Gentleman's Escort Service?

768
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:04,449
I'm calling for Miss Beecham...

769
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:06,817
at the Barclay Hotel.

770
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:10,370
Right. She changed her mind.
She won't need nobody tonight.

771
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:13,506
That's right.
Thank you very much. Bye.

772
01:01:24,706 --> 01:01:29,347
Would you believe a whole goddamn hotel
with nothin' but lonely ladies?

773
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:31,331
Score once
in a setup like that...

774
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:34,051
and the way they talk,
I could open up an office in there.

775
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:35,587
Come on.

776
01:01:38,563 --> 01:01:41,380
Go ahead.
Get the money.

777
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:44,804
Listen, get the cash.

778
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,004
Remember that lady in the penthouse.
Get the cash.

779
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:51,492
Those rich ladies write out a check,
and then call the bank and stop payment.

780
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:55,012
Go ahead. Watch the car!

781
01:01:55,076 --> 01:01:56,069
Go on.

782
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,905
Rico!

783
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:10,377
Rico, up here!
Up here!

784
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:12,073
Rico!

785
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:34,411
A-6.

786
01:03:34,475 --> 01:03:36,843
G-49.

787
01:03:36,907 --> 01:03:39,691
G-49.

788
01:03:39,755 --> 01:03:41,483
I-24.

789
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,339
I-24.

790
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,644
And the next one is...

791
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:49,260
O-62, ladies and gentlemen.

792
01:03:49,324 --> 01:03:52,492
O-62!
Are there any bingos?

793
01:03:52,556 --> 01:03:56,332
- And the next one is B-13.
- How dare you, in this public place!

794
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:59,852
Wait a second, lady!
Goddammit, you keep your hands off me!

795
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:17,714
The temperature right now is 28 degrees,
and the weatherman says it's going down.

796
01:05:17,778 --> 01:05:22,386
It's cloudy now, and we can expect
a few snow flurries later on.

797
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:20,438
I'll give you $5 for it.

798
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:59,960
I got a telephone call from Jesus

799
01:07:00,952 --> 01:07:03,832
I got him on the line

800
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:06,873
I'm gonna call him up
Ring him up

801
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:09,433
Then the sun will shine

802
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:26,138
I got a telephone call from Jesus

803
01:07:26,202 --> 01:07:29,146
I got him on the line

804
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:29,118
Oh, for Christ's sake!

805
01:08:49,919 --> 01:08:51,775
Hey, Ratso.

806
01:08:54,303 --> 01:08:56,992
Hey, get your ass out here.

807
01:08:57,056 --> 01:08:59,232
I wanna show you something.

808
01:09:12,513 --> 01:09:16,033
There you go, boy.
There's money for you.

809
01:09:16,097 --> 01:09:18,273
That's $9 right there,
plus assorted change.

810
01:09:19,681 --> 01:09:22,465
Minus 26 for milk.

811
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:25,569
Plus 5 for Dentyne... gum.

812
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:32,674
Oh, that's smart.
Light a cigarette.

813
01:09:32,738 --> 01:09:36,834
Why not take that and buy a carton?

814
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:39,810
Do the job right.

815
01:09:39,874 --> 01:09:42,787
Where'd you get it?

816
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:45,475
I got it.

817
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:50,051
Where you been? 42nd Street?
That's where you been.

818
01:09:52,195 --> 01:09:54,051
Movies,
that's where you've been.

819
01:09:54,115 --> 01:09:56,451
- I ain't been nowhere.
- Yeah, movies.

820
01:09:56,515 --> 01:09:59,012
That's where you got
that thing on your back.

821
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:01,188
What, this?

822
01:10:01,252 --> 01:10:02,980
'What, this?'

823
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:05,028
A friend I did a favor for
give it to me.

824
01:10:05,092 --> 01:10:06,948
- A friend?
- Yeah.

825
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:09,284
You'd just let some poor bastard
freeze to death, wouldn't you?

826
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:11,908
You stole the damn thing, didn't you?

827
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:17,413
I stole it for you! The goddamn thing's
ten sizes too big for me.

828
01:10:17,477 --> 01:10:19,397
Wear it yourself!
I wouldn't have it on my back.

829
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:22,213
I'll be goddamned
if I'll wear it.

830
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:23,653
Here.

831
01:10:27,301 --> 01:10:31,238
Buy yourself some medicine
before you die on my damn hands.

832
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,472
- I hate boneyards.
- So split.

833
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:12,808
He ain't your goddamn father!

834
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:47,531
He was even dumber than you.

835
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,771
He couldn't even
write his own name.

836
01:11:49,835 --> 01:11:52,779
'X,' that's what it oughta say
on that goddamn headstone.

837
01:11:52,843 --> 01:11:54,699
One big, lousy 'X'!

838
01:11:54,763 --> 01:11:57,291
Just like our dump:

839
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,467
condemned by order of city hall.

840
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,044
My grandma, Sally Buck...

841
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:10,892
she died without lettin' me know.

842
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:25,261
Oh, Hitler's storm troopers!

843
01:12:25,325 --> 01:12:28,397
Just because I happened
to get out of a car!

844
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:30,637
It all depends on
what you believe in.

845
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:35,214
Like sometimes your spirit goes up,
sometimes it goes...

846
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:37,614
It goes other places.

847
01:12:37,678 --> 01:12:41,486
How long did I hold up traffic
just to get out? I ask you.

848
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,582
Give some people a little power, and
they gotta supersede their authority.

849
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:49,231
This whole kind of thing is
spiritual... spiritual matters.

850
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:52,175
Oh, now you're talkin' priest talk.
You're talkin' priest talk now.

851
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,927
I ain't talkin' priest talk, I'm
talkin' about what people believe in.

852
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:57,647
Some people believe you can
come back in another body.

853
01:12:59,343 --> 01:13:01,679
Well, I hope I don't
come back in your body.

854
01:13:01,743 --> 01:13:04,528
I ain't asking you to come back in my
body, but you can come back as anything.

855
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:09,136
You could come back as a...
a dog or a president.

856
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,784
If I had my choice,
I'd come back as a president.

857
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:15,632
I ain't that dumb.
What do you think?

858
01:13:16,656 --> 01:13:19,761
Maybe you gotta think about
those things for a while.

859
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:24,817
I'm usually not like this. I'm usually
a very calm and collected person.

860
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:27,185
Really, forgive me.
I'm awfully sorry.

861
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,745
I think I'm gonna
write a letter to the mayor.

862
01:13:31,793 --> 01:13:35,570
I don't believe in any of that crap.
You're entitled to think what you want.

863
01:13:35,634 --> 01:13:38,098
- Maybe I do think what I want.
- Him.

864
01:13:38,162 --> 01:13:42,130
Maybe I do believe all that
damn stuff, and I... and I...

865
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,442
- Do some thinkin' about it, that's all.
- Here.

866
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:53,715
What was that all about?

867
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:57,587
Hey, lookie here.
I've been chosen for some damn thing.

868
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,483
- It's a come-on.
- You know what this is?

869
01:14:02,547 --> 01:14:06,228
- This is a come-on to a party.
- It's a couple of wackos advertising.

870
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,820
Where does it say to go?
Klein's Bargain Basement?

871
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:12,468
You go and get a ten-year subscription
to the Encyclopedia Britannica.

872
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:16,948
It says 'Broadway and Harmony Lane,
Hansel and Gretel McAlbertson.'

873
01:14:17,012 --> 01:14:19,188
- That's perfectly clear, ain't it?
- Get outta here.

874
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:23,061
What do a couple of fruity wackos want
with characters like you and me?

875
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,077
It don't say nothin' about you.

876
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:27,285
It don't say nothin' about you.

877
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:30,613
It don't say nothin'
about you, either.

878
01:14:30,677 --> 01:14:32,533
They took my picture, didn't they?

879
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:35,765
So, you want me to get lost
so you can go to your fancy-ass party?

880
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:38,518
I didn't say nothin' about that.

881
01:14:38,582 --> 01:14:42,326
Did I say that?
Did I?

882
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,246
I'll just tell 'em...

883
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,574
'You want me, I don't go nowhere
without my buddy here.'

884
01:14:51,062 --> 01:14:53,559
I ain't dressed for a party.

885
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:06,936
There you go. Right here.

886
01:15:11,384 --> 01:15:13,080
Hey, dog.

887
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:31,801
Hey, you all right?

888
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:34,361
You okay?

889
01:15:36,857 --> 01:15:40,474
Hell, damn, you're sweating
all over the damn place.

890
01:15:41,722 --> 01:15:43,450
Come here.

891
01:15:54,203 --> 01:15:56,475
You got a comb on ya?

892
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:00,027
- I don't need a comb.
- Here.

893
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:03,195
Few dozen cooties ain't gonna
kill me, I don't guess.

894
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,996
- Okay?
- Yeah.

895
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,492
- I look okay?
- Yeah.

896
01:16:16,796 --> 01:16:19,804
Okay, come on.
Come on.

897
01:16:26,557 --> 01:16:28,733
They're takin' my picture.

898
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,926
Now just one more
close-up with her.

899
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:47,262
I love everything
in the theater.

900
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:50,398
I would like to die
on the stage.

901
01:16:50,462 --> 01:16:52,542
And my hair is fur, you know...

902
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:56,255
its tendrils reaching
out into space sometimes.

903
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:58,687
I've watched it touch many stars.

904
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,479
Wackos. They're all wackos.

905
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,967
I think we better find somebody
and tell 'em that I'm here.

906
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:08,799
Uh, well, I made it.

907
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:11,168
This is my friend,
Ratso Rizzo, and I.

908
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:14,112
- Rico. Rico Rizzo.
- Hello.

909
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:18,144
If you need anything, there's beer
and stuff behind me. Anything you want.

910
01:17:19,456 --> 01:17:21,248
Oh, Jesus.

911
01:17:25,056 --> 01:17:27,169
If you want the word on that
brother-and-sister act...

912
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:30,273
Hansel's a fag and Gretel's got the hots
for herself, so who cares, right?

913
01:17:30,337 --> 01:17:31,713
Load up on the salami.

914
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:33,313
It's like what?

915
01:17:33,377 --> 01:17:35,233
It's like heroin.
Death is like heroin.

916
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:37,953
- Have you tried heroin?
- Yeah, I've tried heroin.

917
01:17:38,017 --> 01:17:40,641
It's like nothing. It's like death.
It's just nothing.

918
01:17:40,705 --> 01:17:43,074
- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

919
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:44,802
Who brought you?

920
01:17:46,306 --> 01:17:47,682
I don't know.

921
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:06,819
Thank you, ma'am.

922
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,788
Hey, sonny,
what you doin' there?

923
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:22,212
She gave it to me, boy.
Give me the goddamn thing.

924
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,543
Hey, what do you want?
Up or down?

925
01:19:02,535 --> 01:19:05,831
Up or down?
Here, why don't you take an upper.

926
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:28,844
Why are you stealing food?

927
01:20:30,316 --> 01:20:33,005
I was just noticin'
that you're outta salami.

928
01:20:33,069 --> 01:20:36,845
I think you oughta have somebody go over
to the delicatessen and bring some more.

929
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:40,909
Well, you know, it's free.
You don't have to steal it.

930
01:20:40,973 --> 01:20:42,829
If it's free,
then I ain't stealin'.

931
01:20:42,893 --> 01:20:46,605
- How did you get crippled?
- I slipped on a banana peel.

932
01:20:46,669 --> 01:20:48,878
- I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.
- What's the matter?

933
01:20:48,942 --> 01:20:52,014
- Take your hands off of me!
- Why don't you use my shower?

934
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:55,534
Take a walk! Just take your hands
off of me! Don't touch me!

935
01:20:55,598 --> 01:20:57,582
- Just take a walk!
- Take a shave!

936
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:00,398
- I'm going to lick the sweat off.
- Keep your hands off of me!

937
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:02,158
Well, you look hot!

938
01:21:02,222 --> 01:21:04,591
- Guess who I am.
- Who?

939
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:06,511
It's me!

940
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:10,607
How you doin'?
You're gettin' your picture took, huh?

941
01:22:24,308 --> 01:22:26,260
Let's, uh...

942
01:22:28,404 --> 01:22:30,388
leave now.

943
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:34,932
Your place...

944
01:22:34,996 --> 01:22:36,853
or mine?

945
01:22:40,693 --> 01:22:43,701
- She's hooked.
- Like why a cowboy?

946
01:22:43,765 --> 01:22:45,941
I'd say she was good for 10 bucks,
but I'll ask for 20.

947
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:48,373
Why a cowboy whore?

948
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:50,421
Did you know
we were gonna make it?

949
01:22:50,485 --> 01:22:53,206
So, you really
wanna do business?

950
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:55,062
Who is he?

951
01:22:55,126 --> 01:22:58,422
Don't tell me you two are a couple.

952
01:23:07,318 --> 01:23:09,495
Why are you laughing, Joe?

953
01:23:09,559 --> 01:23:11,863
- Are you really a cowboy?
- I'll tell you the truth now.

954
01:23:11,927 --> 01:23:15,351
I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I am one hell of a stud.

955
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:18,615
A very expensive stud,
and I happen to be his manager.

956
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:25,656
- How much is this gonna cost me?
- Twenty bucks.

957
01:23:27,192 --> 01:23:29,048
- Okay.
- And taxi fare for me.

958
01:23:29,112 --> 01:23:31,544
Oh, get lost, will ya?

959
01:23:31,608 --> 01:23:35,128
I agree, but for that service
I charge one buck taxi fare.

960
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:40,857
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

961
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:42,649
Oh, boy.

962
01:23:44,025 --> 01:23:45,561
Here.

963
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:49,753
- Go ahead.
- Give me a break.

964
01:23:49,849 --> 01:23:52,825
I don't even know what your name is.
I wanna know your name. What is it?

965
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:54,298
My name's Joe!

966
01:23:55,482 --> 01:23:58,266
Fabulous!
Joe could be anyone.

967
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,930
I like that.

968
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,714
Move over, Joe. Come here, Joe.
Kiss me, Joe.

969
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:06,170
That's a very good idea.
Why don't you kiss me, Joe?

970
01:24:09,691 --> 01:24:12,667
Oh, my... Wow!

971
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:14,715
Too much.

972
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:18,331
He fell.
Hey, fella, you fell.

973
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:22,331
Is he all right?

974
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:24,891
Yeah, he's fine.

975
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:27,932
Well, if you're all right,
why you hangin' on the banister?

976
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:31,612
- Can't you walk or not?
- Naturally, I can walk.

977
01:24:31,676 --> 01:24:34,236
He's got taxi fare.

978
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,276
- Come on.
- Are you sure you're all right?

979
01:24:46,141 --> 01:24:48,029
Hey, Ratso!

980
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,375
Well, it happens.

981
01:25:22,815 --> 01:25:27,039
- Don't worry about it.
- It ain't never happened to me before.

982
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:30,272
You can bet your
bottom dollar on that.

983
01:25:30,336 --> 01:25:32,672
Where's the matches, ma'am?

984
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:35,072
Over there behind that thing.

985
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:48,033
Maybe if you didn't
call me 'ma'am'...

986
01:25:48,097 --> 01:25:50,273
things might work out better.

987
01:25:50,337 --> 01:25:53,473
That's the first goddamn time
the thing ever quit on me.

988
01:25:57,089 --> 01:25:59,458
That's a fact.

989
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,602
You think I'm lyin' to you?

990
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:04,354
No. No, I don't
think you're lying.

991
01:26:04,418 --> 01:26:08,354
I just had this funny image.

992
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:10,818
I had this image of a...

993
01:26:10,914 --> 01:26:13,506
policeman without his stick...

994
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,355
and a bugler without his horn...

995
01:26:16,419 --> 01:26:19,235
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

996
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:26,147
Well, I think
I'm making it worse.

997
01:26:32,868 --> 01:26:35,716
Maybe we oughta
take a little nap...

998
01:26:37,316 --> 01:26:39,684
and see what happens.

999
01:26:39,748 --> 01:26:42,724
I ain't sleepy.

1000
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:52,677
I know. Scribbage.

1001
01:27:04,742 --> 01:27:05,798
Shit!

1002
01:27:15,238 --> 01:27:18,887
Look at this here. See?

1003
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:22,247
There's an 'e' in 'money.'
I mean, if that's your word.

1004
01:27:22,343 --> 01:27:24,647
M-O-N-Y.

1005
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:28,487
That's just exactly how you spell it
on that big building up there.

1006
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:30,567
M-O-N-Y, money.

1007
01:27:33,768 --> 01:27:37,224
'Y.' What in the hell
starts with 'Y'?

1008
01:27:39,496 --> 01:27:42,568
Well, it can end in 'Y'...

1009
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:48,233
like, uh, 'say,' 'pay'...

1010
01:27:49,257 --> 01:27:51,049
'lay.'

1011
01:27:51,113 --> 01:27:53,321
Hey, pay...

1012
01:27:53,385 --> 01:27:55,049
lay.

1013
01:27:58,025 --> 01:27:59,881
Okay, cut it out now.
That's enough.

1014
01:27:59,945 --> 01:28:02,954
You're cheating...
teasin' me so I can't think.

1015
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:08,618
'Gay' ends in 'Y.'

1016
01:28:11,274 --> 01:28:14,378
- Do you like that?
- Cut that out.

1017
01:28:14,442 --> 01:28:17,194
Gay, fay.

1018
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:20,363
Is that your problem, baby?

1019
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:24,427
I'm gonna show you
my darn problem!

1020
01:29:35,087 --> 01:29:39,152
I'm not.
I'm not exaggerating.

1021
01:29:40,432 --> 01:29:43,728
Listen, Marjorie,
you should try it.

1022
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,736
It might be terrific for you.

1023
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,880
Oh, for God's sake.

1024
01:29:48,944 --> 01:29:52,273
Well, what night
is Phil's poker night?

1025
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:54,737
Well, think.

1026
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:56,785
Yeah, all right.

1027
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:59,409
Joe, are you available
Thursday night?

1028
01:29:59,473 --> 01:30:02,705
What time?
Yeah, around 8:30?

1029
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:06,802
Uh, well, let me think now.
Thursday, 8:30.

1030
01:30:06,866 --> 01:30:09,618
Uh, well, I guess
I can be available.

1031
01:30:09,682 --> 01:30:12,082
Hell, yes!

1032
01:30:12,178 --> 01:30:16,434
Hello? Marjorie, it's all set
for Thursday night at 8:30.

1033
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:20,850
Yes, it's... No, I can't talk to you now,
so call me at the office later.

1034
01:30:20,914 --> 01:30:22,899
Yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

1035
01:30:24,307 --> 01:30:27,475
Ma'am, Shirley,
I sure hate to trouble you, but...

1036
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:29,203
Sure.

1037
01:30:31,379 --> 01:30:34,227
- Twenty, wasn't it?
- Yes'm.

1038
01:30:41,076 --> 01:30:42,452
Bye.

1039
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:06,421
Hey, boy, look right in there!
What do ya see?

1040
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:09,110
Look in there, boy!
Some of that stuff's for you too!

1041
01:31:09,174 --> 01:31:12,118
Look. Try that on
for size for ya.

1042
01:31:12,182 --> 01:31:14,870
I got some of that stuff
you like to swill too.

1043
01:31:14,934 --> 01:31:17,718
Aspirin, Mentholatum,
all that crap.

1044
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:23,478
- What's the matter? They wrong?
- They're okay.

1045
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,399
Only why'd you buy 'em?

1046
01:31:25,463 --> 01:31:28,663
While you were gettin' the aspirin,
I could've lifted this.

1047
01:31:28,727 --> 01:31:32,631
- Is that hot?
- Yeah. You want some soup?

1048
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:35,351
- Yeah.
- I'll get you some soup, then.

1049
01:31:35,415 --> 01:31:37,815
We ain't gonna have to steal no more,
is what I'm tryin' to tell ya.

1050
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:40,952
I got eight bucks in my damn pockets.
Twenty more come Thursday, boy.

1051
01:31:41,016 --> 01:31:44,536
-We're gonna be ridin' easy before long.
-Give me some soup.

1052
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,184
- Give me some soup.
- I'm gettin' ya some soup.

1053
01:31:48,248 --> 01:31:51,832
Look at that there.
That's good, healthy stuff for you.

1054
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:54,200
Lookie there.
Lookie there. Soup.

1055
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,761
- Thanks.
- It's hot. Watch out.

1056
01:31:57,785 --> 01:31:59,641
How was she?

1057
01:32:00,953 --> 01:32:03,481
She went crazy, if you want
to know the damn truth of it.

1058
01:32:03,545 --> 01:32:05,785
Yeah. She turned into
a damn alley cat.

1059
01:32:05,849 --> 01:32:09,657
- Thanks for the stuff.
- Don't mention it.

1060
01:32:09,753 --> 01:32:11,610
It's good.

1061
01:32:15,034 --> 01:32:17,050
Hey, listen, don't get sore
or anything, okay?

1062
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:19,706
I ain't sore.

1063
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:21,946
I don't think
I can walk anymore.

1064
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,506
I mean, I've been
fallin' down a lot.

1065
01:32:27,899 --> 01:32:29,275
I'm scared.

1066
01:32:29,339 --> 01:32:31,867
What are you scared of?

1067
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:35,227
You know what they do to you
when they know you can't...

1068
01:32:35,323 --> 01:32:38,619
When they find out
that you can't wa... walk.

1069
01:32:38,715 --> 01:32:40,091
Oh, Christ!

1070
01:32:42,844 --> 01:32:44,956
I gotta lay down.

1071
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,876
- Okay, okay.
- I gotta lay down.

1072
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,924
You're gonna lay down now.
Just take it easy.

1073
01:32:48,988 --> 01:32:51,516
I'm gonna lay you down.

1074
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:54,972
I'm gonna lay you down.
There you go.

1075
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:57,373
I'm gonna put this thing over ya.

1076
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,613
Now you stay here.

1077
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:03,005
Where you goin'?

1078
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:05,117
- I gotta get a doctor.
- What?

1079
01:33:05,181 --> 01:33:07,517
- I gotta get a doctor.
- You ain't gettin' me no doctor.

1080
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:10,109
You're sick, boy.
You need a damn doctor.

1081
01:33:10,173 --> 01:33:13,822
No doctors, no cops.
Don't be so stupid.

1082
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:16,894
- What the hell you want me to do?
- You get me to Florida.

1083
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:19,742
- Hell, I can't go to Florida now.
- Just put me on a bus.

1084
01:33:19,806 --> 01:33:22,302
Just put me on a bus.
I don't need you.

1085
01:33:22,366 --> 01:33:25,438
You got the damn fever.
How the hell you gonna get to Florida?

1086
01:33:25,502 --> 01:33:27,742
Just get me on a bus.
You ain't sendin' me to Bellevue.

1087
01:33:27,806 --> 01:33:30,879
All right. What are you
doin' that for? It's hot.

1088
01:33:30,943 --> 01:33:32,991
You're sick.
I'm keepin' it on you.

1089
01:33:33,055 --> 01:33:35,327
I'm too hot now.
Dumb.

1090
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:38,175
Boy, you're really dumb.
I don't need you. You're dumb.

1091
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,895
- Shut up! Just shut up!
- Dumb cowboy, boy.

1092
01:33:40,959 --> 01:33:43,488
Damn it! Shut up!

1093
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:47,648
Just when things are goin' right for me,
you gotta pull a damn stunt like this.

1094
01:33:50,496 --> 01:33:53,184
Hi, Shirley.
How you doin', girl?

1095
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,776
Miss who?

1096
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,033
Well, when will
Mrs. Gardner be home?

1097
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:04,929
This is a friend of hers.
This is a goddamn good friend of hers.

1098
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:11,105
Well, hell,
I can't wait that long.

1099
01:34:27,106 --> 01:34:29,442
Too bad.

1100
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:31,491
Well, we all have
our off days.

1101
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:38,595
I'm Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
Call me Towny.

1102
01:34:38,691 --> 01:34:41,283
I'm here on a paper manufacturer's
convention and, frankly...

1103
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:43,523
to have a little fun, damn it.

1104
01:34:43,587 --> 01:34:47,844
It's my first night here, and I'd feel
privileged if you'd have dinner with me.

1105
01:34:47,908 --> 01:34:50,084
There's a little French restaurant
not too far from here.

1106
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:53,732
Italian restaurant?
Does that appeal to you?

1107
01:34:53,796 --> 01:34:56,964
Don't worry about how you're dressed.
They know me.

1108
01:34:57,028 --> 01:34:58,916
Besides, I'll tell 'em
you're with the rodeo.

1109
01:34:59,012 --> 01:35:01,605
There's always a rodeo
in town, damn it.

1110
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:04,421
Besides, you look very elegant.

1111
01:35:04,485 --> 01:35:08,997
Oh, but damn it all, we can't do that.
I'm expecting a phone call at the hotel.

1112
01:35:09,061 --> 01:35:11,589
Mama? A coincidence.

1113
01:35:11,653 --> 01:35:14,053
Guess who was being discussed?

1114
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:16,902
Have you got
that thing turned up?

1115
01:35:16,966 --> 01:35:19,238
Well, why aren't you wearing it?

1116
01:35:19,302 --> 01:35:22,054
Oh, really, Mama,
this is just impossible.

1117
01:35:22,118 --> 01:35:25,158
I mean,
why go to all the expense?

1118
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:27,366
Listen, Towny.

1119
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,150
Did I tell you I got me
a sick kid on my hands?

1120
01:35:30,214 --> 01:35:34,279
Well, he's sick on chill, and I gotta
get him south quick as I can.

1121
01:35:34,343 --> 01:35:36,711
I got me a sick boy...

1122
01:35:36,775 --> 01:35:38,663
and I'm gonna get him south.

1123
01:35:38,727 --> 01:35:41,767
Do you understand me, Towny?
I'm gonna get him south.

1124
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:46,055
What you want?

1125
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:48,584
What you got me up here for?

1126
01:35:48,648 --> 01:35:51,400
Oh, Joe, it's...

1127
01:35:51,464 --> 01:35:54,312
It's so difficult.

1128
01:35:54,376 --> 01:35:57,512
You're a nice person, Joe.
I should never have asked you up here.

1129
01:35:59,848 --> 01:36:01,704
You're a lovely person, really.

1130
01:36:03,785 --> 01:36:05,801
Oh, God, I loathe life.

1131
01:36:05,865 --> 01:36:08,649
I loathe it.
Please go.

1132
01:36:08,713 --> 01:36:11,433
- Please.
- You want me to leave?

1133
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:18,794
I mean, yes, yes.
Please go.

1134
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,554
Come back tomorrow.

1135
01:36:20,618 --> 01:36:23,402
- Promise?
- I'm goin' to Florida tomorrow.

1136
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:25,834
That's terrible.

1137
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:29,514
You meet someone, you think...
Yeah.

1138
01:36:29,578 --> 01:36:32,778
I want to give you a present...

1139
01:36:32,842 --> 01:36:34,891
for your trip.

1140
01:36:36,747 --> 01:36:38,923
Please take it.

1141
01:36:40,427 --> 01:36:42,315
I want you to have it.

1142
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:44,715
You don't have to be a Catholic.

1143
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:46,635
St. Christopher's the patron saint
of all travellers.

1144
01:36:46,699 --> 01:36:50,092
I want you to take it.
It's for helping me be good.

1145
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:54,028
I gotta have money.

1146
01:36:54,092 --> 01:36:56,556
Yes, of course.
Wait here.

1147
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:06,893
I said wait.

1148
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,765
Here. Don't even thank me.

1149
01:37:10,829 --> 01:37:13,805
I gotta have more than 10.
I gotta have $57.

1150
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:16,877
- I simply don't have it, Joe.
- I got family, goddammit!

1151
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:20,109
- There's nothing in here.
- Get outta my way, please, sir.

1152
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,342
Get outta my way!

1153
01:37:24,654 --> 01:37:27,246
Let go of that table,
please, sir.

1154
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,102
- Please, sir?
- No, please!

1155
01:37:30,894 --> 01:37:33,518
No, don't, don't.
I deserved that.

1156
01:37:33,582 --> 01:37:37,039
I brought this on myself, I know I did.
My nose is bleeding, isn't it?

1157
01:37:37,103 --> 01:37:39,279
Now, you gonna let go
of that table?

1158
01:37:39,343 --> 01:37:43,311
Now, are you gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

1159
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:52,144
Oh, Joe, thank you.

1160
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,736
Operator.
Number, please.

1161
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,480
- Number, please.
- Hello.

1162
01:37:58,544 --> 01:38:02,288
- No, no, I wasn't calling anyone.
- Hello?

1163
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:05,904
I wasn't calling anyone.
I wasn't calling anyone.

1164
01:38:05,968 --> 01:38:10,097
No, I wasn't calling anyone.
Oh, Joe.

1165
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:24,530
Thirty-one hours.

1166
01:38:24,594 --> 01:38:28,018
11:30 in the morning
we get there.

1167
01:38:28,082 --> 01:38:30,066
Not this morning...

1168
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:33,298
but the next at 11:30.

1169
01:38:33,362 --> 01:38:35,730
These guys are good drivers, boy.

1170
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,227
They gotta be.

1171
01:38:40,723 --> 01:38:42,899
You didn't kill him, did ya?

1172
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:46,643
Got blood on your jacket.

1173
01:38:49,331 --> 01:38:51,507
I don't wanna talk about it.

1174
01:39:22,517 --> 01:39:25,846
If you're gonna shiver,
put your blankets up more.

1175
01:39:28,406 --> 01:39:30,262
I've been thinkin'.

1176
01:39:30,326 --> 01:39:33,718
I hope we're not gonna have trouble
about my name down there.

1177
01:39:33,782 --> 01:39:36,406
I mean, what's the whole point
of this trip, anyway?

1178
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,134
You know?

1179
01:39:38,198 --> 01:39:40,567
Keep your blankets on you.

1180
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:46,551
I mean, can you see this guy, running
around the beach all suntanned...

1181
01:39:46,615 --> 01:39:49,143
and he's goin' swimmin', like...

1182
01:39:49,207 --> 01:39:52,503
and somebody yells,
'Hey, Ratso.'

1183
01:39:53,527 --> 01:39:55,383
What's that sound like to you?

1184
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,704
Sounds like I knew ya.

1185
01:39:59,768 --> 01:40:02,008
Sounds like crap.
Admit it.

1186
01:40:02,072 --> 01:40:03,960
I'm Rico all the time, okay?

1187
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:12,217
We're gonna tell all these new people
my name's Rico.

1188
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:15,737
Okay?

1189
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,657
Okay.

1190
01:40:50,619 --> 01:40:54,011
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm wet.

1191
01:40:54,075 --> 01:40:56,475
You're... You're what?

1192
01:40:56,571 --> 01:40:59,644
I wet my pants.
The seat's all wet.

1193
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:02,684
Well, hell, there ain't no use
cryin' over the damn thing.

1194
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,964
Here I am goin' to Florida,
my leg hurts...

1195
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:10,620
my butt hurts, my chest hurts,
my face hurts...

1196
01:41:10,684 --> 01:41:14,301
and like that ain't enough,
I gotta pee all over myself.

1197
01:41:15,805 --> 01:41:20,189
That's funny?
I'm fallin' apart here.

1198
01:41:20,253 --> 01:41:22,429
You just...
You know what happened?

1199
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:26,013
You just took a little rest stop
that wasn't on the schedule.

1200
01:41:41,086 --> 01:41:43,134
Let me put you up here.

1201
01:41:47,903 --> 01:41:50,815
Hey, what size pants you wear?

1202
01:42:19,969 --> 01:42:21,825
Thank you, ma'am.

1203
01:42:24,129 --> 01:42:27,393
- Where you from?
- New York.

1204
01:42:27,457 --> 01:42:28,833
You ever been here before?

1205
01:42:28,897 --> 01:42:31,394
No, ma'am, I ain't.
This is my first time.

1206
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:34,178
Well, I hope you have
a good time in Florida.

1207
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:35,746
Thank you.

1208
01:42:45,378 --> 01:42:48,483
Hey, what're you doin'?

1209
01:42:48,547 --> 01:42:51,683
I'm zippin' your fly.
What the hell you think I'm doin'?

1210
01:43:15,972 --> 01:43:17,989
Thanks, Joe.

1211
01:43:18,053 --> 01:43:20,805
These shirts are comfortable,
ain't they?

1212
01:43:20,869 --> 01:43:24,837
Yours was the only one left
with a palm tree on it.

1213
01:43:30,501 --> 01:43:32,998
Clothes are damn cheap here too,
you know that?

1214
01:43:38,822 --> 01:43:42,278
Everything we got
only set us back ten some.

1215
01:43:44,422 --> 01:43:47,270
Hey, you know, Ratso...

1216
01:43:47,366 --> 01:43:49,287
Rico, I mean...

1217
01:43:49,383 --> 01:43:51,847
I got this damn thing
all figured out.

1218
01:43:51,911 --> 01:43:55,623
When we get to Miami,
what I'm gonna do is...

1219
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:58,343
get some sort of job, you know?

1220
01:43:58,407 --> 01:44:00,839
'Cause, hell,
I ain't no kind of hustler.

1221
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:05,000
I mean, there must be an easier way
of makin' a livin' than that.

1222
01:44:05,064 --> 01:44:07,432
Some sort of outdoors work.

1223
01:44:08,488 --> 01:44:10,664
What do you think?

1224
01:44:14,536 --> 01:44:16,872
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

1225
01:44:18,504 --> 01:44:20,233
Okay, Rico?

1226
01:45:05,803 --> 01:45:08,780
Okay, folks, everything's all right.
Nothin' to worry about.

1227
01:45:13,388 --> 01:45:15,564
Is he kin to you?

1228
01:45:17,804 --> 01:45:20,556
- Wanna close his eyes?
- What?

1229
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:23,373
Just reach over
and close his eyes.

1230
01:45:29,933 --> 01:45:33,901
We'll just drive on in, all right?
Nothin' else we can do.

1231
01:45:33,965 --> 01:45:37,518
Okay, folks, just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in a few minutes.

1232
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:44,558
Okay, folks, nothin' to worry about.

1233
01:45:44,622 --> 01:45:47,630
Just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in just a few minutes.
