1
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
Hi, Mom.

2
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Sorry, I couldn't call sooner.
Haven't had the chance.

3
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,240
No, I'm just walking back to the Hat.
My shift ran over.

4
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,680
Loads of kids with firework burns.

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
How's Dad?

6
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
What about next weekend?

7
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,960
I could take the train up, stay the night.

8
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,440
I'll call you on Sunday.
We'll make a plan.

9
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Gotta go now.

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,360
OK. Bye.

11
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,200
Go on, man.

12
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Hey, cut across her.

13
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Oh, fuck.

14
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,680
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

15
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,240
The money, the purse.
Give me the purse, give it to me.

16
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
Don't fuck about.

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,040
Hey. Please.

18
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
- Give me that ring.
- It's not worth..

19
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Shut up. Wanna get murked, innit?

20
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,280
- Stupid..
- Get off me!

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,680
- Oh!
- Oi, what?

22
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,400
- Boy, you're too brave.
- Quick, fam, 'fore the feds come.

23
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Fuck the feds, man.

24
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
Take it.

25
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Look, man. Look.

26
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,040
Fuck!

27
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,000
- Oi, she's duckin'.
- Hey, fam, she's ghostin'.

28
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,200
- Allow it.
- Somebody's bombin' us, blood.

29
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,760
- No, man, it's just a firework.
- Some big firework.

30
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,520
Nice whip.
Could be bare valuables in there.

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,640
Raargh!

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,440
- Shit. There's something..
- Whoa!

33
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
What the fuck was that?

34
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Some orangutan type thing,
I'm not even lying, bruv.

35
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Hey, it's breezin', man.
It looked like Dobby the house elf.

36
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,760
Moses got shanked by a Dobby.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

38
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Watch.

39
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,880
- Payback, fam.
- I'm proper stampin' that.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,880
- It's gone in adventure.
- Round two, bruv. Round two.

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Playtime, bruv.

42
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,000
I got my tool.

43
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,800
No man stunting.
I'm gonna fuck this thing up!

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
Yo, you got beef now, Moses.

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,120
- Yo, Pest, got them bangers?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
Jam, man.

47
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,800
It's mine.

48
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Hey, back me! Back me!

49
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,120
- Ah, no, man, that is rank.
- Hey, we broke it up.

50
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,360
- What is that, cuz?
- That ain't no is. That's a was.

51
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,960
I told you, some exotic creature,
like a monkey thing.

52
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
That fell out of the sky. You trying to
tell me it's raining monkeys?

53
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.

54
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.

55
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,320
- I ain't even gonna say.
- You know what that is?

56
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,400
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.

57
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,240
It must have come from outer space,
trying to take over Earth.

58
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,520
But it landed in the wrong place.

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
The wrong place!

60
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,520
- Welcome to London, mo fucker.
- Welcome to the ends, brother.

61
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,640
This is the block. And nobody fucks
with the block, do you get me?

62
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,320
The B-L-O-C-K.

63
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,400
Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap..

64
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,280
- You all right, love?
- Not really.

65
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

66
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,680
- Come along, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.

67
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,800
Come on.

68
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,040
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.

69
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,640
Must have given you such a nasty shock.

70
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
- You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thanks. Water's fine.

71
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,840
Bloody fireworks.

72
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,200
I think they should ban them.

73
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,680
Could be the third world war out there,
you wouldn't know the difference.

74
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
What did the police say?

75
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Said it was one of the busiest nights
of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.

76
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,320
Only it's not like the kids
are scared of 'em no more.

77
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,840
Walking around with knives,
great big dogs, like they own the block.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,040
Excuse my French, but they're
fucking monsters, ain't they?

79
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,480
Yeah. Fucking monsters.

80
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,680
- Its ribs and that.
- Have you found anything?

81
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,200
I beg you give me two pound
to go to Chicken World, fam.

82
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,680
That's disgusting.

83
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,760
Moses,
where are we gonna take that thing?

84
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,840
Take it to Ron's. He watches
that National Geographic shit.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
All man ever does is blaze,

86
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,640
water them big buds
and watch the nature channel.

87
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.

88
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.

89
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
We were crazy kicking that.

90
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,360
No, Mom. Playing football.

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.

92
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Some kind of
non-found-out-about creature.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,880
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.

94
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,280
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mom, back by ten.

95
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,200
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.

96
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking
the poor people, man?

97
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
- Hey, let's walk, bruv.
- Whoo!

98
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
Woy.

99
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,920
- Moses, what happened to your face?
- Battled an alien that fell from the sky.

100
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,640
- You're funny.
- Eurgh, what is that?

101
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.

102
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,280
- Halloween was last week.
- That ain't real. That's a creation.

103
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,160
- Touch it.
- Shove that thing in my face

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
and them fangs are going up in your tits.

105
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,440
- Move it from me. Grow up.
- Could be diseased, you get me?

106
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
I don't want no chlamydia.

107
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
So you're telling me
that fell out of the sky?

108
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,520
- Yeah.
- And did that to your face?

109
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,800
- Yeah.
- So, you killed it?

110
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Yeah.

111
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,680
Such a bad breed, Moses.

112
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Fuck! It's alive!

113
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,720
- Tia is moving to you, Moses.
- She's on your balls, cuz.

114
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Hey, that's my cousin
you're chatting about.

115
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,800
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.

116
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
Get down, man.

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,920
- Trust, I can do it.
- Humpty-Dumpty.

118
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,640
We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.

119
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,240
- Oh, I swear I could do that.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.

120
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,440
- Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
- My name ain't Gavin.

121
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.

122
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,160
Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?

123
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,800
- Urgh, what is that?
- That's none of your business.

124
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,360
That's sick, man.

125
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,280
Where you going?
Let us come with you.

126
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,240
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,360
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.

128
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah, get in touch
when you get your first pube.

129
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,360
Go suck your Mom.

130
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,640
- Oooh!
- Whoo!

131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,280
{y:i}Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

132
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,640
{y:i}Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of the beast

133
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,120
{y:i}Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

134
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
{y:i}Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of the beast

135
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,480
{y:i}Whoop whoop,
that's the sound of da police

136
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,720
{y:i}Whoop whoop, that's the sound of..

137
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Hey, Dad.

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,680
Yeah, just on my way to the cinema.

139
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,120
Yes I promise, it'll be parked
outside in the morning.

140
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
OK, Dad. Gotta go. Bye-bye.

141
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,320
I pressed it already. Taking 'nough time.

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll.. I'll just.. I'll get the next one.

143
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,280
Express elevator
to the penthouse suite.

144
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you remember
what they were wearing?

145
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,320
One of them had one of those
woolly hats with those tassels.

146
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
The one that pushed me over,
the main one,

147
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,280
had a black baseball cap
with a red brim.

148
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,320
That's all I can remember.

149
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
Did you see their faces?
Have you seen them around?

150
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,480
No. They had hoods and scarves.

151
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,320
You want me to call the police?

152
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,120
The best thing is to come with us
for a drive around the block,

153
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,760
see if we can spot them.

154
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Then we can drop you
with a friend afterwards.

155
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
No, thanks.

156
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm not gonna be scared out my own home
by a bunch of bloody teenagers.

157
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
Yo, Ron!

158
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,840
Yo, Ron!

159
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
All right?

160
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,520
No idea. Not a bloody clue.

161
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,880
Maybe there was a party at the zoo
and a monkey fucked a fish.

162
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,320
I saw them with it on the way up.

163
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,280
- Thought they'd won it at the funfair.
- Smells real though, don't it?

164
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Smells like a shit did a shit.

165
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,280
- You wanna buy a bit of weed, then?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah, come on.

167
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,960
Shut up, man.

168
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
Well done, lads.

169
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,120
You've discovered a species
hitherto unknown to science,

170
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,640
quite possibly non-terrestrial in origin,
and you kicked its fucking head in.

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
- Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

172
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
We're getting rich off that, you know,
cos we discovered it.

173
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
- eBay, fam.
- Alert the media.

174
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
Exclusive rights to the highest bidder.

175
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,880
The Sun. Believes anything.

176
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,120
No, no, no, no, no. The Sun'll dress it up
like one of them Page Three girls.

177
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,800
You wanna call The Guardian, blood.

178
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,240
- People will believe it in a proper paper.
- No, tabloids pay more money.

179
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,520
You can't call the paper.
FBI will confiscate it.

180
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,760
FBI? This is England, there ain't no FBI.

181
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,800
It's Section Six or something.

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,040
- We need an expert to verify that thing.
- Look in the Yellow Pages.

183
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,520
Look for scientist people who know
about all them meteor things.

184
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,120
Yellow Pages?
Like, what, "A" for aliens?

185
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,720
- Cheers.
- We need a lawyer,

186
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
a manager or something.

187
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,480
Bell Simon Cowell. Alien's Got Talent.

188
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,400
Jokes, man, jokes.

189
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,480
Actually, I did this
zoology module at uni.

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,120
Primatology, mammalogy, all that shizzle.

191
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,320
That thing in there don't belong
to no taxon I've ever studied.

192
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,160
You met Brewis, then?
Very reliable customer.

193
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Gwanin'.

194
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Hey, move, blood!

195
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,320
Hey, hey!

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
Allow it, allow it, allow it..

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,040
- Yo, Ron.
- You want a bourbon?

198
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,720
Let me keep that thing in the weed room.
Could be worth bare money.

199
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,000
That's the safest place in the block.

200
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,160
Look, I'd love to, but it's not my decision.
I only work here.

201
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,240
Why don't you come and ask the boss?

202
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,760
- What, Hi-Hatz is here?
- Yeah, he's in the weed room.

203
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Come on.

204
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,280
{y:i}Get That Snitch

205
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Hi-Hatz.

206
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
Hi-Hatz!

207
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Hi-Hatz!

208
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,000
Yo, Moses, hear my beats?

209
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's my new trick.

210
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,640
{y:i}Get that snitch
Get the strap

211
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
{y:i}Don't give a fuck
{y:i}Blat, blat, blat..

212
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
That's serious.

213
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,640
Ah, check it out, he's got a puppet.

214
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,040
You made that in college or something?

215
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,000
You got mad skills for puppets.

216
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,120
Looks proper rotten and everything.

217
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,360
Found it over the park,
didn't you, Moses?

218
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,160
He wants to know if he can keep it here.

219
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
He reckons it's worth bare money.

220
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
True say?

221
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

222
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,160
{y:i}Get that snitch
Get the strap

223
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,560
{y:i}Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat

224
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,000
{y:i}Get that snitch
Get the strap

225
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,720
{y:i}Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat

226
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,120
{y:i}Get that snitch
Get the strap

227
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
{y:i}Don't give a fuck..

228
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
Yo. Do whatever you want.

229
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,040
I don't care about that bullshit.

230
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,360
You shot my food from Ron still?

231
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
Sometimes.

232
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
There's better ways to make P's
in the ends, you know.

233
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,760
Man of your age should step his game up.
Move some white.

234
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,840
I'm gonna put you on bail.

235
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,320
Get me 300 back from this.

236
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,360
You're my boy now.

237
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,160
One thing, though.
This is my block, get me?

238
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
The female lands.

239
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,360
If this new territory is hospitable,
she releases a pheromone

240
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,160
which can be detected by the male
of the species from over a mile away.

241
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
Brewis.

242
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
Oi, Brewis.

243
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,960
Oi, come on.

244
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
You all right?

245
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,160
Yes, fam.

246
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,920
- What you on about, man?
- Oh, fam, boy.

247
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
I know, fam.

248
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,520
Hey, what, bruv?
Hey, why are you smiling, bruv?

249
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
- Hey, what's that?
- Hey, I bet he got a job.

250
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,920
- Eh, is it?
- He got recruited, innit.

251
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,600
What's that in your pocket, bruv?

252
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,120
Hi-Hatz is gonna step you up.

253
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,040
What's that?
What's that in your pocket, man?

254
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
Yo, check it.

255
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
- What, bruv?
- More.

256
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
- More what?
- Them tings.

257
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,360
It's just rockets, innit?

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Nah. Rockets go up
before they come down.

259
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,800
Them things are pure comin' down.

260
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,680
- They're the same.
- Same as what?

261
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,720
- As what hit that car before, fam.
- Trust.

262
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,720
Nah. More of them nasty little gremlins.

263
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,520
- It's raining Gollums.
- Bare creatures.

264
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,160
Hey, that one landed in
the park, fam, close.

265
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,480
- Ch, lovely fireworks.
- Nah, mate, it's a alien invasion.

266
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,880
- Course it is.
- Let's get down there, cuz.

267
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,800
- Let's go fuck them up!
- I'm killin' them straight.

268
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
- Ay, let's get tooled up, blood.
- Come, come.

269
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,840
Ay, somebody call pest control?

270
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
Quite sweet really, aren't they?

271
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,520
- Hi.
- Emergency situation! Move, move!

272
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
- Don't shove us!
- Some of us have got exams tomorrow!

273
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,800
- Where have you been?
- Got to get the puncture repair kit.

274
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,120
- Why? You're not going out again.
- Just to mend my tyre. Ten minutes.

275
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,880
- Hey. Ten minutes, I mean it.
- I promise.

276
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,640
What happened to your leg?

277
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
Nothing, Nan.
I pulled a muscle playing football.

278
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,520
- Back in a bit, Nan.
- Now, don't you go getting into trouble.

279
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Course not, Nan.

280
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,960
- Dennis, where are you going?
- Out!

281
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,200
- Then take your dog.
- No, man, I'm busy.

282
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm not asking, I'm telling.

283
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,160
Pogo. Come, come, come.
Come, let's go savage some Gollums.

284
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Whoa! Let's go!

285
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
Go, go, go!

286
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,160
Hey, Moses, what's happening?
Wait for us.

287
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,000
Wait. It's not fair, man.
We wanna come too.

288
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
Hey, what, the Debbies came again.

289
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,480
- There might be something in it.
- Set the grass on fire.

290
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,160
- Messed up, man.
- I told you, fam.

291
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,920
- A meteor, for real.
- Ay, loads came down, innit.

292
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,160
We gotta take them all out.
Gotta catch them all.

293
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,440
Calm down, Biggz, this ain't Pokémon.

294
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,440
Yo, shine the light.

295
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,760
- Like a fossil, innit.
- No, that's different.

296
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
That ain't even the same thing.

297
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,320
That looks triple the size, blood.

298
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,480
I'd like to see the brother
who'd tight that.

299
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,440
Right now, I feel like going home,
locking my door and playing FIFA.

300
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
Hey, what was that?

301
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,680
Pogo. Pogo, whoa. Stay.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
Stay.

303
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,280
- There.
- Holy fuck.

304
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
- Where, fam? Where?
- On top of the tower.

305
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,160
- Which tower?
- Ain't you got your contacts in? Look.

306
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,920
Pogo! Pogo!

307
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
No, man!

308
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,120
What's it doing? Where's it gone, man?

309
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
It's coming.

310
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,800
- Ah, I can see its eyes.
- Not sure them things is eyes.

311
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
- Hey, let's bounce, bruv.
- I'm gone, fam.

312
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Everyone run!

313
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Aliens! Run! Leave, leave, leave!

314
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,520
- They say aliens?
- That's what I heard, man.

315
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,560
Doughnuts.
They think we're scaredy-cats.

316
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,480
Look, man.

317
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,800
Shit, man!

318
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Hey, come on, Biggz, man.

319
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,160
Bully van!

320
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,640
Stay down! Come here!

321
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,120
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

322
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,280
- Man, fuck the 'five-o!
- Stay down, stay down.

323
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,560
Hey, calm.

324
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,400
We got wraps.

325
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,480
Mike Delta 4-0-3,
need assistance, Ballard Street.

326
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
- You are under arrest on suspicion of..
- Four-inch flick blade.

327
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,000
..possession of Class A drugs.

328
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,080
You do not have to say anything..

329
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,480
Victim's mobile phone.

330
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,480
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Do you understand?

331
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,080
Ballard Street, over.

332
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,160
- He said, do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,280
Hurry up and get me in that van.

334
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,680
- Are you absolutely positive that's him?
- Positive.

335
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
And the rest of them are up on that
walkway. You know that, don't you?

336
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,320
He's brucking him in the van, bruv.

337
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
Behind the cars, check it.

338
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,440
- Hey, where is it?
- The roof, fam, clock that roof.

339
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Control, re Ballard Street.
We got a prisoner coming in. 557, over.

340
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,480
Also, please advise, er..
four other suspects still in the area.

341
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Not so tough now, are we, fella?

342
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,120
Aaargh! Aaargh!

343
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Oh, Shit!

344
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,760
- Nah. Feds got savaged.
- Shit, man. We gotta back Moses.

345
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,320
Fuck that, bruv.
I ain't going nowhere near none of that.

346
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,920
- Think. Think what scared the little one.
- Bangers ain't gonna do nothin', fam.

347
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,560
I ain't talking about bangers.

348
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,800
Let me out, man!

349
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh!

350
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
- Hold it steady.
- I ain't the one with the shakes.

351
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,280
- Hurry up, man.
- Come on, you lot, man.

352
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Open the door! Let me out!

353
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,360
Yo, cover me, fam.

354
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,400
This is for Pogo. Rest in peace, dog.

355
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,240
What?

356
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,600
Took your time, man.

357
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,480
- Dumb feds left the keys!
- Then let's jack it!

358
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Throw it off, man! Throw it off!

359
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
Yo, Biggz,
meet us at the underground garages.

360
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,120
{y:i}Skanga, skanga, skanga, skanga..

361
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
Fuck.

362
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,240
Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

363
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Ron, it's Brewis.

364
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,240
Mate, someone's like petrol-bombed
my dad's car or.. I don't know.

365
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,320
And there's po-po everywhere.

366
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,600
- I need to come back up.
- All right, calm down.

367
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,280
I've got the binoculars out.
Where are ya?

368
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,760
I'm by the road by the park.
Behind a bush.

369
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,800
What can you see?

370
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Couple of fire engines parked up
by the off-license, and I think..

371
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,440
- Hang on. Fuck me.
- What?

372
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
Blockbusters has shut down.

373
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,520
- Right. No police, though?
- No, you're all right.

374
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Come back up. Not a blue light in sight.

375
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,640
Whoa!

376
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

377
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,880
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

378
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,120
This is a bad dream.
Tell me I'm dreaming.

379
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,360
Let me out! Open the door!

380
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
Wait, blood, wait, blood.

381
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,040
That ain't even police at the wheel,
that's youths in there.

382
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,440
- What we gonna do, bruv?
- Give me the strap.

383
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,080
Let me out! Open the door!

384
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Open the door!

385
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,960
Sorry about the driving.
I'll get lessons for Christmas.

386
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,720
- What were those things?
- We're thinking probably aliens.

387
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,880
- You should leave.
- Before the situation gets more nuts.

388
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
Go on, then.

389
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,360
Ain't you gonna thank us
for saving your life?

390
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,280
My fucking hero.

391
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,280
- Yo, Hi-Hatz, it was a accident.
- Nah, trust, bruv.

392
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,280
There's bare creatures chasing us.

393
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,200
Big alien-gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.
I swear.

394
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,680
Some creature fell from outer space
and jumped Moses, so he bored it.

395
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,200
And now its brethren
have come down in force, blood.

396
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,960
Moses got shiffed by the feds
and the things attacked the van

397
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,240
and savaged the bluefoot,
so we jacked the van.

398
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,000
We're running for our lives now, cuz.
Believe!

399
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,680
Jack a bully van, crash it into my whip
and then chat shit about aliens to me?

400
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,480
This is making me nervous, blood.
That boy's still cuffed, you know.

401
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,440
- Police are gonna be all over this.
- You trying to snake me?

402
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,400
What, you wanna bring arms to me now?
You wanna murk me?

403
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,480
- You wanna war with me?
- Listen to me, cuz, I'm not even lying.

404
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,800
If we was making it up,

405
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,520
don't you think we'd make up
something better than aliens?

406
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,320
Say that word one more time.

407
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,240
I told you, bruv.
On the roof, if you don't believe me.

408
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,760
What? What's on the roof?

409
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,400
- One of them..
- Say it!

410
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,440
One of them big
gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.

411
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,280
Yo, Hi-Hatz, there is
something there, bruv.

412
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,640
Yo, go see what that is.

413
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
- No way, bruv.
- Move!

414
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,880
Shit.

415
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,440
Yo, Hi-Hatz, bruv.

416
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,520
- There's no..
- Oh, shit!

417
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,360
Oh, Shit!

418
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,760
- Got the key to your lockup?
- Yeah.

419
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
Follow me, follow me!

420
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,720
Moses! Pussyhole!

421
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
I'm gonna get you killed, blood! Watch!

422
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,520
I told you, man. Alien invasion.

423
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,040
London-wide. For real.
I knew it from the start.

424
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
Them vans got tracker beacons.

425
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,800
- Police will be here any minute.
- We're fucked.

426
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,720
When the feds ind the bodies
and the van, we are fucked.

427
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,120
No. If it's happening all over, the police
are gonna be too busy tonight.

428
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,760
National emergency,
army on the streets, helicopters,

429
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,600
all that 28 Days Later shit.

430
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,720
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.

431
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,360
Like none of this ever happened.

432
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,200
Yes, boss. Back in the block!

433
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,240
How do we do that
with them things out there?

434
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,080
That's suicide, man.

435
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,160
- You know what?
- What?

436
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time..

437
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,440
What?

438
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,280
This is sick.

439
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,200
Fuck!

440
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,840
They're on us!

441
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,640
- Split! Meet at the block!
- Oi, pedal, pedal, pedal!

442
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,080
Jerome, pedal!

443
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Stairs, blood!

444
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,560
Move, move, move, move!

445
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,520
Where's Biggz?
Where's Pest?

446
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Hurry up!

447
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,360
Go on, run!

448
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,160
Close the door, man!

449
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,480
Fuck!

450
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,880
Grab it!

451
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
Aarghh!

452
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,560
Hey, snitch!

453
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,360
Move, man! Huh? Move!

454
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,880
Fucking move!

455
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,160
- Hey, come on, blood!
- Get the bag off him!

456
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,320
- Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
- I got one text left.

457
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,600
- I got no credit.
- Drop call everybody.

458
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,600
- Pray someone calls back.
- This is too much to explain in one text.

459
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,000
Get out of my fucking flat!

460
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,800
- Shut up, man.
- Pss..

461
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,720
- I said, get out!
- Yo, snitch, calm yourself.

462
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,320
This ain't about you no more.

463
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,920
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!

464
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,480
There's worse things out there
than us tonight.

465
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.

466
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,640
- She's a nurse, innit.
- Help me, then. I need this leg.

467
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,240
I need it to be able to run away
from them things.

468
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,040
You think I'm gonna help you?

469
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,640
After you attacked me, and robbed me,
and then set those dogs on the police?

470
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,360
- Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
- Dogs?

471
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,040
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?

472
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,600
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?

473
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Go out there and try feedin' 'em
some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.

474
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,480
Whatever the fuck they are,
they're not fucking aliens.

475
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,600
- You swear too much, man.
- Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.

476
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
Whatever they are,
they're inside the block.

477
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,000
They're after everyone.

478
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,080
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?

479
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
- No feds.
- You'd be better off calling
the Ghostbusters.

480
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,600
This is the block. We take care of things
our own way. Get me?

481
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,640
- You're joking?
- Does it look like he's jokin'?

482
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,720
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.

483
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,760
So do you. If those wounds get infected,
they could kill you.

484
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,520
- Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
- Fuck!

485
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,280
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!

486
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,600
We ain't gonna do nothing.

487
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
Fix him.

488
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,800
Jesus.

489
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,880
It's one of the most extraordinary
spectacles in nature.

490
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,000
What if those kids were right?

491
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,160
What if they're connected -
that freak show animal

492
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,560
and the hole in my dad's car?

493
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,320
What if there is some kind of invasion
and the police are out there?

494
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
I can't get busted again.

495
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
- You've been busted?
- Yeah.

496
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,840
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in
the washing machine by mistake and..

497
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,800
I shit you not, my Mom's underwear
came out stinking of skunk.

498
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,600
My dad obviously caught a whiff
and cutoff my allowance.

499
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,680
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.

500
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,160
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.

501
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,080
The irony is, now I've gotta sell
twice the amount just to pay the rent.

502
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,880
I thought you said you lived at home?

503
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,640
Yeah, well, I mean..
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.

504
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,960
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

505
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,000
A man's gotta put bread on the table..
proverbially speaking, of course.

506
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,600
Fo-shizzle.

507
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,320
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion,

508
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,440
they're four foot high, they're blind

509
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,360
and they got kicked to death
by a group of kids.

510
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,320
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

511
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,160
- All right?
- Yeah.

512
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,480
Sorry I messed up your couch.

513
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,880
- Don't worry about it.
- D'you want me to take 'em off?

514
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,040
That won't be necessary.

515
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,360
You sure? I got nice boxers on.

516
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,520
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.

517
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,080
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Try me.

518
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,840
Ow! Hurts.

519
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
- How about this?
- Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

520
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,120
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.

521
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,520
This needs treating
before you lose too much blood.

522
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
- Do it, then.
- I can't do it.

523
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,960
I don't have the equipment or the skill.

524
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,480
I've only just graduated.

525
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,880
And I missed the class
on alien bite wounds.

526
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,400
Stop hyping, man.

527
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,600
Pass me that cushion.

528
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,600
I said, pass me that cushion!

529
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Oh! Don't take it out on me.

530
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,600
I ain't seen you around here before,
you know.

531
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,840
- You lived here long?
- Couple of months.

532
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,080
Hmm. Nice place you got.

533
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,960
Thanks. Thinking of moving.

534
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,040
Shame. Why?

535
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,280
- I don't like the area.
- What do you mean, don't like the area?

536
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,800
What's wrong with the area?

537
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,040
Fam, stay.

538
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,680
Get off me!

539
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,920
- What was that?
- They found us.

540
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,280
How could they End us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.

541
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,520
Whatever gang war you're involved in,
leave me out of it, please.

542
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,480
Hey, this ain't got nothin'
to do with gangs.

543
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,840
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.

544
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,160
- This is the worst night of my life.
- Feeling's mutual.

545
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,160
Moses, don't, man!

546
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,480
Moses.

547
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,120
Ninja!

548
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,000
Tango neutralized.

549
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,000
See? Is that a dog?

550
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,280
- No.
- No, that is not a dog.

551
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,840
That's black.

552
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,360
Too black to see.

553
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,560
That's the blackest black ever, fam.

554
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,960
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.

555
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,320
Oi, where's that woman?

556
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,600
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.

557
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,600
After what you put me through tonight,
it's the least you can do.

558
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,280
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.

559
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,160
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.

560
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?

561
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,400
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?

562
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,520
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!

563
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,840
- My name's Sam.
- Jerome.

564
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,640
- I'm Pest.
- No, man.

565
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,880
Dennis.

566
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,160
You're Moses, right?

567
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,400
You're gonna need a weapon.

568
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,200
Move along, please. Move along.

569
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,520
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

570
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,960
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.

571
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,360
- What's happening, man?
- Something fucked up.

572
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,840
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in
the area, roadblocks and everything.

573
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,120
Maybe we should chill out
till things die down.

574
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,160
- Are you telling me to chill out?
- No. Wait till things cool down.

575
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,800
- You telling me to cool down?
- Ah, forget it, bruv.

576
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,560
Get in the car.

577
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,560
Get in the car now!

578
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,160
They mash up my whip
with a bully van they stole,

579
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,560
start threatening me about aliens
or some shit,

580
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,600
facing me down,
telling me I'm gonna get shifted.

581
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,040
Hey, watch where you're going,
you prick!

582
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,600
Then, some like.. some like big dog,
some big gorilla wolf motherfucker,

583
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,240
comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks,
tears his neck all the way out. Believe.

584
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,320
- So was it a dog, then?
- Don't give a fuck what it was.

585
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,440
Shot that ting. Died easy.

586
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,600
And we gotta learn them youngers
tonight, you get me?

587
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,480
That's my block!

588
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,360
{y:i}Don't give a fuck

589
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,480
{y:i}Blat, blat, blat

590
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,080
{y:i}Get that snitch
Get the strap

591
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,640
{y:i}Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat..

592
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,280
You get four years for carrying
an offensive weapon, you know.

593
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,440
- I think this situation's a bit different.
- Is it?

594
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,800
Walking around,
expecting to get jumped at any moment?

595
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,920
Feels like just another
day in the ends to me.

596
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,640
- Where's he taking us?
- Tia's flat.

597
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,440
- How will we be any safer in her place?
- Security gate.

598
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,640
She wouldn't be asking that question
if she'd seen them girls fight.

599
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,640
Ay, it's Biggz. He's alive.

600
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,880
- Yo, Biggz, we thought you was dead.
- I called you 50 times, blood.

601
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,080
What's your phone doing on silent
at a time like this for, fam?

602
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,480
- Where you at?
- In the bin.

603
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,640
Same bin I was at that time
them boys from Aylesbury was after me.

604
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,000
One of them things is trying to headbang
me out. Rescue me, yeah?

605
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,760
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things
are in the block, busting through doors.

606
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,920
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.

607
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,560
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?

608
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,840
I'll bell you back when we get to Na's.

609
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,040
Fuck this, man!

610
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,480
- Yo, Biggz.
- Listen, listen.

611
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,120
I've got one pound credit and bare people
to call. I can only say this once.

612
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,840
We need backup. Alien attack.

613
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,400
Slow down. I don't understand
a word you're saying. Speak slowly.

614
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,640
This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!

615
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.
Call everyone!

616
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,800
Tell them to come back!
That thing we killed was for real!

617
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,920
Now there's bigger ones battering me..

618
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,800
Phone me later
when you ain't playing Xbox.

619
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,400
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.

620
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,880
Don't answer those names no more.
It's Probs and Mayhem.

621
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,600
Fam, we saw the aliens.

622
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,680
They ran past us, straight.

623
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,480
We got tools.

624
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,560
- Let us roll with you, man.
- That's not real, is it?

625
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,440
- Jesus, he looks about six.
- I'm nine and a half.

626
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,160
- That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
- Hey, leave it!

627
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,640
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.

628
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,240
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!

629
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,080
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.

630
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
Just stay inside tonight, get me?

631
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,600
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!

632
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,040
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.

633
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,600
You really think they'll die
if you shoot water at them?

634
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,560
Ain't water in it. Is it?

635
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,280
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.

636
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,920
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.

637
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,800
And, look, that one's bleedin'.

638
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,840
And that woman, I don't even know her.

639
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,360
I'm not getting myself involved in
a situation I don't need to be in.

640
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,800
It's my house, Dimples.

641
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,160
Come.

642
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
Get off me, man.

643
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,280
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.

644
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,640
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.

645
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,320
This ain't London-wide.
This is localized.

646
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,800
- Yeah, localized in your head.
- Localized in your dreams.

647
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,840
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.

648
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,200
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters
killing everyone? Uh-uh.

649
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,480
- Maybe they only fell on these ends.
- Please!

650
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,840
What kind of alien, out of all the places
in the whole wide world,

651
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,640
would invade some shitty council estate
in South London?

652
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,000
- One that's looking for a right.
- They're coming for us. Ready or not.

653
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,640
{y:i}Ready or not, here I come

654
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,200
{y:i}You can't hide
- Excuse me.

655
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,720
{y:i}They're gonna find you

656
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,600
Listen to me!

657
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,840
There's a dead one
in my living room.

658
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,960
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.

659
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,960
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.

660
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,080
Moses, when did you start going out
with your maths teacher?

661
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,840
- How d'you know that woman?
- We met earlier.

662
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,320
He mugged me.

663
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,480
- Whey! For real?
- That part I believe.

664
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,000
That true? You rob that woman?

665
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,720
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg
and we saved her from the monster.

666
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
So.. we're mates now and it's all sweet.

667
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,000
- We're heroes, innit?
- Heroes?

668
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,600
Five of you and a knife
against one woman? Fuck off!

669
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,240
Raah. Cold.

670
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,120
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv.
It weren't all that.

671
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,320
- We never even touched you.
- The blade was to get it over with quick.

672
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,480
- We was as scared as you.
- Blade?

673
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,680
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?

674
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,120
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed
or beaten up or gettin' arrested?

675
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,120
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.

676
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,840
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.

677
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,480
Think the police will help them?

678
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,920
They might not arrest you,
but they'll arrest them.

679
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,840
For the murder of two police officers,
vehicle theft, resisting arrest..

680
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,640
everything that happened
everywhere in the ends tonight.

681
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,640
They arrest us for nothing already.

682
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
You know what I reckon, yeah?

683
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,920
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.

684
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,000
Government probably bred
those creatures to kill black boys.

685
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,440
First they sent drugs to the ends,
then they sent guns.

686
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,000
Now they sent monsters to get us.

687
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,040
They don't care, man.

688
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,000
We ain't killin' each other fast enough,

689
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,120
so they decided
to speed up the process.

690
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,560
Believe.

691
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,120
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?

692
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,080
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.

693
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,160
Excuse me, but what is that?

694
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,000
Oh, my days!

695
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,800
- You can't take two, fam.
- Watch me.

696
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,200
Shit. It is a toy!

697
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,600
Help! Hey, Moses!

698
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,080
Dennis!

699
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,040
- Moses.
- It's coming for you, Moses!

700
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,120
Oi, you fucker!

701
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,400
Tia, what you doing?

702
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,160
Back!

703
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,880
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!

704
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
- Don't stop!
- Harder! Cut him!

705
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Kill him! Harder!

706
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,320
Oh, Shit!

707
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,240
Yo, youngers, wagwan?

708
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,760
- Nothing much.
- All right.

709
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Nice weapons. Who you fightin'?

710
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
- Aliens.
- Is it?

711
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,480
- Seen that yout Moses lately?
- Who wants to know?

712
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,160
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.

713
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,640
Bang! Bang! Bang!

714
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,440
So, where's he at?

715
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,240
You know that little one
you killed before?

716
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,880
That was a mistake.

717
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,640
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.

718
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,120
Actions have consequences, you know.

719
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,440
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.

720
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,400
Stay away from us, Moses.

721
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,920
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.

722
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,280
- Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
- I ain't going nowhere.

723
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,000
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.

724
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,200
Come on!

725
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,480
Come on!

726
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,840
Easy kill.

727
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,320
Run, man! Come on!

728
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,320
- What are you waiting for?
- Shit!

729
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,240
Open the door! Go!

730
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,240
Wagwan, its young Den.
If it's girls, leave a message.

731
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,040
Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.

732
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,000
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.

733
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,120
Everyone's come down to back us,
blood, but no one can get inside.

734
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,320
Feds have the block on lockdown.

735
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,160
You've got one minute remaining.

736
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,520
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.

737
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,240
I need to make a break for it.

738
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,040
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?

739
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,840
Aargh!

740
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,480
Hey, what the fuck, man!

741
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,000
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?

742
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,400
Better get the next one, blood.

743
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Go, man!

744
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,160
- Who was that?
- That's Hi-Hatz.

745
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,520
- Man's a sausage.
- Why is he shooting at us?

746
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,720
His best friend got ate
and he's a bit vexed.

747
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,640
I know exactly how he feels.

748
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,400
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

749
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,080
What's chasing you? Why is the other
lift full of bits of dead people?

750
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,640
What? We need to go down.

751
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,480
I ain't going down. There's too many
things down there out to get me.

752
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,080
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters
and fucked-up monsters down there.

753
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,920
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?

754
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,200
- We're going to Ron's weed room.
- What's Ron's weed room?

755
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,080
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. It's good.

756
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,480
- It's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
- Plan.

757
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,920
19.

758
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,080
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.

759
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,800
This is long, man. They've all gone.

760
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,280
No, they ain't. Check it.

761
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,600
- Down the end.
- Raah.

762
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,520
I am too high for this shit.

763
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,600
Trust.

764
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,640
- I wanna shoot those things, man.
- Same here, bruv.

765
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,760
- Times three.
- Done now.

766
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,120
- Bangers, man, bangers!
- I'm Brewis, by the way.

767
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,160
- Sam.
- Front pocket, man.

768
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,480
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.

769
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,840
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.

770
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,120
- What about you?
- I live here.

771
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,400
Really?

772
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,800
Wicked.

773
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,800
I'm set.

774
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,120
Lights. Stay close.

775
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,240
Go. Go, go.

776
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,880
- Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
- Wait for me.

777
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
Fire in the hole.

778
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,240
Get the fuck off me, man.

779
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,240
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!

780
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,880
Jerome, where are you, man?

781
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,000
Jerome!

782
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,600
Jerome! Where you at?

783
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,360
Jerome!

784
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,200
Jerome?

785
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,760
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.

786
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
Pest? Moses?

787
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Pest! Moses!

788
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,280
- Aaarghh!
- Jerome, where you at?

789
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,440
- Oi, lights, man, lights!
- Trying to find 'em, man.

790
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,280
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.

791
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,800
Are you there, man?

792
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,440
They're coming up the stairs, quick.

793
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,240
Jerome?

794
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,240
Help! Help!

795
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,400
- Aargh!
- Follow me!

796
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,120
They got Jerome. Moses!

797
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,320
They took him!
They took Jerome!

798
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,000
- Man!
- Oh!

799
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,400
What the fuck was that for?

800
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,320
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!

801
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,520
Moses!

802
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,200
- Yo, Ron! Ron!
- Ron, man, let us in!

803
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,640
- Ron!
- Open the door, man!

804
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,120
- Hey, let us in, man!
- Hey, open the door!

805
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,560
- All right?
- We need to hide in your weed room.

806
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,000
It's the only safe place
left in the block.

807
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,040
I don't know about that.

808
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,880
- Ah, come on! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

809
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,440
Come on.

810
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,840
Wagwan, Moses?

811
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,840
Sorry.

812
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,840
- You killed that thing.
- Hi-Hatz, bruv..

813
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,440
- You brought it in the ends.
- I don't want no trouble.

814
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,280
You brought fed in the ends.

815
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,440
Listen to me, bruv.

816
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,960
You brought an alien invasion
to the ends.

817
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,960
Shit.

818
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,480
Behind you, bruv.

819
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,440
- Don't chat me.
- I'm not even lyin'.

820
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,240
Shut up!

821
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,960
I was gonna make you.

822
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,800
Now.. I'm gonna dead you.

823
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,600
This is my block. Get me?

824
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,040
Not really.

825
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,560
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.

826
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,320
Wish we never murked you.

827
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,760
I wish I never took
that white off Hi-Hatz.

828
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,560
Wish I'd just gone home
and played FIFA like Biggz said.

829
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,760
Anyone got skins?

830
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
No.

831
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,920
Bare weed and no skins.

832
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,160
This is my worst nightmare.

833
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,280
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.

834
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,120
If.. If we knew you,
we wouldn't have stepped you.

835
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,120
It would have been OK to mug me if I
didn't live here? Is that how it works?

836
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,840
Boy, you's tetchy.

837
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,200
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.

838
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,720
You're quite it, you know.

839
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,880
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

840
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,040
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?

841
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,560
Cos he ain't exactly
looking after you tonight.

842
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,480
- He's in Ghana.
- You go out with an African man?

843
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,000
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.

844
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,120
Oh, is it?

845
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,160
Why can't he help
the children of Britain?

846
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,200
Not exotic enough, is it?

847
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,360
Don't get no nice suntan.

848
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,800
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.

849
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,400
It's glowing in the UV light.

850
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,840
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.

851
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,120
Maybe it's a what now?

852
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,880
Er.. it's an eco-hormone
that triggers a social response

853
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,960
in members of the same species.

854
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,680
Maybe that's a female
and the others are male,

855
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,120
and that.. that.. that stuff
is what's attracting them here.

856
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,240
They're smelling us.

857
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,840
They fell out of the sky, yeah?

858
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,280
Well, maybe they like drift through space
on.. on solar winds, like spores,

859
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,960
and.. whatever planet they land on first,

860
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,880
the female leaves a pheromone trail
for the males to follow it,

861
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,240
find it, breed, et cetera.

862
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,440
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.

863
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,000
Some fucking funny-looking moth.

864
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah.

865
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,440
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it

866
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,520
and it seems to be piquing the interest
of a rather hostile alien species.

867
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,600
Just saying,
maybe if you took those clothes off,

868
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,440
they wouldn't know we were here.

869
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,280
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?

870
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,800
No, I'm trying to save your life.

871
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,280
And in answer to your question earlier..

872
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,960
Ah, thank fuck.

873
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,840
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.

874
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,880
Yo, Brewis.

875
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,960
Everyone who touched this thing
got murked, you know..

876
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,160
Dennis..

877
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,600
Jerome..

878
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,120
Tonks..

879
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,360
them feds when they tried touch me,

880
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,320
everyone who had that scent on them.

881
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,520
So if they follow the smell
on that, then..

882
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,360
maybe I can lead 'em.

883
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,240
- Lead them where?
- Somewhere I can blow them up.

884
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,600
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.

885
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
I've gotta finish what I started.

886
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,120
- What if it jumps at us?
- Then throw the banger.

887
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,480
- What if I miss?
- Then we run.

888
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,760
What if it kills us?

889
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:41,640
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem
if you keep on acting like such a pussy.

890
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,160
I'm telling the truth! I know I lied to
you before, but it's for real this time,
I swear!

891
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,480
I'm calling your dad. You hear me?

892
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,240
Throw it, throw it, throw it!

893
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,280
Now, now, do it!

894
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,000
- Are you even listening?
- Mom, I gotta go.

895
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,000
Just do as I say and stay indoors.

896
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,040
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.

897
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,600
- I love you, Mom. I love you.
- Five minutes!

898
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,120
- Any time, blood. Any time.
- We don't give a fuck, man.

899
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,000
Armed police. Stay where you are!

900
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,600
Fuck.

901
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,120
- Wagwan, Biggz.
- What are you doing?

902
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,760
- Armed police, fam.
- Swear down?

903
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,200
Swear down.

904
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,400
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.

905
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,560
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.

906
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,280
Probs and Mayhem, right?

907
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,400
Yeah.

908
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,160
You look clean.

909
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,600
You look good.

910
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,040
I'm betting my life
we're right about this.

911
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,760
Believe me, I'd go out there myself
if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.

912
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
Likewise.

913
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,600
- One floor down. 191.
- One floor down. 191.

914
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,000
- You bell me when you get there.
- Yeah.

915
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,160
Yo, Pest, give me that ring.

916
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,120
What ring, man?

917
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,960
Oh, man, that's ours.

918
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,840
- It's worth bare P, man.
- Give it!

919
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,000
Raasclaat, man.

920
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,520
Thanks.

921
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,520
Even if you outrun them,
even if you make it,

922
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,120
how are you gonna get out?

923
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,000
Don't worry about me, man.

924
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,320
You don't have to do this, Moses.

925
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,760
Yeah, I do.

926
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,240
Oi. Hi.

927
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,080
Is it safe?

928
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,560
No. All right. Good luck.

929
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,760
- Are you sure no one's here?
- Yeah.

930
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,560
Who do you live with?

931
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,160
Just my uncle.

932
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,040
Where's he?

933
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,400
Comes and goes.

934
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,400
Goes, mostly.

935
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,120
You got a little brother?

936
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,440
No.

937
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,440
- How old are you?
- 15.

938
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,040
You look older.

939
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,960
Thanks.

940
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,160
Shut the hatch.

941
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,040
Lock the window.

942
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,240
Leave the front door on the latch.

943
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,000
Turn all the gas all the way up.

944
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,400
Get out the block as fast as you can.
You hear me?

945
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,200
Good luck, Moses.

946
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,280
Later.

947
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,400
Moses versus the monsters.

948
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,440
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.

949
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,280
Allow it.

950
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,120
- Is that Moses?
- Moses!

951
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,160
Moses.

952
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,560
- Oh, shit.
- Is that more of the monsters?

953
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,040
Sort of.

954
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,800
Armed police! Put your weapons down!

955
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,840
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

956
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:49,000
Armed police! Drop your weapon!
Hands on head!

957
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,720
Drop your weapon now!

958
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,400
- Get off me!
- This one?

959
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,400
Aaargh, get off.

960
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,400
Get off me. Aaargh.

961
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,200
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

962
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,440
- I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
- I don't even live here.

963
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,280
I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.

964
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,600
What's your number?
What's your number, huh?

965
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,040
I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.

966
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,400
Get off me!

967
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,200
Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.

968
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,320
He's a hero. He's a legend.

969
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,400
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.

970
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
- Call me.
- Yo, Moses.

971
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,720
Hey, Moses. Moses.

972
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,240
Why do you always arrest the wrong people?

973
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,560
Moses is a hero, don't you get it?
He saved the block.

974
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,320
Excuse me, sir.

975
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,160
This is Samantha Adams,
the woman that called in the mugging.

976
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,200
Miss Adams, I believe you were out
with two of my officers earlier tonight?

977
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,640
- You know they lost their lives?
- Yeah. I was there.

978
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,360
We were attacked.

979
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,560
Those boys there,
the ones you're arresting..

980
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,560
Can you confirm it was them?

981
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,480
Don't let them intimidate you, miss.

982
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,040
No. I know them. They're my neighbours.

983
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,320
They protected me.

984
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,800
Yo, Moses. Hey, Moses.

985
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,320
Moses! Moses! Moses!

986

989
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,360

Brap! Brap! Brap!

992
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,280
Moses, bruv.

993
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,240
Can you hear that?

994
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,680
Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses!

995
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,080
