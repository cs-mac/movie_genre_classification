1
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:30,776
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,647
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,190
Open it.

4
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:50,571
Take this.

5
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,261
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,263
Yes.

7
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:25,312
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,610
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,818
OK.

10
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:37,280
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,746
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,376
Yeah.

13
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,908
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,412
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:32,010
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,382
A face with features...

17
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,222
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,843
I have participated in

19
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,424
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,054
carried out in the world...

21
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:47,600
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,060
Good...

23
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,729
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:57,448
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:03,658
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,500
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:54,560
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,569
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:30,679
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,759
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:35,514
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,814
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,697
Your skin is softer than I tohught.

34
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,195
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,572
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,819
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:52,996
In any case...

38
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,413
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:07,380
Here it is...

40
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,219
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,892
Thank you.

42
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,836
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,044
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,841
I was hasty.

45
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,974
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,812
No.

47
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,017
And now?

48
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,269
No.

49
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,988
Now!

50
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,657
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,072
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,192
in recent years.

53
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,992
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:06,373
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,788
No.

56
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,001
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,463
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,626
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,593
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:21,678
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,766
and the results...

62
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:28,639
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,558
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,649
they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,527
in human mammals.

66
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:40,107
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:41,821
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,160
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,082
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:52,163
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,005
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:57,633
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,385
and it smells different.

74
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,137
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,796
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:06,466
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:08,560
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,272
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,479
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,563
Excuse me.

81
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,863
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,406
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:25,286
By mutating it.

84
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,574
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,325
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:33,834
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,506
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,296
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,177
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:42,757
You're insane!

91
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:46,217
You know the application
of transgenetic therepy...

92
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,893
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,099
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:52,888
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:56,063
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:59,444
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,315
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:04,779
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,862
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:09,327
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:10,833
Don't go on!

102
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,040
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:16,000
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,288
But even so...

105
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,751
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,879
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,554
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,597
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:31,681
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:37,062
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,649
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,442
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:43,481
I remember...

114
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:46,492
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,862
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,782
And it still is.

117
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,284
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,667
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:56,754 --> 00:17:00,622
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,469
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,348
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,050
I don't know.

123
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:14,222
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:17,107
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:13,838
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:17,391
What do you mean?

127
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,102
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,943
No.

129
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,899
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,950
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,654
Yes...

132
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:38,371
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,706
And now what?

134
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:49,927
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,884
and smoke it.

136
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:54,179
I mean us.

137
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,635
Me.

138
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:59,845
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:03,139
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,347
When?

141
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,980
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,613
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,240
Live together.

144
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,617
Live together?

145
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,997
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:24,254
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,503
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,960
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,886
That's it!

150
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:42,061
Here.

151
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,185
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,155
I'm yours.

153
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,484
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,906
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,157
Did I say that?

156
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,999
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,375
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,176
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,011
In this pocket.

160
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:04,471
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:13,690
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,279
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:19,905
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:22,070
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:24,952
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,362
No.

167
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:30,664
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:34,751
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,087
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:40,588
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,599
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:47,678
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:50,014
You're sick.

174
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,691
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:54,942
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:58,401
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,574
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:07,915
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,795
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,331
What do you want?

181
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:53,409
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:54,744
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:57,169
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:01,130
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:02,881
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,929
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:19,271
Zeca!

188
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,783
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,654
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:28,198
Open the door!

191
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:34,042
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:38,874
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:43,761
Little tiger!

194
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:46,260
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,183
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,179
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:55,890
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,383
How did you find us?

199
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:26,595
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,507
He was giving a...

201
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,928
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:33,928
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,059
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:38,439
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,647
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

206
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,073
Brute!

207
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,415
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,253
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:02,546
<i>and the daring robbery commited
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,583
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:05,999
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,592
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

213
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:14,843
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,430
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:22,017
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:26,109
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:29,491
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:32,741
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,155
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,828
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:39,792
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:43,792
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:46,167
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,718
Hide you here?

225
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:48,875
Not a chance.

226
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,842
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,925
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,594
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,437
Robert?

230
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:01,557
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:04,728
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,364
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,822
after what you did?

234
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:11,024
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:17,031
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,449
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,292
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:26,465
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,379
Even better.

240
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,051
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,310
Where are you going?

242
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,849
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:45,816
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,294
What's this?

245
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,972
It's a film!

246
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,842
Go away!

247
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:44,325
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,622
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:49,340
Mom...

250
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,878
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:57,511
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,680
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,311
How could it be her?

254
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:04,389
Get out of here!

255
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:05,933
Keep away!

256
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:15,031
Marilia?

257
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:18,275
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:20,323
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:22,371
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,082
<i>Marilia?

261
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:26,912
Marilia!

262
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:51,193
There.

263
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:20,571
Who is it?

264
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,658
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:24,578
I can't.

266
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:27,622
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,457
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,998
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:57,267
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:07,702
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,830
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,161
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,919
No, where is it?

274
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:19,337
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:28,096
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:35,474
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,559
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:49,569
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,155
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,621
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:59,244
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:02,963
It all fit before.

283
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:51,307
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,590
No.

285
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,269
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:04,071
He saved me.

287
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,691
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,824
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,120
You're saying that...

290
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,949
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,162
No!

292
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:21,412
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:24,465
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:27,166
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,220
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,555
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:35,476
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:37,938
Great.

299
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,145
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:44,978
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,529
Yes.

302
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,607
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,700
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:58,165
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:02,421
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,713
Listen...

307
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,419
What?

308
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,802
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,805
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:18,977
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:27,403
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,197
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,449
It's very big.

314
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:34,327
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:35,829
Yes...

316
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,499
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:43,328
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:58,696
Kill her!

319
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:01,366
Kill them both!

320
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:34,237
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:38,818
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:43,036
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,077
Yes.

324
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,371
They're brothers...

325
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,502
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:53,582
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:59,302
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:05,184
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:10,640
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:15,152
It's my fault.

331
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,906
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,126
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:30,541
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:35,708
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:40,347
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:46,056
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:51,059
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:55,397
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:57,448 --> 00:39:01,196
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:07,160
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:11,336
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:20,968
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,973
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:28,719
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:32,683
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:35,314
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:40,068
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:42,899
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:46,571
But she...

350
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:55,876
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:03,336
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:11,264
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,266
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:19,980
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,522
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:27,324
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:28,872 --> 00:40:31,708
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:36,747
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,589
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,720
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:49,974
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:56,932
One day...

363
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:01,819
whe she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:07,073
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:11,487
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,504
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,469
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,214
And it was...

369
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:30,341
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,932
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:15,519
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:26,357
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,356
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,743
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,074
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:53,682
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,763
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:59,022 --> 00:43:02,937
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,021
Through the window.

380
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,899
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,526
Did you pray?

382
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:55,868
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,958
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,370
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:46,086
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:50,548
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:53,211
As you wish.

388
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:58,723
But hold me!

389
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:08,223
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:11,981
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:13,990
Thank you!

392
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:31,878
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:41,430
Sleep, my love.

394
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:03,656
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:38,278
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:40,987
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:46,034
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,573
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:58,212
Your daughter is getting on well
with my neices.

400
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:00,672
She seems much better...

401
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:03,552
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:07,262
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:07,354 --> 00:47:10,687
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:26,114
To you!

405
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,128
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:21,801
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:35,768
Excuse me.

408
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:46,898
Norma!

409
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:48,574
Norma!

410
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:50,735
Norma!

411
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:52,577
Norma!

412
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,322
Norma!

413
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:57,990
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:51:02,922 --> 00:51:05,413
There, there!

415
00:52:13,575 --> 00:52:14,774
What about this one?

416
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,067
Yes, but...

417
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:17,324
no.

418
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:18,569
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:20,871
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,414
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:25,994
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,624
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:29,132
No stripes.

424
00:52:40,352 --> 00:52:41,895
Something graphic?

425
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:44,642
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:46,647
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:49,854
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:54,904
Cristina...

429
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,903
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:57,995 --> 00:52:59,905
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:01,581
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:04,322
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:08,038
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,165
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,008
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,003
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:17,385
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:19,634
In any case...

439
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:23,469
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:25,643
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:30,894
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:31,695 --> 00:53:33,238
I'm off.

443
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,073
Where to?

444
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,574
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:36,658 --> 00:53:37,904
How come?

446
00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:39,525
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,158
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:43,404
Were you invited?

449
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,575
Jorge knows one of the neices.

450
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:47,411
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,703
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:53,123
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:55,052 --> 00:53:56,381
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:56,553 --> 00:53:58,013
Hello.

455
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:01,471
My wife has left us...

456
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:04,097
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:07,144
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,066
Well...

459
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:12,482
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:18,698
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:20,444
They're very nice.

462
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:22,778
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:26,496
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:27,491
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:28,996
It certainly is.

466
00:54:29,086 --> 00:54:30,461
But...

467
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,169
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:35,339
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:38,427
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:40,220
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:40,306 --> 00:54:43,390
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:29,646 --> 00:55:32,138
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:34,984
What a party!

474
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:36,569
Fresh air!

475
00:55:38,322 --> 00:55:41,358
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:46,245
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:48,700
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:52,836 --> 00:55:54,628
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,129
All the better, right?

480
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:12,807
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:14,934
Stoned?

482
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:17,400
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:19,903
Yes.

484
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,523
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:26,327
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:29,697
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,450
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,290
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,700
Shit!

490
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:37,795
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:39,252
High?

492
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:41,128
Yes.

493
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,048
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:50,260
No. Are you?

495
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,183
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:15,036
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:22,544
And this jacket!

498
00:57:24,052 --> 00:57:27,967
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,174
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:35,718
Wait.

501
00:57:36,732 --> 00:57:38,440
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:20,517
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:23,944
and different.

504
00:58:26,114 --> 00:58:27,822
I'm different too.

505
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,275
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:33,158
No.

507
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:35,286
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:36,784
I don't know.

509
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:40,994
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,500
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:44,547
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:44,675 --> 00:58:46,418
with all my affection.

513
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:51,276
No!

514
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:58,202
Shut up!

515
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:02,826
Stop!

516
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:38,764
Cristina...

517
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,140
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:43,811
Yes...

519
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:45,687
but where are you going?

520
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:48,726
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,477
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:52,021
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:53,737
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:56,612
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,200
It's best not to.

526
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,661
I'm going out.

527
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:04,031
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:05,031
Yes.

529
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:10,331
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:13,127
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:13,174 --> 01:02:16,211
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,510
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:19,555 --> 01:02:22,012
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:19,649
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,240
Son of a bitch!

536
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:05,567
Bastard!

537
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:15,295
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:15,546 --> 01:04:18,713
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:16,997
Help!

540
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:22,666
<i>Help!

541
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:36,430
Come in.

542
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:39,726
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:41,692 --> 01:06:43,103
Thank you.

544
01:06:45,154 --> 01:06:47,146
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:52,737
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:55,991
And the body?

547
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,744
Nothing.

548
01:06:58,251 --> 01:07:00,409
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:06,799
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,718
My son is alive.

551
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:14,556
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,224
but my son?

553
01:07:17,728 --> 01:07:20,219
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,269
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:26,362 --> 01:07:28,320
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:32,451
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:35,108
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:40,493
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:40,585 --> 01:07:43,788
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:45,581
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:46,960
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:47,132 --> 01:07:50,584
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:09,861
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:24,504 --> 01:08:28,204
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,336
Norma...

566
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:36,253
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:37,552
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:40,596
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:44,475
Where are you going?

570
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:53,113
Where are you going?

571
01:09:01,081 --> 01:09:03,157
Norma, love.

572
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:08,751
Everything OK?

573
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:11,205
Yes.

574
01:09:15,846 --> 01:09:17,590
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:20,007
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:20,142 --> 01:09:24,187
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:24,271 --> 01:09:25,766
We tried...

578
01:09:26,315 --> 01:09:29,434
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:31,186
She rips it off.

580
01:09:32,988 --> 01:09:37,068
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:38,202 --> 01:09:41,487
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:41,664 --> 01:09:43,740
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:46,869
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:47,002 --> 01:09:48,377
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:50,835
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:50,923 --> 01:09:53,675
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,041
Maybe...

588
01:09:56,136 --> 01:09:59,007
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:01,803
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:04,472
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:10:04,604 --> 01:10:05,635
How could I know...

592
01:10:05,688 --> 01:10:08,642
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:34,735 --> 01:11:39,610
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:39,698 --> 01:11:42,615
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:43,786 --> 01:11:47,368
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,581
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:52,787
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,004
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:56,966 --> 01:11:59,752
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:12,563
Turn around!

601
01:12:43,553 --> 01:12:46,092
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:46,223 --> 01:12:49,508
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:50,519 --> 01:12:52,642
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:31,427
Eat.

605
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:34,264
Thank you!

606
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:42,519
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:45,819
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:48,702 --> 01:13:51,905
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:58,118
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:58,295 --> 01:14:00,335
We have to talk.

611
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,783
My condolences.

612
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:35,281
We did what we could.

613
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:38,074
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,084
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,794
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:41,838 --> 01:14:44,590
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:48,303 --> 01:14:50,130
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:50,222 --> 01:14:51,385
Yes.

619
01:14:51,515 --> 01:14:54,634
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:54,726 --> 01:14:57,810
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:57,896 --> 01:15:00,387
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:20,534
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:23,785
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:33,723 --> 01:15:35,799
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:43,642
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:45,235 --> 01:15:47,144
The toys...

627
01:15:47,237 --> 01:15:48,980
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:53,356
We buried her today.

629
01:15:55,954 --> 01:15:57,863
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:06,965 --> 01:16:09,634
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:12,346 --> 01:16:14,385
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:14,848 --> 01:16:16,840
That's a good question.

633
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:11,315
Yes?

634
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:12,738
<i>It's us.

635
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,274
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:33,427 --> 01:17:35,004
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:37,294
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:17:37,556 --> 01:17:39,430
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:42,894 --> 01:17:44,519
Good evening.

640
01:17:44,604 --> 01:17:45,933
You're late.

641
01:17:46,105 --> 01:17:47,932
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:51,027
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,436
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:53,947 --> 01:17:57,825
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:38,658 --> 01:18:42,157
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:42,954 --> 01:18:44,662
He isn't.

647
01:18:45,414 --> 01:18:48,582
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,711
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:27,248 --> 01:19:29,205
What's happened?

650
01:19:33,838 --> 01:19:35,796
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:36,465 --> 01:19:38,708
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:48,019 --> 01:19:49,893
No...

653
01:20:36,818 --> 01:20:39,439
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:39,528 --> 01:20:41,153
It's very important.

655
01:20:43,491 --> 01:20:46,825
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:47,036 --> 01:20:51,782
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:55,041
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:56,575
You...

659
01:20:57,881 --> 01:21:00,715
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,169
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:09,931
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:10,018 --> 01:21:12,390
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:15,480
In this case...

664
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:20,269
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:27,158
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:31,737
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:35,120
but in a few months...

668
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:38,335
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:40,171
and the skin...

670
01:21:40,339 --> 01:21:44,419
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:52,894 --> 01:21:56,512
This is very good.

672
01:21:58,316 --> 01:22:00,771
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,520
Four weeks.

674
01:22:02,862 --> 01:22:04,404
Can I go now?

675
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:07,396
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:07,909 --> 01:22:09,866
But we've just started.

677
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,757
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:28,804 --> 01:22:31,426
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:35,889
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:46,316
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:50,028
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:55,657
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,289
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:59,335 --> 01:23:03,664
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:23:04,632 --> 01:23:09,508
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:09,553 --> 01:23:14,097
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:14,183 --> 01:23:15,974
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,823
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:44,672 --> 01:23:48,124
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:52,429
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:24:01,272 --> 01:24:04,143
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:24:04,775 --> 01:24:07,231
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:08,321 --> 01:24:12,781
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:15,536 --> 01:24:20,282
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:20,374 --> 01:24:23,708
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:24,378 --> 01:24:28,672
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:31,461
like a second skin.

698
01:24:32,886 --> 01:24:34,429
Put it on.

699
01:25:19,975 --> 01:25:22,265
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:42,748 --> 01:25:44,076
Bitch!

701
01:26:32,756 --> 01:26:34,131
Stop!

702
01:26:35,426 --> 01:26:37,917
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:40,055 --> 01:26:41,763
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:57,656 --> 01:26:59,483
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,609
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:27:02,786 --> 01:27:04,530
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:39,573 --> 01:27:41,364
We were lucky.

708
01:27:43,118 --> 01:27:44,910
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:28,872 --> 01:28:31,660
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,999
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,647
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,150
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:31,244 --> 01:30:32,905
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:55,727 --> 01:30:58,301
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:30:58,355 --> 01:31:01,225
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:31:21,836 --> 01:31:25,040
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:31:25,507 --> 01:31:28,294
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:31:28,385 --> 01:31:30,176
<i>a place to which...

719
01:31:30,262 --> 01:31:32,587
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:35,308
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,140
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:31:38,395 --> 01:31:41,312
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,689
<i>It's a flace where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:31:45,735 --> 01:31:47,360
<i>freedom.

725
01:31:47,487 --> 01:31:49,195
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:51,902
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:31:51,992 --> 01:31:56,321
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:31:56,788 --> 01:31:58,780
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:33:00,185 --> 01:33:02,094
My Cigarral!

730
01:33:02,937 --> 01:33:04,846
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:09,105
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:09,236 --> 01:33:12,936
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:16,159
I tohught you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:16,993 --> 01:33:18,701
I thought that...

735
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:22,121
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:24,824
My poor child.

737
01:33:25,085 --> 01:33:27,161
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:27,295 --> 01:33:29,703
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:30,382 --> 01:33:32,256
As you wish.

740
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,667
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:37,514 --> 01:33:39,471
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:41,302
I'm parched.

743
01:33:45,355 --> 01:33:47,312
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:49,108 --> 01:33:51,434
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:51,653 --> 01:33:55,188
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:55,532 --> 01:33:57,904
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:02,328
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:34:02,455 --> 01:34:04,247
I'll explain.

749
01:34:05,124 --> 01:34:07,616
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:11,625
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:13,633 --> 01:34:17,631
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:38,408 --> 01:34:40,115
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:40,827 --> 01:34:43,283
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:44,871
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:44,997 --> 01:34:47,619
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:57,044
Who is she?

757
01:34:58,303 --> 01:35:00,426
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:02,965
What's she doing?

759
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,558
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:07,974
I can see that.

761
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:11,558
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:13,985 --> 01:35:16,191
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:16,321 --> 01:35:19,107
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:19,491 --> 01:35:22,445
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,074
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:27,707 --> 01:35:32,036
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:32,879 --> 01:35:35,167
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:35,297 --> 01:35:38,963
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:39,093 --> 01:35:43,304
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:54,526 --> 01:35:57,977
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:13,038
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:26,015 --> 01:36:28,257
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:32,897 --> 01:36:35,684
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:37,985 --> 01:36:40,607
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:40,738 --> 01:36:42,530
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:42,865 --> 01:36:46,068
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:47,369 --> 01:36:48,912
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:48,996 --> 01:36:52,033
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:56,546 --> 01:36:59,037
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:37:00,424 --> 01:37:01,919
Thank you.

781
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:06,273
Good morning.

782
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:13,788
Breakfast.

783
01:38:17,293 --> 01:38:19,084
Thank you.

784
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:30,887
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:31,057 --> 01:38:33,096
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:34,143 --> 01:38:37,476
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:49,650
Last night...

788
01:38:50,492 --> 01:38:52,366
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:52,494 --> 01:38:55,412
we talked alot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:56,958 --> 01:39:00,243
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:39:02,213 --> 01:39:05,332
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:39:06,133 --> 01:39:08,755
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:12,052
that I was free.

794
01:39:14,183 --> 01:39:17,219
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:20,436
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:21,023 --> 01:39:23,479
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:26,351
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:35,747 --> 01:39:38,498
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:43,077
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,914
She promised not to.

801
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:48,256
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:52,633
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:54,257
That's enough!

804
01:39:57,309 --> 01:39:59,551
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:03,480
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:40:03,941 --> 01:40:07,392
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:09,147
Thank you.

808
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:26,830
Come along, child!

809
01:40:33,304 --> 01:40:35,343
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:39,175
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:40,937 --> 01:40:44,305
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:44,523 --> 01:40:46,516
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:49,026
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:49,111 --> 01:40:52,610
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:54,366 --> 01:40:57,284
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:57,369 --> 01:40:58,994
It's not just that.

817
01:40:59,288 --> 01:41:03,072
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:41:04,793 --> 01:41:08,376
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:08,464 --> 01:41:11,299
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:11,425 --> 01:41:14,260
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:14,303 --> 01:41:17,802
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:21,643 --> 01:41:24,182
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:25,314 --> 01:41:28,481
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:03,759
Are you still here?

825
01:42:05,146 --> 01:42:06,391
I'm leaving now...

826
01:42:06,522 --> 01:42:10,187
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:14,488 --> 01:42:16,196
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:16,323 --> 01:42:18,482
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:19,243 --> 01:42:22,861
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,195
as you can see.

831
01:42:24,331 --> 01:42:25,873
And?

832
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:28,991
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:29,253 --> 01:42:31,044
without hormones.

834
01:42:31,172 --> 01:42:33,164
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:33,674 --> 01:42:37,090
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:37,219 --> 01:42:40,718
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:45,102 --> 01:42:48,720
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:48,814 --> 01:42:50,972
Don't go there.

839
01:42:51,108 --> 01:42:53,516
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:53,944 --> 01:42:54,893
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:54,986 --> 01:42:57,738
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:57,864 --> 01:43:00,486
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:43:00,534 --> 01:43:03,452
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:43:04,121 --> 01:43:08,166
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,492
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:10,794 --> 01:43:11,909
You told us...

847
01:43:12,003 --> 01:43:14,625
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:14,715 --> 01:43:16,506
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:16,592 --> 01:43:19,925
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:20,011 --> 01:43:21,885
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:22,223 --> 01:43:26,136
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:26,227 --> 01:43:28,184
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:30,310
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:30,356 --> 01:43:32,977
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:35,319 --> 01:43:37,857
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:41,157 --> 01:43:44,028
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:45,496 --> 01:43:49,280
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:52,669 --> 01:43:53,618
And...

859
01:43:53,712 --> 01:43:55,669
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:57,048 --> 01:43:58,792
A cream?

861
01:44:01,052 --> 01:44:03,722
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:44:04,973 --> 01:44:08,841
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:09,185 --> 01:44:10,810
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:14,769
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,458
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:49,885
Thank you.

867
01:44:50,185 --> 01:44:52,972
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:19,923 --> 01:45:21,667
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,378
Yes.

870
01:45:25,471 --> 01:45:27,463
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:28,682 --> 01:45:30,971
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:31,768 --> 01:45:33,512
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:33,604 --> 01:45:35,762
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:35,814 --> 01:45:38,352
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:53,373 --> 01:45:55,532
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:56,830
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:56,918 --> 01:45:59,492
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:02,791
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:36,457 --> 01:46:39,708
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:54,974
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:57,478 --> 01:46:58,973
Not yet.

882
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:06,278
Come on...

883
01:47:08,114 --> 01:47:09,739
What are you doing?

884
01:47:12,368 --> 01:47:14,195
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:14,663 --> 01:47:16,322
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:17,207 --> 01:47:18,950
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,417
But you promised!

888
01:47:22,545 --> 01:47:24,419
I lied.

889
01:48:03,837 --> 01:48:05,295
Robert?

890
01:48:07,257 --> 01:48:08,716
Robert?

891
01:48:08,842 --> 01:48:10,384
He's asleep.

892
01:48:11,678 --> 01:48:13,421
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,222
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:15,598 --> 01:48:18,385
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:25,066 --> 01:48:26,643
Robert!

896
01:48:27,568 --> 01:48:29,229
My son!

897
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:43,575
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:45,503 --> 01:48:47,330
Where are you?

899
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,560
I knew it.

900
01:51:03,849 --> 01:51:05,474
Hello.

901
01:51:15,278 --> 01:51:17,271
You see to her.

902
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:21,068
Good morning.

903
01:51:33,921 --> 01:51:35,748
What did you want?

904
01:51:37,633 --> 01:51:39,673
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:40,761 --> 01:51:42,837
Are you all right?

906
01:51:46,684 --> 01:51:49,436
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:51,522 --> 01:51:53,480
Do you know me?

908
01:51:54,317 --> 01:51:58,149
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:59,197 --> 01:52:02,696
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,204
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,408
You have to help me.

912
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,047
Look.

913
01:52:19,759 --> 01:52:21,798
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:24,096 --> 01:52:28,177
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:28,518 --> 01:52:30,641
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:31,061 --> 01:52:33,600
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:33,689 --> 01:52:38,066
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:40,112 --> 01:52:44,940
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:54,284
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:56,462 --> 01:52:58,918
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:14,891
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:26,075 --> 01:53:28,448
I'm Vicente.
