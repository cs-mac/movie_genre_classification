1
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,968
<i>Okay, wake up.</i>

2
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:38,001
<i>Don't know where I am.</i>

3
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,146
<i>I don't remember what I did.</i>

4
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,339
<i>Drinking, drunk.</i>

5
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,110
<i>That is a plausible explanation.</i>

6
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,323
<i>And I wish I remembered that part.</i>

7
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:50,755
<i>Or do I?</i>

8
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:58,997
What's her name? What happened?

9
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:04,030
<i>Mary. She was very drunk.
You fucked her. Twice.</i>

10
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>Mr. Memory.</i>

11
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:10,210
<i>Stupid idea.</i>

12
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,373
<i>Where am I?</i>

13
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:18,886
<i>Okay, okay. I'm in this situation.</i>

14
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:21,718
<i>What do my eyes see?</i>

15
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,823
<i>Okay, how many beads?</i>

16
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:29,364
<i>One, two, three, four...
No, meaningless, no.</i>

17
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,374
<i>Good morning.
Good.</i>

18
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,446
Good morning.

19
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,339
Who are you?

20
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,618
I was just about to ask you
that same question.

21
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,244
But you didn't.

22
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,557
Well, you didn't give me a chance to.

23
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:55,784
Oh, I think I did.

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,689
Isn't that an obvious thing to say.

25
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,956
Are we in an obvious situation?

26
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,088
Obviously.

27
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,702
I knew you were gonna say that.

28
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,930
Yeah, I used to surprise myself.

29
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:11,805
Not anymore.

30
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,069
<i>Fucked.</i>

31
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,736
<i>Congratulations.</i>

32
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,612
<i>She was naked and she was boring.</i>

33
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:21,844
<i>Or was she?</i>

34
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,922
<i>Maybe she wasn't boring, but I was.</i>

35
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,856
<i>Bored to death with the book,</i>

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,691
<i>and still suffering to finish it
in some satisfactory manner.</i>

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,330
<i>I hated the book so much,
I'd rewritten it five times, top to bottom.</i>

38
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:41,399
<i>I was nearing another bottom.</i>

39
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,735
<i>And if it weren't for the contract
and the advance,</i>

40
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:48,438
<i>the advance that had long ago declined...</i>

41
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,259
Mar?

42
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,717
It's Rick McMurray for Peter.

43
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,159
Peter, hi.

44
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,764
Yeah, Margo's just kicked me out.

45
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,962
She changed all the locks.

46
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:46,838
I'm not working on it. I can't.
The computer's in the house.

47
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,067
Just a suitcase.

48
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,076
Yeah, I'll call you later.

49
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:03,057
<i>Used to be, you didn't wanna talk
to anyone, you left the house.</i>

50
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,025
<i>Now, you leave the house
and you still have to talk.</i>

51
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,857
<i>I could write a book about that.</i>

52
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,828
<i>That might make a better book.</i>

53
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,899
<i>Anything would make a better book.</i>

54
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,361
Hey, Diane, it's me.
What room number are you?

55
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:16,627
Huh?

56
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,798
No, no, no. No, no, I'm here, I'm here.

57
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm here. See?

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,121
- Why the suitcase?
- Long story. Actually, a short story.

59
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,018
A short story with a catchy opening?

60
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,322
I'm very pleased to welcome
novelist Richard McMurray.

61
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,428
So without further ado...

62
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:51,305
I haven't done this in a while.
What do you usually...

63
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,473
We usually read a piece
and talk about writing.

64
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:56,603
- Oh, dear. Okay.
- Is that something from your new book?

65
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,682
Yes, it is. Or it was.

66
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,376
I was working on this

67
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,317
today at lunch.

68
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:09,515
Thankfully for you, I've edited out
all of the boring, repetitive material.

69
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,357
So I'm left with...

70
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,056
With this.

71
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,192
"One morning,
Richard McMurray woke to find

72
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:21,329
"that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach. "

73
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,468
No, you've heard that.

74
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,101
Actually,

75
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,476
there's nothing left.
Consider yourselves lucky.

76
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,673
Mr. McMurray?

77
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:34,877
Richard or Rick.

78
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,818
Rick, what's the new book about?

79
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,956
Well, after four years, it's not so new.

80
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,220
But some very good news today. My wife,

81
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:45,195
or is it ex-wife?
How quickly do they become exes?

82
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:50,261
She locked me out, and my computer in,
so I can't work on my book anymore.

83
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:54,629
And I have to say that feels better
than anything's felt in

84
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:57,300
four years.

85
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,068
Richard's always been very hard on himself.

86
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,306
You didn't read the book.

87
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:04,145
<i>What do you think about
The Trouble with Dick now?</i>

88
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,914
Well, I haven't read it since

89
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,251
they ripped the galleys from my hands.

90
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,649
I'm afraid to read it again.

91
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,754
I'm sure I'd find
a zillion things wrong with it.

92
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,797
At the time,
I remember thinking it was pretty good.

93
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,564
I'm sure it could have been better,
but I did the best I could and

94
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,261
I wasn't looking over my shoulder.

95
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,236
So what are your plans now?

96
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,238
Well, I don't have a place to sleep tonight.

97
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,777
But I've escaped from Malibu and that feels

98
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,477
great.

99
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,220
Wow, I feel great.

100
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:45,959
It's always seemed to me that
there are two different kinds of writers,

101
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,187
those that write
from the inside of their heads

102
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:50,787
and those that write about
what's on the outside.

103
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,499
The inside of your head, my head,

104
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:57,904
is fairly limited.

105
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:03,239
But reality is inexhaustible, so I opted for
writing about stuff on the outside.

106
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:06,007
Of course, it's easier said than done,

107
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:08,974
but feel free to bust me anytime.

108
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:10,176
Rick. Rick.
Rick.

109
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,276
Could you tell us...
- Actually, we're out of time.

110
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:16,380
But I would like to thank Richard
for sharing so much with us.

111
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,321
Thank you.

112
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,458
Thank you.

113
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,161
Excuse me.

114
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,794
- Will you sign this for me?
- Sure.

115
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:30,497
- What's your name?
- Kristin.

116
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,801
Hi, Kristin.

117
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:36,968
So is it really true
you don't have a place to stay tonight?

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,310
That is a true fact, Kristin.

119
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,110
You know, you can stay with me.

120
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:44,653
I mean, my roommate and I don't mind
sleeping on the couch.

121
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,156
Well,

122
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:50,051
thank you, but if I said yes,
that would be a plan,

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,323
and I'm sort of loving not having a plan.
As long as that lasts.

124
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,762
So, not having a plan is your plan.

125
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,197
Oh, another dream punctured.

126
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,701
Tell me about Malibu.

127
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:10,881
Okay.

128
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,575
I sat in this room
and looked at my computer.

129
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,121
Sometimes I looked at the waves.

130
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,857
And sometimes I'd confuse the two.

131
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,448
What about Margo?

132
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,655
She owned the house.
Maybe she owned the waves.

133
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,823
I paid her rent.

134
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,662
On the house or the waves?

135
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:33,033
That's the thing about Malibu,
it all conflates. It's boring.

136
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,628
Successful novelist married to

137
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:37,299
beautiful actress, living in Malibu?
Sounds mythic.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,210
You care to deconstruct me? Is that
what you beautiful, brainy professors do?

139
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,613
- Oh, I wouldn't presume.
- Yes, you would, but allow me.

140
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,878
Successful novelist.

141
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,012
Cult hit, seven long years ago.

142
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,817
"Genre-bending, coming of age... "

143
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,858
Please, let me deconstruct myself.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,657
Cult novelist gets confused
by the encomium "genre-bender. "

145
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:02,097
His egregious use of sci-fi
in an otherwise conventional first novel

146
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,965
fools him into trying the same trick twice.

147
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,472
- And what else am I?
- Living in Malibu.

148
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:11,010
Well, I've already taken care of that,
or rather she has.

149
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,373
God bless her.

150
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,711
You okay?

151
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,555
If you'd asked me that question yesterday,
I would've lied and said yes.

152
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,090
Fuck, if you asked me that this morning...

153
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,763
What about you? Doctor of Literature,

154
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:35,461
teaching at the great university,
living the life of the mind.

155
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,562
- You haven't been to a faculty meeting.
- You have a boyfriend?

156
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:42,207
Um...

157
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,710
No, not at the moment.

158
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,009
So, we're both available.
What are you doing tonight?

159
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,746
Oh... Oh!

160
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,683
Richard,

161
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,585
- this is a little fast.
- Life is fast.

162
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,126
- That sounds like a familiar line.
- Only because we're familiar.

163
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,059
Down, down, boy.

164
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:05,929
Sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted you
to meet my roommate.

165
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,094
- Jacqueline, hi.
- Hi, Jacqueline.

166
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:12,331
- Thank you so much for today, it was...
- You're welcome.

167
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,574
So have you found a place to stay?

168
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:18,974
Oh, no. I haven't
officially started looking yet.

169
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,709
Well, our couch is extremely comfortable,

170
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,114
and it's still available.

171
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,710
Yeah, you said you needed a place to sleep

172
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:28,814
- and we have a place, so...
- And it would be an honor.

173
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:31,155
- So you were serious?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,553
- Okay, why not?
- Great.

175
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,138
Here.

176
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:44,740
Okay.

177
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:48,072
We'll see you later, then?
- I'll see you later.

178
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,013
- Bye.
Thank you.

179
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,417
- See you.
See you. Bye-bye.

180
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,144
Richard, I have a couch
if you need a place to stay.

181
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:58,243
I don't need a couch.

182
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:01,984
- Lf you're planning on staying with them...
- I wasn't planning on anything.

183
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,050
Let me help.

184
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,028
I don't need help. It's a lark.

185
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:10,430
- It's just... I'm their teacher.
- Diane, it's just a couch.

186
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,564
What's wrong with mine?

187
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:18,799
What's wrong is, you never would have
offered if they hadn't first.

188
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,207
But I did.

189
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:23,581
Yeah.

190
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,977
Weird fucking day.

191
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:37,189
It's open.

192
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:41,900
Hi.

193
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:45,269
- You really came.
- You're really reading it.

194
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:47,896
Yeah, I...

195
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:50,669
I read it in high school and... Wow.

196
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:55,047
The Diana character,
that's Professor Freed, right?

197
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,137
Diane.

198
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,480
Should have been cleverer
with the pseudonym. First novel.

199
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,288
So, you guys have a history?

200
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,857
I mean, it's her, but it's not her.

201
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,925
How did you do that?

202
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,189
I just did it.

203
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,061
- Hello.
- Hey,

204
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,226
- Jacqueline.
- Richard.

205
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,943
Are you still a pothead?

206
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,616
And that's all I know.

207
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,845
What is this?

208
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,480
It's probably the Main.

209
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,987
Their second CD.

210
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,424
It's amazing.

211
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,654
Mmm-hmm.

212
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,320
They're from Portland.

213
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,102
I'll burn you a disk, if you'd like.

214
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,329
Thank you.

215
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,204
Do you listen to music when you write?

216
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:53,535
Sometimes. Do you?

217
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:55,973
Yes, always.

218
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,170
Power pop stuff, you know.

219
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,443
Hits, only hits. Like "Best of" albums.

220
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:06,187
HIHO is my thing.

221
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:09,052
Hits In, Hits Out. HIHO.

222
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,450
Hi-ho.

223
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,530
"Hi-ho, Silver, away. "

224
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:21,793
That's The Lone Ranger
from a long time ago.

225
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:24,870
Oh, fuck.

226
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,239
My fucking phone is ringing.

227
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:29,612
Ow!

228
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,712
It's my agent, shit.

229
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,510
Should I talk to him?
Gotta talk to him sometime.

230
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:38,520
- Yeah, just get it over with.
- Don't bother.

231
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,914
Hi.

232
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,257
With friends.

233
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:48,631
Yes.

234
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,691
Marty, she kicked me out of the house.

235
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:55,467
I only had chapter one with me, yes.

236
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,934
No, I called him. He's on it. Yeah.

237
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,013
Yes.

238
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,980
Goodbye, Marty.

239
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,483
- Bye, Marty.
- Fuck.

240
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:11,922
- Did I sound high?
- No.

241
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,081
Yes.

242
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,451
Why the fuck did I answer that?

243
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,689
It's a primal mammalian urge.
You're hard-wired to do it.

244
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,973
Dead air.

245
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,841
Hmm.

246
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:49,992
<i>Hmm...</i>

247
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,690
<i>Kristin's towel or Jacqueline's?</i>

248
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,464
<i>Shampoo, which is which?</i>

249
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:02,934
<i>Similar because same demographic,
family, education, that kind of shit.</i>

250
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:07,939
<i>They are roommates, but different.</i>

251
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:10,340
<i>Huh?</i>

252
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,051
<i>Jacqueline.</i>

253
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:18,548
<i>Eye drops, Kristin. Tampons, shared.</i>

254
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,023
<i>Do I talk louder to myself stoned?</i>

255
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:29,928
<i>What a strange, great, unexpected place
to be peeing tonight.</i>

256
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,174
- Hello.
- Hey.

257
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,975
Brad, this is Richard. Richard, this is Brad.

258
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,310
What's up?
- Hey, Brad.

259
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,544
<i>Richard wrote The Trouble with Dick.</i>

260
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,052
- The flick?
- No, no, the book.

261
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,083
Cool.

262
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,618
<i>Oh, God, The Mezzanine.</i>

263
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:56,493
Been Kristin-ized.
It's a book about a broken shoelace.

264
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:58,965
- Far out.
- It's great.

265
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,036
Yeah, it's the greatest story ever told,
about a shoelace.

266
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,140
Anyway, sweet dreams.

267
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,903
- Good night.
- Good night.

268
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,194
Hi.

269
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,570
I'm gonna write a bestseller.

270
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,438
Does that make you hate me?

271
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,478
No, what genre?

272
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:46,175
Me. I'll turn myself into a genre.

273
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,682
I'll fulfill my destiny.

274
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,177
What?

275
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,017
The destiny of my name.

276
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,655
Jacqueline Susann.

277
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,662
She wrote terrible books,
and nobody even reads them anymore,

278
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:01,356
but everybody remembers her.

279
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,060
Or the idea of her anyway.

280
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,796
So just imagine a really well-written,

281
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:08,997
postmodern Jacqueline Susann.

282
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:12,967
- I'm trying. Postmodern?
- Mmm-hmm.

283
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,602
Why can't there be
really hot postmodern sex?

284
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:17,112
- No reason.
- I know.

285
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,013
- Sex transcends style.
- Sex is style.

286
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,142
Well...

287
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,847
Sex is whatever you want it to be.
It's a mirror.

288
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,058
What is that look?

289
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:33,059
- I'm thinking.
- You think it's silly.

290
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,826
- Right? A silly ambition?
- No.

291
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,298
It's all right, 'cause I really don't care.

292
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,392
- No.
- Actually, I do care.

293
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,233
But I'm still gonna do it.

294
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,670
You know what you want.

295
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:44,173
I respect that. Hell, I envy it.

296
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:45,903
You don't respect what I want.

297
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,603
I don't have to, you do.

298
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,281
Write a hit book, more power to you.

299
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,048
You did it.

300
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,350
By accident.

301
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,622
Well,

302
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,062
I guess it's beddy-bye.

303
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,874
- Research?
- What?

304
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,676
- Brad.
- No.

305
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,408
I sent him packing.
There's nothing new there.

306
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,877
Well, research takes patience.

307
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,385
And tenacity.

308
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,215
Well,

309
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,589
time for bed.

310
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,521
Time for couch.

311
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,799
- Good night.
- Good night.

312
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:19,866
- Hey.
- Hi.

313
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:23,170
- What time is it?
- 9:45.

314
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,610
Oh, Jesus.

315
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:26,147
Late for class.

316
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,215
- I left you some coffee.
- Thank you.

317
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,218
Could I use one of your computers
to check my e-mail? Would that be...

318
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,716
Um...

319
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,793
Yeah. Sure.

320
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,327
- Bye.
- See you later.

321
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,801
Kristin. Oh, hey, Kristin.

322
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:49,269
Key to your apartment.

323
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:02,282
Hi, Peter.

324
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:04,321
Yeah.

325
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:06,824
What?

326
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,726
I'm hiding assets? That's fascinating.

327
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:17,264
No, it's not community property.
I started it before we were married.

328
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:18,335
Yes.

329
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,671
I know she's an officer of the corporation.

330
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,868
Uh-huh.

331
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,836
Well... What?

332
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,905
It's a joint bank account.

333
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,081
No credit cards, no...

334
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:35,847
Peter, you're an excellent lawyer, fix it.

335
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,850
I am crashing on the couch of a couple of
English students right now, okay?

336
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,789
I have about $60 in my wallet.

337
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,893
Yes, they're over 18.

338
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,729
Good morning.

339
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,983
<i>Kelly, I know you've been
lonely since Ed was called up,</i>

340
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,488
<i>but I don't think you should be
having sex with strangers.</i>

341
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,857
<i>Maybe you checked this guy's credit history,
but did you check his medical history?</i>

342
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,294
<i>This guy Vincent is nice, Kel.</i>

343
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,558
<i>His pecs are buff, but not his paragraphs.</i>

344
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,529
<i>Maybe I'd be better off dating
someone in the physical sciences.</i>

345
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,732
<i>Sometimes I just wanna stand
in Royce Quad and yell,</i>

346
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,310
<i>"Richard, are you here?"</i>

347
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,378
Rick?

348
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,746
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey.

349
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,845
Didn't you hear us?

350
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,183
No, I was just checking my e-mail.
Bad news.

351
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,455
So, until my lawyer
gets it straightened out, I...

352
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,252
I have no money.

353
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,965
Wow. You really don't seem
that upset about it.

354
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,099
You can stay here for a while.

355
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,365
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,940
Only if you agree to let me pay
for all the food and at least a month's rent

357
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:12,409
until my finances, you know.

358
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,570
No.
No.

359
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,874
I'm afraid I insist.

360
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,471
Well, how long is this gonna take?

361
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,517
I don't know.
A couple of days, a week maybe.

362
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,745
My lawyers are very good.

363
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,221
Yeah, but how good
are your wife's lawyers?

364
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,818
Listen, how about, instead of rent,

365
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:29,794
you pay us in services?

366
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:33,195
Literary consultation.

367
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,393
Yeah.

368
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,736
I read your stuff and make some comments?

369
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,010
Hmm.

370
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:48,205
Okay, it'd be my pleasure.

371
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,184
Really.

372
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:53,849
How did a genius like you
end up on our couch?

373
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:55,355
Just lucky, I guess.

374
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:01,185
<i>Her profession was empty
rooms, always someone else's rooms,</i>

375
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:03,856
<i>that she showed and sold on commission.</i>

376
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:06,730
<i>Anonymous spaces and faces.</i>

377
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:10,931
<i>If it was a he, and he looked okay,
she thought, "He can sleep with me. "</i>

378
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,064
<i>Have your way, eye to eye.</i>

379
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:16,373
<i>And I prefer it not so perfectly polite.</i>

380
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:19,243
<i>But I will not show you, you must see.</i>

381
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,510
<i>There is a reward for seeing me.</i>

382
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,680
<i>Why was I doing this?</i>

383
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:27,051
<i>Didn't know him, didn't like him.</i>

384
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:29,454
<i>Didn't remember his name,</i>

385
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,460
<i>but I got him to say yes.</i>

386
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:33,859
<i>Because of me.</i>

387
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:38,124
<i>Just wish that he was better,
because if he was good,</i>

388
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:41,601
<i>any good, then I would
stop talking to myself.</i>

389
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:44,231
<i>Details.</i>

390
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:47,174
<i>A collection of details
pouring into my senses.</i>

391
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:50,775
<i>Input</i>

392
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,041
<i>defines me.</i>

393
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:03,892
<i>She thought she was revealing one
thing, but she was revealing something else.</i>

394
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:06,155
<i>Her words were a window into her world,</i>

395
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:08,630
<i>a prime artifact of what she was thinking.</i>

396
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:13,304
<i>Not as a fiction writer, an artifact of herself.</i>

397
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:19,939
<i>Already I can't see her as who she is, but
rather as a character that I am observing.</i>

398
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:22,070
<i>Recording, manipulating.</i>

399
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,273
<i>As much as I can manipulate words.</i>

400
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,539
<i>Huh?</i>

401
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:29,620
<i>I'm talking to myself,
like her character talks to herself.</i>

402
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:32,283
<i>At least she was getting laid.</i>

403
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,457
<i>Maybe she's right.</i>

404
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:38,086
<i>The Jacqueline Susann mode of literature.</i>

405
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:42,457
<i>And what was Richard doing,
except critiquing her in such a way</i>

406
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:46,527
<i>that preserved and perhaps propelled
his tenuous self-image</i>

407
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,834
<i>into something that he could live with.</i>

408
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:51,774
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
- Didn't.

409
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,509
So, what do you think?

410
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:57,015
Well...

411
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:01,545
You definitely put me inside her head.

412
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,987
I wish there were more details.

413
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:05,558
It's just a beginning.

414
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,422
Well, I can't factor that in.

415
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,655
You hand me something,
I wanna read it without excuses.

416
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:11,924
Fair enough.

417
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,597
Your character talks about input.

418
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,736
What she gets from her senses,
so give me that.

419
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,775
That's what I want. Don't just put me
in her head, put me in that room.

420
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,036
Put me...

421
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,803
Squish it around.

422
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:38,292
<i>So if I think about Jacqueline,
this Jacqueline, as a character,</i>

423
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,190
<i>does it elevate what I'm doing into...</i>

424
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,230
<i>And why do I have to elevate it?
For who, whom?</i>

425
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,598
<i>She has definite talent as a writer.</i>

426
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:50,227
<i>A voice, subject matter, theme.</i>

427
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:53,536
<i>Not completely aware of what she's doing,</i>

428
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:54,836
<i>but who is?</i>

429
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,681
The novel?

430
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:02,984
No. Something new.

431
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,586
Something, anyway, maybe.

432
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,391
Well, okay. I think I'm...

433
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,663
Thank you though.

434
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:20,593
<i>She tip-toed away.</i>

435
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:25,106
<i>Not tip-toes, but the quiet susurration
of cotton sock on shag.</i>

436
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,641
<i>She was gone.</i>

437
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:29,337
<i>His words chasing her
all the way back to her bedroom.</i>

438
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,010
<i>And as Richard sat there
with paper and pen,</i>

439
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:34,379
<i>he imagined the room
that she was sitting in.</i>

440
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:36,475
<i>He imagined his words in her head.</i>

441
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:40,149
<i>Her room was as small
and purple as her prose.</i>

442
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:44,016
<i>She listened for the sound
of his pen scraping on paper.</i>

443
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,154
<i>Laid back on the bed,</i>

444
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:47,355
<i>five senses.</i>

445
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:51,430
<i>And if she closed her eyes,
did that mean four?</i>

446
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:55,934
<i>Shrugged off her clothes because
she wanted to feel the air and not herself.</i>

447
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,530
<i>Not herself, not...</i>

448
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:02,444
<i>She rose from the bed
and quietly twisted the knob,</i>

449
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:06,038
<i>opening the door a crack,
hungered for some small clue.</i>

450
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:11,283
<i>Afraid to stop and reread this.
Afraid to stop, because I'm just starting.</i>

451
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,752
<i>Character from my novel
just walked into the room.</i>

452
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,624
<i>Sat down in front of me saying, "Here I am.</i>

453
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,926
<i>"Take your best shot,
see if you can capture the contradictions,</i>

454
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:25,526
<i>"the flickers of attention and inhibition,
the moment-to-momentness of me.</i>

455
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:28,800
<i>"If I weren't here,
then you could kid yourself, but I am. "</i>

456
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:32,707
<i>Not a distraction,
but yet seen and imagined.</i>

457
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,335
<i>Self-conscious in all the right ways,</i>

458
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:37,541
<i>and un-self-conscious
of the self that I am stealing.</i>

459
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:42,214
<i>How do you describe that delicate,
fractious angle of her chin?</i>

460
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:46,519
<i>Compare it to how many degrees off axis
from what?</i>

461
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,522
<i>Well, she's younger,
further away from death,</i>

462
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:52,564
<i>less fearing of it, more confident,
less battered.</i>

463
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:56,533
<i>Different set of images pounding into her
from different channels, and yet,</i>

464
00:30:56,636 --> 00:30:59,503
<i>her face seems smoother
and cleaner as she writes.</i>

465
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:02,802
<i>More there, and less...
Fuck, I'm getting vague.</i>

466
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:05,845
<i>First person or third?</i>

467
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,811
<i>Think in whole sentences.</i>

468
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,782
<i>She sat across the room from him
in an attitude of...</i>

469
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:13,978
<i>Okay, stop. Pick a moment,</i>

470
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:16,681
<i>the best one, and go all the way into it.</i>

471
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:21,859
<i>The moment where she sat down,
as her body settled into balance.</i>

472
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,855
<i>I'm imagining it backwards.</i>

473
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,763
<i>Cubist strokes,
paintings perceived instantaneously,</i>

474
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,928
<i>words, sequentially.</i>

475
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,199
<i>Run out of ideas, but still running.</i>

476
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,611
Jacqueline?

477
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:52,786
Jacqueline?

478
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:01,236
Jackie?

479
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,266
Oh, Jackie?

480
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,409
Oh, Jackie O?

481
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:12,146
<i>How did she dress and leave
without me noticing?</i>

482
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:16,513
<i>Was I that into it? That inspired?
Or that out of it?</i>

483
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,653
<i>Look around. Don't see her journal.</i>

484
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:23,851
<i>But the whole room is hers.</i>

485
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:30,062
<i>And under the surface, a whole book here.</i>

486
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:36,064
<i>It's wrong, but... No, not if it's what I do.</i>

487
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:38,663
<i>It's what I do. I'm doing it.</i>

488
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,606
<i>Obvious thoughts of an obvious writer,</i>

489
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,703
<i>and a tired game, tiresome...
Stop, stop. Stop.</i>

490
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,645
Jacqueline?

491
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:04,227
Hi.

492
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,926
Hey. Just checking my e-mail.

493
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,894
Thought you were a Mac guy.

494
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:13,905
No, I'm trying to open myself up
to new experiences.

495
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,037
- Where is Jacks?
- I don't know.

496
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:20,108
Did you just get back?

497
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:22,976
I've actually been here all day.

498
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,244
- All day?
- Writing.

499
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:30,783
- Don't you need some fresh air?
- I've OD'd on fresh air.

500
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,396
Hello? Hey.

501
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:49,276
Really?

502
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,774
Well, that was fast.

503
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,906
Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thank you.

504
00:34:58,621 --> 00:34:59,588
No.

505
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:03,716
No, she can have the goddamn thing.
Tell her.

506
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,692
Okay. Yeah. Bye-bye.

507
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:13,625
You seem upset.

508
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:19,038
No. No, good news, sort of. Lawyer stuff.

509
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:22,609
I got my money back. Such as it is.

510
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,148
And the book? What's the title again?

511
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,216
Oh, uh...

512
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:32,578
<i>The morning I left, it was, honestly,
Doom for Breakfast.</i>

513
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,489
Maybe because I never knew what it was,
I never knew what to call it,

514
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,822
but it's hers now.

515
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,429
You're free.

516
00:35:46,303 --> 00:35:48,396
So I guess our deal is off.

517
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:50,874
Yeah.

518
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,568
Listen.

519
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:59,043
I hope this doesn't sound
or seem too weird,

520
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,947
but I would like to stay.

521
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,815
I mean, I'm writing again.

522
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,781
And I'm superstitious. I'm afraid if I leave

523
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,622
I'll break my streak.

524
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,423
It's not like I was blocked.

525
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,296
I mean, I can always spin out pages,
I can write pages anytime,

526
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:19,029
but I didn't like them. They were shit.

527
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:21,571
And for some reason being...

528
00:36:22,774 --> 00:36:25,800
There's something...
I mean, it's boring to talk about, but...

529
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:29,312
- No, no.
- I'd like to stay.

530
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:31,709
If it's okay.

531
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:35,481
- Sure.
- On one condition, I pay the rent.

532
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,714
No, we pay the rent anyway, so...

533
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:41,259
But I'm not here anyway, and I'm sure
you guys could use some extra money.

534
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:42,589
So, I pay.

535
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:48,360
- So no writing lessons?
- No, yes. No. Yes, writing lessons.

536
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:50,959
I'd still love to see your stuff.

537
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,265
<i>- What if you think it's terrible?
Like everyone else on the planet,</i>

538
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:54,533
<i>I'm talking and I'm thinking,</i>

539
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:57,474
<i>and the thinking doesn't always
overlap with the talking.</i>

540
00:36:57,577 --> 00:37:01,274
<i>- That's the subtext, and...
- The only terrible stuff is back in Malibu.</i>

541
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:04,276
Show me something.

542
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:08,814
A story.

543
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:21,458
<i>Barton's idea of a good time
was to roll a fat one,</i>

544
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:23,900
<i>watch The Big Lebowski with his buds,</i>

545
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:27,269
<i>then truck on down to the local lanes
and roll a few lines.</i>

546
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,013
<i>My idea of a good time was Barton</i>

547
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:36,241
<i>before his idea of a good time
was a bowling ball.</i>

548
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,820
<i>Every sad story is the same, right?</i>

549
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,816
<i>In the end, we're all dead.</i>

550
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:50,120
<i>A bowling ball is
an evolved form of complex carbon,</i>

551
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:51,721
<i>just like people.</i>

552
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:57,131
<i>My mind felt clear, empty,</i>

553
00:37:57,238 --> 00:37:59,570
<i>ready to strike or spare.</i>

554
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:01,836
<i>Hope or despair.</i>

555
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:04,606
<i>The trick to aiming is not to...</i>

556
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,894
<i>Iris out.</i>

557
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,099
Then sit in the dark with whatever
lies behind your cool, quiet eyelids.

558
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,941
What's the most important thing
in the story for you?

559
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:47,285
- Walking off alone at the end.
- So why write about the guy?

560
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:51,122
Well, I figured she needed to get
the bowling ball from somewhere.

561
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,128
- This guy...
- Barton.

562
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,791
Okay, start there, why Barton?

563
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,358
<i>Well, Barton Fink was the Coen brothers
film that predates The Big Lebowski.</i>

564
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,099
It's about a writer, so it's a referential echo.
It's clever. I'm all for cleverness,

565
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,903
but the Barton details feel generic to me.

566
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,472
The way you write,

567
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,016
the rhythm of your sentences,
gives me a sense of you.

568
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,019
How things bounce around your head.

569
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,390
It's like a footprint. It's very distinctive.

570
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,055
Let's just say I like to watch you walk.

571
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,429
I have a nice ass, so to speak.

572
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,192
But the Barton stuff is all...

573
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:35,703
Even if the guy's a drip,
find a fresh way to show that.

574
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,342
- Draw from real life.
- Draw something from you.

575
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:41,708
But you wrote sci-fi.

576
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,578
I wrote about a guy
who wanted to write science fiction.

577
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:49,678
He was trying to squeeze himself into
a different landscape as, you know, a way to

578
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:54,021
cope with his problems, and I was doing
the same thing writing that book.

579
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:57,654
I mean, I didn't know that then, not overtly,
and we were smoking a lot of pot.

580
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,561
It wasn't much of a stretch.

581
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,897
Your stuff's good, Kristin.

582
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:05,903
Compared to you,
I was an idiot when I was 20.

583
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:07,063
19.

584
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:10,368
But who's counting?

585
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,778
It's good.

586
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,481
So what are you writing now, post-Malibu?

587
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,917
Are you writing from experience?

588
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,116
Practicing what you preach?

589
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,855
Just taking notes.

590
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,329
<i>Notes from Underground?</i>

591
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:36,565
If I tell myself it's just notes,
keeps me looser.

592
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,707
Notes from a couch.

593
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:43,205
So the Barton character, is there a template?

594
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:48,342
High school flame.
And I did notice you changed the subject.

595
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:53,114
Give me a Barton detail.
Something disgusting or weird or

596
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:56,287
disgustingly weird.

597
00:40:57,993 --> 00:41:01,827
Well, there was this water bottle
rolling around in Barton's Honda,

598
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,331
and he got very weird
when I reached down for it,

599
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:09,268
so I snuck back later,
and it was filled with piss.

600
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:11,067
Oh!

601
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,069
- Piss bottle.
- Yeah.

602
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:15,006
Well, start there.

603
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:18,308
Maybe you pick up the bottle
when he's driving and...

604
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:23,511
Speed of that is...

605
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:27,549
Forget it. It's fortuitous...
Can you call it fortuitous?

606
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:29,625
Hello? Hey, Marty.

607
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:34,796
Well, she's got the book,
how can I deliver it?

608
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,063
Are you threatening me?

609
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:40,400
Are they threatening me?

610
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:43,771
Well, they should sue her for the advance,
shouldn't they?

611
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:45,569
Well, let's be clear.

612
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,770
Marty, I hate the book,
I don't want it published.

613
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:51,814
Can't I just give them another book?

614
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:55,510
Listen to your fucking language.
I'm not in breach, I'm the writer.

615
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,282
Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,448
Okay. Okay.

617
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:41,030
- Oh, hey.
- You okay?

618
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:44,432
Yeah. Great. Actually I feel very free.

619
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,668
Should I smash my cell, too?
Is that part of the tutorial?

620
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,075
Wait until you get a book agent.

621
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,773
Meeting some of my friends,
you want to come with?

622
00:42:57,751 --> 00:42:59,480
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

623
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,754
Okay.

624
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:03,986
<i>I wanted to stay home,</i>

625
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,719
<i>but there was a lot to be learned
from seeing Kristin in a social context.</i>

626
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:09,522
<i>That could be a boon.</i>

627
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,392
<i>It was all about the work.</i>

628
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:13,193
<i>That's what I told myself.</i>

629
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,665
<i>That everything I was doing
was about the work.</i>

630
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,796
<i>But it wasn't intimate
or surprising or insightful.</i>

631
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,965
<i>I wasn't insightful.</i>

632
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:22,474
<i>The Heisenberg principle.</i>

633
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:25,272
<i>The observer affecting the observed.</i>

634
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:28,576
<i>Within a minute of sitting down,
I was wondering when I could politely leave.</i>

635
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:30,116
<i>I couldn't wait to get back to the apartment.</i>

636
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:33,448
I'm going to take off. Thank you.
It was nice meeting you.

637
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:36,955
<i>All the artifacts, all the evidence of them.</i>

638
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:38,582
<i>Goldmine.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

639
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:41,594
<i>Better to exercise the imagination with that.</i>

640
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:46,960
<i>After I left, I imagined that...</i>

641
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:48,798
<i>Is he okay? I mean...
Is he okay? I mean...</i>

642
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:51,896
<i>He just gulped down his latte and...
He sipped down his latte and...</i>

643
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,736
Left. I know.
He's been going through a lot lately.

644
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,400
<i>Richard's been going through a lot.</i>

645
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,273
<i>And he's really sleeping on your couch?</i>

646
00:43:57,379 --> 00:43:58,869
<i>He's gotta have bucks.</i>

647
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,642
<i>He wants to sleep on my couch.</i>

648
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,548
<i>And that's the only thing
he wants to sleep on?</i>

649
00:44:06,456 --> 00:44:09,619
<i>But what I imagined was, well,</i>

650
00:44:09,726 --> 00:44:11,387
<i>so unimaginative.</i>

651
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:14,760
<i>Meeting her friends was a bad idea.</i>

652
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:17,524
<i>The apartment was more than enough world.</i>

653
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,157
<i>It was too much.</i>

654
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,376
<i>That one corner of existence
was, for me, inexhaustible.</i>

655
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:03,608
<i>And in that bed
there was neither dream nor sleep.</i>

656
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,873
<i>Just a dream of sleep,
until another voice spoke.</i>

657
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:08,842
<i>Dick, come on.</i>

658
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:11,150
Dick.

659
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:13,986
Out of bed. Here we go.

660
00:46:15,655 --> 00:46:17,987
That's right. Up we go.

661
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:20,026
Okay, put your arm...

662
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:28,128
Okay, Dick.

663
00:46:29,804 --> 00:46:31,101
What's wrong?

664
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:33,463
What's wrong with you?

665
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:35,572
I don't know.

666
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:41,275
This house is a bad environment for you.
I think that's a big part of the problem.

667
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,009
Now I feel responsible.

668
00:46:43,118 --> 00:46:46,554
It's not this house. It's not this house.
It's not this house.

669
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,748
Then, Dick, talk to me. What is it?

670
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:53,023
It's pressure. Everything is pressure.

671
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,858
Such as?

672
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:57,822
Name something.

673
00:46:59,368 --> 00:47:00,335
Okay.

674
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:02,595
A flower.

675
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:04,035
There's a bag of flour on a shelf.

676
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,131
It's real, it exists, it's tangible.

677
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:08,800
<i>Somebody drew the label.</i>

678
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,845
<i>They grew the wheat, they...</i>

679
00:47:10,947 --> 00:47:12,710
<i>They made the bread.</i>

680
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:15,682
<i>It gets eaten. It tastes good.
It does something.</i>

681
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:18,345
And the bag, it says to me,

682
00:47:19,656 --> 00:47:23,114
"What do you do, huh? What do you... "
What do I say to that?

683
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,759
What do I say to that?

684
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:32,892
It's better than me. It's real.

685
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,238
Dick, what are you saying?

686
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,365
Nothing. I don't...

687
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:41,376
"He ran out of the room, out of his head.

688
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:44,641
"Like running across the bottom
of a dead, dry ocean.

689
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:47,615
"And it felt like drowning. Drowning in air. "

690
00:47:52,823 --> 00:47:57,226
So Professor Freed must have been
flattered by literary immortality.

691
00:47:57,328 --> 00:47:58,659
Not quite.

692
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,730
So how much was based on experience?

693
00:48:00,831 --> 00:48:02,025
Why is that relevant?

694
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,067
Isn't that what you asked me?

695
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:08,099
I thought I said something like,
"Write from yourself. "

696
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:09,901
It's not like I'm working
from lecture notes here.

697
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:12,602
But the issue is
transposing experience, right?

698
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:16,374
You're the guy who had the experience and
so here's the transposition. What's the deal?

699
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,847
Okay, have you considered a legal career?

700
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,510
- I have considered writing legal novels.
- I bet.

701
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,012
Yes, I lived in a house with Diane.

702
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:26,022
So then you imagined your own seduction.

703
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,455
It's better than imagining your own death.

704
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,084
And it's not strictly fair
to equate me with Dick.

705
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:33,131
Oh, come on, Richard, Rick, Dick?

706
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:35,700
Dick was supposed to be
a nod to Philip K. Dick.

707
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:36,893
Right.

708
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:38,698
You know, you had to have known
that naming your hero

709
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,329
Dick is going to provoke
a double entendre or two.

710
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,407
Hmm?

711
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,203
Okay, so then,
without putting too fine a spin on it...

712
00:48:46,312 --> 00:48:47,870
- Yes?
- You write your experience.

713
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,642
Yes. Me or my unconscious.

714
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,446
Okay, so then this new thing
that you're working on.

715
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:56,487
<i>- Notes from a Couch.
- What experience is that from?</i>

716
00:48:57,758 --> 00:48:59,953
- From where I'm at now.
- Here?

717
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:07,795
My headspace.

718
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:08,959
Here?

719
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,774
- No, don't take me so literally.
- No?

720
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:27,788
Hi.

721
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:34,117
You have something for me?

722
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:41,961
I wonder if this house isn't
a bad environment, too.

723
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,799
What?

724
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:45,702
And I feel responsible.

725
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:47,998
Oh!

726
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,509
Are we reciting?

727
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,209
Life imitating art.

728
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,145
Isn't that a clich?

729
00:49:56,251 --> 00:49:58,685
Doesn't irony rescue us from clichs?

730
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:00,746
Hmm.

731
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,699
I'm not just imitating your book.

732
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,805
<i>The oracle was inviting me into her bed.</i>

733
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:24,645
<i>Sleeping with her would help the book,</i>

734
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:27,807
<i>but there was also the danger
it could ruin everything.</i>

735
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,450
We can still stop.

736
00:50:32,555 --> 00:50:34,352
<i>"I'll make it his choice,"</i>

737
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,391
<i>I imagined her thinking.</i>

738
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:52,306
Oh, Jack's back.

739
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:56,507
- Fuck.
- "Fuck"?

740
00:50:57,014 --> 00:50:58,379
Shh.

741
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,083
She's alone.

742
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,458
Why don't you want her to know we're here?

743
00:51:10,562 --> 00:51:12,530
She gets very competitive.

744
00:51:13,598 --> 00:51:16,192
- I see. Well...
- What are you doing?

745
00:51:16,902 --> 00:51:19,769
I'm sneaking out in a cowardly fashion.

746
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:22,102
You can't do that.

747
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,175
If she comes out of the bathroom,
sees you on the couch,

748
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:27,575
- she'll know you were here.
- I'll go out for a drink.

749
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,580
- I could come with you.
- Good idea.

750
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,486
Well, I guess you'll just have to stay here
until she falls asleep.

751
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:49,393
- Done.
- One more paragraph.

752
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:52,837
- You're slow.
- You're making me slow.

753
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:56,066
Done.

754
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:04,082
She's asleep.

755
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:17,090
It's time.

756
00:52:23,237 --> 00:52:25,068
I'll see you tomorrow.

757
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:30,938
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

758
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:09,382
Oh, my God.

759
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,994
No way.

760
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,570
Hey, I need to pee.
- Just a sec.

761
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:42,818
Hi.

762
00:54:24,863 --> 00:54:27,161
You don't have a monopoly on guilt.

763
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,631
Can guilt be the basis for a relationship?

764
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:32,761
Guilt's just the foreplay.

765
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,572
Recrimination and regret,
those take real commitment.

766
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:45,048
So does this count as a confession?

767
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:57,496
Hi.

768
00:54:58,097 --> 00:54:59,428
Coffee?

769
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:02,467
I'm sorry. I meant to make an extra cup.

770
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,834
So how are you?

771
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:13,769
Late for class.

772
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:17,339
Stayed up late.

773
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,079
- Yeah.
- Writing.

774
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:26,952
So, see you.

775
00:55:46,648 --> 00:55:49,617
<i>"Who fucked who? Who fucked whom?</i>

776
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:53,254
<i>"Why did I let you spend

777
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:54,344

<i>Fucked up can resonate.</i>

- Hey.
Hi.

791
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:50,305
- How did your story go over?
- Hmm.

792
00:56:50,414 --> 00:56:51,540
Fine.

793
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:54,743
I don't really care what they think,
they all have agendas anyway.

794
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:55,876
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

795
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:00,223
You want to hear it?

796
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,190
Don't I have an agenda?

797
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,420
Well, yeah, but you have talent.

798
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:06,223
- Okay.
- Okay.

799
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,297
All right.

800
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:14,399
- Wow.
- Wow, what?

801
00:57:14,506 --> 00:57:15,666
I just...

802
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:18,106
I feel so naked. Nervous.

803
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:21,246
It's a first draft, okay? So...

804
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:23,280
- Come on. Come on.
... be gentle.

805
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,280
All right, the title is...

806
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,546
So you really, really liked the story?

807
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,656
A single really's worth.

808
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:35,683
<i>Her story was well written.</i>

809
00:57:35,794 --> 00:57:37,193
<i>It was about sex.</i>

810
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:40,789
<i>Rather, it was about college students
who were interested in sex</i>

811
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,164
<i>and who acted upon that interest.</i>

812
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:47,672
<i>It was realistically detailed, it was credible,</i>

813
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,734
<i>it was sporadically poetic.</i>

814
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:55,809
<i>"'No, ' he said, 'There's nothing
wrong with a story that ends with a kiss. '</i>

815
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,111
"She held him at arm's length,

816
00:57:58,217 --> 00:58:00,185
"the Luxembourg Gardens, a green sward

817
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:03,449
"stretching languorously behind him,
and said, 'Yes.

818
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:09,189
"'A kiss is a kiss is a kiss. "'

819
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:12,766
You...

820
00:58:18,939 --> 00:58:22,340
- You don't have to play the part with me.
- What part?

821
00:58:22,443 --> 00:58:25,139
- "She asked innocently. "
- "With feigned innocence. "

822
00:58:25,245 --> 00:58:28,043
The part of a reckless, experienced woman.

823
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:35,823
Look, I know what I'm doing.

824
00:58:35,924 --> 00:58:38,518
- Do you?
- And you know what I'm doing,

825
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:41,328
so let's just do it.

826
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,867
Shouldn't you just do something
for its own sake?

827
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:55,465
Is there such a thing?

828
00:58:57,046 --> 00:59:00,072
No, I mean... No, I am.

829
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:02,446
I'm doing it for its own sake.

830
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,214
Sorry, I just...

831
00:59:12,561 --> 00:59:14,153
Are you quoting me?

832
00:59:15,297 --> 00:59:16,457
Maybe.

833
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:29,303
"He searched for a way to

834
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:31,540
"describe the act

835
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:34,811
"that didn't sound like secondhand porn. "

836
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,250
- It's fiction.
- Well, it doesn't have to be.

837
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,153
That sounds like cheap dialog.

838
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,419
Cheap can be a turn-on.

839
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:46,655
Just don't over-intellectualize
the aesthetic experience.

840
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:51,124
You know, we can do anything.

841
00:59:53,237 --> 00:59:55,899
- Yeah?
- You can tie me up

842
00:59:56,974 --> 00:59:58,965
or you can spank me.

843
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:03,308
I've got a really cute little whip,
or we can shoot a movie.

844
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:05,109
I have a camcorder.

845
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,975
So is this like you imagined it?

846
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:11,216
- You're presuming I imagined it.
- Oh, come on.

847
01:00:11,322 --> 01:00:13,654
Like you never thought about fucking me.

848
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:15,555
Not even once, right?

849
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:19,828
How did you imagine it?

850
01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:22,160
With me on top.

851
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,802
I know what you really want.

852
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:37,446
- Yeah?
- A mind fuck.

853
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:42,119
- No.
- Yeah.

854
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:45,450
You want to get inside my head.

855
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,458
You have a pretty healthy ego.

856
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,857
So do you.

857
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:52,857
Are you going to write about this?

858
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:56,700
- No.
- Never?

859
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:01,139
I don't know.

860
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:05,477
Well, I'm going to write about you.

861
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:08,642
Uh-oh.

862
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,546
- I scared you.
- No.

863
01:01:11,986 --> 01:01:16,923
Don't worry, I'm not going to call you
Richard, or Rick, or even Dick.

864
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:21,354
Nick? Mick?

865
01:01:21,462 --> 01:01:24,431
You want to pick it?
You want to pick the pseudonym?

866
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:26,932
That would make me a collaborator.

867
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,527
Wasn't this collaborating?

868
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,667
That's a fresh word for it.

869
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:36,140
<i>I was trying to remember
what she said, word for word.</i>

870
01:01:36,244 --> 01:01:40,374
<i>I was desperate for a pen and paper,
but that would break the mood.</i>

871
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:53,560
Hello.
- Fuck.

872
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:55,522
In here.

873
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:00,567
- Did you get milk?
No.

874
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,730
Well, then don't touch what's left.
There's just enough for my coffee.

875
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,966
Okay.

876
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:09,737
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

877
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:12,406
You know what I mean? I...

878
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:14,415
No.

879
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:18,613
Meaning is so subjective and evanescent,
so don't assume.

880
01:02:20,957 --> 01:02:24,358
But you said last night
that you wanted to keep it a secret.

881
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,485
Well, we obviously didn't.

882
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,432
Yeah, I mean, we've both slept with you.

883
01:02:30,534 --> 01:02:33,503
I don't understand what the big deal is.

884
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:36,164
And this is a basic male fantasy, right?

885
01:02:43,881 --> 01:02:46,281
Are you fucking with me right now?

886
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,445
Define "fucking. "

887
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:51,043
God, that word. It's so subjective.

888
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:54,180
You know, so charged, so evanescent.

889
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,520
I have a technical question, now.

890
01:02:55,627 --> 01:02:56,594
<i>About mnage  trois?</i>

891
01:02:56,694 --> 01:02:59,322
No, about dream sequences.

892
01:03:00,064 --> 01:03:05,001
Would you feel cheated
if you read a sexy, sexy sex scene

893
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:08,436
and then you found out afterwards
it was just a fantasy?

894
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:09,540
Hmm.

895
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:13,344
Not if it gave me an insight into character.

896
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:16,339
Not if it was hot.

897
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,019
Hello.

898
01:03:26,959 --> 01:03:28,187
In here.

899
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,392
That didn't take long.

900
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:36,729
I thought you had class.

901
01:03:36,835 --> 01:03:38,735
I thought you had scruples.

902
01:03:40,706 --> 01:03:43,300
Wait. Why am I acting jealous?

903
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:46,378
I don't know. Why are you acting jealous?

904
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:50,245
I'm not. How is that? I'm not.

905
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,749
How was class?

906
01:03:53,853 --> 01:03:56,014
Professor Freed read my story.

907
01:03:56,656 --> 01:03:59,557
You'd think she'd be more sophisticated
about a piece of fiction.

908
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:01,490
Yeah, you'd think, right?

909
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:11,731
<i>You really think
you could help me with my fiction?</i>

910
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:15,400
Oh, yeah.
You could write something very dark,

911
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,977
something outside the unexpected,

912
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,412
something that turns the ordinary world

913
01:04:21,515 --> 01:04:24,245
of a college girl upside down,

914
01:04:24,352 --> 01:04:28,015
<i>that eroticizes the mundane quotidien.</i>

915
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,848
You up for that?

916
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,260
As a piece of short or long fiction?

917
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:38,657
As an experience.

918
01:04:41,803 --> 01:04:45,295
- Yes, absolutely.
- Good. Good.

919
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:49,138
Can you be ruthlessly honest with yourself
about what you want?

920
01:04:49,244 --> 01:04:50,472
Can you?

921
01:04:51,546 --> 01:04:52,877
Absolutely.

922
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:00,919
Well?

923
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:05,551
- What do you mean?
- Christine, the forbidden is the forbidden.

924
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:09,363
You either cross the threshold or you don't.

925
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,148
Why here?

926
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:36,790
Because it stinks of the body,

927
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:39,590
because it transcends romantic illusion.

928
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:45,026
Read me your story.

929
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:47,330
- Here.
- Read it. Don't be shy.

930
01:05:57,382 --> 01:06:00,317
"One morning, Sarah Samso
awoke to find that she had been

931
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,852
"transformed into a giant cockroach. "

932
01:06:12,464 --> 01:06:14,694
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Sure.

933
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:16,591
Thanks.

934
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:19,801
What did you think?

935
01:06:19,904 --> 01:06:22,134
What did you expect me to think?

936
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:25,103
- I don't have any expectations.
- I think that you do.

937
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:28,510
I think you have
very finely calibrated expectations.

938
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,209
You said to write for myself.

939
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:36,720
Will you take all my advice to heart?

940
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:38,255
Try me.

941
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:40,052
- Don't.
- Don't what?

942
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:42,184
Take my advice.

943
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:43,886
Is that your advice?

944
01:06:43,996 --> 01:06:46,430
It's an antidote. It's an inoculation.

945
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:49,932
Everybody needs an antibody.

946
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:00,168
Diane.

947
01:07:03,183 --> 01:07:05,378
I didn't like Kristin's story.

948
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:10,348
Well, she's young,
she's still finding her voice.

949
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:14,052
- The content.
- You think I fucked her in a men's room?

950
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:16,187
It's fiction, Diane. It's fucking fiction.

951
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:18,356
Forget about the men's room. Did you?

952
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:20,491
It's none of your business.

953
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,330
You did.

954
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:24,597
Is that what you want to talk about?
Who fucked who?

955
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:25,763
Whom.

956
01:07:29,844 --> 01:07:33,280
It's been 10 years since we made
those kind of claims on each other.

957
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:35,315
- "Claims. "
- Pick your word.

958
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:40,051
You hurt me.

959
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,588
- You ended the relationship.
- The book.

960
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,184
That came well after.
And it's not you, it's a character.

961
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,594
- Based on me.
- Only in part.

962
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,031
But your attitude toward Diana, it hurt me
that that was what you thought of me.

963
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,035
It's what I thought of the character.

964
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,866
It's not so simple.

965
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,375
No, it's not.

966
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:07,245
Funny talking about that old book now.

967
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,512
It's because we couldn't then.

968
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,585
You know, it's...

969
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,291
It's ridiculous that you are with those girls

970
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,732
and not with me.

971
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:34,801
Hey.

972
01:08:42,653 --> 01:08:45,520
How did you know
my sister's name was Kelly?

973
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:49,025
You've been spying on us.

974
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,220
You broke into my computer and read
my e-mails and God knows what else.

975
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:54,923
- My ledger.
- You've been invasive.

976
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:57,057
You wrote about my ledger?

977
01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,967
I'm sorry.

978
01:09:01,373 --> 01:09:03,000
Are you?

979
01:09:03,108 --> 01:09:04,268
Sort of.

980
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,571
That's pretty noncommittal.

981
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,874
Committal in art, noncommittal in life.

982
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:13,280
Don't try to clever your way out of this,
okay? You used us.

983
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:15,751
I wrote about you. It's what I do.

984
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:20,916
I write about where I am,

985
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:23,256
or I should, because if I don't, it's shit.

986
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:24,794
Well, this is shit.

987
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,728
You can't just say, "It's what I do. "

988
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:29,392
Jasmine? You called me Jasmine?

989
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,595
Like I'm some kind of shampoo?

990
01:09:31,704 --> 01:09:33,638
Not you, your character.

991
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:42,237
Look, I should leave.

992
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:43,906
I'm leaving now.

993
01:09:49,922 --> 01:09:51,890
I just wish we could find a way to...

994
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:53,482
Just be friends?

995
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,587
I'd settle for you thinking
I'm not an asshole.

996
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,825
You or your character?

997
01:09:59,933 --> 01:10:01,901
Here's what I'd settle for.

998
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:09,399
See you try and talk
your way out of this one.

999
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:10,840
No, burn it.

1000
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,849
You're burning my character, too.

1001
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,645
Write your own character.

1002
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:21,779
Well, I can't do that from his point of view.

1003
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:26,356
Thank you.

1004
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,989
I'm sorry about the spying.

1005
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,595
I'll be leaving now.

1006
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,835
I think you guys are both great.

1007
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,165
This isn't how it reads.

1008
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:45,273
Well, sometimes I dwell too much
on the negative

1009
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:47,977
in my writing.

1010
01:10:49,318 --> 01:10:53,846
Oh, so this is where we all hug, right?
And then you lay on some big moral truth.

1011
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:04,589
Hey.

1012
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,661
This just rambles.

1013
01:11:10,774 --> 01:11:13,106
- It's only a beginning.
- Yeah, a bad beginning.

1014
01:11:13,209 --> 01:11:16,178
- There's no sexual tension.
- It's not about sexual tension.

1015
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:19,976
That's where you're wrong.
See, and this dialog, right here?

1016
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:23,075
A girl would never say that,
not in this context.

1017
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:26,121
Well, so cut the line. Just have her be quiet.

1018
01:11:26,222 --> 01:11:27,849
That's wrong, too.

1019
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,033
I have an idea.

1020
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:42,901
Tell me, I won't bite.

1021
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,139
The crazy idea is that you and me...

1022
01:11:50,414 --> 01:11:53,110
Do you want to write something together?

1023
01:11:54,585 --> 01:11:56,576
I thought you'd never ask.

1024
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:11,733
Of course.

1025
01:12:19,978 --> 01:12:22,811
<i>His words were my words and vice versa,</i>

1026
01:12:22,914 --> 01:12:25,974
<i>but there was no vice and no versa,</i>

1027
01:12:26,084 --> 01:12:28,518
<i>just the alternating verse of our voices.</i>

1028
01:12:32,992 --> 01:12:37,258
<i>The manuscript I found secreted
with a stash was about a bratty girl,</i>

1029
01:12:37,363 --> 01:12:42,096
<i>whose only redeeming qualities were
a flair for flamenco guitar and fellatio.</i>

1030
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:47,099
<i>It was sickening and sobering to realize
that this was what he thought of me.</i>

1031
01:13:01,755 --> 01:13:04,724
<i>If you burn words, are they gone?</i>

1032
01:13:06,226 --> 01:13:09,059
<i>Or do they linger behind the eyelids
like scar tissue?</i>

1033
01:13:12,366 --> 01:13:14,596
What about the age difference?

1034
01:13:15,302 --> 01:13:16,633
Irrelevant.

1035
01:13:17,337 --> 01:13:19,635
It's a stupid reason not to.

1036
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,208
And I'd love you both?

1037
01:13:23,444 --> 01:13:26,345
That's easy. We'd just alternate nights.

1038
01:13:26,447 --> 01:13:28,847
A threesome would never last.

1039
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,113
But think of all the fun we'd have failing.

1040
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:36,350
<i>I had my mnage  trois fantasy already.
This is repetitive.</i>

1041
01:13:36,457 --> 01:13:38,652
<i>The mnage  trois or the fantasy?</i>

1042
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:45,199
I just can't imagine it.

1043
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:47,261
<i>Instead,</i>

1044
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:51,330
<i>I can imagine myself gone.</i>

1045
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,043
<i>The question is, how do I imagine them?</i>

1046
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,384
<i>Writing? Writing about me?</i>

1047
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:10,620
<i>Which raises the question of me
writing about them, writing about me.</i>

1048
01:14:13,964 --> 01:14:16,797
<i>The one future you pick excludes the others,</i>

1049
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:22,463
<i>except in fiction or...</i>

1050
01:15:28,206 --> 01:15:29,798
What time is it?

1051
01:15:30,909 --> 01:15:32,001
Late.

1052
01:15:35,415 --> 01:15:36,780
Got a title.

1053
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,085
<i>Crashing on the Couch.</i>

1054
01:15:41,154 --> 01:15:42,451
Hmm.

1055
01:15:44,357 --> 01:15:45,847
Drop the couch.
