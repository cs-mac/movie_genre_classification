1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,760
- What is it boy? - It is a packet, granny!

2
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,840
- Who kept this here? - I don't know!

3
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,160
- What is it? - Feac...

4
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
Keep quiet!

5
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,640
Do we have brazen people in our place to do this?

6
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,720
When I went to supply milk at Lonappan's place this morning...

7
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,680
I saw Bakery Mathai ducking here...

8
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,320
- Could it be him? - Not likely!

9
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,040
Ma'am, praise the Lord!

10
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
What is that golden covered packet?

11
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Feaces!

12
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,640
Is it pork meat? Make pickled pig's knuckles!

13
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
It would be splendid!

14
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Ma'am!

15
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,040
Can't you figure out what it is?

16
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,200
Feaces!

17
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,840
When did Mathai pack this and left it there!

18
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,280
He even asked ma'am if it is pork meat?

19
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
He told her to make pig knuckles and consume it!

20
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,400
I would make him eat it!

21
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,840
Get me two teak leaves!

22
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,480
- What is it Chachappa? - Few fishes Thangamma!

23
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,200
It is moray eel!

24
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,400
Would be great for fish gravy!

25
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Is it a backwater catch?

26
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,440
No, it is baited from the toilet!

27
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,840
Thresy! Is the stove hot?

28
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,400
It is moray eel! if we don't heat it up...

29
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,120
...it would become difficult to peel them!

30
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,720
From where did you get moray eel?

31
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Chachappan brought it

32
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,720
You prepare for the gravy!

33
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
My God!

34
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Mathai! Salvage our family esteem!

35
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
Chachappa!

36
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
What happened?

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Sir! This beggar hurled faeces in my house!

38
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,280
Sir! This fellow gave faeces to my mom saying it is moray eel!

39

'Police Station'

40
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,400
Stop it!

41
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Don't come to my station with such faecal cases!

42
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
Have you both heard it guys?

43
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,680
'This is also a story of this town!'

44
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,840
'But this is not the story of this town!'

When I started for the church did I not wake you up?

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Did you sleep again?

Tomorrow your brother is playing the band!

166
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
- Are you coming mom? - Go woman!

167
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,680
Bye!

168
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,360
Saint! For the first time...

169
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,200
I am going to play before a gathering!

170
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
In case I tremble, stay along with me!

171
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,560
Solomon! Is this the attire for an helper of the church?

172
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,800
Pope told me to join the band today!

173
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,800
An helper's job in church is not playing the clarinet!

174
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,920
Those who did not take part in new year prayer...

175
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
...need not play in church band!

176
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
Please don't talk like that, Father!

177
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,640
I informed everyone that I would play the band tomorrow!

178
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,760
Don't look at him!

179
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,120
Gee Varghese band expenses are not borne by the pope

180
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
It is borne by the church!

181
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,280
Church may bear the band expenses!

182
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
But it is me who decide who should play in the band!

183
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,400
I am a vicar in this parish for the last 15 years!

184
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,440
All these years the church band has lost everywhere!

185
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,040
I believe Thomas's contention is do not accept anything...

186
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,600
...until seen by your own eyes!

187
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,720
Why are you creating an issue Father?

188
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,440
Is it because we asked him to play?

189
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,480
More than this guy he has all the credentials...

190
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,280
...to play for the church band

191
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,160
He is the son of Esthappan master!

192
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,320
A person is not selected for band...

193
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
...based on his dad's name and his lineage!

194
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,080
Have you heard him play?

195
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,160
You may play now!

196
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,440
Let me hear you!

197
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,800
No sound is coming from this!

198
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Has someone packed cloth inside?

199
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,480
Father...!

200
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,920
Come on play man!

201
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,040
When you suddenly asked me to play...

202
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,760
Are you going to play in toilets?

203
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
Come on play, man!

204
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,240
Play man!

205
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
First learn to ring the bell and make frankincense

206
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
Try to become a sacristan!

207
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,640
Remove the shirt and give it to the pope!

208
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,000
Must be at the church at 5 AM...

209
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,360
...and ring the bell for the first mass!

210
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,840
Leelamma! Keep this at the Kitchen!

211
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
Kamalahasan engineer bought this!

212
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,000
On the other bank today it is Davi's band!

213
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,760
It is impressive

214
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,760
Leelamma!

215
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,200
Is it grilled breast or duck roast?

216
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,560
Leelamma, you didn't answer me!

217
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,840
Engineer sir! What is that you want?

218
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,360
You take it home I will answer him!

219
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
Kamalahassan Engineer!

220
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
This is not meant for today!

221
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,400
For tonight all creatures living in water and land...

222
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,880
...are cooked and the curries are swanked on table!

223
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,400
The only one left out is the cow in the cowshed!

224
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,080
Shall I cut the cow's udder and make pickles for you?

225
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,320
- What are you talking? - How else can I answer him?

226
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Engineer sir! He was just joking!

227
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,880
Come on sir Climb up sir!

228
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,360
I thought...

229
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,480
Matha!

230
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,240
That guy Solomon who is after this girl...

231
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,200
...stitched shirts for band and went upstairs

232
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,480
Will the Father allow him?

233
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,320
Instantly he drove him out

234
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,760
Dad! Don't talk ill of Solomon!

235
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,200
I would splash chilli water on your face!

236
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,520
Who is Solomon for you?

237
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Shall I serve you a cutlet?

238
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,600
Did you not hear me?

239
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
Who is Solomon for you?

240
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,320
I am going to marry him He is my groom

241
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,800
What have you done Mathacha?

242
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,080
Coddle her! You pampered her and now...

243
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,560
Wash the face!

244
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,360
- Mom! - Stay there!

245
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,000
Are you going to kill her?

246
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,320
Mom! I was...

247
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,400
- Mathacha! She has fainted! - I will be back now!

248
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,360
Binamma!

249
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,880
Serve little buffalo meat!

250
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,480
My god! Mom...

251
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Binamma! Get some water soon!

252
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
Coming!

253
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,880
My God! What happened to you?

254
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,800
Binamma, get some water

255
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,160
- I just enacted a scene! - Water!

256
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,080
I just tested if my son still has affection for me!

257
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
This is queer!

258
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
What are you looking at?

259
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,640
Get me two pieces of duck meat and one appam!

260
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,280
- This is excessive! - Are you a big...

261
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me go to bed!

262
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,520
Granny!

263
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
When I mentioned your name...

264
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
...yesterday my uncle was about to kill me

265
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,600
I don't think I can hold out any longer!

266
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,520
You are bothered about your problems only

267
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,760
I yearn to play in the band!

268
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,720
When Father asked me to play...

269
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
...I trembled

270
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
He drove me out

271
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,240
The other guy is now wearing the shirt stitched for me!

272
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
If you couldn't play there then you are unsuitable!

273
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,440
You play standing beneath my window

274
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Why are you not able to play before a gathering?

275
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,240
You know everything! Yet should you say this?

276
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,080
When I hold the clarinet before a gathering...

277
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,040
...I get to see my dad drowning!

278
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,080
That makes my throat dry! I would tremble!

279
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,560
Are you not ashamed to say you are Esthappan master's son!

280
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,600
It will be better for you to discard this and seek some other job

281
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,400
I wanted to become a Father in church!

282
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,400
- You only prevented me - Because I loved you...

283
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,720
But if you continue to behave like a child...

284
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,080
...one day I would leave you!

285
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,760
They are celebrating their victory!

286
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,680
You don't waste time standing here!

287
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,120
Clean your clarinet and put it on the attic

288
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,240
This is appam Give it to your mom!

289
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,120
How great was this band?

290
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,280
Now every year we are losing It has become a routine!

291
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,480
Gulp it!

292
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,160
Can you get me pork meat?

293
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I would whack your throat

294
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,520
You have already devoured 2 Kgs of pork meat

295
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,040
Slug! Has lost the competition!

296
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,040
Jesus! He is crestfallen!

297
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,440
He is not playing the clarinet! He is weeping through the instrument!

298
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,440
Take the boat to the toddy shop! Today we must batter them!

299
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,520
My Lord! Thommeri Davis and his group are coming here!

300
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't know what is going to happen today!

301
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
Guys! They are coming here!

302
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,680
"Granny's children! You are a pain in the neck!"

303
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,600
"Will you not go?"

304
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,680
"Don't play an endless game This is a queer lancet!"

305
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,000
"We don't want to win or lose! We are incompetent!"

306
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
"Times have changed! Appearances also have changed!"

307
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,120
"It is all seamed! It is a raucous rooster call!"

308
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,560
"Losers became obdurate!"

309
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,800
"Why did your nose tip turn red?"

310
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
"Why is your gaze embarrassed?"

311
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,880
"Why your words are incisive?"

312
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
"Why is your gaze embarrassed?"

313
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,040
"Why your words are incisive?"

314
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
"Am I your kith and kin to clap?"

315
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,960
"Are you a rogue because you consume Therutha's toddy!"

316
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,200
"Who am I to you! Am I a brother or a bother to you!"

317
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
"Don't you want to be well disposed with your neighbour!"

318
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,640
"Did you not run away without turning your back?"

319
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,400
"But now are you not panting?"

320
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,520
"After drinking toddy you can't even stand erect!"

321
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,640
"Come straight to me!"

322
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,080
"Lying down and staying at home You were shamed!"

323
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,280
"To win or lose, you could not bid on us!"

324
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,080
"Times have changed! Appearances also have changed!"

325
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,080
"It is all seamed! It is a raucous rooster call!"

326
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,400
"Was it not Mariamma on the dais?"

327
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,440
"While she strip teased her hubby would sit in front yard!"

328
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,840
"Look at the sun alas! It appears like moon!"

329
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,360
"It is a rhythmic beat!"

330
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,760
"Scamp, come on perform! How dare you abuse my dad!"

331
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,040
"You can't even uphold your esteem and repute!"

332
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,120
"You scoffed others! Have you got anything to say now!"

333
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,240
"When you strike back and forth to wash dhoti..."

334
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
"...the dhoti went past Bums did not notice this!"

335
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
"While stupes and dullards were watching two bums..."

336
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,520
"...they were busy making a mallet for a game!"

337
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,880
"They were busy making a mallet for a game!"

338
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,080
- Come here guys! - Stop it!

339
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,600
Dogs! Defeat us in slugfest, if you can!

340
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,440
Anybody can combat anyone

341
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
If you mean slugfest, come to our place!

342
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,320
We too have men at our place!

343
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,800
If we want to bash you...

344
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,080
...we would come to your house

345
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Do you want to see that?

346
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
Then bash me!

347
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,560
You should have shown this spirit while playing the band!

348
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
Move away!

349
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,720
Your dad Kochu Lonappan taught me to play clarinet!

350
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
Do you know what he told me...

351
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,040
...when he gave me the clarinet for the first time?

352
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,160
God blew soil and made man...

353
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,840
...and gave music to give life to man

354
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,000
Every time we breath we are giving life to this clarinet

355
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,040
There is neither defeat nor victory for a genuine musician

356
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,760
Only music dwells!

357
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,840
Do you mean to belittle our musicians!

358
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,640
If you have any self esteem, compete and defeat them

359
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
Then deliver your discourse!

360
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,880
Even if the Gee Varghese Band toils for 50 years...

361
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,040
...this trophy in the name of the Lord

362
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,320
...would stay before the garlanded photo of my dad Kochu Lonappan

363
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
This is a challenge thrown by Thommeri Davis!

364
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Come Mariamma!

365
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
Don't blabber because you won this time!

366
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,680
Come on guys!

367
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,480
We will show our mettle in the next year's competition!

368
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,960
Year long toils for teaching a band like this...

369
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
...and later dumping in the attic is futile

370
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,840
It would be better to fart in the backwaters rather than doing this

371
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,440
At least two bubbles would surface and blast with a sound

372
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,240
Trumpet, Clarinet and yosr attires keep everything on the attic!

373
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,480
Unless I tell you no one should touch it!

374
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Go to the other side of the bank

375
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,680
If you come this side again...

376
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
...we would drop you guys in the backwaters!

377
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,080
- That is not required! - Not like that!

378
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,400
Father! When our band was victorious...

379
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,320
Louis Pope and Esthappan master were in the forefront!

380
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,840
When the boat capsized with Mathoon and 4 other people...

381
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,600
...my son in law and Molamma were also dead

382
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,480
Along with them our band was also drowned!

383
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,640
That can't be viewed as insignificant!

384
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,640
Stop it!

385
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,360
We are hearing this story for years!

386
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,920
When there is a difference of opinion on the church band...

387
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,640
...let us put to vote to decide if we should continue the band or not?

388
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,640
Before that let this guy give a reply, Father!

389
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,080
Let him respond!

390
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,880
He is silent when the church committee is questioning

391
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Under the circumstances please don't think I am also raising an issue

392
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
We need an answer!

393
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,120
There was a time when the Gee Varghese band was a big-name

394
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,160
Those days band earned money for the church!

395
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,120
Those days even if a key is defective in clarinet...

396
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,840
...a new clarinet would be given

397
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,920
If someone can not play it right he would be replaced by a new person

398
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,760
Those golden days of the church band...

399
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,080
...are now enjoyed by the Martha Mariam band on the other side of the banks

400
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,920
Have anyone of you bothered to ask...

401
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
...how church band members make a livelihood?

402
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,800
Our band members fair Thoma and kochu Agusti...

403
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,000
...sold their houses and crossed the waters to join their band

404
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
They did so out of poverty

405
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
For the last few years the Gee Varghese band...

406
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,160
...is defeated by the church and no one else

407
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,560
I don't have any further elaboration on this!

408
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,160
Those present here want to dissolve the band

409
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,320
Please inform this in the Sunday Prayer mass, Father!

410
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,280
If the members of the parish also have the same opinion...

411
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
I have nothing more to say

412
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,160
Come on guys!

413
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,080
Go!

414
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,880
What is this pope!

415
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,120
You have not completed it this time also Half way through, is it not?

416
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,280
After the Edathuva Church festival we were all returning in a boat

417
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,480
All those who accompanied were sleeping!

418
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,040
It was a bright full moon day!

419
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Suddenly Esthappan took his clarinet...

420
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,640
...and started playing a tune unheard until then!

421
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,440
In an excitement, I also joined him!

422
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,360
All those who were sleeping got up!

423
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,200
In that bright moonlit night...

424
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,320
...amidst few of us, I felt it was Saint sitting there right in the middle

425
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,760
In our experience none of us have ever played such a tune...

426
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,040
After birth and death you swim across to another point

427
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,520
It was such a bliss!

428
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Esthappan used to tell me always...

429
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,880
...at a convenient time we should reach the ultimate

430
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
But it did not happen

431
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,400
It could not be completed by both of us!

432
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Couldn't complete it

433
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,960
In life everything breaks halfway through!

434
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,640
Esthappan and Molamma are no more with us

435
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Itteri, Kochu Thomma, Antappan All of them have gone!

436
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,240
Now our band will also go!

437
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,080
I have witnessed it

438
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,320
After winning the trophies from Edathuva, Chambakulam and Cherukara...

439
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,080
...you and Esthappan would reach the shores of our place in boat

440
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,160
Who recalls all those days?

441
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,520
Relax yourself pope!

442
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,840
To set right all these...

443
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,560
Saint will send someone This is my surmise!

444
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,560
This boat does not follow the safety regulations stipulated by the government

445
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,800
For all those travelling in this boat...

446
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,920
...there is only one life jacket and that is worn by me

447
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,960
If passengers sit quiet this boat will reach shore!

448
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,560
Quite for some time I wanted to sit with you people

449
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,440
Dead people are better than those living!

450
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,480
Cheers!

451
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,480
What is this? Come on have a drink!

452
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
'ITTOOP LOTTERY PAWN BROKERS'

453
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,080
Ittoop brother! Boat has come I am making a move

454
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,320
I said I am making a move!

455
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,720
Brother! Mom fainted!

456
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
Get her tablets! Get money from Ittoop's shop

457
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,640
I am going for collections!

458
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,720
You may go I will get her tablets!

459
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,120
Seems you would wait for the boat to return from the banks

460
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,920
You go home! Mom is alone

461
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
Don't order me Clara, I will go!

462
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,160
Are you trying to stare me down?

463
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,000
If you misbehave with me, with the umbrella I would throw you in the lake!

464
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Let me see that!

465
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,640
Clara! You may go The boat has arrived!

466
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,600
- Yabber! - Go prattler!

467
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Have this cashew!

468
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,680
Is he Saint Gee Varghese!

469
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,080
He has a lance with him What he needs is a horse!

470
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,400
Give me a lime soda!

471
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,480
Brother! The church...

472
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,880
Are you not the son of Puthukudi Thomas sir!

473
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,240
From America and then Bombay

474
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,800
How did you guess?

475
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,240
You are a replica of Thoma sir! Can't I recogonize?

476
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,240
Where are your things?

477
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,000
It would come in the boat later Now I have come!

478
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,960
Come on Ride as my pillion!

479
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
I want to go to the church!

480
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Will people coming to Kumarangiri go home without seeing the Saint?

481
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,680
Get on to the bike

482
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,160
I am also going to the church!

483
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,160
This bike belongs to the church!

484
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,560
I am the sacristan, Ouseph!

485
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,760
Are you the sacristan! Then let us go!

486
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
Brother!

487
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,840
Sacristan! Give this to the senior Father!

488
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,960
Tell him Chachappan gave this!

489
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,640
- What is the matter! - I want to stop drinking!

490
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,800
Inform Father to pray for me at a convenient time!

491
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,320
There is no urgency! He can take his own time!

492
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,080
I will give him!

493
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,000
'But this fish will not reach church'

494
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,200
'It will reach the kitchen at sacristan's house!'

495
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,240
'From there it will travel to sacristan's intestine!'

496
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,680
'Amen!'

497
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,160
Hold this son!

498
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,520
Is he using the oil meant for rockets in his bike?

499
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,920
Now you must buy some lands in Kumarangiri

500
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,560
Marry a beautiful girl and settle here

501
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,760
I would arrange for everything!

502
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,320
What do you say?

503
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,640
There are lot of beautiful girls in Kumarangiri

504
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,040
Shall I bring marriage proposals?

505
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,920
Is priests in our parish allowed to marry?

506
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,360
Why do you ask this?

507
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,360
I am the new junior vicar for this church!

508
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,920
Father Vincent Vattoli!

509
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,960
Fish!

510
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,760
Father! Praise the Lord!

511
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,440
All the time Praise the Lord!

512
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,560
I am the new junior vicar - Vincent Vattoli

513
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,080
I am telling the truth!

514
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,960
I have come to take charge!

515
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,640
I am Father Irunnalamkuzhi Joseph Irunnalamkuzhi!

516
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,200
Attuva parish vicar is my cousin Father idannalamkulam!

517
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,040
But there was no information about your arrival!

518
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,640
I had to come suddenly!

519
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,400
Where did you stitch this robe?

520
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,880
This is not stitched It is ready made apparel!

521
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,160
Pants and shirt!

522
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,520
- What? - Pants and shirt

523
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,920
Seems you didn't have time to wear the priest's robe!

524
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,160
No Father! Priest robe can be worn while doing religious duties!

525
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,880
I am used to wearing these!

526
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,000
I am comfortable in these attire at normal times!

527
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,640
- What? - Comfortable!

528
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,120
Besides, does our parish stipulate wearing robes all the time?

529
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,120
You must be weary after the travel Have some fruits!

530
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,440
- Come on! - No thanks!

531
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,160
Then it is ok

532
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,160
A priest is a replica of Jesus This is what I have learnt!

533
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,680
A replica of Jesus wearing pants and shirts is little excessive

534
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,680
Is it not Vattoli?

535
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,960
When I am a vicar of this parish I don't want any outside influences!

536
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,440
Glasses and shoes Glasses and shoes!

537
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,880
Even otherwise there are few revolutionaries in this parish!

538
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,160
This parish can not bear the brunt of having another revolutionary Father!

539
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,560
So if you want to continue as a junior vicar of this church

540
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,680
Change these attire and wear the priest's robe!

541
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
Yes Father!

542
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,000
Is it permissible to have two extra pockets in the robe?

543
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
I guess it is not permitted Okay

544
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,840
Tomorrow morning will be Vattoli's first mass!

545
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
Let me see how smart he is!

546
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,000
My god!

547
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,560
No problem! You can wear it!

548
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,360
Seems the church band lost this year also!

549
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,280
- Yes, we lost Father! - What happened?

550
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,200
That is a big story!

551
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,840
Seems neighbouring parish got the trophy this time also!

552
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,480
Right?

553
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,120
It was all planned! They have lots of money!

554
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,560
Thommeri Davis and his wife Mariamma

555
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,080
Both of them have lots of money

556
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,960
- Does Davis play? - Never!

557
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,600
His dad Kochu Lonappan used to play!

558
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
These people will make others play their band...

559
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,320
...win the trophy and steal the limelight Both of them

560
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,240
That lady is flashy!

561
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,680
She would wear a shirt, dhoti and a dark glass!

562
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,440
Is it?

563
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,960
Solomon, attend the call

564
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,400
Father! I am scared to attend calls!

565
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,800
There are just 2 phones in this town!

566
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,560
One in contractor's house and another one in church!

567
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,440
Your brother has assumed charge in a church!

568
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,840
Can't you visit me?

569
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,360
His aunt in Kayankulam slipped in bathroom!

570
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,320
We had been there and just returned!

571
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,080
Give it to me! Give

572
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,920
The jack fruit stain will go on the phone!

573
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,800
Dear Brother in law!

574
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,000
Big brother in law!

575
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,560
Dear brother in law!

576
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,080
Big brother in law!

577
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,280
What is the news! Did you not go home?

578
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,760
I had to come here earlier for some wok

579
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,000
Any way, if you call from the other banks...

580
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,440
...me and your sister would reach there!

581
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,520
Did you meet Ottapla Father?

582
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,360
Yes I met him, taunted and then only came here!

583
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,320
Your younger brother is taunting Ottapla Father!

584
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,080
Have you started your pranks!

585
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,840
If I come to know any of your mischieves there...

586
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,680
I would immediately come there in a boat!

587
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,760
Ok

588
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,080
Is it your sister, Father?

589
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,440
We have only one sister, Mariamma!

590
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,800
- You know her - Is it?

591
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,200
She is married to Thommeri Davis of the other bank!

592
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,040
I take leave Father! It is time to ring the bell!

593
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,360
Solomon, wait!

594
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,040
You complained about my sister and brother in law

595
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,680
How can you leave just like that!

596
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,200
I don't know anything

597
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,600
Vincent Vattoli from Changanaserry...

598
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,760
Why should he choose Kumarangiri parish to become a junior vicar?

599
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,840
Do you know Solomon?

600
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,400
I don't know Father!

601
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,480
Will the church band survive tomorrow's voting?

602
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,520
What do you think Solomon?

603
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,440
I don't know about that too, Father!

604
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,280
But I have understood one thing!

605
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,280
It is a concerted planned move!

606
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,720
Gee Varghese band does not belong to the church alone!

607
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,720
It belongs to this town and also to the Lord in this church!

608
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,400
I don't want anything to happen to the band!

609
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,600
Before we decide to continue or not the Saint Gee Varghese band...

610
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,440
...our church's new priest Father Vincent Vattoli

611
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,600
...would address you briefly!

612
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,960
I saw this place for the first time on a new year day long ago!

613
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,560
I was a young child then!

614
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,680
I was like the little son sitting in front!

615
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,880
- What is your name son? - Joy mon!

616
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,760
I was like Joy mon!

617
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,760
That day my dad said something to his brother!

618
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,280
That is still ringing in my ears!

619
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,160
In Kumarangiri, one can't find a person...

620
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,000
...who has not hummed a song or who has not fallen in love at least once

621
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,680
When I stepped in to this place...

622
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,280
...my dad and uncle took me first to this church!

623
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,560
Through the big gathering...

624
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,600
...what struck me first was a priceless thing!

625
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,800
People who came out of the church touched and caressed that!

626
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,320
It is still vivid in my memory!

627
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,800
After many years I have returned to this place as a priest!

628
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,880
When I entered the Saint's church again...

629
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,080
...my eyes were looking for that invaluable thing!

630
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,000
It is there It is still here!

631
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,960
When I returned on that day in boat with dad and uncle...

632
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,800
...along with ice stick and toys I took along one more thing

633
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,920
The music of this town!

634
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,960
The music of this place made Kumarangiri renowned!

635
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,440
That music was shared to everyone who lived here...

636
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,600
...by the saint Gee Varghese band!

637
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,720
That band is now like this neglected piano...

638
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,480
...full of dust and is getting ready to receive its last rites!

639
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,200
Esthappan master, Itteri, Kochu Thommy, Antappan

640
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,240
What was drowned in the lake was merely their bodies!

641
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,000
You have forgotten all of them After having lost all near and dear...

642
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
...Pope Louis is, still living for the sake of music!

643
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,920
If you don't want him...

644
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,240
...you would be losing the soul of Kumarangiri

645
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,280
...and also Kumarangiri's music

646
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,000
Let that music bring back excitement and integration of this town

647
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,200
Should we not submit the ever rolling trophy...

648
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,960
...at the feet of the saint again?

649
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,320
What do you say Lonappan brother?

650
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,880
Don't you want Ittoop brother?

651
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,680
- What about you Joy mon? - I want

652
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,920
Should we dissolve the church band?

653
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,440
No No

654
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,960
No

655
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,640
Father! You could have contested the election!

656
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,080
I have contested and won too!

657
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,480
"The entire village looked in overwhelming surprise!"

658
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,400
"From where did this divine messenger come?"

659
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,960
"You caress while weaving a tender leaf garland!"

660
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,240
"You have changed the feeble wind! Is it a fortune for this town?"

661
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,080
"Your flair is throbbing and shining outwardly!"

662
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,800
"Welcome you Welcome you!"

663
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,640
"You are a pulsating fortitude!"

664
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,400
"Vattoli father's gait is graceful and rhythmic"

665
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,320
"It's a rhythmic sway to left and right!"

666
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,280
"Have you not noticed his captivating smile!"

667
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,000
"How elegant he is! It is a treat to watch!"

668
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,560
"We are endowed with this gift today!"

669
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,960
"Vattoli!"

670
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,600
"His words are coated with honey! His looks are serene!"

671
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,720
"You are a fortune to this town!"

672
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
"Vattoli"

673
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,160
"The gentle breeze from south is nippy!"

674
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,200
"To get over the chill you fell in campfire and wine!"

675
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,080
"The gentle breeze from south is nippy!"

676
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:17,280
"To get over the chill you fell in campfire and wine!"

677
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,160
"Sunshine of Kumaram!"

678
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,080
"Good people vowed for betterment..."

679
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,200
"...you sprouted like a golden ray from a mango seed!"

680
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,760
"You are like Kuravilangadu saviour! Country's first sailor captain!"

681
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,760
"It is cherubic! The song and rhythm!"

682
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,480
"Like an harvest let us celebrate!"

683
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,000
"Vattoli!"

684
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,160
"Vattoli!"

685
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,560
"Vattoli!"

686
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,160
"Vattoli!"

687
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,800
He is wearing pants and sun glasses!

688
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,280
Is he a Father?

689
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,240
Saint has sent us Vattoli Father!

690
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,440
- Sufficient for one load - My god!

691
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,000
Say so You are an artist!

692
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,120
Yesterday I thought why should a Father coming from eastern hill side...

693
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,160
...argue for Gee Varghese band?

694
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,600
That is why I said only those who drink toddy...

695
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,200
...will know the taste of the carp fish!

696
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,200
Is it not?

697
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,200
Come in!

698
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,440
Have you seen her Father?

699
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,600
She is from France Michelle

700
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,480
All those who came with her have returned!

701
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,160
She wants to learn our music and stayed back!

702
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,720
Her parents are not in agreement with her

703
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,920
She is a smart girl!

704
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,720
Child! This is Father Vincent!

705
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,920
He is our church's new junior vicar!

706
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,480
Pappan! Shouldn't Solomon practice playing!

707
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,160
Let him first learn to hold it properly Father!

708
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,080
Is it not Charlie?

709
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,360
When one plays it should not be merely blowing out air!

710
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,240
Music should also come!

711
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,360
You are a Father in the Church!

712
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,920
Yes

713
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,280
But the other day you danced with me in the boat!

714
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,640
I understand English!

715
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,560
But I like to talk in Malayalam!

716
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,720
I can understand Malayalam!

717
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,040
What is wrong in both of us dancing together?

718
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,320
People and your culture...

719
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,960
...would miscon-

720
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,800
Will not misconstrue

721
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,040
People with good intentions never misconstrue!

722
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,360
They will look at us as two human beings!

723
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,280
It is like a cinema scene!

724
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,360
You dog! Go

725
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,360
Stop there!

726
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,440
You need not bathe at home sacristan!

727
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,040
I did not insist on selling the house...

728
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,880
...because I don't want you and kids to be left in lurch!

729
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,960
I have made some computations

730
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,760
I will take a decision shortly about that!

731
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,640
Then you decide quickly and inform us

732
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,240
Should we also not know about it?

733
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,240
- You... - Don't do it dad!

734
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,080
Hope you know...

735
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,800
If I consider the interest and compound interest Esthappan owe...

736
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,480
...even if the house is sold you may have to pay me

737
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,000
Went there to help them!

738
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,680
Come fast! I left the dinner half way

739
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,080
'The food left over by sacristan...'

740
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:13,240
'...would have been by now consumed by his pet dog Chakki!'

741
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,720
'The deal for Chakki will follow'

742
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,920
Stay there!

743
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:42,400
'That night 7 1/2 year old chakki died due to sacristan's fatal blows!'

744
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,720
Is there anything tastier than this?

745
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,760
Couldn't you get some fish?

746
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,960
Is anything stuffed in your throat?

747
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,880
No point in opening your mouth when you come for food!

748
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,280
Do you know what is happening here?

749
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,200
How will you know?

750
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,240
All the time you roam around carrying the clarinet!

751
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
My dad's name is Esthappan!

752
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,760
I will roam with the clarinet!

753
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,360
I care a damn if others feel bad about it!

754
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,840
For one week I have been telling you to change the bulb!

755
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,800
Today mom went there and fell down

756
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,680
Until now she was screaming! She has just gone to bed!

757
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,080
When can I see you thriving?

758
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,920
I will die only after seeing you well off

759
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,400
I don't know mom!

760
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,760
Don't cry dear

761
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,000
Clara!

762
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,080
- Is Solomon not there? - He is inside!

763
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,880
What is it?

764
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,360
He has been asked to go to the church!

765
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,080
Junior Vicar has a session!

766
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,280
Is it?

767
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,040
Yes, bro

768
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,600
I have just come from church!

769
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,640
You may leave! I will go

770
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,760
Give me some water, Clara!

771
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,040
No

772
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,880
I asked because of thirst!

773
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,800
Does this hen lay eggs?

774
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,480
No, it lays orange Shall I get some?

775
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,200
Give that vessel I have other works to do

776
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,360
Wait for a moment!

777
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,200
I saw you keeping the paper there!

778
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,920
Seems you took great troubles!

779
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,800
If you drink water like this you will find time only to urinate!

780
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,200
Have you not gone yet?

781
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,160
Get into the boat! I am coming!

782
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,480
Has Nancy come for delivery?

783
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,440
Yes

784
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,520
Go hen!

785
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,760
In whose house is the session?

786
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,600
Looks like at the contractors house!

787
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,520
My God!

788
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,520
- Sebi! - Brother!

789
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,920
Father! Should I accompany?

790
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,760
If I come, they may not like it!

791
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,840
You keep quiet!

792
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,840
We don't go for sitting on such criteria

793
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,200
Philipose!

794
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,320
What is it in the sac?

795
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,000
It is hen's dung, manure for plantains

796
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,640
Take care not to soil your foot!

797
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,640
It has a good smell!

798
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,600
What is this Father?

799
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,040
Will it be possible to hang on the comb of a rooster?

800
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,920
Because your family is big your parents would have...

801
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,440
...vowed to make one of them a Father, is it so?

802
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,320
Father Ottaplakal only does sacraments at our house!

803
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,840
The Senior Vicar considers them as insignificant!

804
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,720
Let it happen The saint will forgive!

805
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,160
Where are you going?

806
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,120
I am going for a blessing!

807
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,040
Will you not come for the band practice in the evening?

808
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,640
Seems you are close with the lady!

809
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,840
Poor girl! She is very religious!

810
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,200
Will blessing the house make it alright?

811
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,920
Do one thing!

812
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I will give you the holy book and holy water!

813
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,960
You may do it and return them at your convenience to the church!

814
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,560
You sit quiet, but give knockout punches!

815
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,640
Keep quiet you dog!

816
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,520
I would jab at your vital spots!

817
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,600
Don't take it seriously It is somniloquy

818
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,760
He is not drunk!

819
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,200
Lord! Let this holy water provide protection...

820
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,120
...from evil spirits and all that is unholy

821
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,240
Amen!

822
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,360
Blessing is over

823
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,200
Someone from the house read the bible!

824
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,360
Child!

825
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,600
Psalms of Solomon!

826
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,880
The sacred poems from 1 to 10

827
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,600
Let HIM kiss me with his lips

828
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,800
Your Love for me is absorbing

829
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,520
Your oil is fragrant!

830
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,960
Your name is like an oil stream So virgins love you!

831
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,840
Draw me to follow you! We would run together!

832
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,840
You dog!

833
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,200
Are you showing roguery in my house?

834
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,760
- Mathacha! - My God!

835
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,600
Leave him Mathacha! Don't hit him!

836
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,840
Move away!

837
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,760
Run away from here! Run! Father! Move away!

838
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,840
- I would kill you beggar! - Stay quiet!

839
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,400
How dare he enters our house and make our girl...

840
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,400
Father! Take him away!

841
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,360
Go!

842
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,280
- You dog! - Calm down!

843
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,480
We will drown our girl and burn you fellow!

844
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,960
Get to the other banks Go man!

845
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,520
- Solomon! - Never mind Father!

846
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,760
Do you know father...

847
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,200
Actually I wanted to join the seminary!

848
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,160
Then...

849
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,120
It was Shoshanna who...

850
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,080
When your people said...

851
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,320
...have you started with your belongings to join the seminary?

852
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,120
What are you talking Shoshanna?

853
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,440
He got a divine call!

854
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,640
Then what else will he do other than joining the seminary?

855
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,480
You move away!

856
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,200
Give me the number of the God who called him!

857
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,160
Let me ask, if he called him?

858
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,000
When did I call? I have not called anyone!

859
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,720
What are you talking?

860
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,200
Is the God carrying a phone?

861
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,840
You move away! The boat will go now!

862
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,600
Have you forgotten the blooming at school?

863
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,800
What is that man?

864
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,520
- Blooming! - What does that mean?

865
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,640
Blooming is a word!

866
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,720
What did I give to guys like Francis, Anto and Raghu who gave me letters?

867
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,600
- What did she give? - Blows!

868
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,800
What did I give you?

869
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,040
What did she give you?

870
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,840
- Kiss! - Kiss?

871
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,000
Have you not heard about kiss?

872
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,280
At the cemetery bushes what did you do to me?

873
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,720
At the cemetery bushes what did you do man?

874
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,760
Don't you know what is done at the cover of bushes?

875
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,640
Shoshanna! I am like your dad...

876
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,280
...I tell you even if the leaf falls on the thorn or thorn falls on leaf

877
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,080
Move away!

878
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,520
It is confirmed the sacristan has fallen down!

879
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,400
- My God! - Stay there man!

880
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,440
I want to know your decision right now!

881
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,800
Do you want to join seminary and become a Father in church...

882
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,800
...or do you want to marry me and father my children?

883
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,520
I would father your children!

884
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,240
What?

885
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,520
I would like to be father of your children!

886
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,360
Heard you called me Father!

887
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,640
Heard it is urgent, so I rushed here!

888
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,840
More than 1500 people have signed and sent a petition...

889
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,640
...to the Bishop's house!

890
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,880
The demand is to remove Father Ottaplakan who is...

891
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,640
...the vicar of Kumarangiri parish for the last 15 years!

892
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,480
Today Bishop called Father and told him to change...

893
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,440
...parish after the church's festival!

894
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,200
We know not even a stone moves in Kumarangiri without your knowledge

895
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,440
Who spearheaded the petition drive got signatures of so many people...

896
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,120
...and sent it to the Bishops's palace?

897
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,920
This assignment should reach the destination safely!

898
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,760
My saint!

899
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,320
Sacristan! That is...

900
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,920
Any problem in revealing the name?

901
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,840
Though it is true how can I betray persons in the group?

902
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,040
I am also a witness to the preparation of petition...

903
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,760
...and making people signatories!

904
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,440
It was done by...

905
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,520
Is it not the Gee Varghese band group maintained by the church for decades?

906
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,320
Right?

907
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,760
I swear on Lord and saint...

908
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,480
...I am not involved in this!

909
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,160
I told Louise Pappan and Chali Pappan...

910
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,200
...umpteen times not to do this! They did not pay heed

911
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,360
When I eased myself what a great relief!

912
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,480
Dog faeces!

913
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,040
What is it Pappa! Have you started early today?

914
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,000
What is it in the boat? Is it shrimps?

915
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,880
Good riposte for Pappan's music! Who is it?

916
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,800
Might be someone from Davi's band on the other banks

917
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,160
Then take this one!

918
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,680
That is Esthappan's style!

919
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,520
Who is there to play this?

920
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,880
- Who is it? - I can't see!

921
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,720
There is no light in the boat!

922
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,200
Go close to that boat!

923
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,720
Give that light to me!

924
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,280
Who is this vying to compete with Pappan?

925
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,040
My God! Solomon! Was it you?

926
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,080
From whom did you learn this my son?

927
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,200
- Come near me! - Go there!

928
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,640
Go there!

929
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,000
Let me see your face once!

930
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,040
My Esthappan is not dead!

931
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,600
My Esthappan's music is also not dead!

932
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,640
Play my son! Play!

933
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,040
'When Louis Pappan learned Esthappan's son...'

934
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,360
'...Solomon is a wizard, it was exactly 7 hours and 2 minutes'

935
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,480
'The same evening, the mother duck did not know...'

936
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,800
'...if the egg was dropped in lake or boat'

937
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,800
'...looked perplexed and was staring at the sky!'

938
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,040
'Without losing a moment, an arched coconut tree over the backwaters...'

939
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,240
'...dropped a red coconut in water!'

940
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,560
'The same evening Shoshanna's marriage with Davis's nephew Alby...'

941
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,840
'...settled in US was verbally finalised by Philipose contractor'

942
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,040
'Esthappan master and Angels were sulking after a game '

943
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:08,840
'Ink spread on the speech I was preparing for the next day mass'

944
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,840
'At that time Ottplakkan Father was worried about his parish change '

945
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,560
'Sacristan Kochu Ouseph was closing the church doors with a bang!'

946
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,480
How old is this church sacristan?

947
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,880
Must be 300-400 years old!

948
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,840
Then balks and rafters would have attenuated

949
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,560
The roof and terrace would have eroded!

950
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,000
Then any time the church's roof...

951
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,520
...may fall on those assembled for prayers in church!

952
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,800
Yes Father!

953
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,920
Should we not protect the Kumarangiri devottees!

954
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,400
A Father thus protecting the Kumarangiri people...

955
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,440
...should never be disturbed from this parish!

956
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,560
We would send a petition to this effect to the Bishop's palace!

957
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,280
We would certainly send one!

958
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
The responsibility of building the new church...

959
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,600
...would be given to the devotee Philipose contractor

960
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,360
- Is it not Father? - Yes

961
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,080
So the sacristan will oversee the renovation...

962
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,800
...and the vicar of the church would close his eyes to some of the deeds of sacristan

963
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,280
'AMEN'

964
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,680
I saw...I saw!

965
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:40,280
Wearing red silk and an armour sitting on a snow white colour horse

966
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,400
I saw our saint!

967
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,880
'Kumarangiri church's terrace, balks rafters and pillars are weakened!'

968
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:56,320
'Ottaplaka! Before its roof fall on the head of my beloved people...'

969
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:02,280
'...Kumarangiri church must be rebuilt' Our Saint said this to me

970
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,960
He said

971
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,240
"Is it not a fete ordained from above?"

972
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:47,280
"Did not the saint say it univocally?"

973
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:53,560
"If postponed, it will ravage generations!"

974
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,600
"Who said it is a command from above?"

975
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,640
"Don't sow lies that would not sprout!"

976
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:08,080
"It's easy to demolish! But difficult to build and raise!"

977
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,000
"Don't we need a wall to draw the cross?"

978
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,240
"Don't we need a church to assemble?"

979
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,640
"To save our esteem under the sky, don't we need a roof?"

980
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,960
"To hold the roof, don't we need a firm wall?"

981
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,880
"Don't we need a roof and wall for the church?"

982
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,600
"Doesn't the church need staff and musicians?"

983
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,640
"Doesn't the church need a bell and a sacristan?"

984
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,320
"What...what?"

985
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,240
"Like the old one don't we need a new birth?"

986
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,960
"Should not the church also have a transformation?"

987
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,040
"Doesn't the church need an edifice and a tower?"

988
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,960
"Doesn't the church need a wall and a chamber?"

989
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,840
"To raise a new one need to demolish the present one"

990
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,080
"We can demolish and build a new one"

991
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,600
"Whether the church is there or not..."

992
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,880
"...don't wreck our boozing!"

993
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,400
"If we don't get booze..."

994
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,280
"We would stir up! Would stir up!"

995
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,200
"If the church is there or not..."

996
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,320
"...is there or not Is there..."

997
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,240
"Can't demolish the church"

998
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,240
"We can't"

999
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,280
"Demolishers hands would burn!"

1000
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,680
"Hands would burn!"

1001
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,600
"We would demolish!"

1002
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,400
"You don't demolish!"

1003
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,280
"We would demolish! You don't demolish"

1004
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,120
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1005
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,960
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1006
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,800
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1007
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,640
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1008
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,080
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1009
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,560
"We would demolish! You don't demolish!"

1010
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,640
She is far away Solomon!

1011
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,880
Philipose contractor is smart!

1012
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,720
Without anyone knowing in this side of the lake...

1013
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,040
...he took her to a church across the lake for engagement!

1014
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:30,960
Seeing the American groom she has fallen flat!

1015
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,400
You take two pieces of this!

1016
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,480
Bite the sorrow and push down the throat Solomon!

1017
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,720
Paila! Is there pork meat in kitchen?

1018
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,680
- Is it there mom? - Must be there in the vessel!

1019
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,200
It is a never ending sorrow mom!

1020
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:58,160
Don't you know Solomon that women are treacherous!

1021
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,080
On the night of a festival in church...

1022
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:06,520
...do you know with whom my hubby eloped to Tamilnadu?

1023
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,520
...it was my own sister That whore...!

1024
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,440
My god!

1025
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,320
What is it?

1026
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,320
Chain got entangled!

1027
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,960
- What! - Chain got entangled!

1028
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,040
Solomon his chain got entangled!

1029
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,440
- All of you hear this! - Where did it get entangled!

1030
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,040
- Mom! Don't put me to shame! - You are a shameless guy!

1031
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,440
- Go fellow! - Is he not your son!

1032
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,040
He is wearing a long chain like a father and...

1033
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,640
My Jesus! You have given me a son who is a...

1034
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,080
I am going...

1035
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:50,680
Solomon! Wear your dhoti and go!

1036
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,040
Poor fellow! He has started drinking toddy!

1037
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,320
God has given you a talent!

1038
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,920
Instead of refining and polishing that talent...

1039
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,800
...you were after a girl See what has happened?

1040
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,240
When she saw another guy...

1041
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,680
...did she not prove she is her father's daughter!

1042
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,920
During mornings, have you ever visited the band?

1043
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In 4 month's time we have the competition!

1044
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,640
If you are not serious you will not play this time!

1045
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,840
You are not a person to become obscure because of a girl!

1046
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,680
Go, have a sound sleep and come for tomorrow's practice!

1047
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,600
Father!

1048
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,360
It was like a idiotic act, Father!

1049
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,480
They were determined not to inform me beforehand!

1050
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,600
I learnt the girl is Shoshanna only after going there!

1051
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,200
If I tell you something, will you do it for me Father?

1052
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,800
What is it Solomon?

1053
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,320
Enough Father! We can go

1054
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,240
That window will not open hereafter!

1055
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,560
I will stop playing clarinet from today!

1056
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,680
I think you can decide on that after getting down from my shoulder!

1057
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,960
Father to the left!

1058
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,360
To the right Father! To the left!

1059
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,720
Father!

1060
01:26:54,160 --> 01:27:00,680
Your name is like an oil stream So virgins love you!

1061
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,440
Draw me to follow you! We would run together!

1062
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,240
I want to see you both together before I die

1063
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,000
Granny!

1064
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,680
Her marriage is fixed

1065
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,400
Why should she come here? That too with him!

1066
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,000
Mathacha! She is my daughter!

1067
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,680
She will honour her words!

1068
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,480
We have fixed her marriage!

1069
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,480
Besides! She is right in front of us!

1070
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,440
Yes If I say...

1071
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,080
What happened?

1072
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:11,560
- Has the power gone? - Is it power shutdown!

1073
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,440
Power is resumed!

1074
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,760
My God! Jesus and Mary are missing!

1075
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,840
It is a festival and it is in procession

1076
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,800
But we can't avoid saying this

1077
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,880
- Who's face it is? - Ours!

1078
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,480
Boat is coming! You may go

1079
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,000
I will take care of the rest!

1080
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,400
Brother in law! What is this?

1081
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,760
You are having a lance and crown!

1082
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,760
Who is this? Is it Jesus?

1083
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,360
- Is it not Shoshanna? - Davis! Don't let him go

1084
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,200
Don't let him go! Catch him!

1085
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,800
- Matha! Don't beat him - Don't beat

1086
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,400
Leave me...

1087
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,840
Father, please tell them to stop beating me

1088
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,480
Father, please tell them to stop beating me

1089
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,440
I don't have any share in this blood!

1090
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,920
Let someone call Father

1091
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Let Father take a decision on this!

1092
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,840
He has abducted a girl whose engagement is over!

1093
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,880
He is not doing a sacristan's job!

1094
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,080
You beggar!

1095
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,120
See the venomous guy's stance!

1096
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,480
If we don't get a decision on this We would kill him today!

1097
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,280
- Leave him - He would die

1098
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,800
- Leave him! - Move away!

1099
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,480
Shoshanna from a respectable family is engaged to another respectable family

1100
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,320
Are you trying to tarnish our family esteem?

1101
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,280
You sacristan!

1102
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,920
If anyone touches him...

1103
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,320
...he would not leave Kumarangiri with that hand

1104
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,800
- Move away - You...!

1105
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,280
- Stop it! - You...!

1106
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,920
Our girl was abducted The loss is ours!

1107
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,680
But you are trying to overawe us?

1108
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,480
Who abducted your daughter?

1109
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,160
They have eloped!

1110
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,960
The entire town knows they are lovers!

1111
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,400
But did you not fix her marriage with another guy?

1112
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:24,200
If the children love each other You must help them to get married!

1113
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,040
Damn it!

1114
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,280
Come here girl! She is my only child

1115
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,240
Have you understood?

1116
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,400
Then for what fu****g thing are you here?

1117
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
- You are... - Stop I say

1118
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,680
The entire town knows the status of a sacristan of this church!

1119
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,240
Every one here is involved in love

1120
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,160
The sacristan is in love here!

1121
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,400
- Stop it man - Leave it man

1122
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,120
He is not a mere sacristan! He is a good artist too!

1123
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,440
He is my Esthappan's son!

1124
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,280
Artist! Does he have any value in Kumarangiri?

1125
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,240
Does he have a penny with him? His intentions were different!

1126
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:02,400
If he married my daughter, he can eat for life time without a job

1127
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,240
Even otherwise for quite some time Kumarangiri people have started devouring

1128
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,760
Sitting on terrace and whistling passersby at junction...

1129
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,120
...are the only thing they know

1130
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,840
Is there a single person here who knows to play clarinet?

1131
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,880
Damn with Louis Pappan and his group!

1132
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,280
They play in some toddy shop unnoticed by anyone!

1133
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,280
Does anyone in Kumarangiri including Esthappan's son...

1134
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,840
...has the guts to come forward and play?

1135
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,520
If they climb the dais they would urinate!

1136
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,720
Take it from me!

1137
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,280
If the Gee Varghese band is playing for the coming new year

1138
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,000
Solomon would be at the forefront!

1139
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,840
For the last 17 years you have never come near the dais

1140
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,240
Will you play in the band?

1141
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,560
I will...

1142
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,000
Then will you win the trophy?

1143
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,520
Tell him brother! We will win the trophy!

1144
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,320
We will win!

1145
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,080
If the clarinet I play has life...

1146
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,640
If the saint in this church is true...

1147
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,800
We will occupy the dais and play!

1148
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,080
We will win the trophy!

1149
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,120
And we will dedicate it to the saint too!

1150
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:06,240
In case you win the trophy we will offer last 8 years prize money...

1151
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,280
...won by Martha Mariam band to this boy!

1152
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,640
Is it not contractor?

1153
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,560
Yes!

1154
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,600
Shoshanna was engaged to our boy!

1155
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,920
If you win the trophy, we offer to marry Shoshanna to Solomon

1156
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,800
Tell contractor, you would abide it!

1157
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,880
I would!

1158
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,400
- If it is otherwise... - Tell me

1159
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,440
Tell Pappan!

1160
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,240
Gee Varghese band will never play again!

1161
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,760
We will decide Shoshanna is not destined to marry Solomon!

1162
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,760
That is enough!

1163
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,520
Stop it!

1164
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:44,080
Whatever is said here does not bind the church or the vicar of this church

1165
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,320
But we did not ask you take this responsibility

1166
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,360
Not only that, for a band of this type...

1167
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,040
...church will not spend a penny!

1168
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,920
The church no longer is associated with this band!

1169
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,080
The church can only ban the band

1170
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,920
You cannot forbid us from competing!

1171
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,440
We will get a person to sponsor the band from this side of the bank itself!

1172
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,280
Let us see that Bye Pappan!

1173
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,680
Will see you at the competition!

1174
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,400
We will

1175
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,000
Do you know who helped the junior sacristan in abduction?

1176
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,520
It was the junior vicar!

1177
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,440
Mathacha take leave and come!

1178
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,840
- Come! - Solomon...!

1179
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,040
Come, let's go

1180
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,320
Instead you could have killed me!

1181
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,360
Father! Where should I keep this? I mean this lance and crown!

1182
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,680
Father Vincent Vattoli! Pack your belongings

1183
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:50,560
Don't forget to take your pants, shirt and sun glasses!

1184
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,080
Hereafter you may not have to wear a robe!

1185
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:58,240
You need not waste time until tomorrow morning to vacate!

1186
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,080
I have not done anything so far that my conscience did not permit

1187
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,400
I am damn sure it will not happen henceforth too!

1188
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,800
Wait Father!

1189
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,200
Senior Vicar feels you are against the demolition of the church!

1190
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,840
This ire is because of that!

1191
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,680
What do you want me to do sacristan?

1192
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,640
You should not impede his actions

1193
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,080
Demolishing the church stopping the church band...

1194
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,280
...or preventing lovers coming together Which one I should not impede?

1195
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:33,520
I said this because of my love for you, Father!

1196
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,160
But if you help a devotee coming to church...

1197
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,720
...and a helper of the church to elope

1198
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,520
Will the locals tolerate you Father?

1199
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,000
Sacristan! I have not made any vow...

1200
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,640
...to continue in Kumarangiri parish amidst so many hardships

1201
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,200
I would pack my things and will be ready!

1202
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,200
When you get information from the Bishop's palace, call me!

1203
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,440
Ok Father!

1204
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,840
Pappan! What made you wager my affair with Shoshanna...

1205
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,000
...for a band competition?

1206
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:01,040
If Pappan did not do that together both sides would have killed you

1207
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,920
Solomon don't you believe our band can stage a show?

1208
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,200
How is it possible, Pappan?

1209
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,840
All these years, all of you tried and could not succeed!

1210
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,360
How will I do it?

1211
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,160
Even after engagement with another guy Shoshanna came with me!

1212
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,120
How will I pacify her?

1213
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,080
All of you have ruined my life!

1214
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,280
Pappan! On what basis you thought we can...

1215
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,080
...win the trophy with Solomon at forefront!

1216
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,520
Thoma! Keep quiet!

1217
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,440
Seems Pappan forgot our efforts for this band for many years!

1218
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,760
Has he proved his caliber for you to support him?

1219
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,120
Who are you to say we would stop playing band if we lose this time!

1220
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,240
For the sake of a good for nothing fellow...

1221
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,600
...should we stop playing band It was a bit excessive Pappan!

1222
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,640
Don't you want others to hear the music you held back all these years!

1223
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,560
Don't you need your girl?

1224
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,600
My Esthappan's son! Tell me

1225
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,760
They would not win, son!

1226
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,640
Tell me Will not we win?

1227
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:00,360
If your decision is final, then we don't like to play in this band!

1228
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,960
If that is band master's decision, Solomon would play from forefront

1229
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,360
And we would win the trophy!

1230
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,600
I tell you!

1231
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,520
If anyone is opposed to Solomon as the lead player...

1232
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,360
Tell that right now!

1233
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,240
Chali Pappan! Why are you so worked up?

1234
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,520
For quiet some time I have been planning this for you!

1235
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,720
Don't think no one knows about your behind the scene maneuvers!

1236
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,520
I don't want to see you around the band anymore!

1237
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,200
Go man! Go dog!

1238
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,720
Who is coming here at this midnight?

1239
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,040
From now on Gee Varghese band is not run by the church!

1240
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,280
I, Chachappan is going to sponsor the band henceforth!

1241
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,280
Even if it means spending a lot, I don't mind!

1242
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,400
I am not doing this for fun!

1243
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:08,080
Gee Varghese Saint told me to do it!

1244
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,240
'That night Ottaplakal Father and Ouseph sacristan...'

1245
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,040
'...also had a dream that could not be deciphered '

1246
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,600
Father Vincent is a son of my cousin!

1247
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,480
This is his first parish Let him continue here!

1248
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,040
- Yes! - Let it be so!

1249
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,400
Then you think about it and do what is required!

1250
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,440
Yes!

1251
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,880
'Next day morning Vishakol Pappan crossed the waters and joined...'

1252
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,240
'...Thommeri davis's Martha Mariam Band'

1253
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:02,480
"You fluttered!"

1254
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,600
"Weary eyes! Go to sleep!"

1255
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,880
"Weary eyes! Go to sleep!"

1256
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,600
"My heart is stirred up"

1257
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,400
"It's full of desires!"

1258
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,280
"Will you not give yours!"

1259
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:30,080
"You held my fingers even without me knowing it!"

1260
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:37,600
"Soulfully...! One day when we dine together..."

1261
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,640
"...my colours would bloom in sky"

1262
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,640
"...bloom in sky"

1263
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,160
"In the rainbow of my psyche..."

1264
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,920
"...would sound the cherubic amen!"

1265
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,760
"In the rainbow of my psyche..."

1266
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,760
"...would sound the cherubic amen!"

1267
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:23,120
"Honey! I initially I looked for you"

1268
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:30,600
"Would commingle with your soulful emotion!"

1269
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:37,640
"Go without informing me... Arrogant guy!"

1270
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:41,520
"Came back on account of bewitching love!"

1271
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,320
"The twilight is a blooming season!"

1272
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:54,000
"Finally when we unite, it will be intense passion!"

1273
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,160
"Rainbow of my psyche..."

1274
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,080
"...would resound the cherubic amen!"

1275
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:05,960
"Rainbow of my psyche..."

1276
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,160
"...would resound the cherubic amen!"

1277
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,480
Ponnappa! Don't take the boat close!

1278
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,720
Go straight!

1279
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,680
I have something to talk to Father!

1280
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,760
Is this your regular work Father?

1281
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,600
I mean, abduction!

1282
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,480
Don't stare Father! They are my friends!

1283
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,160
He is Mr.Ernakulam

1284
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,720
He is...runner up!

1285
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,440
Father! For one day can I take her with me?

1286
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,720
Amen!

1287
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,000
Dear Kumarangiri residents!

1288
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,040
For the 50th Gee Varghese ever rolling Trophy...

1289
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,840
...there will be a three day Band competition at Church Premises

1290
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,440
We welcome you all

1291
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:31,280
The next day after the competition our church's demolition work will commence

1292
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,560
Hence from the same day prayers and worships...

1293
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:38,800
...would be held in the temporary thatched shed at contractor Philippose's premises

1294
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,360
Son! Did you call me?

1295
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,200
Here is a son who farts and a mom who responds to farts!

1296
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,840
Son! Don't suspect the anus that farted!

1297
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,800
If you wipe it with sand you can eat it with rice flakes!

1298
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,160
In the boat that reached the jetty that day

1299
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,920
There were 3groups who are going to rewrite the history of Kumarangiri maintenance

1300
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,400
One was an archaeologist to take a final decision on demolition of church

1301
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:12,320
Second was two thugs imported by Contractor Philippose to handle Solomon

1302
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,880
Vikraman Muthtu

1303
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,120
Come Walk

1304
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,720
It is not yet over!

1305
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,400
Third one - to drub Gee Varghese Band...

1306
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:27,320
Thommeri Davis paid to bring from Fort Kochi

1307
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,120
Chavelier Pothachan!

1308
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,920
So this is Kumarangiri!

1309
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,680
Sir! Jetty is on this side!

1310
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,240
He has gone!

1311
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,560
Hold my hand! This side

1312
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,720
- Where? - Here!

1313
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,560
Anyway I am drenched!

1314
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:47,400
I will be there at the shop! You just come there!

1315
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,840
- Saint has come earlier - Who is this guy?

1316
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,480
Is this the horse or is it snake?

1317
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,720
On inspection, we are convinced that...

1318
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,840
...there is substantial weakening to the church building!

1319
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,040
Kumarangiri church has to be demolished and rebuilt!

1320
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,240
We don't see any other way out!

1321
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,040
Come on guys!

1322
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,320
How about it sir!

1323
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,040
Is it sufficient to maul him or should we break his limbs?

1324
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,960
Therutha! Get me two bottles of toddy!

1325
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,800
He is Pothachan Chavelier Pothachan!

1326
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,400
Davis has brought him from fort Kochi!

1327
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,720
So if we bribe even any ancient thing is vulnerable!

1328
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,120
Is it not engineer? Have one more egg!

1329
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,520
Ancient thing will be vulnerable But not public works or maintenance!

1330
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,800
Break his fingers so that he can not...

1331
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,480
...can not happen

1332
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,760
Dear! Do you know who they are...?

1333
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,920
Poor girl! She does not know

1334
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,080
They are the accused in the stabbing case of North station SI

1335
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,840
Vickraman and Muthu!

1336
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,440
I brought them To give few blows to him!

1337
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,480
They are in doubt whether to break his hands or legs!

1338
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,720
For the present they are biting the leg piece!

1339
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:08,920
Poor fellows!

1340
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,240
Shall I serve you some chicken curry?

1341
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,320
You never told me your daughter is a hothead!

1342
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:11,760
Who are the bootlicks of Gee Varghese band?

1343
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,280
Were you asking for me?

1344
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,400
If so, I am right in front of you, Pothacha

1345
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:26,160
Pappa! Seems you have lost your old drive!

1346
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,240
If someone plays, don't you have the strength fight back

1347
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,520
"Desires were benumbed!"

1348
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,520
"Hands wearing rings hardened"

1349
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,000
"But mind alone... mind alone..."

1350
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:01,840
First time, at the Kanjoor church for Saint Sebastian's festival

1351
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,760
Is it not?

1352
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,680
Later at Saint Sebastian's festival at Chalakudy church!

1353
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,360
At Ollur Gabriela angel's festival

1354
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,520
Lastly at Kottamam Sain't Rocke's festival

1355
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,840
That day you floored me!

1356
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,440
I was shamed and heard insults!

1357
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,480
I think that was the last time, right?

1358
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:29,240
No, I was waiting for your return!

1359
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,080
Esthappan left without giving us a chance

1360
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,520
Now you are the only one left

1361
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,720
I have some scores to settle!

1362
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,840
I have not come to Kumarangiri for money!

1363
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,240
Not for wine or women!

1364
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:49,800
I want to defeat you at least once!

1365
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,440
I am obdurate about it

1366
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:55,240
For this time you may discard that desire!

1367
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,280
Come next time I will lose it for your sake!

1368
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,080
No Pappan!

1369
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,320
I have promised Thommeri Davis!

1370
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,400
I have assimilated years of learning, playing and hearing

1371
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,880
I have come well prepared!

1372
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,080
I would not give up, Pappan!

1373
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:22,400
I have also made a promise to deceased colleagues and to Kumarangiri Saint

1374
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,120
That can't be changed!

1375
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:36,680
You have an eternal soul that defies death!

1376
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,680
Jesus!

1377
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:58,840
I will leave this place only after shattering that!

1378
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,360
So we will meet!

1379
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:16,640
Come guys!

1380
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,840
My Jesus! This is the first time...

1381
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,200
...a guy is visiting this shop who consumes glass pieces along with toddy!

1382
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:33,080
"Ascent, ascent thus! Hold your breath and ascent!"

1383
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,720
"We can not now afford to lose!"

1384
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,880
"Can not afford...!"

1385
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,800
"Those who can't, may leave if they are work-shy!"

1386
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,280
"This is our last chance!"

1387
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,360
"If we don't win it will be a shame!"

1388
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,120
"Will confront them To succeed..."

1389
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,320
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1390
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,240
"Commensurate with talent elegance soars!"

1391
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,520
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1392
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,000
"Don't you want to be in dais Come all of you!"

1393
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,160
"It's excitement everywhere!"

1394
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,760
"Join us Come, come!"

1395
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,880
"Come, come! Come, come!"

1396
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:05,760
"Break the barrier!"

1397
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,360
"Join the band Join, join!"

1398
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,360
"Join, join Join, join!"

1399
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,400
"You be the blaze!"

1400
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,640
"Come together! Come, come!"

1401
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:19,920
"Come, come Join, join!"

1402
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,120
"Break and recast!"

1403
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,320
Mike check!

1404
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:26,560
Farid! Bring sugar less tea and laddu!

1405
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,280
Dear countrymen, friends!

1406
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,200
I have come with a solution for everything!

1407
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:37,680
Davis band's fair Thoma's brother Paulachan...

1408
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,160
...would marry Clara without demanding a penny!

1409
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:43,720
I mean the Paulachan who is working in the Cashew factory!

1410
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:47,440
After the festival Solomon can play in the Davis band at a good salary

1411
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:51,640
This is the house document I took from Esthappan

1412
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:55,080
Besides all this, I take the responsibility...

1413
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:59,880
...to see he marries Shoshanna at the Kumarangiri Church!

1414
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:04,080
Tell us what we should do in return for all these favours!

1415
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:06,480
She has understood it!

1416
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,800
Just do one thing A help that does not damage anyone!

1417
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,080
You should not play in the competition!

1418
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,640
"Our band is named after the saint!"

1419
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:21,440
"Whoever confronts us will lose!"

1420
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,800
"Victory is not yours!"

1421
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,720
"The honour is ours!"

1422
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:30,600
"We know you bring outsiders and thugs!"

1423
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:33,240
Matthai! Is it time for lunch?

1424
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:38,240
"Even if we lose we walk with head held high!"

1425
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,680
"Go man!"

1426
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,200
- The programme is about to start! - Let it be

1427
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,480
- How is my uniform? - Splendid!

1428
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,640
- Shall I ask you something? - What is it?

1429
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:50,920
In this uniform I look taller than you and my pomp has enhanced!

1430
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,800
Now how should I call you mom?

1431
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,640
Call me aunt!

1432
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,880
My brother trembles when he takes the clarinet

1433
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,680
He is going to lead the band

1434
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,960
I can even give you a signed document!

1435
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,400
The church band will never win!

1436
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,920
Are you ready for a bet?

1437
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,480
What about you brother!

1438
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:12,840
Son!

1439
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,480
Solomon! Please wait!

1440
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,760
Let me tell you!

1441
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:21,360
Solomon! I know you play better than your dad Esthappan

1442
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,520
If you play the band would win too

1443
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,360
After the competition you may play Play anywhere you like!

1444
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,720
What will they pay you for this service?

1445
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,600
Do you know what will happen to a family if the church excludes them?

1446
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:39,360
You will not get rice Not even a crystal of salt

1447
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,800
Will not get water!

1448
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,600
Not even a child in the parish would talk to the family

1449
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,920
Mom and children may have to leave the place in midnight!

1450
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,280
The saint is inside the cage!

1451
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:56,600
But all functions are carried out by the father and the sacristan!

1452
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:15,040
"Our band is named after the saint!"

1453
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:18,400
"Whoever confronts us will lose!"

1454
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,200
"Victory is not yours!"

1455
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,240
"The honour is ours!"

1456
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:28,120
"We know you bring outsiders and thugs!"

1457
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:34,760
"Even if we lose we walk with head held high!"

1458
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,000
"Go man!"

1459
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,320
Clara! How did we play?

1460
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,960
Will we reach the Last Eight?

1461
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Tell me

1462
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,800
I will be confident, If you say

1463
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:09,080
Viewers!

1464
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:12,560
For the second round 8 teams have been selected!

1465
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,960
I will read out the names!

1466
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,240
Makkamman Mary Matha Band!

1467
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:22,400
Vettikavalam Eso Band!

1468
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,920
Next is Chenkaiyil Chamayam Band!

1469
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:33,000
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1470
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,520
Attookara Iruvetta Band!

1471
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,320
Kurisadi Cherupushpam Band!

1472
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:48,160
Kuruvithalam OK band!

1473
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,280
And last Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1474
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:11,760
Boss, for your happiness I have done a thing!

1475
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,680
What is it?

1476
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,320
I removed the reed from Solomon's clarinet and scathe it on floor!

1477
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,240
So he could not play How will he play without reed?

1478
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,960
His church cleaning job would end today!

1479
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,160
You idiot!

1480
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,360
It should be a manly contest!

1481
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,960
Don't deceit to win! Get lost

1482
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,920
I don't want to see you in the band!

1483
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,760
- Leave the place - Go man!

1484
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,680
He can't be blamed!

1485
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,120
The sacristan asked him to scratch the reed!

1486
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,560
So...

1487
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:44,240
Can't be blamed!

1488
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:46,760
Never mind Solomon!

1489
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,360
Anyway we are not out of the competition!

1490
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,960
You must think only about tomorrow now!

1491
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,600
This has happened today

1492
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,280
It should manifest your resoluteness tomorrow!

1493
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,840
"Oh when the saints go marching in..."

1494
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,560
"When the saints go marching in..."

1495
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:25,800
"Oh lord I want to be in that number..."

1496
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,920
"When the saints go marching in"

1497
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,800
He may be sheepish! But he is Esthappan's seed!

1498
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,760
This time he would revel!

1499
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,840
"No one with us, but truth!"

1500
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,680
"The saint is always with us!"

1501
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:48,560
"The saint is always with us!"

1502
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,360
"The saint is always with us!"

1503
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,240
Dear people! A plantain cluster donation to Makkammam Mary Matha band!

1504
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:55,960
Move away man!

1505
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,720
This is plucked from my grove!

1506
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,360
Thief! Thief!

1507
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,880
Encourage him

1508
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,240
Get down man!

1509
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,840
- You thief! - Go man!

1510
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,000
You drunkard!

1511
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,480
Go man

1512
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,200
Friends! Another happy news!

1513
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:15,640
For Vettikaavala Eso Band 101 eggs are donated...

1514
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,520
...by Chakkarakara Ambrose!

1515
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:22,760
Go guys! Has anyone laid eggs here?

1516
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:28,280
Friends! For the 2nd day's Semi final competitions...

1517
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:33,040
...to be held in the afternoon session 4 teams are selected

1518
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,160
I am announcing the band names!

1519
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:38,440
Makkammam Mary Matha Band!

1520
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,120
Kurisadi Cherupushpam Band!

1521
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:46,480
Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1522
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,040
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1523
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,720
Why do you touch and kiss the horse and the snake?

1524
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,480
Saint or the horse or the snake...!

1525
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,680
Let anyone of them help the band to win!

1526
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,200
My Saint!

1527
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,960
"We can not now afford to lose! Can not afford...!"

1528
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:20,040
"Those who can't may leave if they are work-shy!"

1529
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:21,560
"This is our last chance!"

1530
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,600
"If we don't win it will be a shame!"

1531
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:25,440
"Will confront them To succeed..."

1532
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,440
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1533
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,440
"Commensurate with talent elegance soars!"

1534
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,800
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1535
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,240
"Don't you want to be in dais Come all of you!"

1536
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,280
"It's excitement everywhere!"

1537
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,120
"Join us Come, come!"

1538
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,640
Father! If you look from here...

1539
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:45,080
...with the instrument and uniform he resembles Esthappan!

1540
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:47,720
If you mull over It does not augur well

1541
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,800
If the church band climbs the stage it will expose our vulnerability

1542
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,520
"Those who can't may leave if they are work-shy!"

1543
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,080
"This is our last chance!"

1544
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:00,080
"If we don't win it will be a shame!"

1545
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,880
"Will confront them To succeed..."

1546
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,960
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1547
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,960
"Commensurate with talent elegance soars!"

1548
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,240
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1549
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:11,720
"Don't you want to be in dais Come all of you!"

1550
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,760
"It's excitement everywhere!"

1551
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:17,360
"Join us Come, come!"

1552
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,360
"Come, come! Come, come!"

1553
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:24,920
Dear friends! In the competition held at Kumarangiri church...

1554
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,640
Two teams are selected for the last round!

1555
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,280
I am reading out the names!

1556
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:33,720
Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1557
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:46,440
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1558
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:03,200
No one in Kumarangiri would have thought you would play clarinet so well!

1559
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:07,560
I was also diffident!

1560
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:16,080
- Is this a new one? - No, it is an old one Father!

1561
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,840
So, tomorrow will you play with this?

1562
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:24,200
So the church band will win, right?

1563
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:28,720
For your sake you want me to lose!

1564
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,600
Now play tomorrow and try to win!

1565
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,360
My God! What is it?

1566
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:11,320
Son! What happened?

1567
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,080
Jesus! Tell me son!

1568
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:18,040
How will I play tomorrow!

1569
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:20,640
My clarinet...

1570
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,240
To play, I...

1571
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,280
Is this not dad's?

1572
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,240
I don't want to learn what happened!

1573
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,840
Tomorrow you are playing with this!

1574
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:12,680
It is our dad's desire that you should play with this at stage tomorrow!

1575
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:21,360
I didn't know my brother is a whizz than our dad!

1576
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:23,040
I didn't know about it!

1577
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:40,640
Shoshanna! Don't ask me where is the clarinet you gave me?

1578
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,680
That is no more with me

1579
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,040
This is my dad's

1580
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,160
Esthappan master's!

1581
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:51,440
Wherever he has taken this or used he has seen only victories!

1582
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:54,320
But I am not Esthappan master!

1583
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,800
Have I ever won?

1584
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:03,320
If I take the stage tomorrow, our band will lose!

1585
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,640
I am going!

1586
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:07,480
I can't...

1587
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,560
Will you go? Will you lose?

1588
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:15,960
If you lose, along with you Louis Pappan who has faith in you will also lose

1589
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:18,680
Kumarangiri will also lose!

1590
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,240
Don't you want to win?

1591
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,840
Don't you want to marry me?

1592
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,120
Whose screams you were responding at this midnight?

1593
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,280
I will go!

1594
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:13,360
If my Solomon calls I will go even if it is midnight!

1595
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:31,440
Tomorrow will be your guys last day playing of the instrument!

1596
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:34,880
Let me see how you will reach the church premises!

1597
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:37,640
Until we return from the church tomorrow...

1598
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,880
...don't open the door!

1599
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,360
Aunt! Ask him to open the door!

1600
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:46,280
Brother! Open it!

1601
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,600
Vattoli! Are you going to hit me?

1602
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:04,840
I don't want others to know about certain things!

1603
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,640
Tell me, what it is!

1604
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:13,280
What you did yesterday were deeds not supposed...

1605
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,960
...to be done by a person wearing the robe!

1606
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,960
What is it?

1607
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:18,120
You broke Solomon's clarinet...

1608
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,280
...you don't even qualify to be a human being, Father!

1609
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,440
I am wearing this robe for the last 40 years!

1610
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:30,800
You need not teach me the do's and don'ts of wearing this robe!

1611
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,680
Diocese has not given you robe and authority to help a girl whose engagement...

1612
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:39,680
...is over to elope with someone!

1613
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,760
One does not become a father to work against...

1614
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:49,560
...the church, diocese, superiors and noble Christians

1615
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:54,920
Bible says a tree that does not produce fruit...

1616
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,280
...will be cut down and thrown into the fire

1617
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:03,320
But what I learned evidently from bible is 'let us love one another'

1618
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:09,240
Father, you have time only to roam around with a foreign woman!

1619
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,880
Locals say you would soon discard the robes!

1620
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:20,720
Those days locals said the same thing about Jesus and Mary Magdalene

1621
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,720
It was Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified

1622
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,560
Not Father Vincent Vattoli!

1623
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:31,320
So let us not try to taunt each other on this score!

1624
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:34,880
You believe, if you close your eyes, it is night!

1625
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,640
Don't think no one knows the motive behind the church demolition!

1626
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:44,760
For certain deeds I follow my own style!

1627
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:50,360
I will do what is required to make others also think in those lines!

1628
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,880
You are not the congregation!

1629
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:56,560
But I am the vicar of the Kumarangiri church!

1630
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,080
Whether it is demolition of church or dissolving the band...

1631
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:06,640
...or Shoshanna's marriage with Solomon it is I who take the final decision!

1632
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:14,320
On top of that is the saint who protects the church and Lord Jesus!

1633
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,960
They will also have made some decisions!

1634
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,960
Father! Have a cup of coffee!

1635
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,160
The competition is about to start!

1636
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,080
No thanks, Father!

1637
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,480
Will have coffee after the competition!

1638
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,840
I...I will stay here!

1639
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:44,520
Me and the saint want to hear you play and win!

1640
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,320
Chali!

1641
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:09,640
Dear friends! The exciting contest is about to start!

1642
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:14,520
The two teams are ready like war horses!

1643
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,240
I read your letter kept inside the rafter!

1644
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:21,360
Try to play well and win! I will give you a reply then!

1645
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:30,760
Clap your hands and encourage them! Yes clap like that!

1646
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,760
Competition is going to start!

1647
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:42,360
Dear friends! We welcome you all to witness this competition!

1648
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:51,960
Dear friends! The exciting contest is about to start!

1649
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:56,120
We invite both teams to the stage!

1650
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:15,360
Both teams have occupied the dais!

1651
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:19,480
Both teams are charged up electrifying competition!

1652
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:24,080
Few minutes from now the competition starts!

1653
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:26,840
Come on clap! Come on

1654
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:32,560
Play soft where required and loud where required!

1655
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,720
The clarinet now in your hand will decide whether you should live or not!

1656
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:43,000
A sobbing person with prayers is sitting inside!

1657
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:44,320
Don't forget that!

1658
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:50,440
Did you not hear how he played the third tempo yesterday!

1659
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:54,720
Is he the guy who is going to defeat me and win the trophy?

1660
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:58,680
Today he would poop while playing!

1661
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:37,760
"It is a prayer to Saint Gee Varghese"

1662
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:29,600
"Challenge or defiance!"

1663
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,720
"Even if we die we would not give up!"

1664
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:33,400
"Challenge or defiance!"

1665
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,560
"Even if we die we would not give up!"

1666
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:39,440
"Defeat stares you! But putting up a brave face!"

1667
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:43,160
"Defeat stares you! But putting up a brave face!"

1668
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:49,560
"Challenge or defiance!"

1669
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:56,880
"Death or defeat...!"

1670
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:02,920
I don't know about the decision of the judges!

1671
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,280
But I know about one thing!

1672
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:10,960
I can't play better than this!

1673
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:53,600
'Perhaps he did not want to witness the church demolition!'

1674
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,280
'So he left us earlier!'

1675
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,200
- Philipose! - What is it, Father?

1676
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:21,280
Solomon! You proceed!

1677
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:26,240
Should we not take a decision on this?

1678
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:27,160
About what?

1679
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,720
You made a promise!

1680
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,760
If Solomon wins the competition...

1681
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,520
You mean that one...!

1682
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:40,240
Me making a promise on street and he winning the trophy is all true

1683
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,200
But how can I give my daughter to him?

1684
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,440
Is this a child's play, Father?

1685
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,240
I can consider about it...

1686
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:53,000
...if the guy who played the bet with me who is in grave or the saint tells me

1687
02:23:53,800 --> 02:24:00,080
As I decided earlier, my daughter would marry Davis's nephew

1688
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,320
Is it not Davis?

1689
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:04,880
If that is to happen my dad should not be Thommeri Kochu Pappan

1690
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,160
If you are manly honor your words!

1691
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:10,360
For idiotic acts like this don't expect my support!

1692
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:16,160
After the first mass and first consecration of the new church...

1693
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,320
...the first wedding at the new church will be my daughter's

1694
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:24,520
We will invite all and sundry! Come and enjoy the free feast!

1695
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:26,280
Go guys!

1696
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:28,360
Come Matha!

1697
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,200
Move away!

1698
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,680
First remove the saint!

1699
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:02,320
Then do the rest!

1700
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:43,760
'Kumarangiri rained for one full day and night!'

1701
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:46,920
'Along with that 3 great things happened!'

1702
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:53,080
'Father Ottplakan had a dream that the church need not be demolished'

1703
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:57,680
'Contractor Philipose understood Shoshanna is destined to be Solomon's wife!'

1704
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:03,800
'Sacristan Ouseph decides to return Esthapan's house document to them!'

1705
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:06,320
'Without much delay with locals as witness'

1706
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:15,520
'Shoshanna and Solomon got married at the Kumarangiri church!'

1707
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:19,520
'After few weeks, there were rain laden clouds!'

1708
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,600
'Moist wind was blowing on that day'

1709
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:27,840
'That day Gee Varghese band went to play at Paraman church festival!'

1710
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:35,960
'That day Michele decided to return to France since her mom was unwell!'

1711
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,920
I can never forget Kumarangiri!

1712
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,240
I can also not forget you, Michele!

1713
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:52,440
The boat has arrived!

1714
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:58,320
Brother! Give me a lime soda!

1715
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:09,920
Brother! Where is this church?

1716
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:22,960
Calling from the Bishop's palace!

1717
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,520
Father Vincent Vattoli who is to take charge of Kumarangiri church...

1718
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:27,920
...will reach there today morning!

1719
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:28,880
Let it be

1720
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:37,520
Then who is the guy here?

1721
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:37,800
"Gilded honey dew fills soul! It's a chill moon lit night!"

1722
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:42,400
"It's raining down on the lake, as on a tent!"

1723
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:44,720
"Hoshanna!"
