1
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:43,106 
Grab it, Lu.

2
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,135 
Give me that stick.

3
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,576 
Drop.

4
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,517 
Drop.

5
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:57,580 
Drop it.

6
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,850 
That's a girl.
That's a girl.

7
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,350 
Drop it. Good dog.

8
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:04,653 
Lucy.

9
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,677 
Come on back, girl.

10
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:30,679 
WENDY and LUCY

11
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:32,512 
<i>Lu, where did you go?</i>

12
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,417 
Great dog, what's her name?

13
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:13,776 
Lucy.

14
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,409 
You're a sweetheart, Lucy!

15
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,081 
What is she?

16
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:21,621 
Don't know, really.
A mix of hunting dog and retriever.

17
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:25,057 
Where's the closest
store around here?

18
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,527 
I don't know.
I'm not from around here.

19
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,999 
I'm just kinda
passing through.

20
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,332 
Where to?

21
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,470 
Going to Alaska.

22
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:37,639 
I'm headed south.

23
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:42,541 
Icky over there worked
the canneries last year.

24
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,908 
Hey, Icky!
This lady's going to Alaska!

25
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,078 
King Salmon!

26
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,084 
It's fucking awesome up there.
You going to work?

27
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,949 
Where you going?

28
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,820 
Ketchikan.

29
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:57,459 
Ketchikan.

30
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:01,824 
It's good for greenhorns. Cooper River
is pretty good, too. Further north.

31
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,401 
Lots of work on
that slime line.

32
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:06,645 
You should check out
Northwestern Fisheries

33
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,406 
because their housing
is fucking awesome.

34
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:13,535 
Tell Mike Murphy you met me,
because he's all right.

35
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,371 
Okay, I might. Thanks.

36
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,874 
The money's better there, too.

37
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:22,110 
There's no expenses, you know?
You just walk with everything.

38
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,989 
Well, whatever you do...

39
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,688 
...don't tell Old Man Brutus
that you met me.

40
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:33,524 
Because he was a little upset when
I left in somewhat of a hurry.

41
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,996 
There was this incident...

42
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,865 
...involving me operating
a two ton earth mover...

43
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,564 
...in a state slightly less than sober.

44
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,535 
Some friends of mine...

45
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:46,106 
...they were goofing around...

46
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:50,542 
...and we got the thing started, and
I put it in gear and that was that.

47
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:53,584 
We drove the thing
across the construction site.

48
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,450 
Getting it to stop, though.
No one told me that.

49
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,023 
So, we finally had
to jump off...

50
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:01,820 
...and the thing just rolled all the
way across the construction site.

51
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,191 
We couldn't stop the thing.
We tried everything.

52
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,556 
It snapped the retaining wires.

53
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,167 
Huge spray of sparks.

54
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:12,595 
The Cat went over the hill
head over heels...

55
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:14,831 
...ass over tit, right into the water.

56
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,259 
It was probably a hundred thousand
dollar piece of equipment, gone

57
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,899 
in four fucking seconds.

58
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:21,478 
But they couldn't pin it
on me, man, I was gone.

59
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,933 
Ferry Running Times
NORTHWESTERN

60
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,521 
Good night, baby girl.

61
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:20,025 
Wake up.

62
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:28,868 
Ma'am.

63
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:38,782 
You can't sleep here, ma'am.

64
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,142 
You can't sleep out here,
it's not allowed.

65
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:42,777 
Okay.

66
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,315 
All right, get back, Lu.

67
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,207 
My car won't start.

68
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,179 
I can hear that.

69
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,920 
You can't park here.
That's the rules.

70
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,751 
Yeah, I got it,
I got it, okay?

71
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:25,797 
I don't know what it is.
It was fine yesterday.

72
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:29,028 
You just gonna have
to get it off the property.

73
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:35,232 
Well, where is that?
How far is the property?

74
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,810 
Street. The street's public.
You just have to get it off the lot.

75
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:47,944 
All right, jump in.

76
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:13,971 
Lu!

77
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:16,973 
What do you know
about that...

78
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,878 
...station over there?

79
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:21,949 
Seems to get business.
A lot of cars come and go.

80
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,248 
He's the closest.
He's got that going for him.

81
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,418 
What about, is there some kind
of grocery store around here?

82
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,422 
Down the road there's Jack's.

83
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:34,165 
Pretty good and pretty cheap.
That's where I normally go.

84
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:40,871 
Stay, Lu.

85
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,009 
Hey, Lu.

86
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:38,211 
Look.

87
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:01,935 
I know.

88
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,609 
I know.

89
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,647 
Okay. Be right back.

90
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:58,096 
You're hungry, huh?
Bet you are.

91
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,959 
Come on, let's go.

92
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,756 
I can't shut up, I'm choking.

93
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,719 
So I said, man, I ain't
staying there, I'm going.

94
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:35,456 
Yeah, like one out of what?
Is there like ten of us here?

95
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,559 
Found a few cans and then I
went to this place over here...

96
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:41,764 
...and laid down under a tree
and went to sleep.

97
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:43,096 
Lu.

98
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:44,998 
Sit here.

99
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,610 
There's a long line.

100
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:51,011 
I think some of these machines are
broken today, so it's gonna be a while.

101
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,514 
Why don't you buy
her cans from her?

102
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:55,175 
I don't have any money
to buy her cans from her.

103
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,687 
But, hey, I tell you what,
I'll take those. Hey, dog.

104
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,521 
I'll take those from you and
I'll give you the money later.

105
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,323 
I mean, you've only got...

106
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,493 
It's not many cans.
It's not worth the wait.

107
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,297 
I'll find you later.

108
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:16,202 
Okay, you can just take those.
That's fine.

109
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:18,332 
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's fine.

110
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,239 
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

111
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:22,274 
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

112
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,081 
Don't bother anybody, okay?

113
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,586 
Be right back with a treat.

114
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,080 
Hey.

115
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,090 
What did I say?

116
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,593 
Don't be a nuisance.
We don't need that.

117
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,782 
Hey, Lu.

118
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:45,221 
- Excuse me? Ma'am?
- Let go of me.

119
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,655 
- I think you're forgetting something.
- Let go of me.

120
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,217 
- But you have something.
- Let go of me.

121
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:54,256 
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step inside the store, okay?

122
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,368 
Sit here, please.

123
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:03,906 
What's going on, Andy?

124
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:07,971 
This customer neglected
to pay for a few items.

125
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,271 
I watched the whole thing. I saw
her since she came in the store.

126
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,818 
No. I'm sorry,
that isn't true.

127
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:16,818 
Okay, well, what are
we talking about here?

128
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,687 
Excuse me.

129
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,956 
Sir, I wasn't done
shopping yet.

130
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,528 
I walked out of the door by accident
without paying for those cans...

131
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,456 
...because I was going to check
on my dog. My dog is tied up...

132
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:38,403 
...in front of the store.

133
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:40,534 
Mr. Hunt, it was obvious
what was going on here.

134
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:43,476 
Sir, your employee
has the wrong idea.

135
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,877 
The rules apply
to everyone equally.

136
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:57,418 
If a person can't afford dog food
they shouldn't have a dog.

137
00:20:57,562 --> 00:20:58,688 
Andy.

138
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,693 
Sir, I just made a mistake is all.
I'm very sorry.

139
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:06,435 
This isn't gonna happen again.
I'm really very sorry.

140
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:10,234 
The food is not the issue.
It's about setting an example, right?

141
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:13,468 
I'm not from around here, sir,
I can't be an example.

142
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,013 
We have a policy, ma'am.

143
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:35,755 
Hi, this is Andy Mooney
from Jack's on Lombard.

144
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:59,048 
Sir, my dog is tied
up out front.

145
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:04,928 
- Sir, my dog is tied up outside.
- Just relax.

146
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,864 
Face forward.

147
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:17,775 
Left. Turn to your left.

148
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,551 
Can I get my bag back?

149
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,593 
Not yet.

150
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:49,565 
This machine's gonna kill me.

151
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:51,892 
We've got to do this again.

152
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,732 
Okay.

153
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,039 
Fifty dollars.

154
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,447 
Excuse me?

155
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:39,209 
You can pay your fine now

156
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,181 
or you can come back in two weeks
for a trial with a judge.

157
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:45,547 
Then you can pay
the 50 dollars plus court fees.

158
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:50,824 
I don't live here.
I'm just passing through.

159
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:52,958 
If you get stopped
in another state

160
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:55,522 
you're just gonna end
up right back here.

Lucy!

Lu!

171
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,023 
Has anyone seen a dog?

172
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:35,556 
Excuse me. Has anyone seen a dog?
She was tied out front this morning.

173
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,157 
Yellow-gold.

174
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,661 
You mean like a
German Shepherd or something?

175
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,864 
Medium sized,
yellow-gold in color.

176
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:48,041 
I kind of remember
seeing a white van take a dog.

177
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,214 
You do? What time was that?

178
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:51,906 
Around noon?

179
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,948 
Noon? You didn't
even start work until two.

180
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:56,347 
Could have been later.

181
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:59,145 
Excuse me, a white van,
like a city van?

182
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:01,589 
I don't know.
I could be totally wrong.

183
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,160 
She didn't see anything.

184
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:05,585 
Lucy!

185
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,094 
Lu!

186
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,934

Come here, Lu!

188
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,246 
Lucy!

189
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,280 
Lucy, come out now!

190
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,921 
What are you doing here?

191
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,953 
Looking for my dog. She's gone.
I hope you're real happy.

192
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,258 
Lucy, come!

193
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:03,411 
Lucy!

194
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:11,862 
Come on, girl. Come on out, girl!
Come on, Lu!

195
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:16,723 
Yeah, have a great night, okay?

196
00:28:22,173 --> 00:28:24,733 
You know, your son
is a real hero!

197
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:27,039 
Lucy!

198
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:29,304 
Come now!

199
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,010 
Lucy!

200
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:23,223 
Have you seen my dog?

201
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:26,802 
Not since I saw you. Nope.

202
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,338 
Is that fucking
garage ever open?

203
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,180 
Most days. Yep.

204
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:48,958 
Is there a pound around here? There's
gotta be a pound close by, huh?

205
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:51,756 
Not too far.

206
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:54,258 
You all right, honey?

207
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:59,793 
Yeah. I just need
to get to the pound now.

208
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:01,527 
Well, that's easy.

209
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,007 
You just take the street
right here.

210
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:10,006 
Go straight down till it dead ends
that way about...

211
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:13,447 
...just right till it dead ends, then
you head right about three miles.

212
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:16,820 
You lose your dog,
is that it?

213
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:17,977 
Yeah...

214
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:22,082 
...that's what it looks like.

215
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,887 
That's a shame.
Somewhere around here?

216
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:27,455 
Yeah, that store.

217
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:29,065 
Jack's?

218
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,393 
I'm sure someone's got her.

219
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:34,828 
She couldn't have
gotten too far.

220
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,997 
I was gone kind of
a long time.

221
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:40,870 
I'm sure it wasn't that long.
She'll turn up.

222
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:46,241 
Okay.

223
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,617 
So I just go down this street,
and then I take a right?

224
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:00,529 
I'm pretty sure it's close now. You'll
probably have to wait until morning.

225
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:03,330 
But you know, you can get the
number four right here on the corner.

226
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,335 
It will take you right there.
Starts at six a.m.

227
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:08,598 
I think I'm just
gonna head there now.

228
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:14,504 
It's definitely closed.

229
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:17,075 
Well, fucking Christ!

230
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:23,047 
Well, if she's there she'll be there
in the morning, won't she?

231
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:25,645 
A night in the pound
never hurt anyone.

232
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:34,064 
You know, there's a good hotel
down the road. The Palms.

233
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:36,393 
Really good clean rooms.

234
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,973 
If I see anything
I'll let you know.

235
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:55,884 
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,551 
Hey, Dan.

237
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:01,687 
<i>Wendy? Hold on,</i>
<i>let me turn down the TV.</i>

238
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:06,658 
<i>Where are you?</i>

239
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:09,655 
In Oregon.

240
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:12,101 
<i>Raining?</i>

241
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,900 
Yeah, kind of, sort of.
On and off.

242
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:18,941 
<i>So what's up?</i>

243
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:25,274 
Nothing. I'm just calling.
Just, you know, just...

244
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:28,448 
<i>Nothing?</i>

245
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,047 
The car broke.

246
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:37,716 
I don't know.
It's kind of bad here, actually.

247
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:42,355 
Lucy's lost.

248
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,928 
<i>Who's that?</i>

249
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,299 
<i>It's your sister.</i>
<i>She broke down in Oregon.</i>

250
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,699 
Hi Deb.

251
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:52,167 
<i>0regon?</i>
<i>What does she want us to do about it?</i>

252
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:56,636 
Nothing. I'm just calling.

253
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:58,715 
<i>She's just calling.</i>

254
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:02,714 
<i>We can't do anything. We're strapped.</i>
<i>I don't know what she wants.</i>

255
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,181 
I don't want anything.
I'm just calling.

256
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:07,257 
<i>I can't talk with everyone</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

257
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:10,985 
<i>I'll talk to you when you're</i>
<i>done with Dan. Bye, honey.</i>

258
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:14,020 
<i>Everything's all right?</i>

259
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,763 
Yeah. Everything's great.

260
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:22,295 
You kind of sound like you're busy
over there, so I'm gonna call you later.

261
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:25,135 
<i>All right, if everything's fine.</i>
<i>See ya.</i>

262
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:26,640 
Yeah, see ya, bye.

263
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,134 
Lu!

264
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:33,710 
Luce!

265
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:48,619 
I was usually like
the only white person there.

266
00:34:50,528 --> 00:34:51,620 
That's so weird.

267
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:53,195 
Why does that girl
hate you so much?

268
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:58,164 
I saw the cheerleading squad. Madison's
got some chunky cheerleaders.

269
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,796 
Dude, fuck,
there's a lady in there!

270
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,240 
Your mom's always tired.

271
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,740 
Yeah, my mom's like,
always, always...

272
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,317 
Just a minute!

273
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:42,837 
<i>Good morning. Hello, Amy.</i>

274
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,169 
<i>Hello, Mike.</i>

275
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:46,816 
<i>What is going on</i>
<i>with the traffic?</i>

276
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:51,555 
<i>Well, we have activity on Northeast 53rd Avenue</i>
<i>between Gleason and Irving...</i>

277
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:52,883 
<...so it is closed.>

278
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:20,707 
<i>She's medium sized.</i>

279
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:22,719 
39 pounds.

280
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:26,320 
Yellow-gold in color.
Her name is Lucy.

281
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,451 
I left her tied up to a post

282
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,522 
and then when I got back
she wasn't there anymore.

283
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:33,925 
Well, I don't see
anything here that matches.

284
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:38,429 
But come on, let's go take a look in the
back. You never know. Okay? Follow me.

285
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:50,347 
Okay, so you can go
right around the corner here.

286
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:41,413 
CARROLL WENDY
CANINE FEMALE SPAYED

287
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,537 
Okay, no address?

288
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:58,841 
And no phone either?

289
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:01,968 
No. I mean, no,
not right now.

290
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,781 
I'm just passing through.

291
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:09,575 
Do you have a
previous address?

292
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:13,955 
My sister and her husband.
They live at...

293
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:18,119 
...East, 73 East Jackson...

294
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:23,092 
...Muncie, Indiana, 47603.
You can use that.

295
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,795 
Okay.

296
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:27,964 
Do you think that
you'll find her soon?

297
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,061 
Well...

298
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:34,441 
...you're just gonna have
to keep checking in, okay?

299
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:36,569 
It's gonna be up to you now.

300
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:38,540 
Okay.

301
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:41,814 
Thank you.

302
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,502 
I don't think so.

303
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:43,571 
Okay, just set the Voltmeter
to the DC scale, all right?

304
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:47,476 
Measure the voltage
across the battery terminals.

305
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:51,884 
The volt meter reads
less than 14 volts...

306
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:54,489 
...you know, it should read 14.

307
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:56,052 
Okay?

308
00:40:56,693 --> 00:41:00,060 
If it reads less than 12
you might have a problem.

309
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:04,089 
Okay, tell you what...

310
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,759 
...you turn on the heater...

311
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:09,201 
...you turn on the defogger...

312
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,100 
...you turn on the radio,
and you rev up the motor...

313
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:14,574 
...you're turning on
everything that draws power...

314
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:17,441 
...and then you turn on the
motor, you rev up the motor...

315
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:22,779 
...and if the Voltmeter reads
lower than 14 volts...

316
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:27,686 
...your alternator's probably no
good. Okay? Well, good luck.

317
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,552 
What's up?

318
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:33,789 
Start talking, I'm listening.

319
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:36,660 
I think I've got a problem
with my S-belt.

320
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,023 
What?

321
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:42,733 
With my S-belt. I think my
Serpentine belt is cracked.

322
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,170 
Oh, yeah. Serpentine belt?

323
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,141 
A guy in Salt Lake City said that
he thought it was cracked...

324
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,807 
...and that it would run about
150 dollars for a new one.

325
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:58,247 
You were driving with the air
conditioning on? The engine jerked?

326
00:41:58,555 --> 00:42:00,216 
Steam came out?
That kind of thing?

327
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:04,692 
No. It just won't start.
It just makes this terrible sound.

328
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:09,187 
Yeah?

329
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,501 
Oh, man.

330
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:15,605 
You are blowing my mind.

331
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,837 
You are messing up my mind.

332
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:21,575 
Okay, I'll tell you what.

333
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:23,612 
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:26,774 
50 on Trade Show.

335
00:42:27,518 --> 00:42:28,985 
No, that's it.

336
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:34,648 
Yeah, yeah, I said, you know, you're
really messing with my mind, man.

337
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:36,650 
Yeah, okay.

338
00:42:37,094 --> 00:42:39,255 
Yeah. I'll see you later.

339
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:46,326 
What kind of car
are we talking about?

340
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:48,862 
Well, it's an Accord.

341
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,769 
1988. It's right over there.

342
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,601 
Well...

343
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:55,868 
Easy enough to replace
the Serpentine belt.

344
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:57,638 
I don't know why
the ignition won't fire, though.

345
00:42:57,781 --> 00:42:59,806 
Who knows.
Could be the timing belt.

346
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:03,277 
How much is a new
Serpentine belt?

347
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:06,883 
A hundred bucks.

348
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:11,320 
125. Depends if we have to order a
new one. I'll have to check stock.

349
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:15,063 
And it'll be 50 for labor.

350
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,895 
That's the best you'll find.
I promise that.

351
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:22,563 
Okay. And what about a timing
belt? How much is that?

352
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:26,775 
Could be a little bit more, but I
won't know until I have a look.

353
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:28,935 
Okay.

354
00:43:29,146 --> 00:43:33,742 
And we're going to have to tow it
over, I guess. That adds another 50.

355
00:43:36,253 --> 00:43:37,948 
But it's just right there.

356
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:42,315 
Well, it's always 50. But there's
no mileage here. So it's just 50.

357
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,099 
30 bucks.
I'll give you a deal...

358
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,659 
Yeah.

359
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,472 
How's the dog?

360
00:45:45,282 --> 00:45:46,840 
No news.

361
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,213 
No luck at the pound?

362
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:52,388 
Not yet.

363
00:45:56,226 --> 00:45:59,491 
I had a Collie once that was gone for
two weeks before he came home.

364
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:03,294 
They'll find her.
They always get their dog.

365
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,963 
Yeah, I sure hope so.

366
00:46:08,405 --> 00:46:13,240 
Could I trade you for a quarter? I need
to use that pay phone over there.

367
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:16,540 
All I've got is change
and it only takes quarters.

368
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,538 
Lots of minutes. Feel free.

369
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:19,838 
No, no.

370
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:22,247 
No one uses a pay phone anymore.
Come on.

371
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:28,990 
Thanks.

372
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:50,811 
Hi, my name is Wendy Carroll.
I lost my dog Lucy and I...

373
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:54,981 
Yeah, yeah, hi.

374
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:59,444 
I was just calling to check and see
if there was any new information.

375
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:09,361 
Okay, all right, I understand. I'll keep
checking. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

376
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,353 
How late are you
here tonight?

377
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:33,479 
Eight o'clock.
Eight to eight.

378
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:34,487 
Okay.

379
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,824 
Better than my last job.
I'll tell you that.

380
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:41,053 
That was all night,
every night.

381
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:45,831 
Not a lot of jobs
around here, huh?

382
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:47,530 
I'll say.

383
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:50,038 
I don't know what
the people do all day.

384
00:47:51,174 --> 00:47:54,610 
Use to be a mill. But that's
been closed a long time now.

385
00:47:55,445 --> 00:47:56,605 
Don't know what they do.

386
00:48:02,052 --> 00:48:04,885 
You can't get a job
without an address anyway...

387
00:48:05,388 --> 00:48:07,049 
...or a phone.

388
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,353 
You can't get an address
without an address.

389
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:11,420 
You can't get a job
without a job.

390
00:48:11,928 --> 00:48:13,327 
It's all fixed.

391
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:15,657 
That's why I'm going to Alaska.

392
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:20,199 
I hear they need people.

393
00:48:21,338 --> 00:48:23,101 
I hear it's really
pretty up there.

394
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,332 
Yeah.

395
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,542 
You know, if you need a contact
for the pound or anything...

396
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,239 
...I'm just standing here with my
hands in my pockets all day.

397
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:37,586 
You can use my phone
number if you like, you know.

398
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:41,218 
Yeah.

399
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,995 
I might do that.
That'd be good.

400
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,917 
floppy ears   sharp eyes
yellowish-brown   friendly face

401
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,308 
I'm L0ST!!!

402
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:47,012 
You lost your dog?

403
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,322 
Wow, bummer.

404
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:51,457 
Wow, where did you lose it?

405
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:54,587 
You don't know? Well, I guess if you
knew, you'd know where to find it.

406
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:56,028 
Yeah, I guess so.

407
00:49:56,132 --> 00:49:59,192 
Well, that's too bad. If I see it,
I'll give you a call. Good luck.

408
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:01,065 
Thanks. Appreciate that.

409
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:56,089 
Lucy!

410
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:11,765 
Anything?

411
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:13,639 
Afraid not.

412
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:18,137 
They came and rolled your
car away about an hour ago.

413
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:25,218 
You know, I was remembering today,
when I was a boy I'd go hunting...

414
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:27,555 
...and sometimes we'd lose the hound...

415
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,488 
...so my daddy would take his
coat and leave it in the woods...

416
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:33,391 
...the last place that he saw the dog.

417
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:37,226 
And after supper he'd come
back to fetch the coat...

418
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:41,660 
...and more often than not he'd
come back with the dog as well.

419
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,502 
Could I use that phone again?

420
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:46,836 
Sure.

421
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:50,268 
Thank you.

422
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:03,820 
Hello, I'm calling to check on a dog
that I reported missing. Lucy.

423
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:09,899 
Yeah, sorry, I've just been away from my
phone and so I thought I would check.

424
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,527 
Okay.

425
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,461 
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

426
00:52:22,846 --> 00:52:24,438 
Wait.

427
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,716 
Did you say that the dog would,
the dog came back to a coat?

428
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,446 
Yes, indeed.

429
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,111 
That's how I remember it.

430
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:09,590 
Lucy!

431
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:13,921 
Lu!

432
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:40,314 
Lu?

433
00:54:52,328 --> 00:54:54,296 
Please, please, please.

434
00:56:13,343 --> 00:56:14,674 
Man.

435
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,715 
Don't look at me.

436
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:08,828 
This is a steep hill, huh?

437
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:11,657 
Ain't it?

438
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:16,438 
Those kids coming down
on a cardboard...

439
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:18,667 
...they're having some fun.

440
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:24,090 
Of course if that cardboard
wasn't so worn and old, you know,

441
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:26,508 
they'd slide better, right?

442
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:46,033 
I don't like this place.

443
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:51,606 
You know, it's the
fucking people.

444
00:57:52,175 --> 00:57:54,200 
The fucking people
that bother me.

445
00:57:55,778 --> 00:57:57,177 
God, they have attitude.

446
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:02,942 
I mean...

447
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:09,049 
...I'm out here...

448
00:58:10,526 --> 00:58:12,551 
...just trying to be a good boy...

449
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,922 
...and it's just like
they don't want to let me...

450
00:58:18,468 --> 00:58:19,730 
...you know?

451
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:25,974 
I mean, they treat me like
trash, like I ain't got no rights.

452
00:58:30,213 --> 00:58:31,680 
I mean...

453
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:35,911 
...they can smell the weakness on you.

454
00:58:37,787 --> 00:58:40,847 
Move it along, move it along.
Fuck you.

455
00:58:41,123 --> 00:58:43,182 
You know? Fuck you!

456
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:50,031 
I mean, they gotta know I've killed
over 700 people with my bare hands.

457
00:59:00,643 --> 00:59:02,270 
We lost, man.

458
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:08,141 
Fuck if I know.

459
01:00:55,658 --> 01:00:57,683 
Hang on, girl.

460
01:00:58,294 --> 01:00:59,727 
I'm coming.

461
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:28,179 
You look a little stricken.

462
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:30,911 
I've been here since eight.
Where have you been?

463
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:34,181 
I had to take Holly's son
to school.

464
01:02:34,323 --> 01:02:36,223 
It's my day off today too.

465
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:40,020 
You got a call after you left
here last night. The pound.

466
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:41,285 
Really?

467
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:43,220 
Yes, indeed.

468
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:58,070 
Hi, this is
Wendy Carroll calling.

469
01:02:58,247 --> 01:03:01,239 
I got a message from you all
last night about my dog Lucy.

470
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:09,122 
Are you positive?

471
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:19,526 
Okay, where is she exactly?

472
01:03:22,104 --> 01:03:24,265 
Where the 30 meets Leaf...

473
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:27,975 
Where the 30 meets
Leaf Erickson.

474
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:36,284 
Okay, well, I'll be there right
away. Thank you very much.

475
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:37,985 
Yep. Bye-bye.

476
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:41,513 
All right? Good news?

477
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:45,055 
Yeah. That's good news,
that's good news.

478
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:46,423 
Great.

479
01:03:46,562 --> 01:03:48,359 
Someone took her home.

480
01:03:49,165 --> 01:03:50,832 
Someone took her home
the day she came in

481
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,896 
and that's why they had
such a hard time finding her.

482
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:54,296 
She's in a foster home.

483
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:59,271 
Great. I told you they would find
her. Let that go on the record.

484
01:03:59,408 --> 01:04:01,069 
It's on the record.

485
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:05,145 
So, that's it, huh?
You're gonna be pulling out?

486
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:06,474 
Uh-huh, that's the plan.

487
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:09,148 
Well, I hope it all works out.

488
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:10,580 
I know it will.

489
01:04:15,457 --> 01:04:18,153 
I want you to take this.
Don't argue.

490
01:04:18,928 --> 01:04:20,156 
Just don't argue.

491
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:22,024 
Don't let Holly see. Just...

492
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:28,893 
If you ever come by here again,
you just stop by and say hi, huh?

493
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:32,430 
Thank you. I will.

494
01:04:35,044 --> 01:04:36,033 
Okay.

495
01:04:36,178 --> 01:04:37,406 
Bye-bye.

496
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:57,928 
Ferry Running Times

497
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:28,960 
Finally.

498
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:44,975 
- Good morning.
- Morning.

499
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:47,512 
You're up early.

500
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,679 
You want some coffee?
I think the first pot's ready.

501
01:05:57,126 --> 01:06:01,563 
Yeah, Indiana plates.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

502
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:06,566 
Got a long way to go, too.

503
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:10,704 
Well, the guy was right
about the serpentine belt.

504
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:12,906 
It's cracked
all over the place.

505
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:15,033 
Just a matter of time
before the car gave out on you.

506
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,007 
Yeah, that's what he said.

507
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:19,706 
He wasn't all wrong,
but he wasn't all right either.

508
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:23,582 
The serpentine belt is worn out, but
that's not why the car won't start.

509
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:24,686 
No?

510
01:06:25,154 --> 01:06:26,951 
You've got milky oil.

511
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:32,118 
I didn't ask you
to check the oil.

512
01:06:32,728 --> 01:06:36,721 
I'm just telling you.
Look, you snapped a piston rod.

513
01:06:37,032 --> 01:06:38,693 
Actually, you blew
the head gasket first...

514
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:41,697 
...water got into the cylinder
probably when you cooled it down.

515
01:06:42,004 --> 01:06:44,564 
The rod can't compress
the fluid then.

516
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:48,143 
And there you go, you ended up
with what they call "Hydro lock".

517
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:54,310 
And if you want the car to drive again,
you'd have to rebuild the whole engine.

518
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,933 
Honestly, I don't think
it's what you want to do.

519
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:59,282 
It would end up costing
more than the car is worth.

520
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:05,354 
Yeah?

521
01:07:05,661 --> 01:07:08,095 
No, I couldn't get
around to it yesterday.

522
01:07:08,464 --> 01:07:10,455 
Can you call me back later?

523
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,358 
Righto. Bye.

524
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:16,994 
Are you sure?

525
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,630 
Yeah. No question.

526
01:07:27,216 --> 01:07:28,683 
How much?

527
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:30,481 
To fix it?

528
01:07:32,354 --> 01:07:33,651 
Two thousand.

529
01:07:35,224 --> 01:07:36,782 
At least two thousand.

530
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:39,603 
Like I said, more than the car's worth.
On the other hand,

531
01:07:39,613 --> 01:07:40,662 
it's less than a new car.

532
01:07:49,304 --> 01:07:54,241 
Look, I know this is bad news. It's
not what anyone ever wants to hear.

533
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,766 
But see, the thing is,
the car's taking up space out there

534
01:07:56,776 --> 01:07:58,809 
and I need to know
what to do with it.

535
01:08:01,216 --> 01:08:04,413 
I'll tell you what, just make it 30
bucks for the tow, for the...

536
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:08,386 
...to junk it, and we'll take care
of everything and that'll be it.

537
01:08:08,557 --> 01:08:11,253 
It's just that I can't just leave the
car sitting out there, it's gotta go.

538
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:41,723 
Okay. This is good here.

539
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:58,161 
Thank you.

540
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:52,847 
Hey, Lu.

541
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:58,021 
Hey, Lu!
Did you miss me? Huh?

542
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:00,256 
You miss me? Huh?

543
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:05,924 
You miss me? Huh? Come here,
Luce. Come here. Did you miss me?

544
01:11:06,268 --> 01:11:07,496 
I'm sorry. Come here.

545
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:17,534 
I know, I know.

546
01:11:19,681 --> 01:11:21,546 
Come on, Lu, don't be mad.

547
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:26,876 
Here.

548
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,285 
I got you something.

549
01:11:32,427 --> 01:11:33,894 
Look at that.

550
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:37,330 
Go get it.

551
01:11:37,766 --> 01:11:39,324 
Good girl!

552
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:42,735 
You're such a good
catcher, huh? Drop it.

553
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,862 
Yes, such a good dog.

554
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,309 
Go get it, Lu.
Go get that stick.

555
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,475 
Good dog.

556
01:11:50,612 --> 01:11:52,341 
You are the best catcher.

557
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,612 
Drop it, Lu.

558
01:11:57,853 --> 01:12:00,481 
Lu. Lu, give me that stick.

559
01:12:00,622 --> 01:12:03,489 
Give me that stick, Lu.
Give me that stick.

560
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:05,991 
Drop it. Good dog!

561
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:08,362 
Good girl.

562
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:12,900 
It's so nice here, Lu.

563
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:27,379 
That man seems nice.

564
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:38,925 
Yeah, you got a nice yard.

565
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:49,031 
I'm sorry, Lu.

566
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,777 
I lost the car.

567
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,095 
You be good.

568
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:24,970 
I'll come back.

569
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,569 
I'm gonna make some money
and I'll come back.

570
01:13:36,685 --> 01:13:37,982 
Okay, Lu?

571
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:40,416 
Be good.
