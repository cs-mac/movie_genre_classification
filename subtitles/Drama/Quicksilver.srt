1
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:40,575
The market is higher
with the Dow-Jones industrials
up one and a half points.

2
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:44,879
On the commodities market,
grain closed higher
with November fixings at .03.

3
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,791
Three dollars
and seventy-five cents.

4
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:59,794
That's down 25 cents
from yesterday's close.

5
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:03,064
London silver is up one cent
to 6.08 cents, and the dollar...

6
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,534
Hey, hey!
See that guy up there?

7
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,036
Here's $50 if you can beat him
past the station.

8
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,780
All right, let's go, let's go!

00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,014
%% nothing at all %%

26
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,231
Thanks a lot.
I'm gonna walk.

27
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,873
Listen, I've got an hour,
m-maybe... maybe two.

28
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,577
I'm gonna sell every option
I can get, steal or invent.

29
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,746
I don't know, Jack.
I'm scared.

30
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,081
Yeah, I got it covered.
Be sure, okay?

31
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,451
Okay. Relax, man.
All right.
I'll see you over there.

32
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,453
Okay.

33
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,629
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?

34
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,703
<i>I've got these 30s</i>
<i>at three dollars!</i>

35
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,808
I'll accept these 30s
at two and three quarters.

36
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,277
Buy 250,
two and three quarters.

37
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,347
Sold! Sold! Sold!

38
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,352
Sold at two and a half!
Sold! Sold!

39
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,858
Three hundred fifty...
three hundred seventy dollars.

40
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,928
We had it split for 300!
Sold!

41
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:49,831
Don't worry!
Hey, Jack,
what are you doin'?

42
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:52,867
I know what I'm doin'.
I know what I'm doin'.

43
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,138
- Sold at a quarter.
- Cancel my bid!

44
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:59,674
<i>Sold at a quarter!</i>

45
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,344
Sold at a quarter.
Hey, where is everybody?

46
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:05,680
<i>Where are my buyers?</i>
<i>This is it. This is it.</i>

47
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,915
Sold at a quarter.

48
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,253
- What's goin' on?
- quarter bid. Buy 20!

49
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,322
You got it. You got it.

50
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,525
What are you doin'?
Too low. Too low.
Cancel my stock.

51
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,961
Did you see
the way they were buyin'?

52
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:23,398
Relax, Gabe. The market
doesn't close for another hour.
Excuse me, guys.

53
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,834
Say, Jack, if Semco
moves one goddamn point up,

54
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:28,202
It's four million in margin
we're liable for.

55
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,439
It'll slide down.
What about Bressler? Didn't
they position with us?

56
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,842
No.
No? Sullivan?

57
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,444
It's like we got the goddamn
clap all of a sudden.

58
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,446
Whiskey, rocks
and club soda.
Jack.

59
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,448
Hi. How ya doin'?
How are you?

60
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:43,284
Well, Marcus will stand by us
if we lose a point or two.

61
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:46,388
He said he's thinking about it.
Semco's still trading.

62
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:49,056
He said he didn't know.
He said he didn't know?

63
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:52,427
Shhh.
Geez, that
son of a bitch!

64
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,196
We started him.
He owes us.

65
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:58,383
Come on. Table.

66
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,669
So the guy says to me,
"the horse was gelded late."
what do I know?

67
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:04,972
He said the horse
was gelded <i>light.</i>
<i>I'm thinking to myself...</i>

68
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,876
yes?

69
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:11,245
Mr. Casey,
telephone call.
Thank you.

70
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:16,050
Excuse me.

71
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,157
Sam.

72
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,194
Thank you.

73
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,196
Hello?

74
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,198
Yeah.

75
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,470
What about Marcus?

76
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay. Thank you.

77
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:42,977
Jack.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,549
The buyout took place.
Semco just closed at 30.

79
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,542
Mom?

80
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,483
Dad?

81
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:27,589
What is it, son?

82
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:32,594
Uh, dad, we've, um...
We've had some trouble.

83
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:37,398
See, we... we had this deal
that was goin', and, uh,

84
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:41,002
We were sellin' very heavily
on, on, on margin.

85
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:44,038
We didn't expect
this buyout to happen,

86
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,475
Which, unfortunately,
it did, and...

87
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:50,111
How bad is it, son?

88
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,113
Bad.

89
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,251
I lost it all.

90
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,356
Everything.

91
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:06,761
And you and mom...
your savings.

92
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,268
Oh, Jesus.

93
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:28,550
Hey! We're Caseys.
We can take a punch, right?

94
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:31,485
There'll be other days, son.

95
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,324
I was just
gonna make a sandwich.

96
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:41,262
Nice, nice roast beef.
Salt and pepper, mayonnaise.

97
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:45,132
Join me?
No. No, I can't, thanks.

98
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,469
Come on.
Your mother'll be right back
from the beauty parlor.

99
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,072
She'll be mad if you leave
without seeing her.

100
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,341
No, no, I got a taxi waitin',
and I got some other people
I gotta...

101
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,477
I got some things...
I can't.

102
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,585
Don't you worry about us, son.

103
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,293
You're gonna take a minute,
catch your breath,
get right back.

104
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,163
Right?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure.

105
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,936
Won't change your mind?

106
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,938
No, I gotta go.

107
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,434
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

108
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,473
falcons leading six to nothing,

109
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,276
And it's the wildcats' ball now
on their own 20-yard line...

110
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:06,380
As Norm Shutter, the quarterback,
spinning and handing off
to carnie foster.

111
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:10,184
He's loose at the 25, 30, 35...
he may go all the way.

112
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,221
40, 45, midfield stripe,
45, 40, 35, 30...

113
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,392
Carnie foster.
25, 20, 15, 10, 5...

114
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,394
Touchdown, wildcats.

115
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:25,099
An 80-yard run by carnie foster,
and this game is all tied up,

116
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:29,037
Six and six,
wildcats and falcons.

117
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,287
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

118
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,657
Hey, watch it!

119
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:09,430
<i>what are you doin'? Hey, easy!</i>

120
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,612
Son of a bitch!

121
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:32,286
<i>quicksilver.</i>

122
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,521

That's Apache.

123
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,160
<i>Before he got here, he</i>
<i>used to work for the mayor.</i>
<i>That's right, the mayor.</i>

124
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:42,897
Shortstop! Get over here.
I got one for you.

125
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,467
Seventh avenue,
two together. Go, shortstop.
Yes, that's right, sir.

126
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,771
Over there, that's France...
tour de France.
You know what he does?

127
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,574
he's a ballet dancer.

128
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,943
Really.
That's Teddy bear
and airborne.

129
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,146
Airborne over there was gonna be
the middleweight champion.

130
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,582
<i>Teddy bear's just saving up</i>
<i>to go back to college.</i>

131
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:06,153
Educated and dedicated. They
used to be college professors.

132
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,541
The rest of 'em around here
are just come and go's.

133
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,791
They come, try to ride
a couple of days,

134
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,294
They can't hack it, so they go.

135
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:16,364
Come and go's.

136
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:19,666
Don't worry, I'll hack it.

137

%%

138
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,843
They harpooned you
again, peewee.

139
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,247
Hey, Hector, a little
present for you... new pen.

140
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:39,486
So where are you from?
Different places.

141
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,356
Oh, yeah?
Like where?

142
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:46,560
Uh, Chicago, Detroit,
Denver. My family,
we moved around a lot.

143
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:50,331
Hmm.
<i>Yeah, my father's</i>
<i>in the air force.</i>

144
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,733
He's a jet pilot.

145
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:56,203
Yeah? No kiddin'?
Yeah.
He won a medal once.

146
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:59,606
Yeah, for savin' his
buddies in a plane crash.
They went down in the war.

147
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:02,376
<i>His arms were all burned,</i>
<i>and his hair too.</i>

148
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:05,846
That's why he
doesn't have eyebrows.
They never grew back.

149
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:08,449
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm sorry.

150
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:14,121
So, if you're gonna work here,
you're gonna need some wheels.

151
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:18,059
Tell you what.
Have this beauty right here.

152
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,694
It's in perfect shape,
brand-new tires.

153
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:23,730
And for 50 bucks,
I'll throw in the bag.

154
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't have 50 bucks.

155
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,002
What do you have?

156
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,308
I got ten.
Ten?

157
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:42,049
Five down, five a week...
Till you pay me 55.

158
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:46,954
You just said 50!
Yeah, but on time payments,
you pay interest.

159
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,756
I know that much.

160
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:51,925
Okay.

161
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,636
Ooh, man,
it's a mean machine.
Yo, look, don't touch.

162
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,671
Okay, man.
I won't touch your bike.

163
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:07,674
What you doin'
with these chicken bones
around your neck?

164
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:10,111
Hey, man, be more respectful
of your African heritage.

165
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:18,619
Youngblood, I want coffee.
I want it light.

Money, money, money.

169
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,399
He makes all that money
bein' a messenger?

170
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:35,136
Yeah, well,
he's not too particular
what he carries...

171
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:37,138
<i>And for who.</i>

Yo. I'll check.

Huh?

You deliver short, hustle
my customers for yourself?

244
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:42,563
Wait a minute.
What you talkin' about?
You don't work for me no more.

245
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,500
Go back to bumpin' envelopes.

246
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,535
Disappear.

247
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,540
The street is free
enterprise, gypsy.

248
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,976
<i>You work your side.</i>

249

251
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,836
Hey.

252
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:42,856
Emilio, let me have a hot dog
with everything on it...

253
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:45,693
<i>And a vegetarian</i>
<i>for my friend here.</i>

254

255
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,465
Look at the wheels.
They're new.

256
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,767
Yeah, well, almost new.

257
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:56,069
And dig, man,
it's got two sections.

258
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,039
Got your hot dogs,
got your ices.

259
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,608
The umbrella...
I'd get rid of that.

260
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:04,144

Thank you.

uh-huh. Uh-huh.

262
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,583
So what do you think, man?
You know what I think?

263
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,021
I think you're gonna get
flat feet standin' in one place.

264
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:17,591
Ah, there's
no future on a bike.

265
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,395
You fall, you get hurt,
can't work, no money.

266
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:25,466
Look, I want something
to look forward to.

267
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:28,268
Can't stay on a bike
forever, man.

268
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:37,442
Seventh avenue,
two of 'em, shortstop.
Go ahead.

269
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,046

never kick a door down,
not my guys.

00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,383

308
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,619

you blow my mind %%

309
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:02,489

310
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:05,058
%% and shine on me %%

311
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,995
%% my sunny day %%

312
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:11,398
Come on, fellas.
Back to work.

313
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,782
Anyway, I see interest rates
going down.

314
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,985
The fed is expanding
the money supply,

315
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:35,923
So I would move
to decrease our cash position,
increase stock equity.

316
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,191
Yeah, but not yet.

317
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:41,194
Interest rates will bump
a few more points first.

318
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:44,932
I'd buy high tech...
IBM, Teledyne. What?

319
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,267
That's what
old man Anderson said.

320
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:50,537
I wasn't sure.
Now I am.

321
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,776
Listen, Jack.

322
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:59,980
I want to be straight with you.
Anderson wants to back us.

323
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,884
But it's you they really want.
I'm just part of the package.

324
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,519
I mean, not that I'm not good.

325
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,723
I make that jerk Anderson
look like a hero.

326
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,325
But I don't have
half of what you have.

327
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:17,197
You had the touch, Jack.

328
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,905
Anyway, he'll back us
a hundred percent.

329
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:28,141
I spoke to the lawyers,
Burke and Blum.
They're the best.

330
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:32,212
Two years, three years tops,
we buy out Anderson's interest.

331
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,815
And, Jack, we'd be back
in business our way.

332
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:38,819
Gabe, I'm happy for you.
I am. But... I can't.

333
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,989
- What do you mean, can't?
- Look, you're my friend.

334
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:46,392
The best. And I know you
want it to be like it was,
but it's not for me.

335
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,394
Not now.

336
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:52,365
You're telling me that driving
a bike, delivering junk,
that's for you?

337
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,602
I don't believe it, Jack.
I don't.

338
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,244
If not now, Jack, when?

339
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:07,313
Gabe, don't you understand?
I don't have it anymore.

340
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,374
I don't have the nerve.

341
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:24,114
Okay, you see, that was my...

342
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,383
That's what drove me.

343
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,821
And it went that day.

344
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:36,993
I don't know where it went,
you know, but it's gone.

345
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,535
And, you see, now all
I'm responsible for is me.

346
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,271
Okay? I pick up here,
I deliver there.
It's simple.

347
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,274
Nobody worries.
Nobody gets hurt.

348
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,543
I pay my rent.

349
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,347
I got a couple extra bucks.
If I need more, I work
a few more runs.

350
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:06,256
And when I'm on the street,
I feel good, man.

351
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:11,227
I feel... Good.
I feel... Exhilarated.

352
00:32:12,729 --> 00:32:15,265
I go as fast as I like,
faster than anyone.

353
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,701
A street sign says
"one way, east," I go west.
They can't touch me.

354
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,773
When I'm on a bike,
I forget about...

355
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,108
Well, I don't know. I...

356
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,949
Hey, no, no, no, no.
No, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

357
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,522
Thanks for the coffee.

358
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,171
Hey, what's that mean
right there, Jack?

359
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,341
Collateral.
Right. What's
"collateral" mean?

360
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,579
What's this?
"loan application."
what are you doin'?

361
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:07,149
I'm borrowing some money.
Well, you know, for the cart.

362
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,152
Ahhh.

363
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,222
So?

364
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:14,224
So what?

365
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,559
So what does "collateral"
mean exactly?

366
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,529
It means you ain't
gettin' no loan.

367
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,533
What it means is,
you've gotta have capital goods.

368
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,068
- Capital goods?
- Yeah.

369
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,272
Something that is worth
the same amount or more
than the principle.

370
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,875
The principle is the amount
of money you want to borrow.
Seven grand.

371
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:35,578
Yeah, right. You got
something worth $7,000?

372
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,047
Oh, yeah.
His pretty ass on the street.

373
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,516
let me get this straight.

374
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:45,054
You mean I gotta have
something worth seven Gs if
I want to <i>borrow</i> seven Gs?

375
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:48,190
- Right.
- Shit, if I had something
worth seven grand,

376
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,420
What the hell would I need
to ask the bank for?

377
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,129
Well, it's a little
more complicated than that.

378
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:57,467
Don't you understand, brother,
that you's a spick, a beaner?

379
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,403
I mean, ain't gonna be
no white shirt and tie for you.

380
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,640
<i>It takes it to get it.</i>
<i>The man says,</i>

381
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:06,309
"if you don't have it,
then you ain't gonna get it."

382
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,779
It ain't the man
that steals your future.
It's your bitterness.

383
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,048
Oh! Oh, I guess I'm just
a dumb ol' uptown nigger.

384
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:15,885
I don't know nothin' about
what Jack here knows, right?

385
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,887
Right.

386
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,123
Well, if that's the case,
and Jack is so smart,

387
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,459
Then what's he doin' here?

388
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:26,829
Hey... hey, voodoo, you got
somethin' to say to me?

389
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:31,301
- I say you full of shit, Jack.

390
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:35,772
I say he'll beat
your ass on any street,
any day of the week.

391
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,241
Oh, yeah? Well, where
did you hear this? I want
to know how you knew that.

392
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,679
Because your big mouth
would catch too much wind,
that's why.

393
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,518
All right, flyboy.

394
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:52,655
money talks...

395
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,025
And bullshit walks.

396
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:59,595
Hey, hey, hey. Check it out.
It's on the table, man.

397
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:02,632
- Hey, I'll take some of that.
- Yeah!

398
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,935
hey, voodoo, we down.

399
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:08,938
Hey, where are you
going, Jack?
Look, Hector.

400
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:13,209
This is a job, okay?
It's not a game. I got
deliveries to make.

401
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:16,512
Hey, but the fellas,
they got the money down on you.

402
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,151
<i>I got a cheese sandwich</i>
<i>and a coffee.</i>

403
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:25,655
<i>You can give the change</i>
<i>to Bernadette, all right?</i>

404
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,524
Okay.

405
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,461
Hey, watch it!

406
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:43,733
Yo! One side!

407
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,735
Hey!

408
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:55,110
what's the matter with you?

409
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:59,081
What are you doing riding
on the sidewalk? Are you crazy?

410
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:03,553
Wait a second! I gotta

- Voodoo!

431
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:38,474
I'm tellin' you, Jack,
forget about it.

432
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,644
You're messin' in something
you don't know nothin' about.

433
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,280
All I'm sayin' is...
He could've avoided him.

434
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:48,651
He could've.
I was there, man.
He ran him down for nothin'.

435
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,854
Not just for nothin'.

436
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,390
Voodoo was known to carry
product for some people.

437
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:59,061
- Yeah, to gypsy.
- I don't know who.

438
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,664
He doesn't know who.

439
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,166
The brothers know who.

440
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,335
I don't wanna know who.

441
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:13,242
Voodoo stepped
into that meat grinder because
he wanted the fast money.

442
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,244
He volunteered.

443
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,082
Just be happy
it wasn't a closer race...

444
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,852
Or there would've been
two funerals.

445
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,854
Dig?

446
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,771
<i>yeah. Quicksilver.</i>

447
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,274
Oh, yeah. Sure.
She's still with us.

448
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,611
Right. Uh-huh.
You got it.

449
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,613
Terri?
What?

450
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,315
Terri, you got
a command performance.

451
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,618
2829 grand.

452
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,821
- What's a command performance?
- That means you did a good job.

453
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,224
They asked for you by name.

454
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,391
Terri.

455
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,861
- Come here.
- I can't. I'm working.

456
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:43,399
Yeah, 2829 grand.
That's me. Come here.

457
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,678
You know where this is?

458
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,680
<i>Yeah.</i>

459
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,150
Yeah? You didn't look
at the address.

460
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,122
- 21 west 88th street.
- Know where that is?

461
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,392
Yeah, it's off the park.
What do you need me for?
You got a car.

462
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,828
You wanna conduct an interview,
or do you wanna work?

463
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:16,566
I was just...
look, Terri.

464
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,935
I'll find someone else.
Give it back.

465
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:22,137
No, that's all right.
I'll do it. I-I'm sorry.

466
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,143
Terri.

467
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,813
I'll call you
from time to time.

468
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,684
<i>I call... You come.</i>

469
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,120
%%

470
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,608
Thank you, Maria.

471
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,512
So?
So it's all there.

472
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,715
All right.

473
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:30,519
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. You don't
have the money yet.

474
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:34,957
<i>All you got there</i>
<i>is a neatly typed</i>
<i>loan application.</i>

475
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,294
What I got here is a Chance...
a Chance at somethin' better.

476
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:42,298
Yeah, we'll see.
Friday, huh?

477
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,300
Yeah.

478
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:46,836
Hey, Jack, I'm telling you,
this is just the beginning.

479
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:49,905
This cart is just number one.

480
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,475
I'm gonna work hard.
I'm gonna watch the money.

481
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:57,679
Pretty soon two,
then three, then four.

482
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,649
Who knows? Five, six.

483
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:04,653
You're gonna see "Hector."

484
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,655
That's my dream.

485
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:13,996
Well, you know, Hector,
sometimes things don't
work out the way you plan.

486
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,531
I mean, they can
backfire on you...

487
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,901
Knock you lower
than where you started.

488
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,171
Jack, when you come
from around here, ain't
no place to go but up.

489
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,275
Jesus, man, you are
one optimistic Mexican.

490
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:47,296
Listen, Hec,
uh... When you go to see
the loan officer on Friday,

491
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,400
Wear something nice,
like a suit.

492
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:58,274
Dress like a winner...
Be a winner.

493
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:00,109
Right.

494
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,658
Hi, Jack.
Hello, pat.
I got a pickup for Macy.

495
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:21,797
Thank you.

496
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,775
Uh-huh.

497
00:48:39,782 --> 00:48:42,818
Five, four, three, two, one.

498
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:05,474
Hey, Terri!

499
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,844
Hey, what the hell
are you doin'?
Hey, you moron!

500
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:11,146
Whoa! Ohh!

501
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,588
You okay?
Let me see that.
Yeah.

502
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:22,891
No sweat. I'm okay.
Let me see it. Come on,
come on, come on.

503
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,260
Whoa.

504
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:29,398
All right, uh...
here, look.

505
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,633
Put this around...
yeah.

506
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:34,336
Ju-just hold it
there, okay?

507
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,841
So, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

508
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,216
Who's gonna fix
your bike?
I'll take care of it.

509
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:49,763
You know how
to reset a wheel?
Yeah.

510
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,390
No.

511
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:57,026
You don't have a bike,
you don't work.

512
00:49:57,093 --> 00:49:59,428
You know? You don't work,
you don't get paid.

513
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,897
There's no workman's comp...
yeah, I don't need
a lecture, okay?

514
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:04,699
I told you I'll take care of it,
I'll take care of it.

515
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:08,904
Thank you very much.
I appreciate what you've done.
Okay?

516
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:11,806
What are you doin'?
I told you I'd take care of it.

517
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:13,808
Come on, tough guy.

518
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,133
How come it's so empty in here?

519
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,969
Less to miss.

520
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:56,785
Ah! Ah, this is you, isn't it?

521
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:59,654
Hector said you were some kind
of big head honcho once.

522
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:02,958
No one knew
what you were, but...
is that what Hector said?

523
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:06,095
Well, you know Hector.
He likes... he likes myths.

524
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:09,198
What he doesn't find,
he invents.

525
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,903
Were you?

526
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,872
Was I what?
Were you rich?

527
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,513
You look like you were.

528
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,583
Oh, yeah?
What does rich look like?

529
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,621
suntan at Christmastime.

530
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:37,025
Yeah, always smiling
'cause there's nothin'
ever to worry about.

531
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:41,130
You know, like on TV
on those commercials.
They're always smiling.

532
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,536
What happened
to all of it?
To all of what?

533
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,538
To all that money.

534
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:54,543
Nothing happened to it.
The money's still there. It just
belongs to somebody else now.

535
00:51:56,912 --> 00:52:00,349
If I had it,
I'd never lose it. No way.

536
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,536
You can lose anything in life.

537
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:09,158
Well... There you go.

538
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:12,427
Thanks.

539
00:52:13,996 --> 00:52:15,930
So, you makin' any money?

540
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:18,467
I'm doing all right.

541
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,736
Yeah, well,
the reason I ask is...

542
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:24,473
Being a messenger isn't
for everybody, you know.

543
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,475
I'm doin' fine.

544
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,477
Okay.

545
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,912
It's just that, uh...

546
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,216
There are other jobs that'd be
a little easier on the bones...

547
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,218
Say, waitressing.

548
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,921
I don't like waiting
on people. I don't like
touching their food.

549
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:46,428
Look, Terri, let me try
to explain this, okay?

550
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,165
There are people out there
who use messengers...

551
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,468
To do their dirty work.

552
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:57,005
You know?
So it's our ass
instead of theirs.

553
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:01,976
- You know what
I'm talkin' about?
- Yeah, I do. It's cool.

554
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:03,978
Okay.

555
00:53:10,986 --> 00:53:13,154
What are you doin'?

556
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,157
I'm oiling my chain.
Why?

557
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:19,094
Make it go faster.
It does?

558
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,096
Yeah.
Hmm.

559
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:23,998
- You livin' with your folks?
- No, I live with a friend...

560
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:28,437
A girlfriend of mine.

561
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:31,607
Your family here in the city?

562
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:33,609
Yeah.

563
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:36,445
No, actually, my parents
like to travel a lot.

564
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:38,880
- So they're in Vegas right now.
- Oh, yeah? Vacation?

565
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:42,083
Uh... No.
They work there.

566
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:44,386
- They're singers.
- Huh.

567
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,356
I don't know if you've heard
of 'em. They're pretty famous.

568
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:51,360
They open
for Frank Sinatra’s act.
They're very close with Frank.

569
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:53,795
No kidding.

570
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:58,634
Yeah. A lot of people
don't know this, but Frank
is a profoundly religious man.

571
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:00,802
I should know.
He's my godfather.

572
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,539
Of course, I don't remember
a lot of him, because, you know,
I was a baby and everything.

573
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:08,977
But he sends me birthday cards
and Christmas cards.
He's a good man.

574
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:12,113
I know a lot of famous people.
Let's see. Who do I know?

575
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:15,684
Wayne Newton, Bobby Hackett...
they're all friends of my dad.

576
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,253
Yeah. I-I think you mean
buddy Hackett.

577
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,091
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, buddy Hackett.

578
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,728
I get so confused sometimes.
Bobby, buddy, you know.

579
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:29,097
Yeah, yeah.

580
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,967
Don't they worry about you?

581
00:54:33,035 --> 00:54:37,639
No, they trust me.
They know I'm okay.

582
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:41,209
How'd you do that?
Oh, yeah, it's
magic, you know?

583
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,845
Unbelievable.
Ladies and gentlemen,

584
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:47,982
For the first time ever,
a full 360...

585
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:54,255
Hi, rand. Terri,
this is my friend rand.

586
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,892
- Rand, this is Terri.
- Hi.

587
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,065
Thanks.
Okay.

588
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:09,304
See you later.

589
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:18,112
How's it goin'?

590
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,849
So now I'm
your friend.
What?

591
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,453
That's what you said.
"this is my <i>friend</i> rand."

592
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:28,657
Gonna screw her?

593
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,394
Tough day in dance city?

594
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:37,966
<i>Hey!</i>

595
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,808
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

596
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,878
I use my lock on my
rear wheel, you know? So...

597
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:52,714
Listen, Jack, you're always
working on that bike.

598
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,949
Have a look at it.
Quick release, huh?

599
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:57,853
Right. Make things a lot
easier on yourself.

600
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:01,490
yeah... well, it's nice.

601
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:14,403
Oh, shit.

602
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,305
oh, Jesus.

603
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:27,482
I thought I'd come by for
you guys to wish me luck.

604
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,486
- Hey, Hector, you gonna
audition for the four tops?
- Hey, funny.

605
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:36,024
Hec, what is this?
What are you doing?
What? What's the matter?

606
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:39,761
The tux. Why are you
wearing a tux?
You told me to.

607
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:44,032
No. I told you to wear a tux?

608
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:48,737
- You said, "wear somethin'
nice. A suit," you said.
- Yeah. A <i>suit.</i>

609
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:52,474
- So I ain't got no suit.
- So buy one. Borrow one.

610
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,410
From who? What money?

611
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:59,414
Hey, Jack look... I blow
a hundred bucks on a suit,
and what do I got?

612
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:03,351
<i>A crummy suit</i>
<i>pee-wee Herman wouldn't</i>
<i>wear to his own funeral.</i>

613
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:08,757
- But for 40 bucks, I got
the best tux Hernando had.
- Hernando?

614
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:12,260
Hernando. Go ahead.
Feel it.

615
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:15,396
Come on. Touch it. Feel
the fabric. This is <i>linen.</i>

616
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:19,267
This is a 250
set of threads.
So many ruffles.

617
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,770
Yeah.

618
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:28,076
- Did I screw up? Jack,
did I do somethin' wrong?
- No.

619
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,879
No. Uh, look...

620
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,907
Say you came from
a wedding, okay?

621
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,885
Say you came straight from
a wedding right to the bank.
Yeah, but I...

622
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,420
Hector, just do it, okay?

623
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,422
Okay.

624
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,629
Hey, Hec...

625
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,567
- Good luck.
- yeah, knock 'em dead, Hector.

626
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,803
- Thanks, Jack.
- mazel tov, <i>Hector.</i>

627
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,939
Hector! All right. Go get 'em.

628
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:04,779
Come on, you son
of a bitch. Move!

629
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:07,015
Bastard.

630
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,318
Okay...

631
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,321
Hi, dad.
Jackie.
Here you are.

632
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,657
I thought maybe
you got held up.
No, no.

633
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,893
You came all the way
on that thing?

634
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,330
Yeah, yeah. So,
what's the damage here?
All the way from the city?

635
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,567
Yeah.
Why didn't you call me?
I would have picked you up.

636
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,569
It's okay.
I like to ride.

637
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:32,306
Is the alternator shot?
Plymouths are a pain.
Everything is ass-backwards.

638
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:36,344
Let me give you a hand.
You got grease
on your hands right now.

639
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,346
It's okay. It's all right.

640
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,083
- Dinner's ready.
- Hi, mom.

641
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,420
- Hi, Jackie.
- We'll be in
in a minute, all right?

642
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:48,906
Well, just don't
make it too long.

643
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:59,267
Mar, where's the paper?

644
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,215
It's right there
on the chair.
Oh.

645
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:14,449
So, how do you like Notre Dame?

646
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,451
I like Notre Dame.

647
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,157
That's the <i>wall street journal.</i>

648
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:24,159
Yeah, I know what it is.

649
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,162
So aren't you gonna look?

650
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:31,466
I gotta go.

651
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,469
Where are you going?
I don't want
to start anything.

652
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:38,974
What am I supposed to do
to make you realize...
there's nothin' to talk about.

653
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:42,441
The hell there isn't
anything to talk about.
There's something.

654
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,982
I'm your father.
I say there is, damn it.
You wanna talk? Let's talk, huh?

655
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:49,985
Talk about you working
a double shift at the garage.

656
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:54,822
Let's talk about you fixing
these junk cars in the yards
on weekends, huh?

657
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,593
Let's talk about you
and mom not being able
to take a vacation.

658
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:02,330
That's not the issue. We are
talking about your future.

659
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:05,033
You are smart.
You have brains.

660
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:10,372
You're throwin' it away
on that goddamned bicycle.
What about your future, dad?

661
01:00:10,439 --> 01:00:12,940
You and ma.

662
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:22,117
What... mar, what am I supposed
to do to get through to that
thick skull of his?

663
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:25,120
What? Just
tell me, please!

664
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,862
Remember that day, dad?
What day?

665
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:39,867
- I said to you,
"dad, I lost it all"?
- Why are we bringing this up?

666
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:43,704
You know what he says
to me? "we Caseys,
we can take a punch."

667
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:49,444
- Right. We <i>can</i> take a punch.
- And then you wanted
to make me a sandwich!

668
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,447
I tell you I've lost
everything you and mom have...

669
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,216
And you're worried
if I'm hungry or not.

670
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:11,766
You know, I went out
to the cab and, uh,

671
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:15,970
I thought about what you said.

672
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,075
And I guess I really...

673
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:23,078
I really wanted to believe it.

674
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,617
You didn't hear me
come back in, did you?

675
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,292
You were sitting right there
all slumped over...

676
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:43,431
You know, in my whole life,

677
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,433
I never saw you cry...

678
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,535
Not once... until that day.

679
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:54,642
I gotta go finish
Sweeney’s car.

680
01:01:56,712 --> 01:02:01,149
I don't understand you, son.
You make me so damn <i>mad.</i>

681
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,196
You ever try eating
one of these things?

682
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,198
They're Terrible.

683
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,834
You wanna try another bank?

684
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:22,837
Ah, wouldn't do no good.

685
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:25,806
Would it?

686
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:29,577
- No.

687
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,881
You know, I've been
on both sides.

688
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:37,152
Being a messenger is not so bad.

689
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:40,321
I ain't going back
to riding no bike, Jack.

690
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,127
Hey, and besides,

691
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,864
We have our own
lending institutions
here in the neighborhood.

692

<i>Se habla Español.</i>

693
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:56,871
No. No, th-they'll bleed you.
That's crazy, man. They...
they break people's legs.

694
01:02:56,938 --> 01:03:02,009
Jack, you been watching
too many movies.
Hey, they don't do that no more.

695
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:05,946
Not all the time.

696
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,618
Look, I gotta get out of here.

697
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:15,557
I gotta return this monkey suit
or else they're gonna stick me
for another day.

705
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:10,010
- Ax and Rolf,
this is Jack Casey.
- Hi.

706
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:12,580
- Jack is a stockbroker.
- Really?

707
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,416
I was...
a very successful
stockbroker.

708
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,452
I peeked at your clippings.

709
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,087
clippings! My God,
a celebrity.

710
01:04:20,155 --> 01:04:24,292
In three years on the floor,
Jack grossed $30 million.

711
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,630
- My, my.
- - it was some kind of record, wasn't it, Jack?

712
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:31,633
Yeah, yeah, I set
another record.

713
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,936
I lost it all in 24 hours,

720

I need my bike, you know?
I'm a bicycle messenger?
It's just a job.

721
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,535
A job for kids.

722
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,538
It's my life.

723
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,475

And I...
I see some leverage.

See, I was a trader.
Yeah, and?

742

I was one of the best, and...

743
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,482
I could take
your money in for you.

Yeah.

Yeah. We could.

01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,114
No, I...
I don't need that.

762
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:18,052
Um...

763
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:20,254
Look, I need a place
to crash tonight.

764
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:25,392
It's just for tonight.
I don't wanna make any waves
between you and your girlfriend.

765
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,394
I noticed you had a big place.

766
01:09:27,462 --> 01:09:31,632
I was just gonna take
a space in the corner. I'll
be out before you wake up.

767
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:36,037
<i>I got kicked out of my</i>
<i>girlfriend's apartment,</i>
<i>so I thought that...</i>

768
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:22,416
Uh,

769
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,484
I guess you can sleep
on the couch.

770
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,421
<i>You know, there's some</i>
<i>blankets in the chest...</i>

771
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,157
Oh, no, that's okay.
I brought my sleeping bag.

772
01:10:46,908 --> 01:10:48,843
Where's your girlfriend?

773
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:07,795
%%

774
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,797
%%

775
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,275
Look, there's a pay phone
on the corner, okay?

776
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:25,312
Why don't you go downstairs and
call your mother and father?
What?

777
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,549
In Vegas... isn't that
where you said they were?

778
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,752
I don't wanna bother them.

779
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,322
No, wait. Uh, I'm sure
if you called them,

780
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,325
Told them you were in a jam,
they'd help you out.

781
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:40,327
Parents are like that.

782
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:44,699
- So?
- So what?

783
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:47,367
So are you going to call them?

784
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:49,870
I told you, they're busy.

785
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,872
Oh, yeah.

786
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:56,643
Yeah, yeah, they're...
they're busy in Vegas
singing with Frank, right?

787
01:11:57,946 --> 01:11:59,880
They're not in Vegas,
are they, Terri?

788
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,816
Who are you, dick Tracy?

789
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:06,020
If you don't want me
to stay here, just say so.
I got other friends.

790
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,255
Aw, cut the bullshit,
would you, Terri?

791
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:12,359
I-I mean, you tell Hector
that you're from Chicago,

792
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:15,596
That your father is some kind
of a jet pilot/war hero,

793
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:19,399
<i>Then you tell me</i>
<i>they're singin' in Vegas</i>
<i>with Frank Sinatra?</i>

794
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:23,104
So what is it with you?
Why did you lie to me?

795
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:26,340
What about you? What are you,
some big man/stockbroker...

796
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:28,342
With millions on wall street...

797
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:33,280
And pictures
of expensive vacation
and fancy girlfriends, huh?

798
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,282
Or is it Jack
the bicycle messenger...

799
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,886
Living in some... Warehouse
like a stray cat?

800
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,888
What about that one, huh?

801
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,091
You don't know what
you're talking about.
So do me a favor...

802
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,095
Call up mommy and daddy
and go back to wherever
you ran away from.

803
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,810
I wish that I could, but, uh...

804
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,813
There isn't gonna be anyone
there to take the call.

805
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:13,220
You're supposed to have
all these brains, right?

806
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:17,224
You're supposed to be
really smart, huh?
You're dumb.

807
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,460
You see, you have all these
choices that you can make.

808
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:25,232
I don't have any choices.

809
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,836
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

810
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:42,649
Hey, hey, hey, where are
you goin', hothead, huh?

811
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:48,022
Look, um,

812
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:50,357
I-I thought you needed
a place to stay?

813
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,431
So stay, all right?

814
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,068
I want you to stay.

815
01:14:05,506 --> 01:14:07,441
Okay?

816
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:11,712
Okay.

817
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,715
Come on.

818
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,657
Here. Watch my bike.

819
01:16:40,928 --> 01:16:43,197
Good luck.

820
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:09,289
listen, I got this Guy
on the phone...

821
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,064
Hey, Dave.

822
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,366
Look, uh, could you
get chip for me?

823
01:17:29,877 --> 01:17:33,514
- Mr. Casey.
Wonderful to see you again.
- Yeah, good to see you too.

824
01:17:33,581 --> 01:17:35,516
It's been
a long time, huh?
Yeah.

825
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:40,254
What can I do for you?
Yeah, look, I need to get on
the floor. Can you help me out?

826
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,889
Sure.

827
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:49,663
buy! Buy!

828
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,254
So, what do you like today?

829
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:18,258
I'm gonna spread out, I guess.
Try to build up some momentum.

830
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,260
I'm looking for lightning
to strike.

831
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:23,263
You can make that happen,
Mr. Casey. I remember.

832
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:27,767
Look, if it's okay, I'd like
to handle the phones for ya.
Thank you, chip, but...

833
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:31,771
No, really. I'd like to.
Like old times, huh?
Okay. Okay, thanks.

834
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:34,774
sold! Sold! Sold!

835
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,383
forty-five.

836
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:47,121
<i>go higher. Go!</i>

837
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:51,225
- Forty-five's a nine.

838
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:05,972
D's 30, 35.

839
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,778
- I've got the market...
40s at three quarters.
- Buy! Buy! Buy!

840
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:29,963
Twenty-five, thirty.
No, no...

841
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:51,518
%%
okay. Okay, mama.

842
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:55,455
Si. Si... si, ya...
iya comprendo!
I love you, good-bye.

843
01:19:55,523 --> 01:19:58,458
Hey, Jack, it's Maria.
They got her at the hospital.

844
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:01,127
My mother, she's babblin',
I don't know what.

845
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,798
- Look, I'm sorry, I gotta leave you to do this alone.
- <i> %%</i>

846
01:20:04,865 --> 01:20:08,435
Look, I'm having kind of
a rough time...
hey... hey, hey...

847
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,137
What do you think,
boy or a girl?

848
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:25,919
I need you to float me.
The market closes
in three hours.

849
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:28,589
For chrisake, let's not
jump before we look.

850
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:31,458
The market's a mess. Even
Marcus is holding tight.

851
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:35,462
You said to me,
"if not now, when?"
I <i>know</i> what I said!

852
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,798
but not now.

853
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:43,136
Besides, it'll take time
to put this together.
Listen to me, listen to me.

854
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:47,107
I-I'm in it already, okay?
I used up what I had.

855
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:50,777
I'm down but I'm not out!

856
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:54,114
Why didn't you come talk to me?

857
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:56,683
I'm talkin' to you now.

858
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,857
I need 15 grand.
What the hell are you
gonna do with 15 grand?

859
01:21:03,924 --> 01:21:05,859
That's not money.
That's nothing.

860
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:08,695
You wanna get back in?
Let's do it right,
go for it.

861
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:13,533
Back in business, you and me.
We'll make a plan. Not this way.
Gabe...

862
01:21:14,602 --> 01:21:17,771
I don't know how
I got here, okay?

863
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:20,340
But I'm here and this is it.

864
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,342
Right now. This is the time.

865
01:21:25,713 --> 01:21:27,648
This isn't about
business, is it?

866
01:21:27,715 --> 01:21:29,783
No.

867
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:35,489
Okay.

868
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:37,491
I guess I got 15 grand.

869
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:41,495
I think you should know,
I have nothing, okay?
Just a feeling.

870
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:44,164
What are you trying to do,
talk me out of it?

871
01:21:44,231 --> 01:21:48,702
Ceil, I want you to
put me on the floor. Open
an account for Jack Casey.

872
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,905
Yeah, that's right...
smilin' Jack Casey.

873
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,911
Chip?
Yes?

874
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,913
Raydon.

875
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:04,250
Six and a quarter, up
three eighths. 29,000 traded.
How about Belltech?

876
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:07,855
four and a half, up a half.
That's 40,000 traded.

877
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:10,290
What do you smell?

878
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,292
I like zenon.

879
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,963
Two and three quarters, holding.
Only 15,000...
Jack, Jack...

880
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:19,967
It's been weak all month,
and it opened down this morning.
Yeah.

881
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:22,669
It's a dog.
Let's see. Let's see.

882
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,673
zenon... I'm the seller
at five and three quarters.

883
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,009
At three quarters.

884
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:31,512
- I'll buy five.
- Sold! Sold!

885
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,515
- Five, Jack.
- I'm out. I'm out.

886
01:22:41,088 --> 01:22:45,091
I'll... I'll sell the 30s
in zenon at two and a half.

887
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:48,228
- I'll buy 15.
- sold! Sold!

888
01:22:48,295 --> 01:22:50,931
Why is he buying that junk?

889
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:58,939
Five eighths!
Five eighths!

890
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,241
- I'm gonna sell 'em
down to two.
- I'll buy 20.

891
01:23:01,308 --> 01:23:03,376
Sold! Sold! Sold!

892
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,319
Jack, I'm sorry, man.
This was not the day.

893
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:51,157
Get out. Take the loss while
you still got something.
I'm stayin' with it.

894
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:53,159
Down to one and a quarter,
Mr. Kaplan.

895
01:23:53,227 --> 01:23:56,227
Get out.
It's a mistake.
I'm stayin' with it!

896
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,801
- Get me out.
- Get me out.

897
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:03,737
- Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!

898
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:11,979
Jack, it's up two.

899
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,627
Two and a quarter.

900
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,895
All right.
Here we go.

901
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:33,333
- Two and a half.
- That's right. That's
right, baby. That's right.

902
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,169
Now we got ten and
a quarter. Come on, come on.

903
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:41,041
Buyers everywhere.
Bid for a thousand!

904
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:47,147
- Two and three quarters, Jack.
- My! Oh, my!

905
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:55,421
- Three.
- All right.

906
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:58,969
<i>Three and</i>
<i>a quarter.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

907
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,231
- Jack, it's up to four.
- Okay, sell it.

908
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:09,036
What? It's on a roll.
Lightning is striking twice.
Nah, it already has.

909
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,237
Sell it out
at four.
You got it.

910
01:25:11,305 --> 01:25:14,574
Geez, I was having such a good
time, I forgot to buy in.

911
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,853
That leaves 38 grand
for you, pal.

912
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:31,825
Listen, take a vacation.
Go down to the islands,
do some marlin fishing.

913
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:34,061
And then you and me,
we gotta talk.

914
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:36,329
So who should I make
this one out to?

915
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:39,066
Him.
My father.

916
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:41,367
I thought only Jews did guilt.

917
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:45,605
You do.
We do shame.

918
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,848
Hey.
Huh? Hey.

919
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,150
How's mama?
Mama ain't
mama yet, man.

920
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,986
She's been in there
for, like, eight hours.

921
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,922
Like, what time you got?

922
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:06,093
There's a clock right there.
It's 9:00. Come here.
Oh.

923
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,429
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Look, I know you did
your best in there.

924
01:26:09,496 --> 01:26:13,566
Look, why don't you
just stick around
and wait for the baby?

925
01:26:13,634 --> 01:26:15,568
Open it.

926
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:19,439
team blue.
Team blue to radiology.

927
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:22,743
Look, there's a $170
broker's fee. I deducted it.

928
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:28,414
But I saw your face
this morning and you...
I had a better second half.

929
01:26:28,482 --> 01:26:30,917
Mr. Rodriguez?

930
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:34,888
- Yes?
- It's a boy.
Eight pounds, six ounces.

931
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:40,326
It's a boy. It's a boy!

932

bum a cigarette from you?

Hey, Terri.

938
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,339
Not for nothin'.

939
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:29,009
But what's it gonna cost you?

940
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:47,828
Get in.

941
01:27:50,764 --> 01:27:54,467
I ain't workin' for you no more.
Get someone else.
Whoa.

942
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:59,105
I don't... Talk business
in the street. Get in.

943
01:28:10,651 --> 01:28:15,455
Wanna go to a little party?
What do you mean, "a party"?
What kind of party?

944
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:22,229
What do you care? You'll
get paid for your time.

945
01:28:24,798 --> 01:28:27,734
Let me out. I said,
let me outta the goddamn car.

946
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:31,537
Stop this goddamn car!
What the hell
are you doing to me?

947
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:33,473
Stop it!

948
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,808
Let me out of here!

What... Is this?

950
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:43,483
I carried your shit for you,
and I don't say anything,

951
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,485
But I'm no whore.

Yeah.

967
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:51,375
He's comin', man.
Good work,
Apache.

968

01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:53,052
Jack!

974
01:35:06,933 --> 01:35:10,202
- Oh, Jack.
- What happened? What happened?
What happened to you?

975
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:13,473
He had a gun, and
he shot airborne.
Who shot airborne?

976
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,309
The gypsy. He shot him.
He just...

977
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,845
- All right. Okay.

978
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,457
Terri!

979
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:35,762
Let's just get outta here,
okay? I just wanna
go away, please? Okay?

980
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:38,464
This is what I want
you to do. Take the keys.

981
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:42,568
Go inside, lock the door
and don't let anybody in.
You hear me?

982
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:44,837
Don't let anybody in.

983
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,573
What are you
gonna do, huh? What?

984
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:49,575
I don't know.

985
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:54,180
I don't know. Maybe he'll
follow me. Maybe I can
get him away from here.

986
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:57,983
Just stay here, all right?
Just stay here.

987
01:35:58,051 --> 01:36:02,455
hey, I'm okay. I'm okay.

988
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,457
I can walk.

989
01:41:52,722 --> 01:41:55,224
Hi. Boy,
you look great.
Hi.

990
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:58,227
Thanks. Uh,
how did it go?
Great.

991
01:41:58,295 --> 01:42:01,931
Yeah, I got a couple
of real good offers.
Great. That's good.

992
01:42:01,999 --> 01:42:04,433
You wanna get
something to eat?
Oh, yeah.

993
01:42:04,501 --> 01:42:06,435
Okay. How'd
it go for you?

994
01:42:06,503 --> 01:42:08,437
Well, uh...

995
01:42:08,505 --> 01:42:10,439
I'm gonna be a paramedic.

996
01:42:10,507 --> 01:42:13,507
Yeah, it's this
trainee program.
It's for six months.

997
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:17,947
I get to learn how to save
people and I drive an ambulance.
Oh, yeah?

998
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:22,451
That sounds great. A paramedic.
Well, you've had experience
with accidents...

999
01:42:22,519 --> 01:42:25,999
I'm very serious
about this.
No, I think it sounds great.

1000
01:42:26,023 --> 01:42:28,457
So, what do you say?
Pizza, Chinese, what?

1001
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:33,129
Pizza. Definitely pizza.
Yeah? 'cause I was thinkin'
that Chinese might be good.

1002
01:42:33,196 --> 01:42:35,131
Yeah, well, I really
wanted pizza.

1003
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:38,467
Okay, that sounds good.
Pizza.
No, really.

1004
01:42:38,535 --> 01:42:40,970
We'll go
for Chinese.
No, pizza sounds good.

1005
01:42:41,038 --> 01:42:43,973
