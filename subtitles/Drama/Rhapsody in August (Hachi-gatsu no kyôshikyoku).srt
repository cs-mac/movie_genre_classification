<i>It was kind of a funny summer.</i>

22
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,624
<i>During vacation, nothing
but strange things seemed to happen.</i>

23
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:29,862
<i>And the boy a rose did see</i>

24
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:33,964
Give it up! That organ!
It gets worse as you try to fix it.

25
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,896
I will absolutely fix it.

26
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:40,871
I got into college.

27
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:44,108
Finally managed to get out of
the examination hell.

28
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:45,541
Made up my mind.

29
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,546
Absolutely no studying
during this summer vacation.

30
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:52,815
I've got plenty of time
to fix this organ, absolutely....

31
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:57,518
Here we go again with Tateo's "absolutely."
You said it three times already.

32
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,490
A letter from Hawaii.

33
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,716
Pictures are enclosed.

34
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,419
Let's see.

35
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,490
"I hasten to inform you that we were met...

36
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:42,057
"by the family of Suzujiro's son
at Honolulu Airport."

37
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,526
Dad has a lei.

38
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:50,599
"We knew that Suzujiro's deceased wife
was an American...

39
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,372
"but were somewhat surprised to find...

40
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:56,973
"that all the family members
were 100 percent Americans."

41
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,052
Terrific!

42
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,286
This is a Cadillac limousine!

43
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:08,151
His son Clark and wife, Natalie...

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,787
and their children Michael and Emily.

45
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,859
This Michael and Emily
look like they are just about our age.

46
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:23,302
And Emily, she's a very beautiful girl.

47
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,639
- Tateo, are you falling for her?
- Stupid!

48
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:36,054
"But all of them speak broken Japanese,
which set our minds at ease."

49
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:40,683
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with English.

50
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,423
"After a comfortable drive
of about 20 minutes...

51
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,997
"we arrived at Suzujiro's residence.

52
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,502
"Immediately we met Suzujiro,
who was sick in bed."

53
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,061
Is he Grandma's elder brother?

54
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:07,517
"Suzujiro looked better than
we had anticipated.

55
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:11,249
"He was so pleased
that he held our hands tightly...

56
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,417
"and did not want to let go
for quite some time.

57
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:19,731
"But he was very disappointed
that Grandma did not come.

58
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,857
"He repeatedly asked us
what was wrong with her...

59
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:26,666
"and we didn't know how to answer him.

60
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,673
"Since Grandma had said no...

61
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:39,309
"we came to see Suzujiro on her behalf...

62
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,984
"which was the wrong thing to do.

63
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:45,055
"We are her blood relatives...

64
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:49,959
"but after all, we are actually strangers
as far as Suzujiro is concerned.

65
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:55,934
"The person he really wanted to see
was the lone survivor...

66
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,763
"his sister, Grandma.

67
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,735
"We can't do her job.

68
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:10,547
"Suzujiro, who had kept
his eyes closed for a while...

69
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,447
"opened them, and said:

70
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:15,248
"'Grandma might as well come to see him...

71
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,552
"'with her grandchildren
during summer vacation.'

72
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,660
"He said, 'We would feel easier that way.'

73
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,795
"It's a good idea, please do what he said."

74
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,495
- Going to....
- To Hawaii.

75
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:31,058
"I also think it's a good idea.

76
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,935
"Grandma, please think it over again.

77
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,206
"A trip to Hawaii is not too different...

78
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:44,043
"from a trip between Nagasaki and Tokyo,
where our home is."

79
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:46,011
That's right!

80
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:48,276
"I also beg your favor.

81
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:52,287
"Please come to Hawaii
with your four grandchildren...

82
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,684
"and meet Suzujiro.

83
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,021
"With hasty regards, Tadao."

84
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:02,033
Grandma, it's a very good idea!
You should go, absolutely.

85
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,069
- Everybody to Hawaii!
- Wonderful!

86
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:08,004
- It will be a great holiday!
- Grandma, let's go! Let's go, please!

87
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:11,565
Wait! My mother also wrote...

88
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:17,406
"Dear Grandma,
Suzujiro told us to stay at his home.

89
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,583
"No sense staying at a hotel.

90
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,014
"We decided to take advantage
of his hospitality.

91
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,720
"It is such a big, magnificent residence.

92
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,818
"We are just loafing around.

93
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,558
"The garden is beautiful, and nothing
is better than the ocean-side view.

94
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,066
"Grandma, please do come! Yoshie."

95
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,998
Look! It's a gorgeous home!

96
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,599
It looks just like a hotel!

97
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:50,339
Here's another letter.
It's from Clark, Suzujiro's son.

98
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:52,145
It's written in katakana.

99
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:54,186
Here, can you see it?

100
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:00,686
"Dear Aunt...

101
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,361
"I am the son...

102
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,431
"of your eldest brother...

103
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:10,696
"Suzujiro Haruno.

104
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,571
"Ever since my father...

105
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,268
"came from Japan...

106
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:20,411
"to Hawaii in 1920...

107
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,847
"he lived with the pineapples...

108
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:31,086
"and he will soon die as an American...

109
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:37,218
"leaving me this vast farm.

110
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:48,840
"He tells me that he wishes to see you...

111
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:52,844
"his younger sister, before he dies.

112
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,680
"Please come and see my father.

113
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,485
"Sincerely yours, Clark."

114
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,253
It's touching!

115
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,126
It sure is.

116
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:15,993
Say, Grandma, let's go to Hawaii.

117
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:19,965
You heard what the letter said.
It wouldn't be nice for you not to go.

118
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,270
But still, this is all so strange.

119
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,902
It could be some kind of mistake.

120
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:29,379
Cut it out now!
Sure, if Grandma was a millionaire...

121
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,884
it's possible it could be a swindler
claiming to be your brother.

122
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,887
But I bet there is no one fool enough...

123
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:38,947
to bother lying about being
a brother of poor Grandma.

124
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:43,017
In the first place, these people are rich!

125
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:46,324
Suzujiro Haruno.

126
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:51,865
Surely, my maiden name is Haruno...

127
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:55,674
but I can't remember the name Suzujiro.

128
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,571
After all, I was born in a poor family
that was blessed only with children.

129
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:03,740
I had more than ten brothers and sisters.

130
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,306
More than ten?

131
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:11,452
Besides that, this man is an American,
isn't he?

132
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:16,992
- How could he be my big brother?
- It was written in the letter.

133
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:20,156
He went to Hawaii as an immigrant
and became naturalized.

134
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,393
Although he has American citizenship...

135
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,936
Grandma's brother is still
Grandma's brother.

136
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,700
This guy Suzujiro must be
Grandma's elder brother.

137
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:31,800
Right. Otherwise, what would be the reason
for him trying to find you?

138
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,004
I know...

139
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,373
what you mean, but....

140
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,607
Guess it's about the right time
to eat some kidney beans.

141
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,852
Real stubborn. That's for sure.

142
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:24,018
"Who needs them!" There's no television.

143
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,758
And that refrigerator,
guess how much I had to beg her to buy it?

144
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,961
She still won't go for a washing machine.

145
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,699
"Washing can be done
without a thing like that," she says.

146
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:38,504
A stone head, with a reed screen over it.

147
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,726
It's delicious, really delicious!

148
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:03,130
Eating with all of you
makes the food extra tasty.

149
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:13,968
Grandma.

150
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,647
Let my sister cook the meals
starting tomorrow.

151
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:22,312
I'm sure it will be good for everybody.

152
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:25,220
And it will be much easier on you,
too, Grandma.

153
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:26,723
Don't worry about me.

154
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,158
To put it simply...

155
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:33,187
Grandma's cooking is driving us to despair.

156
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:39,727
In other words, your cooking
just doesn't agree with our tastes.

157
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:44,306
I mean, as a matter of fact,
it's just plain lousy.

158
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:48,543
I'm sorry, Grandma, but...

159
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,747
this pumpkin and kidney beans,
and pumpkin and chicken...

160
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:58,451
it's so boiled down with soy sauce
that we can't even tell which piece is which.

161
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:01,584
- It is so black, and pulpy, and salty--
- Tateo!

162
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:07,963
I think Grandma's cooking is lousy
because of her false teeth.

163
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,734
As long as everything is soft,
it's all right with her.

164
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:14,567
- But we don't have false teeth.
- Shinjiro!

165
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:39,290
Shinjiro, you sure are great!
You did real well.

166
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:40,922
That's true. Because of you...

167
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,991
I can sit at the table starting tomorrow
with a sense of relief.

168
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:46,037
You mean eating is your only concern?

169
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:49,540
But you can't get away that easy.
Tomorrow, we go shopping in Nagasaki.

170
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,873
- And you're coming, too, Shinjiro.
- Count me out.

171
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:57,973
I have the big project to convince Grandma
to take us all to Hawaii with her.

172
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:03,249
Yeah! That's the grand theme
for this summer vacation!

173
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:07,290
We shall all go to Hawaii! Absolutely!
Let's all hold out!

174
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:11,458
Fate is knocking at the door.

175
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,568
Under this beautiful town of Nagasaki...

176
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:30,638
there is another Nagasaki
that vanished with one atomic bomb.

177
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:34,476
Didn't Grandpa die
in the Nagasaki atom bombing?

178
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,317
- Yes.
- How come Grandma was safe?

179
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,019
She was at the house, behind the mountain,
10 kilometers away from the blast center.

180
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:47,994
But she told me
that her hair was a result of the atom bomb.

181
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,561
That's because Grandma came to Nagasaki
on that day, looking for Grandpa.

182
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:57,835
The school where Grandpa was teaching
was close to the blast center.

183
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,968
And did she find Grandpa?

184
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:06,277
The school building was crushed flat
and burned, and full of charred bodies.

185
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:10,416
It was impossible to identify
which one of them was Grandpa.

186
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,154
Do you want to go to the school?

187
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,585
You know, Grandma was also a teacher
at this school.

188
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,060
She quit when she married Grandpa.

189
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,427
She sure was lucky, wasn't she?

190
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,058
I don't know about that.

191
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,737
When Grandpa died,
our father was still a baby...

192
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:04,108
and Grandma was carrying
Minako's mother in her belly.

193
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:07,106
Being left alone...

194
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:10,443
I bet it must have been
very hard on Grandma.

195
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,762
Still...

196
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,300
even though no one ever found Grandpa...

197
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,775
he's here, I'm sure.

198
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:42,306
<i>That day, we went around
the town of Nagasaki...</i>

199
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,739
<i>because we wanted to know a lot more
about the atomic bomb.</i>

200
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:54,910
Even though the atomic bomb was dropped,
this survived?

201
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:57,147
No, it was rebuilt.

202
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:01,156
But there are some things
left just as they were at that time.

203
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:15,807
The angels all look as if they are crying.

204
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:33,016
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.

205
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:50,669
Portugal.

206
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,206
These are monuments...

207
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:59,816
sent from different countries of the world.

208
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,944
Czechoslovakia.

209
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:10,888
Italy.

210
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:14,893
Poland.

211
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,164
Bulgaria.

212
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:27,505
The Soviet Union.

213
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:30,709
China.

214
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,481
Brazil.

215
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:36,448
Cuba.

216
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:38,883
Holland.

217
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,524
I can't find the one from America.

218
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:46,792
What do you expect? America is the one
that dropped the atomic bomb.

219
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,403
"I was so very thirsty.

220
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:06,914
"Water, water."
All died uttering that word.

221
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,145
But nowadays, for most of the people...

222
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:47,121
the atomic bomb is something
that happened once upon a time.

223
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:51,361
People are apt to forget...

224
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:54,091
even a dreadful event like that...

225
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,030
as the years pass by.

226
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,427
Can we leave it like that?

227
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:03,899
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.

228
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:13,280
Want some ice cream?

229
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,451
Grandma.

230
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,722
Grandma.

231
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,109
You're late!

232
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,336
What have you been doing?

233
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,775
It's all right, now, all right.

234
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,856
What's the matter now?

235
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,036
I think Grandma would like it
not too spicy.

236
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,970
May I start eating?

237
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:17,740
I'm really embarrassed. Grandma puts her
hands together to worship what I cooked.

238
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:20,403
- And it was really delicious.
- That's true!

239
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:23,106
We're all counting on you from now on.

240
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:25,515
Look at this.

241
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,255
What is this?

242
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:35,486
To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii,
I talked about Suzujiro today.

243
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,291
Then Grandma started to remember
the names of her brothers.

244
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,526
"Tetsutaro.

245
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,724
"Dozaburo.

246
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:46,865
"Jushiro.

247
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:49,739
"Shogoro.

248
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,109
"Kuginosuke.

249
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,378
"Natakichi.

250
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:58,610
"Kuwata.

251
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:00,182
"Suzukichi.

252
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:02,611
"Nabe.

253
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,177
"Kane. Kyoko."

254
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,789
These names have
the Chinese symbol for metal.

255
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:12,626
Grandma's father, our great-grandfather,
seems to have been a real weirdo.

256
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:16,728
"Kane." So this is our Grandma, right?

257
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:21,802
- Eleven!
- Eleven?

258
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:26,037
And she says there must have been two
or three more, but she can't remember them.

259
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:28,704
And Suzujiro is among the ones
she can't remember?

260
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,772
But you know, Tetsutaro,
Dozaburo, there, is number two.

261
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,409
I think the brother between those two
is Suzujiro.

262
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:39,286
I'm pretty sure of it. First, the Chinese
character for Suzu has the symbol for metal.

263
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:43,726
Even if she could remember,
Grandma won't go to Hawaii. I'm sure of it.

264
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:45,627
Why's that?

265
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:48,425
Grandma doesn't like America,
and it's only natural.

266
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:53,493
After all, Grandpa was killed
by the atomic bomb.

267
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,035
I think he's right.

268
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:01,707
You see, none of us
and none of our parents know about war.

269
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,006
As for the atomic bomb....

270
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:06,880
Sure, we've all heard about it.

271
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,910
But it meant nothing more
than a sort of little scary fairy tale.

272
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:14,015
We never really understood
the feelings of the people...

273
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:18,085
who had the atom bomb dropped over
their heads. We never stopped to think.

274
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:19,424
Look at my mother.

275
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:23,092
Just by being told that there's
a rich relative in Hawaii, she got excited.

276
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,897
Isn't it disgusting?
My father's no different.

277
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:29,565
He didn't even spend time with Grandma.
He took off for Hawaii in a hurry.

278
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,869
Big Sis!

279
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:41,312
Here, eat these.

280
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,554
I'm really pleased...

281
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:51,456
that you are so concerned about me.

282
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:54,426
I'm very grateful.

283
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,395
But then, it was a long time ago
when I felt bitter about America.

284
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:06,202
It's been more than 45 years
since Grandpa died.

285
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:10,848
Now, I don't particularly like...

286
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,644
or dislike America.

287
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:17,053
It's all because of war.

288
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:19,818
War is to blame.

289
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:26,422
During the war many Japanese died...

290
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:29,693
and many Americans also died.

291
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,229
Listen...

292
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,935
because of a man called Suzujiro
or whatever...

293
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,970
I don't think it's right for you
to talk badly about your parents.

294
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:49,545
I was the one who sort of drove them
to go off to Hawaii...

295
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:55,858
for my own joy of having the four of you
here, all to myself, while they're gone.

296
00:26:56,994 --> 00:27:01,398
Anyway, I want all of you to stay here
during summer vacation.

297
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:07,002
The rich man in Hawaii
means nothing to me.

298
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm just grateful
to be able to live with you like this...

299
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:16,269
because of him.

300
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,277
Now, go on, eat.

301
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:27,548
Grandma's watermelon is real tasty.

302
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:29,349
Thank you!

303
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:47,843
Grandpa used to play this so often....

304
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,756
I know I got old...

305
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:03,523
and so did this organ.

306
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:06,596
I'll fix it. I sure will. Absolutely.

307
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,996
You're saying "absolutely" again.

308
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:31,685
There were so many of them.

309
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:34,449
But they all died.

310
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:38,394
All of them died
because of the atomic bomb?

311
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:43,259
No. Some of them died because of that,
but there were some who died young...

312
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:48,271
and some who died in places far away.

313
00:28:57,047 --> 00:29:00,176
This one, Natakichi...

314
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,415
he was my seventh or eighth brother,
I think.

315
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:11,356
He left home
and became a shoemaker in Nagasaki.

316
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:16,226
After five years of apprenticeship...

317
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:20,134
just as he was ready
to open his own shop...

318
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:23,239
he made a gross mistake.

319
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,866
What did he do?

320
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:30,340
Big Bro' Natakichi...

321
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:34,316
eloped with the shoemaker's wife.

322
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,783
Hey, why don't you go to bed?

323
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,713
I'm not sleepy.

324
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:41,490
Then what happened to Natakichi?

325
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:43,917
My father was furious...

326
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:47,431
and refused to let him come back home.

327
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:52,132
So Natakichi was obliged
to build a small hut...

328
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:54,665
far up in the mountain behind here...

329
00:29:54,738 --> 00:29:58,266
and make a scanty living
by making shoes there.

330
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:02,704
They lived in a place...

331
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,180
where two charred cedar trees...

332
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:09,410
that had been struck by lightning...

333
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:14,748
stood along the path
they used in their escape.

334
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,595
But why live in a place like that?

335
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,797
While they were running away...

336
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:25,302
the woman who was holding
Natakichi's hand...

337
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,938
saw those two trees...

338
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:35,738
and said they looked like...

339
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,972
they had committed a double suicide.

340
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:45,487
And that's why they built a hut
at that place.

341
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:50,525
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.

342
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,490
I'm going to bed.

343
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:55,131
Me, too. I'm totally bushed today.

344
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:02,503
Good night.

345
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,875
- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see.
- Go where? See what?

346
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:16,079
Those two trees that committed
double suicide by being struck by lightning.

347
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:18,883
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.

348
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,652
Those trees can't still be there.

349
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:16,012
I can't see them. Grandma told me
they were still here, though.

350
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,011
Burnt trees keep standing forever
because they won't rot.

351
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:39,802
There they are!
That's it! Let's go and see.

352
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,737
Why don't we just look from where we are?

353
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:45,605
I don't know why, but I'm a little scared.

354
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:22,602
"Those two cedar trees look as if
they have committed double suicide."

355
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,546
"We are two elopers.

356
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:39,190
"Why not live next to them?"

357
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,808
What are you doing?

358
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,504
Sorry! I just got carried away
because of the mood.

359
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:56,409
Stupid! I'm going back!

360
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:00,075
Wait a minute! Hey, wait a minute!

361
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:34,078
What's wrong?

362
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:39,755
Something's weird. An old lady
from somewhere came to visit Grandma.

363
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,350
So what? What's so weird about that?

364
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:45,156
But you see, they just sit face to face.
That's it.

365
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:48,198
They don't say a word, for all this time.

366
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:50,563
And it's been one hour already.

367
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:15,579
Grandma, see if this letter
is all right to send to Hawaii.

368
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:20,180
"Hello there.
Grandma is now inclined to go to Hawaii."

369
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,726
This is just in diplomatic language.

370
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:25,489
After all,
we have to consider their feelings, too.

371
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:29,590
"But before that, she says
she wants to make sure about Suzujiro.

372
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:32,727
"Even with the picture you sent,
she doesn't remember...

373
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:35,237
"due to his age,
and his looks after being ill.

374
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:38,070
"If you have a picture taken
when Suzujiro was young...

375
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,076
"please send it as soon as possible.

376
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:44,046
"And ask Suzujiro to try and recall
the names of his brothers.

377
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:49,842
"If he recalls the names
of Tetsutaro, Dozaburo and Jushiro...

378
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:53,750
"those names would match
Grandma's memory.

379
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,487
"And it would mean that Suzujiro
is definitely the elder brother of Grandma.

380
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,820
"In haste, respectfully...."

381
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:04,424
That's a great idea.
Tateo, you are something!

382
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,696
This is all right, isn't it?

383
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:10,831
- Thank you for all your trouble.
- Then I'll send it right away tomorrow.

384
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:14,503
But it's possible that letter
will cross father on the way.

385
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,547
He's got a job, and it's about time
for him to be coming back.

386
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,173
No, he won't be coming back.

387
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:22,446
There's the pineapple farm,
even if he gets fired.

388
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:34,360
That old lady who came to visit you today,
what did she come here for?

389
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:37,123
She came to chat with me.

390
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,132
But you didn't talk at all.

391
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:42,465
Both of you just sat there saying nothing.

392
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:47,533
And then that old lady bowed to you
and left without saying a word.

393
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:52,077
There are things
we don't need words to understand.

394
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,552
Her husband also died...

395
00:37:56,419 --> 00:38:00,254
in Nagasaki, just like Grandpa.

396
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:04,893
That's why she comes here now and then...

397
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:10,629
sits down for a while without saying a word,
and leaves without saying a word.

398
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,735
There are people who are silent...

399
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,305
while they are talking.

400
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:35,649
This one, Suzukichi...

401
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:38,257
the youngest brother.

402
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:42,057
He was a little weak in the head.

403
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:46,300
Ever since he lost all of his hair
from the atomic bomb...

404
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,762
he shut himself up in a room
and stayed there.

405
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,169
But on hot summer days...

406
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:56,940
it must have been insufferable for him.

407
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,478
He used to slip out when the moon came up,
and sneak away for a swim...

408
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:05,716
in the basin of a waterfall
deep in the mountains. That's right, yes.

409
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:10,089
That waterfall is a nice one.
You should go there sometime.

410
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:14,659
And then, that boy, what was he doing
every day in the room?

411
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:18,896
- He just kept on drawing pictures.
- What kind of pictures?

412
00:39:18,968 --> 00:39:22,871
For some strange reason,
only pictures of eyes.

413
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,104
- Eyes?
- Eyes like this.

414
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:30,579
As long as there was paper...

415
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:33,639
he just drew eyes,
never getting tired of it.

416
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,050
He's spooky!

417
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,948
I bet those were eyes
seen through an obsession.

418
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:43,550
He loathed the idea
of being seen with his hairless head.

419
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:46,994
And he must have been obsessed
by the eyes of people.

420
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,589
It must be those eyes.

421
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,463
This kind of drawing?

422
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,569
That's it! That's exactly it.

423
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:03,636
Those are exactly the same pictures.

424
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,513
Come to think of it...

425
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:14,524
you sure do look like Suzukichi.

426
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:17,683
You are like two peas in a pod.

427
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:20,830
That's really something!

428
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:57,865
- Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
- Why?

429
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:00,734
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

430
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:05,104
When I shut my eyes,
the picture of those eyes glares at me.

431
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:08,804
Cut it out! Now you're
going to make me have a nightmare!

432
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:23,420
Coward!

433
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:37,239
Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?

434
00:41:37,306 --> 00:41:40,538
I can't believe that Suzukichi,
who was a little weak in the head...

435
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,101
came here to swim at night.

436
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:44,511
That just proves he was weak in the head.

437
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,606
Isn't it rather cold here?

438
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,217
Grandma says there's a water imp
living in the basin of the waterfall.

439
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:54,620
Stop it! Don't start a story like that.

440
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,886
Come on, let's eat our lunch.

441
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:09,002
By the way,
what will you do if you go to Hawaii?

442
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,302
First of all, eat a pineapple.

443
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:14,103
You've sure got a limited imagination.

444
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:17,874
Maybe it's only natural,
since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi.

445
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:21,076
You are his double,
including being weak in the head.

446
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,551
He was only joking.

447
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,347
Tateo, what do you want to do?

448
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:28,983
What else is there? He'll devote himself
to flirting with Clark's daughter.

449
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,617
Will you propose to her?

450
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:33,288
Don't be stupid!
Emily is one of our relatives.

451
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:37,299
She's related by blood to Grandma.
Marrying her is out of the question.

452
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:39,426
You don't even know a thing like that?

453
00:42:39,502 --> 00:42:42,267
According to Mendel's laws,
there's a high probability...

454
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:46,571
for the offspring of
a consanguineous marriage to be recessive.

455
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:49,043
In terms of eugenics, absolutely.

456
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:15,030
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew. See that?

457
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:16,333
Those eyes are....

458
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:48,699
Grandma is there, too. What are they doing?

459
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,535
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.

460
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:53,599
Now and then, old ladies get together
and hold a religious service...

461
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,167
for the souls of the departed.

462
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:58,112
That's why
there's no Buddhist altar at home.

463
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,172
It's already August.

464
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,014
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.

465
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:04,576
August 9.

466
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:07,222
Grandpa's death day.

467
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:33,779
I see there are other people who
have the same kind of idea as Grandma.

468
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,753
There are quite a few old people like that
around here. Suzukichi was one of them.

469
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:42,815
Although the point where the atom bomb
was dropped is quite far from here.

470
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:02,109
Snake eyes?

471
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:05,743
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing...

472
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:08,445
are not snake eyes.

473
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:12,583
They are the eyes of the flash.

474
00:45:34,376 --> 00:45:37,073
That's right. Around here...

475
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:44,178
on that day, when we heard
the air raid siren...

476
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:48,785
Suzukichi and me were looking...

477
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,625
towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.

478
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,462
Suddenly, the sky split in half
and glared at us.

479
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:07,867
A big eye...

480
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:10,736
peeped through the crack.

481
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:16,775
The big eye...

482
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:21,017
glared fiercely...

483
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:24,458
at both of us.

484
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:30,289
We just looked at the sky
like we were frozen.

485
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:37,439
With a tremendously big sound...

486
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,468
the ground started shaking.

487
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:48,308
Suzukichi was terrified. He didn't move.

488
00:46:49,118 --> 00:46:50,450
Staring...

489
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:54,813
with wide eyes at the sky.

490
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,994
After that, he was possessed by the eye.

491
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:11,866
He could see nothing else.

492
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:16,040
And he kept drawing that picture.

493
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:23,616
I can't forget that eye either.

494
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:33,995
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.

495
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,529
The moon also glitters,
but it's not frightening.

496
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,097
Moonlight is nice.

497
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,905
Yes, it was on a night just like tonight...

498
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:27,010
a strange thing happened--

499
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:28,277
Stop it!

500
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,581
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.

501
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:32,178
I never told...

502
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,283
you a scary story.

503
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:41,021
When I was in the kitchen,
I heard a feeble voice saying:

504
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:44,360
"Hello, hello."

505
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,202
I heard a feeble voice.

506
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:50,370
I looked...

507
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:53,409
and saw a strange boy poking his head in.

508
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:58,341
He said, "Your Suzukichi--"

509
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,641
Suzukichi again?

510
00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:05,587
"Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool...

511
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:07,689
"so I pulled him out...

512
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,890
"and carried him here.

513
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:13,190
"I put him on the grass over there."

514
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:15,458
This was what the little boy said.

515
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:20,859
He was a skinny little boy.

516
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,769
And sure enough,
he was soaking wet himself...

517
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:28,676
with water still dripping from his hair.

518
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,709
I was so shocked. I rushed out to see.

519
00:49:35,751 --> 00:49:36,980
I saw...

520
00:49:37,886 --> 00:49:40,219
Suzukichi lying there.

521
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,457
Looking quite dazed.

522
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:46,160
And what happened to the skinny little boy?

523
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:50,665
When I looked around...

524
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,067
he was gone.

525
00:49:56,105 --> 00:50:01,134
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have
carried Suzukichi all the way back here?

526
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:03,346
Because it was the water imp.

527
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:04,744
Water imp?

528
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:09,842
Later on, the village people
and my father talked about that.

529
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:15,054
But then they all came to the conclusion
that it was the water imp.

530
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,924
Those skinny, cucumber-like arms and legs.

531
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,832
And his green face, like a leaf.

532
00:50:25,634 --> 00:50:29,537
It couldn't possibly have been
anything else but the water imp.

533
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,382
Grandma is pretty good
at telling all those make-believe stories.

534
00:50:48,457 --> 00:50:51,017
Maybe it's our fault,
listening to her so seriously.

535
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:54,962
It's not make-believe, it's her dotage.
After all, consider her age.

536
00:50:57,866 --> 00:50:59,300
What happened?

537
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:01,769
The water imp was peeking in the window!

538
00:51:01,837 --> 00:51:03,601
Stop talking nonsense!

539
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,349
Shinjiro! Why, you....

540
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:39,070
Wait up!

541
00:52:10,105 --> 00:52:13,735
"Suzujiro confirmed the names
of his brothers.

542
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:18,211
"Please come to a definite decision
to come to Hawaii. Tadao."

543
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:21,684
What'll you do, Grandma?

544
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:24,481
I'll go.

545
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:31,585
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death
is coming pretty soon.

546
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,358
I will go after I hold
a memorial service for him.

547
00:53:00,455 --> 00:53:03,118
All right? What? Grandma decided to go?

548
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:06,059
Yes. You didn't see the telegram
telling you that?

549
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:10,726
No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent
while we were on the way back.

550
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:13,359
I guess we didn't have to come back
in such a hurry.

551
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:16,997
Thought it was impossible
for mere children to move Grandma.

552
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:21,610
Grandma said she'd go right after holding
a memorial service for Grandpa.

553
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:24,844
Did you write that in the telegram?

554
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,472
Yes, he did.

555
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:31,146
August 9 is the day Grandpa died
because of the atom bomb.

556
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:34,383
She'll go after
the memorial service on that day.

557
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:40,759
That's not advisable.

558
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:47,398
If Clark reads that telegram,
it's going to be pretty awkward, isn't it?

559
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:50,363
Why do you say that?

560
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:51,498
Why?

561
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:53,769
Because Clark is an American.

562
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:58,069
And after he finds out that Grandpa
was killed by the atom bomb...

563
00:53:58,814 --> 00:54:01,875
of course, it will make him feel
pretty awkward.

564
00:54:06,888 --> 00:54:08,550
We've got trouble.

565
00:54:09,858 --> 00:54:12,225
Father, you mean that you went there...

566
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:15,856
and didn't tell Suzujiro and Clark
and his family about Grandpa?

567
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:19,891
Of course not. It is something
that is not necessary to mention.

568
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:33,779
It's Father!

569
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:35,374
Sam and Mother!

570
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:39,577
Thanks...

571
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,749
for all your trouble.

572
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:44,122
I'll bet it was some trip for you, too.

573
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:47,094
Machino told me that you were coming
straight here.

574
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:51,395
Since I haven't seen Grandma for some time,
I decided to come and pay a visit.

575
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:56,237
Me too. I've been having Grandma
look after my kids all this time.

576
00:54:56,304 --> 00:54:58,068
So I must see her and thank her.

577
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,941
By the way, how was it in Hawaii?
I made a little inquiry and found out...

578
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,912
that the pineapple farm
is considerably large...

579
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,677
and the canning factory
that goes with it, too.

580
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:11,743
And tell me, Suzujiro's house,
I hear it's just like a castle. Is it?

581
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:14,781
Mother...

582
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:18,315
you have come here to see Grandma.
Why don't you ask about her?

583
00:55:54,763 --> 00:55:58,825
Tonight's dinner was quite a spread,
but it wasn't enjoyable, was it?

584
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:02,462
Because the grownups' chatter
wasn't enjoyable.

585
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,232
Let's eat their souvenir.

586
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:12,075
Tateo...

587
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:15,141
don't you find it strange?

588
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,049
Why do they hide
everything about Grandpa?

589
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,355
To put it nicely, they do that
out of consideration for Suzujiro and Clark.

590
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:27,795
And to put it not nicely, it's sort of
a diplomatic tactic and calculation.

591
00:56:27,863 --> 00:56:30,992
To put it straight,
they don't want to ruin the relationship...

592
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,968
with that rich family
that they've suddenly got.

593
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:39,674
Hold on. You mean that Grandma
is just being used as an excuse?

594
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:40,868
That's terrible.

595
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:43,639
That's the reality of being a grownup.

596
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:46,143
Still, I hate it.

597
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:49,442
Can you take it?

598
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:53,714
Me? Count me out.
I'm going to concentrate on this.

599
00:57:02,456 --> 00:57:05,824
At any rate, the pineapple farm
is tremendously vast.

600
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,959
It has eight thousand
and some hundred acres.

601
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:12,292
There are six huge chimneys soaring up
from the canning factory.

602
00:57:12,366 --> 00:57:15,495
There is this huge swimming pool
in the patio of the house.

603
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:18,004
Clark's wife got a swimsuit out
for me to use.

604
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,064
But you see, I can't swim.

605
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:24,310
And Clark took us on a tour
of the factory, too.

606
00:57:24,411 --> 00:57:27,074
Did you know the factory's agency
is in Tokyo?

607
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:30,777
I know that. They've got agencies
in every big city in the world.

608
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,945
Tell me, what is Clark's wife like?

609
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,320
A very nice person.
So different from rich Japanese wives.

610
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,088
She broke down all reserve in no time,
and looked after us like her family.

611
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,959
And why not?
After all, you are a blood relative.

612
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,794
I guess you're right.

613
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:48,927
And about the agency
of the canning factory.

614
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:52,628
I got the impression that Clark wants
me to work there.

615
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,477
And of course,
the post will be a good one, I imagine.

616
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:02,111
I'm thinking about it.

617
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:06,313
Since it is simply unbearable
to stay a clerk forever, you know.

618
00:58:08,722 --> 00:58:10,122
That's true.

619
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:15,852
Well, now, don't forget about me
when the time comes, all right?

620
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:19,834
Now let's have a drink.

621
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,526
Thank you.

622
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:24,228
What miserable men you are.

623
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:27,072
What is eating inside your heads?

624
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,833
You're just like beggars.

625
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:33,477
I am only going because...

626
00:58:33,547 --> 00:58:36,915
this man Suzujiro is my big brother.

627
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:41,483
And mind you, I am not going
to see him because he is rich.

628
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,938
Everybody, come over here!

629
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,205
What is it?

630
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:04,842
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!

631
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,828
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.

632
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:27,792
He always said watching the moon
washed his mind clean.

633
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:31,798
He often stood in the garden
and looked at the moon.

634
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:48,881
Grandma is certainly a lady
of firm character, isn't she?

635
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,286
No, she's just old-fashioned.

636
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:55,788
In short, she has an antiquated mind.

637
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:59,633
But still, the way she talks
is worthy of an educator.

638
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,525
I'm sure Grandpa was, also.

639
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:05,505
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.

640
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,138
And now...

641
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,171
we've upset Grandma.

642
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:10,971
I feel pretty bad.

643
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,940
You've got to do something about it.

644
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,505
Stop worrying.

645
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,808
She'll recover her mood pretty quick.

646
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:21,913
Still, what if she starts to say
she won't go to Hawaii again?

647
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,185
You know how stubborn she is.

648
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:26,318
I've got an idea.

649
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:31,422
Why don't you, Tadao, and Yoshie stay here
until the anniversary of Grandpa's death?

650
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:34,127
Devote yourselves to Grandma's service...

651
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:37,130
and send her to Hawaii in a good mood.

652
01:00:38,438 --> 01:00:41,272
I can't do that.
I've got work to do at the office.

653
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:44,368
Why not? You've still got
some summer vacation left.

654
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:45,741
And besides...

655
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:50,147
if the circumstances require, there's
a road open to the canning company, right?

656
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:55,584
But I've got to get passports
for Grandma and the children.

657
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:58,490
Don't worry about that.
I will take care of it myself.

658
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,859
Keeping Grandma in a good mood
is our first priority.

659
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:06,158
If she starts to say that she won't go again,
it'll be a serious problem.

660
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:21,172
"I received your telegram.

661
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:23,945
"Clark will come right away, Suzujiro."

662
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:37,923
I knew that telegram would mess things up.

663
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:41,431
Americans do resent being reminded
of the atom bomb.

664
01:01:41,768 --> 01:01:45,136
Japanese-Americans are
especially sensitive about it.

665
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:49,075
I think they feel embarrassed
by the Americans.

666
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,284
I wonder why Clark is coming here?

667
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,945
Well, that's....

668
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:01,851
He's probably coming...

669
01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:04,653
to wind up this matter once and for all.

670
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,521
I see.

671
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:10,921
To tell us to forget the whole thing.

672
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:16,498
By the way, I guess I must be going, now.

673
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:21,969
Then I think I'd better be going, too.

674
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:24,841
Since my being here is useless.

675
01:02:25,345 --> 01:02:27,246
You don't mind, do you?

676
01:02:27,614 --> 01:02:30,277
I must say, what a letdown.

677
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:34,046
Really, all that trouble for nothing.

678
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,990
It's your fault,
sending a telegram like that.

679
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:39,549
That's enough!

680
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,821
Don't you blame Tateo.

681
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,724
I made him write that.

682
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,261
But...

683
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:52,300
I don't see what is wrong
about writing the truth.

684
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:54,001
Stupid!

685
01:02:56,043 --> 01:03:00,344
They did drop the atom bomb,
and they resent being reminded of it?

686
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:04,514
If they don't like it,
they don't have to remember it.

687
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:07,486
But I can't have them pretending ignorance.

688
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,323
They claim they dropped
the flash to stop war.

689
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:16,395
It's already been 45 years now.

690
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,832
But the flash hasn't stopped war.

691
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:22,830
They're still killing people!

692
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:27,598
But you know...

693
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:30,105
war is to blame.

694
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,444
People do anything...

695
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,212
just to win a war.

696
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,884
Sooner or later,
it will be the ruin of all of us.

697
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:04,737
Now, let's go to the arrival lobby.

698
01:04:04,811 --> 01:04:07,576
There's still time before he comes out.

699
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:08,842
But....

700
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:27,765
I feel sort of depressed.

701
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:32,600
If he came here
because of what my mother said...

702
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:35,300
I don't want to meet Clark.

703
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:39,573
Shall we run away?

704
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:00,764
I feel really awkward
about introducing Clark to Grandma.

705
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,827
So do I. But it can't be helped.

706
01:05:23,623 --> 01:05:28,027
Don't you think what we are doing
might not be the right thing to do to Clark?

707
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,426
Who cares?

708
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:33,225
He just came to finish off
the relationship with Grandma.

709
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:46,513
- Hello!
- Hello!

710
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,748
Thank you.

711
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:54,444
Why didn't you tell us...

712
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:58,120
about Uncle?

713
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,256
I wish I had known.

714
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:03,993
When we found out...

715
01:06:04,898 --> 01:06:06,389
about Uncle...

716
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:08,702
we all cried.

717
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:21,807
Looking at Nagasaki, it's hard to believe
this is where the bomb was dropped.

718
01:06:21,882 --> 01:06:25,410
People do forget everything,
and so quickly, too.

719
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,589
But I will never forget!

720
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,981
Say, let's go back there once more.

721
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:34,658
You mean, that school?

722
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:37,396
Yes. Let's go to Grandpa's place.

723
01:06:43,803 --> 01:06:46,238
Where is Nagasaki?

724
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:48,104
We can't see it yet.

725
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:50,370
It's on the other side of that mountain.

726
01:06:52,879 --> 01:06:55,576
I wonder what happened to the children?

727
01:06:57,617 --> 01:07:00,712
They didn't want to meet Clark.
That's for sure.

728
01:07:01,821 --> 01:07:03,551
It's all our fault.

729
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:05,652
Our...

730
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:09,393
stupidity.

731
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:11,322
But Clark....

732
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,196
We didn't think that.

733
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:20,173
Clark, is there any place that you
would like to see in Nagasaki?

734
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,365
Yes, there is.

735
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:25,840
So, we'll go to the hotel, and then....

736
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:28,815
I don't need a hotel.

737
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:32,642
I'm going to stay at Aunty's place.

738
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:38,520
Before that,
there's a place I'd like to see.

739
01:07:42,262 --> 01:07:44,356
The place where Uncle died.

740
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,356
What? You were all here?

741
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:20,156
Clark came to apologize to Grandma.

742
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:24,295
He found out about Grandpa
by reading that telegram.

743
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:26,340
But Father, you said....

744
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,837
I'm sorry. It was because I was stupid.

745
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,440
Hello.

746
01:08:39,652 --> 01:08:43,214
My son, Tateo, and my daughter, Minako.

747
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:47,056
I'm Clark. How do you do?

748
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:50,957
My son, Shinjiro.

749
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:54,595
My daughter.

750
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,335
They're adorable.

751
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:00,500
I'm so happy to meet you.

752
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:03,901
After August 9...

753
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:06,575
let's all go...

754
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:10,112
to Hawaii with Aunty.

755
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:28,366
My uncle....

756
01:09:29,102 --> 01:09:30,468
Right here?

757
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:37,099
And this is...

758
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:44,111
the monument built for the children
who died on that day.

759
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:07,571
With these children...

760
01:10:08,942 --> 01:10:12,310
my uncle died.

761
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,742
Just where did it happen?

762
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:23,385
That's something we just can't find.

763
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,115
You can't find?

764
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:28,493
That day...

765
01:10:29,496 --> 01:10:31,692
the whole town was in flames.

766
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:36,732
And this place was filled with people
who came here to try and escape from it.

767
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:40,930
But the school had also been burned.

768
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:43,834
The people were burned.

769
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:47,340
Iron, everything.

770
01:13:35,782 --> 01:13:40,345
These people are the classmates
of the children who died here.

771
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:44,022
These people....

772
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,956
Somehow, they scare me.

773
01:13:46,592 --> 01:13:48,083
It's because...

774
01:13:48,528 --> 01:13:51,726
those are the people
who witnessed the worst fear.

775
01:13:58,871 --> 01:14:01,466
Seeing these people....

776
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:06,339
Nagasaki.... That day....

777
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,138
I can feel it.

778
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:30,562
Okay.

779
01:14:30,803 --> 01:14:34,240
Even if it's okay for you,
it's still too short for Clark.

780
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:36,276
His feet will stick out.

781
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:39,077
He's the same size as John Wayne.

782
01:14:39,846 --> 01:14:42,338
How about using this to add length?

783
01:14:57,363 --> 01:14:59,662
We did make fools of ourselves.

784
01:14:59,732 --> 01:15:01,462
Don't you think so?

785
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:03,632
I guess you're right.

786
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:05,801
I really feel ashamed.

787
01:15:06,339 --> 01:15:07,602
Where's Clark?

788
01:15:07,673 --> 01:15:10,165
He stepped out into the garden
with Grandma.

789
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:14,044
I wonder if it's all right.
I wonder if they can communicate.

790
01:15:14,347 --> 01:15:17,977
I think it's all right.
They seem to be talking just fine.

791
01:15:28,461 --> 01:15:32,523
I am terribly sorry
for not knowing about Uncle.

792
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,331
I'm really sorry.

793
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,168
That's all right.

794
01:15:44,877 --> 01:15:47,847
You were born and live in Nagasaki.

795
01:15:50,716 --> 01:15:52,116
And still...

796
01:15:52,752 --> 01:15:54,948
we didn't realize it.

797
01:15:57,824 --> 01:15:59,622
That was wrong of us.

798
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,988
We were wrong.

799
01:16:05,765 --> 01:16:07,393
That's all right.

800
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:15,869
My father told me...

801
01:16:17,844 --> 01:16:19,779
"Clark, go...

802
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:25,543
"and do whatever you can for your aunt."

803
01:16:27,553 --> 01:16:29,317
That's what he said.

804
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:32,885
That's all right.

805
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:35,421
This is just fine.

806
01:16:38,931 --> 01:16:40,695
Thank you very much.

807
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:44,263
No. Thank you very much.

808
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:47,364
You've made me very happy.

809
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:49,969
Very, very happy.

810
01:16:54,814 --> 01:16:56,077
Where's Clark?

811
01:16:56,148 --> 01:16:58,617
He's talking to Grandma,
sitting on the bench.

812
01:16:58,684 --> 01:17:00,346
I saw them shake hands.

813
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:04,855
I feel as though I saw something very nice.

814
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:06,552
That's wonderful!

815
01:17:09,161 --> 01:17:13,895
<i>And the boy a rose did see</i>

816
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,030
The tone, it's all fixed!

817
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:19,072
Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?

818
01:17:19,138 --> 01:17:20,663
How about that?

819
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,572
Let's sing!

820
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:29,407
<i>And the boy a rose did see</i>

821
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:33,916
<i>A rose standing in the field</i>

822
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:38,649
<i>Blossoming in innocence</i>

823
01:17:38,724 --> 01:17:42,855
<i>Awed by the color it did yield</i>

824
01:17:43,062 --> 01:17:48,091
<i>A never-ending fascination</i>

825
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:54,368
<i>For the crimson color</i>

826
01:17:55,575 --> 01:18:01,378
<i>Of the rose standing in the field</i>

827
01:18:03,249 --> 01:18:05,013
Bravo!

828
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:08,816
You sound like angels. This was amazing.

829
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:31,838
Is this Uncle's room?

830
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,308
This is your bed.

831
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:37,815
Oh, my God.

832
01:18:39,352 --> 01:18:40,445
Okay?

833
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:43,186
Okay.

834
01:18:47,093 --> 01:18:48,322
Not bad!

835
01:18:58,904 --> 01:19:01,396
I better try it, shouldn't I?

836
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,873
Oh, yeah!

837
01:19:06,712 --> 01:19:09,580
This is a bed. This is a real bed.

838
01:19:15,488 --> 01:19:17,286
What's that up there?

839
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:25,429
- Is there a picture of Uncle?
- Yeah, here.

840
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:30,131
And here.

841
01:19:42,581 --> 01:19:44,174
This is Grandpa.

842
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:49,653
Very young.

843
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:53,115
Forty-five years ago.

844
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:58,661
This picture was taken the same year...

845
01:20:01,434 --> 01:20:03,027
he died.

846
01:21:08,634 --> 01:21:10,535
Those large letters....

847
01:21:11,403 --> 01:21:13,065
What do they mean?

848
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,244
"Let us all meet again
to join in the beyond."

849
01:23:37,516 --> 01:23:40,111
A sea bream ascending a waterfall.

850
01:23:41,754 --> 01:23:45,282
That's not right. It's carp.

851
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:47,526
A carp ascending a waterfall.

852
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:51,992
Darn it! I made a mistake.

853
01:23:52,064 --> 01:23:53,828
Clark-san!

854
01:23:58,437 --> 01:23:59,837
What's this?

855
01:24:07,846 --> 01:24:09,474
Clark's father...

856
01:24:10,316 --> 01:24:12,308
Suzujiro-san passed away.

857
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:47,485
It's Clark-san.

858
01:24:53,826 --> 01:24:57,228
Clark-san is gone.
He took a different plane.

859
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,330
We're home.

860
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:22,415
Clark sincerely regretted it.

861
01:25:23,422 --> 01:25:27,223
Saying that it's almost unbearable
having to leave like that.

862
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:31,586
Big Brother...

863
01:25:32,564 --> 01:25:33,862
I'm sorry.

864
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:38,002
I wish I'd come to see you sooner.

865
01:25:59,224 --> 01:26:01,887
Big Brother!

866
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:05,430
Did you come to see me?

867
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:43,035
You'd better hurry
or you'll miss your plane.

868
01:26:43,102 --> 01:26:45,196
No. I've decided not to go.

869
01:26:46,705 --> 01:26:48,196
But what about your work?

870
01:26:48,273 --> 01:26:51,266
Shinjiro, you go and see
how Grandma is doing.

871
01:26:54,413 --> 01:26:57,008
Is something the matter with Grandma?

872
01:26:59,184 --> 01:27:01,210
There's something strange!

873
01:27:05,324 --> 01:27:08,055
Grandma is sleeping. Snoring up a storm!

874
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:20,003
How is she?

875
01:27:21,607 --> 01:27:24,600
She ate some rice porridge,
but she's asleep again.

876
01:27:27,713 --> 01:27:29,682
Shall we go to bed, too?

877
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:36,684
It looks like we're going to have some rain.
Shall we close the sliding doors?

878
01:27:58,076 --> 01:27:59,305
Grandma!

879
01:28:02,981 --> 01:28:03,971
The bomb!

880
01:28:04,049 --> 01:28:05,642
What's the matter, Grandma?

881
01:28:05,717 --> 01:28:07,709
Grandma! What's going on?

882
01:28:07,786 --> 01:28:10,950
It's the bomb!
You two, quick! Put this over you.

883
01:28:11,823 --> 01:28:13,849
This is best for the bomb!

884
01:28:14,726 --> 01:28:18,959
There're many who survived because
they were wearing something white!

885
01:28:45,724 --> 01:28:47,056
The sooner, the better.

886
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:49,151
Let's take her to the hospital right away!

887
01:28:49,228 --> 01:28:51,129
She's sound asleep now.

888
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:54,698
Maybe we should leave her as she is
a little longer.

889
01:28:55,834 --> 01:28:57,063
Brother.

890
01:29:12,017 --> 01:29:13,781
Grandma isn't there!

891
01:29:21,026 --> 01:29:22,255
These....

892
01:29:22,327 --> 01:29:24,193
They're Grandpa's clothes.

893
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:27,932
But why spread them out like this?

894
01:29:29,768 --> 01:29:32,932
The clock in Grandma's head
is running in reverse.

895
01:29:33,005 --> 01:29:36,305
So now, she is slipping back
to the time of Grandpa.

896
01:29:47,786 --> 01:29:48,947
Hello!

897
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:50,080
Yes?

898
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:57,361
Just a little while ago,
your Grandma came to my place.

899
01:29:57,729 --> 01:29:59,254
Then...

900
01:29:59,831 --> 01:30:03,859
she saw the clouds and took off in a hurry.
She was headed for Nagasaki.

901
01:30:03,935 --> 01:30:05,528
Today's clouds...

902
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:08,368
look exactly like they did on that day.

903
01:30:08,607 --> 01:30:11,805
Maybe she remembered
what happened on that day.

904
01:30:13,478 --> 01:30:16,539
No, I mean,
she thinks she's reliving that day.

905
01:32:47,032 --> 01:32:48,694
Grandma!

906
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:50,429
Grandma!

907
01:32:53,071 --> 01:32:57,099
<i>And the boy a rose did see</i>

908
01:32:57,175 --> 01:33:01,237
<i>A rose standing in the field</i>

909
01:33:01,346 --> 01:33:05,283
<i>Blossoming in innocence</i>

910
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:10,955
<i>Awed by the color it did yield</i>

911
01:33:11,323 --> 01:33:16,023
<i>A never-ending fascination</i>

912
01:33:17,629 --> 01:33:21,794
<i>For the crimson color</i>

913
01:33:23,902 --> 01:33:28,203
<i>Of the rose standing in the field</i>
