Can you give me
my shoes, please.

00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,286
Hey!

5
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:30,350
Wait. I need to do something.

Wherever you are! I'm Marga Castro

Vangie Sis!

Vangie -Sis!

15
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:18,400
Where's my cardigan?

16
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:20,932
The one I told you
to wash last week.

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,473
Never mind!

18
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:29,578
<i>Left where, where to search now.</i>

19
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,279
To start of the week, we have some very
interesting guests here in today's show

20
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,357
to discuss a topic that viewers
will surely relate to!

21
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,695
Now, the question is...

22
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,136
do you really need a partner
to be happy in life?

23
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:44,023
Ma'am, here it is.

24
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:48,593
Is a life alone the lifestyle
choice of today's society?

25
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:54,069
Is it true that nowadays,
people living alone are happier

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,465
than people in a relationship

27
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,276
- or someone living a family life?
- Who the hell is that?

28
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,522
This won't take long, please.

29
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,707
You can swallow your
cellphone if you want to!

30
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,114
Please, wait. This is important.

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,845
Mayor Lani!

32
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,654
- Hi!
- Tristan! Good morning! How are you?

33
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:13,223
Good morning. I'm good.
You look great as usual.

34
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,484
Thank you. Give my love
to ‘Fta Isabel, okay?

35
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,692
- Sure. I'll tell her that. Take care!
- Bye!

36
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,609
Hey, are we on for tonight?

37
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,281
Is there a change of plan?

38
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,146
I don't know about you. You
might have other plans.

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,118
I'm good. We'll ﬁnish early
at our client meeting.

40
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,020
- Are you going to pick me up?
- But you're the one who has a car.

41
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,555
Pick me up instead.

42
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,123
You're so cheap!

43
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,262
Bye! I have to go.

44
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,567
Sis, I already ran
out of credit load.

45
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,236
Oh well!

46
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,039
Ma, she didn't give me money!

47
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,897
Mama!

48
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:06,068
<i>Why think, why stop.</i>

49
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,106
- Sorry, miss!
- The hell!

50
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,115
Big ass stupid!

51
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,848
I don't know if I can go.

52
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,718
Sophie, it's her birthday!

53
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,993
You weren't there last Christmas. You
weren't there for ‘Fto Anding‘s birthday.

54
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,122
Okay. Okay. I'll go.

55
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:28,301
Before this becomes another
major issue. I'll go.

56
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,798
- You know it's gonna mean a lotto her if...
- I know.

57
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,766
I'm going, okay?

58
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,671
What else?

59
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,070
Be there at 8.

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,202
You can bring your
husband if you want.

61
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,278
Yeah. Anyway... I have to go.

62
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,946
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

63
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,658
Good morning, ma'am.
You're done for today?

64
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,222
Not yet. I'll do
some cardio ﬁrst.

65
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,523
Your phone's ringing.

66
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,229
Oh, don't mind it.

67
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,889
- I'll go ahead.
- Alright.

68
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,802
Cellphone all day?

69
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,335
Quit that.

70
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,005
Madame's been giving
you a hard eye.

71
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,345
Are you going to
have dinner here?

72
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,482
I'll be staying late at the
prayer meeting tonight.

73
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,215
Ma! How many times a week do
you go to that prayer meeting?

74
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,578
You just went to
church yesterday.

75
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,753
Lord might soon take
you away with Him.

76
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,059
Miss Schulmann?

77
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,095
I'm Tracy, the assistant of Mr.
Pineda.

78
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,664
He sent me to meet you.

79
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:35,732
You're late.

80
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,093
What the hell is your problem?!
I'm working!

81
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,472
Why are you mad at me?
I'm just asking.

82
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,971
Then why do you keep calling?!

83
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,677
- Are you monitoring me?!
- What do you mean?!

84
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,675
Am I not allowed to call you?!

85
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,647
Dammit!

86
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,447
We're on-air!

87
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:56,284
You've been hiding in the corner
whispering to your damn cellphone!

88
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,922
What if I shove
it up your mouth!

89
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,454
It's super emergency.

90
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,929
I'll just call you later.

91
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,436
- Ls this a long distance call?
- No, I just got here half an hour ago.

92
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,396
So how long will you
be here in Manila for?

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,707
Around 5 days then I'll
ﬂy back to Hong Kong.

94
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,370
Can I see you tonight?

95
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:20,712
Why?

96
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,780
You're asking me why I want
to meet up with you tonight.

97
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,308
Well, I just have meeting
that'll finish around

98
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,776
8 or 9 and then I'm free.

99
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,621
Perfect. I have dinner.
It's my mom's birthday.

100
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,358
Oh tell her, I say
happy birthday.

101
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,557
Is the Power Point
presentation ready?

102
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,354
Yes, it's ready.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,093
Will you relax?! You're
getting me tense as well!

104
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,426
I have to go. Just load up
endorphins there at the gym.

105
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,735
I'm near the ofﬁce.

106
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,538
Okay.

107
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,072
Watch it!

108
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,345
Thank you so much for keeping me company
on this beautiful Monday morning!

109
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,777
Until tomorrow, this
has been Marga Castro,

110
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,951
wishing everybody a
great week ahead!

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,282
Keep on smiling!

112
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:08,621
Cut!

113
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,427
What the?! Take this lapel off me!
Dammit! This is irritating!

114
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,968
What the?!

115
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:19,071
You, you and you. I want to
see you in my office now!

116
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,405
Ma'am, can I have your sign?

117
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,274
Get out of my way!

118
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,709
I told you! If she says take
it off, then take it off!

119
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,053
What's this serendipity
thing you're saying?!

120
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:40,226
Come on, Peachy. Don't you
know what serendipity means?!

121
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,688
Google it, girl!

122
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,624
And who's that one you
were eyeing earlier?

123
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,336
- Gay!
- Ugly!

124
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:56,134
Do you think people will watch
us early in the morning

125
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,803
if our guests are so ugly?

126
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,709
I mean, how are you supposed to
get an appetite for breakfast

127
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:08,015
if you're watching two fat and ugly
and even horribly dressed women

128
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,146
who are single because
nobody wants to fuck

129
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,753
fat ugly women!

130
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
Well?

131
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,198
Is there anybody wants
to say anything?

132
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,763
You know what, sis?
He's just so handsome!

133
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,967
My panty almost dropped!

134
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,039
His clothes suit him very well!

135
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,677
He's wearing a long
sleeves stripes shirt

136
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:36,014
in black pants and
leather shoes!

137
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,317
It's because we're actually
gunning for substance.

138
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,020
Oh yeah, she's right.
Substance. Yeah.

139
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,253
That's right.

140
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:52,396
But the topic of our show
is about single women

141
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,589
who choose to be single!

142
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,691
Those two women on
our show today,

143
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,527
did not choose to be single!

144
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,099
They had no choice to be single!

145
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,971
Because they're ugly! They're even fat!
They're like roasted pigs in La Lorna!

146
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:08,106
Sorry.

147
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,042
Do you think I'm being funny?

148
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:14,851
No.

149
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:15,951
Sure?

150
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,616
You're insulting me!

151
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:23,420
My God.

152
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,703
Yes? Who are you?

153
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,667
Why are you watching
my monologue?

154
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:35,203
And then, we were
together at the elevator.

155
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,112
Our own ﬂesh touched each other.

156
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,312
And then?

157
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,709
Peachy!

158
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,619
We just had our
physical contact!

159
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,621
That damn guy smells so good!

160
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,325
T-TH-S, he wears Prada.

161
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,619
M-W-F, Burberry.

162
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,489
I love it!

163
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:57,322
Chloe, you're too much!

164
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,659
Are you serious? You're
really sniffing him?

165
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:01,924
Why not?

166
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,497
Madame, she's Tita
Judy's assistant.

167
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,901
Yes? What can I do for you?

168
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:12,170
‘Tita Judy's asking for you.

169
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:13,379
Right now?

170
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,584
She said now. She's waiting
for you at her office.

171
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,149
Okay, thank you.

172
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,483
- Is this the group of Image Plus?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:25,688
- Mr. Valderama.
- Hi.

174
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:29,417
I'm Raissa Montelibano. I'm the
Managing Director of Image Plus.

175
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,319
- Okay.
- And this is Sabrina Madrilejos.

176
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,698
She's our Senior Creative Director for...
Have we met before?

177
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,065
Have I seen you?

178
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,299
I don't think so.

179
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,710
Are you sure we've never
bumped into each other before?

180
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,248
I would've remembered
if were so.

181
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,986
I'm mixing you up
with somebody else.

182
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,293
Anyways, you may proceed.

183
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,524
Dan, Tristan called.

184
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,758
It's my mom's birthday.

185
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,531
We'll have dinner there.

186
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:09,900
Okay.

187
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,835
Tell her happy birthday.

188
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:22,140
Do you trust your boyfriend
one hundred percent?

189
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,383
Of course.

190
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,214
You know what's difﬁcult about your
situation? It's your boyfriend's job.

191
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,289
There's so many temptations!

192
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,457
Muscular, macho, ﬁt!

193
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,256
Of course! That's his job.
Get people fit.

194
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,796
Surrounded by hungry
women at the gym!

195
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,791
They can even smell his sweat.

196
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:43,862
Wait a minute!

197
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,199
My boyfriend's a personal
trainer, not a gigolo!

198
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,069
Oh.

199
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:55,407
Valhalla Tower. Exclusivity with
accessibility and availability.

200
00:10:55,705 --> 00:11:00,484
When you talk about the Valhalla Tower, you
immediately think of the fabulous life,

201
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,286
high-end living with
the best and ﬁnest

202
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,050
that is Vortex
Development Corporation.

203
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,984
Two icons who's
achievements and lifestyles

204
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,226
best represent the
kind of living

205
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:17,201
that people can expect when they become a
part of the Valhalla Towers Community.

206
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:22,536
Star athlete, top commercial model,
triathlon hero, Rainier Granada.

207
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:29,511
Beauty queen, blogger, model and
one-time tv personality, Tara Arambulo.

208
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,409
...for the arrival
of the guests.

209
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,587
Excuse me, Miss Schulmann.

210
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,781
It's Miss Castro
again, Miss Schulmann.

211
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,047
Excuse me.

212
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,583
This better be good. I'm in the middle
of a very important brieﬁng right now.

213
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,895
I'm going crazy, Val!
I'm going crazy!

214
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:48,699
Marga, you can't go crazy because
you've been crazy a long time ago!

215
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,238
My career is so over.

216
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,241
You're such a drama queen.

217
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,938
You also said that when you broke
up with your congressman boyfriend.

218
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:04,517
No. This is different.

219
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,850
There are lots of TV stations
you can transfer to, right?

220
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,556
With your experience, you
will surely ﬁnd a job.

221
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,852
You guys aren't in the business
that's why you won't understand.

222
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,994
They're like a maﬁa.

223
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,760
It's hard to transfer to another network
because they each have their own kingdom,

224
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,731
territory.

225
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,930
And I can't afford to
lose my job right now!

226
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,736
So what's your plan now?

227
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:32,343
I hope that monster Marga
Castro gets her karma!

228
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:36,697
I hope she gets crashed by
a piano, a steamroller,

229
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,282
or even the broadcast
tower of our station!

230
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:44,147
But you already announced to Facebook
that you're in a relationship.

231
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:48,862
You can even announce it on TV Patrol
or Saksi that you now have a boyfriend!

232
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,331
Even my mom gave me a warning.

233
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,067
Here's what she told me.

234
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,492
My child, let me be frank.

235
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,835
You're not that pretty.

236
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:03,907
In case you thought you're drop
dead gorgeous, well, it's not true.

237
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,978
Really? Your mom said that?

238
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,978
Too bad, Daniel
isn't here, Sophie.

239
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,947
He had a previous appointment.

240
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,487
By the way, Tristan, how's
everything with you?

241
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,180
I'm good, Tito.
Everything3 good.

242
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:19,714
Tristan said he's going to join
us in Europe this Christmas.

243
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,319
Morn, that's still tentative.

244
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:22,951
I still have to fix my schedule.

245
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,454
Make it happen!

246
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:27,099
It's more fun if we're all
together this Christmas.

247
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,634
How about you, Sophie?

248
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,527
My husband won't let me.

249
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,737
Why not?

250
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,195
Oh, well.

251
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,207
Where can we go this time?

252
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,139
Ma, we can go to Venice.

253
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,275
- Venice.
- Yes.

254
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,371
But Venice is like...
Everybody's there.

255
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,913
Oh no, we can go
to Rome instead.

256
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,881
Or Greece. Let's go to Greece.
In Vatican.

257
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,354
The show's ratings are very low.

258
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,158
These people would rather watch
cartoons than watch my show.

259
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,651
Your show is at seven
in the morning.

260
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,996
That's exactly my point!

261
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:04,326
People would rather watch old
episodes of Popeye and Sponge Bob

262
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,470
than watch me in the morning.

263
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,741
How do you think
that makes me feel?

264
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,178
Morn also said

265
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:18,284
beware of your boyfriend because good
looking ones can only cause headaches.

266
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,511
They attract kitties.

267
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,618
Girl! Your mother's
one of a kind!

268
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:26,714
I envy my friend Winston,
the writer of our show.

269
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,855
His boyfriend's really good looking!
And he's kind too!

270
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,997
Those damn queers are
happier than us, girls!

271
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,062
Even good looking
guys are now queers!

272
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:41,297
It's like a spreading deadly
virus without a vaccine!

273
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,669
It could be an evolution since
there's too many people now!

274
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,839
Number of queers are getting high
so that no one will give birth

275
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,212
and the world population
will ﬁnally be controlled.

276
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,520
That's the solution to the
problem of the Philippines!

277
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:02,388
Not the RH law, but spread all
gays, queers, fairies instead!

278
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,825
The management gave me one month
to improve the ratings of my show.

279
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:10,135
Or else, the show
will get suspended.

280
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,400
What?

281
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,297
So they're cancelling the show?

282
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,145
You know what, I knew that.

283
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,943
Eventually, all these
things will come to that.

284
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,377
Even the brightest, most
popular, biggest stars,

285
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,050
one day, will be irrelevant.

286
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,585
But...

287
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:39,221
I am too young and too
beautiful to be irrelevant.

288
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,891
Right?

289
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,037
Yeah.

290
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,040
Yeah.

291
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:52,971
I don't know how you do it. You work and
then you study law at the same time!

292
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,716
You know what it's called?
Extreme necessity.

293
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,213
I don't have a sponsor to
help me through school.

294
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,687
I have few relatives but

295
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,922
all of them are
below poverty line.

296
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,059
That's why I'm amazed
with you, best friend!

297
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,061
Sabs, I have news for you.

298
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,337
I got the scholarship.

299
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:27,371
Really?

300
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,281
Dammit! He rejected my call!

301
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,914
Hey! Who's getting into
your nerve this time?!

302
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,690
What took you so long?!

303
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,520
I've been emoting here!

304
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:47,455
Girl! My officemate loves to show off!
She ﬁnished something first. Such a VIP!

305
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,402
Oh well! Here are my friends.

306
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,092
- Peachy and Chloe.
- Hi!

307
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,731
- He‘s Winston.
- Winston.

308
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,635
He's our writer. He's the one I've told
you about who has a cute boyfriend.

309
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,274
- Come on! Sit here!
- Oh not too much!

310
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,109
Well, where is he anyway?

311
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,012
He's just parking the car. We just
wanted to make sure you're still here.

312
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,381
You guys might've left already.

313
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,949
- You can order now.
- Love.

314
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,028
She hasn't forgiven me still
for leaving you and her,

315
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,793
for leaving you and your dad.

316
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,734
Ma, can we not talk
about this, please?

317
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,729
I'm worried about her.

318
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,072
She married the wrong man.

319
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,342
You know, ma...

320
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:37,179
She's old enough to make her
own decisions in life, okay?

321
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,613
Why aren't they
having children yet?

322
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:43,181
Did she consult a doctor?

323
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,852
Who's got a problem?

324
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,063
Oh My God. Peachy!
Look who's coming!

325
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,629
What is he doing here?

326
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,234
Why? You know Yves?

327
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,106
Baby!

328
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,869
This is Yves. Okay?

329
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,481
- This is Amelie. I work with her. Yves.
- Hi!

330
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,915
And these are her friends.

331
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,042
Peachy and Chloe.

332
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:14,476
You look familiar.

333
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,620
You work at V Tower
I too, right?

334
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,584
So you know him already!

335
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:21,594
- He's just sweet!
- You can order now.

336
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,285
Go. Go. Go.

337
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,838
About how many years
will you be gone?

338
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,476
Maybe three or four years.

339
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,113
It depends.

340
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,179
That'll be quick.

341
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:53,720
You want to have coffee ﬁrst?

342
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,824
Let's go home. Come on.

343
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:19,585
<i>HEY.</i>

344
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:22,621
What's up?

345
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,619
So what time will you
be up tomorrow morning?

346
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,956
Well, I have an eight
o'clock meeting.

347
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,985
Eight o'clock?

348
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:44,940
Okay, let's go.

349
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,140
We're here. You can go now.

350
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,543
You can take that ride.

351
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,011
Why are you so quiet?

352
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:53,217
What?

353
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,454
You've been quiet.

354
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,781
What am I supposed to talk about
that I haven't told you yet?

355
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,960
We've been together all night.

356
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,236
<i>Nines!</i>

357
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,601
Congratulations for
your scholarship!

358
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,950
Have they exhausted
all the possibilities?

359
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,323
He isn't cooperating.

360
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,862
Huh? I thought he's the one
who want to have kids.

361
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,125
What happened?

362
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,730
I know. He's just
blaming my sister.

363
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:43,461
They've been married for ﬁve
years and still no children.

364
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:48,173
But it's not your sister's fault
that she can't have children.

365
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,177
Tell her husband that.

366
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,108
How about you?

367
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:01,882
You want to have kids?

368
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,021
What?

369
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:04,620
What kind of question is that?

370
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,523
It's a simple question.

371
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,020
You want to have kids?

372
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:10,924
I don't know. I guess.

373
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,798
I'm not thinking about it.

374
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,332
Why not?

375
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,935
You don't want to have a family?

376
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:19,428
I guess.

377
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,234
In the future. Maybe. Yeah.

378
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,241
I don't believe he's
with Amelie's friend!

379
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:30,647
I can see he doesn't really
like to be with that cheap gay!

380
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,650
What?! You think he goes out with
Winston just out of kindness?!

381
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,388
I know Yves is not gay!

382
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,049
You're just judgmental!

383
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
Then what?

384
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,222
Let's just say he's
a neat person.

385
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,861
He's cultured. Refined!

386
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,157
Educated, gentleman!

387
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,924
What are you talking about?!

388
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,933
Cleolilde, didn't you see
what they were doing?!

389
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,696
How did you two meet?

390
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,600
It's exciting. It's in Boracay!

391
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,208
WOW!

392
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,911
The boys at Station 2
were gauging up on me.

393
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,746
They're so cheap!

394
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,749
He came to my rescue!

395
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:09,613
Yes! The only thing missing is a
horse and a sunset! Right, baby?

396
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,192
After that, we got drunk.

397
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:16,322
They didn't do anything but grab
themselves and ﬂirt with each other!

398
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:21,500
They don't even care holding each
other's hands under the table!

399
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,298
They weren't holding hands!

400
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,598
He was just touching and
massaging his hands!

401
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,637
They call that acupressure!

402
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,811
It seemed that your prayer meeting
finished too late last night.

403
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:37,074
I was home earlier than you are.

404
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,979
Pastor Mike and I have been
doing a lot of things.

405
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,423
What's keeping you both
busy to ﬁnish that late?

406
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,150
Oh, we have lots of projects.

407
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,926
Like?

408
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,021
Why are you asking me
too many questions?

409
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,993
Why? Ls it bad to ask?!

410
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:58,471
I'd like to have a major
press conference tomorrow.

411
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,971
Why are you asking for
a press conference?

412
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:06,340
I can't tell you because
it's conﬁdential.

413
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,477
But I do have few
announcements to make.

414
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:13,948
Madame, are you retiring?!

415
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,114
Why would I retire? Why?

416
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,287
Am I irrelevant?

417
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:20,493
Oh! Those aren't my words.

418
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:25,157
- What?!
- Check Secret Manila's site!

419
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,963
Oh shit!

420
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,064
Sophie.

421
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:35,339
Sophie.

422
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,707
Yeah?

423
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:41,279
Now that that gossip about that
triﬂer beauty queen is already out,

424
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:44,048
how is that not going
to affect our pitch?!

425
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,219
Chill. Okay? Chill!

426
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:52,682
Apparently, 70% of Filipino males are
getting crazy over this slut beauty queen.

427
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:56,192
Ranging from the ages 11 to 111.

428
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,987
She's the 'it girl“
of the moment!

429
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,822
The object of fantasy of every
functional Filipino male

430
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:04,133
and quite possibly even
the lesbians as well.

431
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,731
That's why no matter what kind of
morality she has, she can sell!

432
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,203
This is what we need.

433
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,504
This is what Tristan
Valderama needs.

434
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,443
Somebody who can sell his
overpriced condo units!

435
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,152
That's why no matter what kind of scandal
she has with the rich and famous,

436
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,280
do you think the Valderamas will turn
their back to an opportunity to sell?

437
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:24,920
<i>Ma'am Rai.</i>

438
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,990
- Yes?
- Phone call from the Valderama Development.

439
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,383
Line 1 please.

440
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,523
See? We won the bid!

441
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,858
Hello. Raissa speaking.

442
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,068
Make sure you'll be at the
country club before 12, okay?

443
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:43,401
Hey. Did your brain stop that's
why you're staring into space?

444
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,203
Did you forget about it again?!

445
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,413
What is?

446
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,914
The lunch with Freddie and Isa!

447
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,717
Remember Freddie and Isa
with Mike and Juliet?!

448
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,858
Right.

449
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,026
Okay.

450
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,429
Don't be late, okay?

451
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:06,490
What?!

452
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:10,127
You'll marry him? As in you're
going to marry what's-his-face?!

453
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,165
Why? There's nothing
wrong with it.

454
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:16,635
- He's not your boyfriend.
- Oh, he is.

455
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,802
Why did I only hear
his name just now?

456
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,711
Well, because it's
been very private.

457
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,004
Private. You.

458
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,075
Okay. Sure.

459
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,850
Excuse me, Val.

460
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,455
I know that I'm this
popular celebrity here,

461
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:34,521
adored by millions of
fans here and abroad.

462
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:38,520
Sometimes, I really
just need my privacy.

463
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,489
Oh shut the fuck up, Marga.

464
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,792
The whole country knows even
the brand of your napkin

465
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,364
because you endorse it in
billboards all over EDSA.

466
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,333
Even your boyfriend.

467
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:51,843
Hey, girl!

468
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,807
Where were you?! Ma'am Karen
has been looking for you.

469
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,979
She's asking why didn't
you go to the taping.

470
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,420
Oh, My!

471
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,280
What happened to you?!

472
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,350
Did your boyfriend beat you up?!

473
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:11,588
Come here!

474
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:13,323
So how long have you
known this guy?

475
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:14,499
Along time.

476
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:15,827
About two months.

477
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:18,295
Two months and
you're marrying him?

478
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,440
Why? Ls there a timeline
for those kind of things?

479
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,074
What about you and
this Valderama guy?

480
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,539
How long has it been?

481
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,906
6... 7 years?

482
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,483
That's because Tristan and I
aren't in a relationship.

483
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,342
Oh, is that right?

484
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:39,182
So what do you guys do when you stay
overnight abroad or when you meet up?

485
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:43,557
You talk about the Republic
of the Philippines?

486
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:48,400
He harassed me!

487
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,764
Harassed?

488
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,564
H 0w?

489
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,073
You're getting into my nerves!

490
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:58,967
We're in public!

491
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:02,111
Are we doing something wrong?
Are you ashamed of me?!

492
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,309
Dammit. Will you
lower your voice?

493
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:05,985
People can hear us.

494
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:09,847
Wow! You're concern about other
people's feelings but not with mine!

495
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,456
You're truly amazing.

496
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,057
Will you stop that drama!
You're giving me a bad mood!

497
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,186
You're so pretentious! And
yet whenever we're alone

498
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:19,028
in a room, you're the one
who bends over first!

499
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:20,657
Oh My!

500
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,067
If he truly loves me,
then he'll understand.

501
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,302
Hey!

502
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,029
Try to understand the guy!

503
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,598
You only have an
imaginary uterus!

504
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,344
Wait. Ls he even out yet?

505
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:33,967
He said he isn't yet.

506
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,538
Who would even believe that?!

507
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:37,945
Whenever he goes out for a drink at
the karaoke bar with his friends,

508
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,119
those basketball players,
what does he sing?

509
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:43,148
Regine Velasquez,
Lani Misalucha!

510
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,621
Then he says he's not out yet? His
friends doesn't know about it?!

511
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,394
The hell! “You Don't Have
To Say You Love Me",

512
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,485
a real man he say?!

513
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:52,355
- Hi, sweetheart!
- Hi, babes!

514
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,400
- Hi.
- How are you?

515
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:58,229
Good. I missed you so much.

516
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,601
- Remember my friend?
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

517
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,774
Yeah. Yeah. I know you.

518
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,676
We've met before.

519
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,283
Yeah. At Republic?

520
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,912
Or at Acara...

521
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,686
- Aracama.
- Aracama. Yes.

522
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,184
Oh okay.

523
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,559
Val, this is Rainier
Granada, my ﬁancee.

524
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,195
You know he's a triathlete.
As a matter of fact,

525
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,161
he just won the recent
Iron Man in Cebu.

526
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,556
Oh. Wow. That's nice.

527
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:33,972
I thought you have plans of having a
vacation in the States last year?

528
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,662
Oh yeah. Dan and I
even talked about it.

529
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,609
He said you plan to spend
some days in Chicago.

530
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:39,702
And then suddenly, you
guys cancelled your plans.

531
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,648
What happened? Why
didn't you go?

532
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,083
I had a miscarriage.

533
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,823
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

534
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:57,787
I'm just curious, why the
sudden decision to get married?

535
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,893
It's Marga who asked me
if I want to marry her.

536
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,994
- Oh.
- Excuse me, Rainier.

537
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,262
I did not asked you to marry me.

538
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,238
I merely suggested it.

539
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,938
That's not the same.

540
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,375
Suggested.

541
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,410
You called me last night,

542
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:17,774
you told me to. So I
asked you to marry you.

543
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,650
Then you'll say yes, right?

544
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:21,883
- Babe, what?
- Don‘t misquote me.

545
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:25,322
That's not how I said it.
He just misinterpreted it.

546
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:28,417
Do you really want
to marry Marga?

547
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:30,694
Well...

548
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:34,232
it's okay.

549
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,766
Wow. That's so romantic.

550
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,235
True love.

551
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:40,732
It is.

552
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,031
Right? It's true love.

553
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:44,631
You know what, Val?

554
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,567
I want to have kids.

555
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:49,174
I think it's time for
me to be a mother.

556
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:52,606
Margs, you don't need a
husband to have a child.

557
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:54,484
What you need is a sperm donor!

558
00:29:56,444 --> 00:30:00,722
- You're so... You're really so funny, Val!
- Right?

559
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,683
- This friend of yours is really cool.
- Yes!

560
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:05,255
- What is it? Do... Donor?
- She's so funny!

561
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:10,327
I know I'm late. Sorry, guys. I had
this meeting. It started late.

562
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,394
Oh by the way, Dan.

563
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,437
Have you seen the pictures
of your godchild?

564
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:16,407
Not yet. Let me see -Oh yeah.
Show it to him.

565
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,469
Can you believe
that's Sebastian?

566
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:20,541
No way! This is my godchild?!

567
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:21,677
How tall is he?

568
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,248
- About 5'1?
- 5'7.

569
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:24,578
And he's what? 11 years old?

570
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,641
- Actually, 10 and a half.
- 10 and a half!

571
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,353
He was just this tall!

572
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:29,783
And now, woah!

573
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:30,649
Go on.

574
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:32,283
I have more pictures.

575
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,964
I'm hungry-Come on!

576
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,362
Tastes good, right?

577
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:47,367
Of course! You know
I eat like a beast!

578
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,872
You make me eat anything!

579
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,757
You're the one who got
an amoebiasis when we

580
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,373
ate Isaw (GRILLED CHICKEN
INTESTINE), right?

581
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,445
But me, I can eat anything.

582
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,709
That's why I should've courted you.
You're not picky. I can save up more.

583
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,278
Well, sorry. You're a coward.

584
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,257
I was just joking.

585
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,395
She's going to marry this guy to get
attention from the media all over again.

586
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:13,927
Can't you see it?

587
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:16,304
Your friend wants people
to talk about her that's

588
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:18,433
how more and more people
gets interested in her.

589
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,233
That's how your friend
makes a lot of money.

590
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,302
How much does one need
in this lifetime?

591
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,173
I mean maybe there's
more to life than that.

592
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,908
Are you willing to
quit your hotel job?

593
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,307
No.

594
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:30,812
But...

595
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,482
I will get married also.

596
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,088
Sabs, how long have
we known each other?

597
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,158
Third year high school
at a party.

598
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:45,330
You were even hitting on
Karen's cousin from abroad.

599
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,363
But sorry, your style
didn't effect.

600
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,137
Because you're so old-fashioned
when it comes to girls even then.

601
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,063
That's not true. She just speaks in an
American accent. She's hard to understand.

602
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,600
Niccomedes, will
you just admit it!

603
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,237
You're old-fashioned.

604
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,005
Fine.

605
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,073
It's because I only
have an effect on you.

606
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:07,778
I don't think so! You're a coward
if you think of hitting on me!

607
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,554
Why is that? Would you agree to
be my girlfriend if I court you?

608
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:11,487
You're crazy.

609
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,547
Is that true?

610
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,583
You're so cheap!

611
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:18,727
What's going on here! Ls this
because of the oil or the vetsin?!

612
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,833
Who is this man you're marrying?

613
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:22,998
You don't know him.

614
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:26,068
Of course I don't know him. You've
never said anything about him.

615
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,599
Well, his name is Andrew.

616
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,000
Andrew Chow.

617
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:31,235
And?

618
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:34,843
And he's a banker. He's actually
the vice president of his bank.

619
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,648
His family is from Hong Kong.

620
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,077
Okay. I get it.

621
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:41,150
He's some big shit. Whatever, you know.
He's rich and...

622
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:44,956
So how long have you've been
known this big ass Chow dude?

623
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,017
Three years.

624
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:50,152
Val, three years.

625
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,823
And you've never told me
you're dating anybody.

626
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,296
You never asked.

627
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,034
You love him?

628
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:02,007
Do you think I'll marry
a man I don't love?

629
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,337
What if you go to
the States too?

630
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:08,412
What if you apply
for a job there?

631
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,777
If I really wanted to go to America, I
would've done that a long time ago.

632
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,547
I should've gone with our
batch mates who have migrated.

633
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,188
You know, when you leave, I will
surely miss you, Nicoomedes.

634
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,970
That explains why your man
treats you like a rag.

635
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,834
It's because you let him.

636
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,975
You let him!

637
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,909
Yeah. Yeah. Now, I know!

638
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,976
I just went a little
overboard with Jason.

639
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,844
A little? You call that little?!

640
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:56,456
His last birthday, you spent 5,500
to buy that jerk a new rubber shoes!

641
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,087
But it's his birthday.

642
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,326
Okay. Okay. Birthday.

643
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:07,129
On your mom's birthday, you spent
250 pesos for a chocolate roll.

644
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,574
I'm not like Winston.

645
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,565
What did you say about Winston?!

646
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:15,309
This friend of mine is having
an argument with his boyfriend.

647
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,176
Then he wants to
break up with him.

648
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,378
You mean the "love
team" broke up?

649
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,783
Yes! They had a ﬁght!

650
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:26,752
The guy hit Winston
so they split!

651
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:28,720
Amelie, just a minute.

652
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,227
What's the last name of
your friend's boyfriend?

653
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,755
I just know he's Yves.

654
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,309
Rivera. I remember it
because he has the same

655
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,830
last name as Ariel Rivera
and Marian Rivera.

656
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:42,297
Hello?

657
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,065
Chloe!

658
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:51,242
Yves Rivera.

659
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,983
Oh hello there, pretty boy.

660
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:01,715
Vangie, is Coooy there?

661
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:03,059
Yes. He's home early.

662
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,719
But your mom's not here yet.

663
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,293
She said she's going to church.

664
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,531
What kind of a church
is that anyway?

665
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,867
Do they hold services at
this time of the day?

666
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,483
Thank you, Mike.

667
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,257
Ady...

668
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:39,228
Thank you very much for
taking part at the service.

669
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,091
Many were tearful.

670
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,093
About being an ideal
mother to your children.

671
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,868
Oh My. Thank you
very much, pastor.

672
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:52,305
You truly are my inspiration.
I'm thankful.

673
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,553
Oh Jesus! That's disgusting!

674
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,081
You said you only go
to prayer meetings!

675
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,658
Why are you with a guy?!

676
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:11,156
Why?! Don't they have
guys at prayer meetings?

677
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,788
Ma, I saw it! You were kissing
that guy you're with!

678
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,998
Hey, Sabrina! You don't have the
right to talk to me like that!

679
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,203
Where have you been?
And who is that guy?

680
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,763
At a prayer meeting and
then we had coffee!

681
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,108
Ma, who is that guy?!

682
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:27,710
He's Mike.

683
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,111
- Pastor Mike.
- Pastor Mike?!

684
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,883
Pastor?!

685
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,175
Pastor?!

686
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,183
Yes! Are you deaf?!

687
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,859
Ma! My God! You were smooching
with our congregation!

688
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,957
Jay, son.

689
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:52,431
- Dad?
- I bought food.

690
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,764
- Okay, dad.
- The bread's still hot.

691
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,034
This is good to match
with a potted milk.

692
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:00,143
- Eat with me.
- Okay, dad.

693
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,745
I don't care!

694
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,028
As long as there are at
least 30 photographers

695
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,882
and video coverage for
that press conference.

696
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,022
I don't care! Okay, thanks, bye!

697
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:11,121
Dammit.

698
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:14,158
Hey, will you lower you voice.
People are everywhere.

699
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,189
Boy, this girl has problems.

700
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:18,624
Dude, that chick...

701
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:20,759
What's her name again?

702
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:23,201
I wasn't sure it was you.

703
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,633
- How are you, Jaime?
- I'm good, Dan. I'm good.

704
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,964
How's Tristan?

705
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:28,601
He's also good.

706
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:31,534
We have to go.

707
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,208
Tara Arambulo?

708
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,748
But, Tristan, we can tell
the agency to replace her.

709
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,147
So we can actually take
her out of the campaign.

710
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,723
Why would you want me
to do that, Jaime?

711
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,456
That whore sells.

712
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:48,324
We need whores who sell.

713
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:51,586
That's why my brother-in-law's
crazy about her because she sells.

714
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,297
She does not only sell,

715
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,595
she's also for sale.

716
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,533
What about your sister?

717
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,498
Jaime, this is business.

718
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,005
Leave my sister out of it.

719
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:08,878
What?

720
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,576
Juliet talked to me.

721
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:15,011
She said she has a
friend who's a doctor.

722
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,084
Another doctor?

723
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,057
Sophie, stop, okay?
Let's face the fact.

724
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:22,885
Will you let me finish first?

725
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,054
Please!

726
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,357
Let's face the truth!

727
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,665
Whatever therapy or
medicine they offer you.

728
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,393
You can't have children!

729
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,799
Are you done?

730
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,763
Juliet has a friend
who's a doctor.

731
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,643
And this doctor can
make arrangements.

732
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,175
What arrangements?

733
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:43,139
Clean, legal arrangements!

734
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:46,212
In fact, they were able
to help Juliet's friend.

735
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,613
Wait, Sophie.

736
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:48,585
What's this?

737
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:51,253
There are women who go to this doctor.
They're

738
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,523
pregnant and they can't
keep their baby.

739
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,855
So what the doctor does, he
looks for parents for the baby.

740
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:57,895
No.

741
00:38:58,686 --> 00:38:59,687
Daniel.

742
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,456
Please! Please, listen.

743
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,635
The parents will pay for
the medical expenses

744
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:05,392
of the mom while she's
still pregnant.

745
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:07,498
And when the baby is born,

746
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:11,064
when the baby is born, the biological
morn won't see the baby anymore.

747
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,978
And then at the hospital, at the
hospital, Daniel, -Sophie. Sophie.

748
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:17,478
The adopted parent's name will be
placed on the birth certificate.

749
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,046
Sophie.

750
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:22,415
I said no!

751
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:24,180
Daniel, please!

752
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,385
Sophie, I don't want to adopt.

753
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,293
Will you please
give me a chance?

754
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,864
I don't want to adopt! If it works to
other people, well not to me, okay?!

755
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,124
I see how much you love kids.

756
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,071
I see how you...

757
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,516
If I wanted to have a child,

758
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,178
I can.

759
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,213
Not you.

760
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:03,056
I won't let myself be liable
of your failure as a wife!

761
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,095
Now,

762
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,426
do you have anything
more to say?

763
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:09,730
Do you have anything
more to say?!

764
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:25,580
Ma'am, you forgot your phone at the
study room. Someone's calling.

765
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:27,743
Thank you.

766
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,099
Have you checked your Facebook?

767
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:44,634
Huh?

768
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,162
I added you.

769
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,671
I haven't seen it. I
didn't checked last night.

770
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,600
Accept my request, okay?

771
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,108
Okay.

772
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:57,176
Actually, we wanted
to keep it private.

773
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:02,175
But, we realize we really
owe this to our fans.

774
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:05,487
We want them to be happy
with us and for us.

775
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:08,114
Right, babe? Because we know

776
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:11,892
we wouldn't be where we are know
if it weren't for our supporters.

777
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,500
Do you have Twitter?

778
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,537
Yes, I have. Why? You're
going to follow me?

779
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,270
What's your name on Twitter?

780
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,267
@iamyves

781
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,276
I'll follow you, okay? Then
follow me back so we could DM.

782
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,439
Okay. What's your name again?

783
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,804
Chloe.

784
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:35,343
- C-H-L-0...
- I know how to spell Chloe.

785
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:43,828
Bye! Take care!

786
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,921
We'll be submitting our proposals
and our studies by early next week.

787
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,162
Ah, no. Too late.

788
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,958
We have to advance our timeline.

789
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,366
Marketing and Sales need
a proportional stuff

790
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,404
for us to move on ahead
of our schedule.

791
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,803
When do you really need it?

792
00:41:58,899 --> 00:41:59,741
Friday.

793
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:00,669
Fri...

794
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:03,882
That's after tomorrow.

795
00:42:04,004 --> 00:42:04,982
Yeah, I know.

796
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:08,876
You asked me when do I need it,
then we need it on Friday.

797
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,782
Okay! Friday.

798
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:17,623
Good.

799
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:21,522
You see, Val. I'm
all over the news.

800
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,335
And I'm not just talking
about our TV station.

801
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,665
I'm also featured by
our rival station.

802
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:31,709
And tomorrow I'm sure I'm all over the
entertainment page of broad sheets.

803
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,470
Even columns and
tabloids, I'm there.

804
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,337
And you know what, today?

805
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,276
I am number three trending
on Twitter Philippines!

806
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,249
I mean... everybody
is talking about me.

807
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:44,284
Same with Rainier,
he's also trending.

808
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:48,526
Do you know how the Philippine
Sports beneﬁt from my decision, Val?

809
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,958
Hello?

810
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:52,757
Val...

811
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:54,764
Are you still there?

812
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:56,428
Yes, still here.

813
00:42:56,924 --> 00:42:58,062
Okay. AHYWBY...

814
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,330
I know this may surprise
you, but I really like him.

815
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:03,566
Okay.

816
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,531
I mean... Listen, Val.

817
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:08,479
I know you don't think
much of him but he's kind.

818
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:10,678
He's just really...

819
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:14,577
Kind.

820
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:15,946
Yeah...

821
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:17,915
Okay.

822
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,361
You know what?! I'm getting
pissed with your answers.

823
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,641
OMG!

824
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:44,076
He accepted me on Facebook,
we're already friends!

825
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:45,309
He likes me!

826
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:47,042
Did you check the number
of his Facebook friends?

827
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,579
1256.

828
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:59,162
And you're the 1257,
then he likes you?

829
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:02,123
You know what, Peachy?
I'll unfriend you soon!

830
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,297
Hi.

831
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,734
What are you doing here?

832
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,742
You're not going to let me in?

833
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,112
I just want to talk. That's all.

834
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,248
Oh, look at his body.

835
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:23,854
Would you even doubt him as gay?

836
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:25,149
Why don't you go to the gym?!

837
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:32,354
Those guys who have broad muscles wear
perfect blending of liquid foundation!

838
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,428
Look at that...

839
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:39,971
In his 1257 Facebook friends, 1
or 2 out of 3 or more are boys.

840
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:41,265
And they're not
just ordinary boys!

841
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:44,001
They have good looks
and hot body!

842
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,768
So you're saying that only because
of that, he's already a gay?!

843
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,745
You know what?! I know
you're just bitter!

844
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,643
Because you're boyfriend had a child
with his co-worker in Singapore!

845
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:55,680
And you can't accept the fact that
he's now happy with someone else.

846
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:02,391
Fine! Be part of the federation that
believes they can convert gays to real men!

847
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:04,822
Let's see if he'll give in!
There isn't any

848
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,398
drug or potion from Quiapo
that can change him!

849
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:10,026
Bitter! You're ugly! Damn you!

850
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,267
Don't fool yourself! You
think you're beautiful!

851
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:13,634
I am really beautiful!

852
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:15,735
Why are you marrying that man?

853
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:18,475
Did it ever occurred to
you that I love him?

854
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:19,640
But what about us?

855
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:21,879
What about us, Tristan?

856
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:26,141
There was never an us. There was a you,
and there was a me... but never an us.

857
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:28,951
Well, after all these years...

858
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:30,855
You will tell me that
there's never an us?

859
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:34,458
Did you even asked me?

860
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:35,926
Was that even necessary?

861
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,656
I think so?

862
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:41,832
Come on, Val.

863
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:46,064
You know me, Tristan.

864
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,494
I don't like waiting.

865
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,434
And the other night, I realized

866
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,641
I'm waiting for something
that's never going to happen.

867
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,012
What if you understood?

868
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,445
That's why I'm leaving.

869
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,914
Because I understand you.

870
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,214
Not bad, Val.

871
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,655
Whenever you change your mind

872
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:18,896
just tell me.

873
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:22,137
Yeah, I'll give you a call.

874
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,547
Just tell her.

875
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:43,051
You're being stupid. Why did you
even attempt to hit on Sab?

876
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:48,297
Whenever we go on vacation, you sleep
together in one bed and nothing happens.

877
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,864
So what's your plan now?
You're leaving?

878
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,677
You get her number.

879
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:06,511
I got your back! Just let
me eat the sisig alone.

880
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,452
Have you ever heard
anything from me?

881
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,019
Did I ever meddle
about your work?

882
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,982
But Jays, you know my work hours
in the studio aren't deﬁnite.

883
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:17,621
Same as mine!

884
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:22,231
My work at the gym isn't even enough!
It's a little more than the minimum wage.

885
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,867
That's why I have sideline!

886
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,498
Then tell me about
your sideline.

887
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,333
I accept private session!

888
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:29,639
What else do you think?

889
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:31,005
Even at night?

890
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:32,670
That is the problem with you.

891
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,239
You have a dirty mind!

892
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:36,203
Don't you really trust me?

893
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:58,096
Don't tell me you're
working on our project?

894
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:00,861
Mr. Valderama.

895
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:04,569
If you keep on doing that,
I guess it is better to...

896
00:48:04,665 --> 00:48:06,076
Are you breaking up with me?

897
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,804
Are you working on
Valhalla Towers

898
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:14,746
at this hour of the night?
In this cafe?

899
00:48:16,343 --> 00:48:18,016
Because I do have
a deadline, sir.

900
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,092
But I was the one who
gave you a deadline...

901
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,295
So that means I could
ask for a time-out?

902
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:32,794
Okay... I'm sorry.

903
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:36,939
Sorry for being a nagger and if
I'm asking too much. I'm sorry.

904
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,907
I just can't forgive you
by being always sorry.

905
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:43,539
Son of a bitch! Are you
seriously breaking up with me?

906
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:47,647
So now you're cursing
my dead mom!

907
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,548
That was just a ﬁgure of speech!
Asshole!

908
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,845
Amelie...

909
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,992
What else do you want me to do?!
I said I'm sorry!

910
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,752
Will you please stop
making a scene here?!

911
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,458
You're embarrassing!

912
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:01,725
Girls cry at defense, right?

913
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:02,726
Defense?

914
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,499
If you can't defend
yourselves, you, girls, cry.

915
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:12,433
Mr. Valderama, you should be more
careful with women who don't cry.

916
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:14,375
Yeah, I know.

917
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:19,450
I know a girl who never cries.

918
00:49:20,173 --> 00:49:23,484
Or maybe she doesn't cry
in front of anybody.

919
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:26,484
There were also
boys who cry a lot.

920
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:27,254
Yeah.

921
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,719
Just like my best friend,

922
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:31,357
he cries easily.

923
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:36,825
We watch not-so dramatic movie at times...
and yet he cries.

924
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:39,128
You like weak men?

925
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:43,703
I just admire men who can
cry in front of others

926
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:47,008
including and especially women.

927
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:52,650
- Am I oversharing Mr. Valderama?
- Oh no! No! No! No!

928
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,049
It's amusing me. Go ahead!

929
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:59,123
Can you do me a favor?

930
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:03,253
We're not in the ofﬁce so please
stop calling me Mr. Valderama.

931
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:05,122
Call me Tristan.

932
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:06,853
And you're Sabrina.

933
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:08,723
You still remember my ﬁrst name?

934
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:12,497
Of course! You almost run
over me while jogging.

935
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:19,534
You know what? I
may not cry easily

936
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:22,046
but I have a very good memory.

937
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,778
Shut up! Let's go!

938
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:30,921
You're leaving without
settling things.

939
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,089
Let's talk about this next time!
You're embarrassing.

940
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,122
Jason! Jason!

941
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:45,196
A little after 1:00?

942
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:47,303
You drove alone about 1:00?

943
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:50,770
What's the fuss? I
do it all the time.

944
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:53,007
What time will you be out?
Let's go out after your work!

945
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:56,068
I can't, Niocs. You know
we're photoﬁnishing

946
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,339
our proposal for the
project launch.

947
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,242
It's our deadline tomorrow.

948
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,180
Oh, I see.

949
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,949
Okay, take care then!

950
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,244
You too.

951
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,490
Stop it! Not tonight, I'm busy.

952
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:20,133
Are you not even tired?

953
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,209
Ma! Ls there any problem?

954
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,676
Do I only call you if
there's a problem?

955
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,945
You just don't call like this.

956
00:51:31,204 --> 00:51:32,649
Can I invite you for dinner?

957
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,276
But that's our usual rule.

958
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:39,737
I mean... you join a
beauty pageant and then

959
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:42,056
you win it and you
become a beauty queen.

960
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:43,693
And then you enter
show business.

961
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,422
For some but not for me.

962
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:50,234
And how can I enter
show business?

963
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:55,639
I don't know how to sing, I only dance
a little but I don't know how to act.

964
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:59,467
And I'm not even good in lying.

965
00:52:02,903 --> 00:52:04,712
Of course not!

966
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:08,549
Oh, she's not a liar.

967
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:11,781
No one even believes her.

968
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,064
Hi Yves! What are you up to?

969
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:24,864
I'm buying coffee.

970
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:28,231
So are you going to the
French Film Festival tonight?

971
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,873
How did you know that...

972
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,009
On your Facebook! You even posted a
status that you're going alone! Right?

973
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:36,313
Or do you have
someone to go with?

974
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,142
Oh, no one. I used to
go with Winston but...

975
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,784
I'm also going there tonight!

976
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:43,620
Okay.

977
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,819
I'm going alone. F.Y.l.

978
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:52,052
Oh Tara! Let's talk
about your love life.

979
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,121
What about my love life?

980
00:52:54,454 --> 00:52:56,263
Guys, I'm sure...

981
00:52:56,389 --> 00:53:00,838
Look at you, having that pretty face, don't
tell me you don't a have a love life.

982
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:06,910
Let's just say that, a lot of people
love me... and I have a life.

983
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:14,085
You're funny! You answer like
you're in the show business.

984
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:17,621
No, really? I mean is there
someone special in your life?

985
00:53:19,913 --> 00:53:22,860
Let's just say that I'm happy.

986
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:27,160
Happy that there's someone
special in your life?

987
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:31,698
I mean... I heard...

988
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:36,398
Oh Marga, don't be
fooled by the hearsays.

989
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,043
So are you denying that there is
someone special in your life?

990
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,845
So you're also planning to
watch Hiroshima Mon Amour?

991
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:47,347
Oh yes! I watched that
movie in DVD and...

992
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,920
and the actors were very gifted.

993
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,214
Emmanuelle Riva.

994
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,389
OMG! I'm such a fan!

995
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:58,788
I'm not denying anything... I'm happy!
That's all I can say.

996
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,162
Like you! Am I right?

997
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:05,832
Of course I am! Everybody
knows that I am so happy.

998
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,696
I actually know him.

999
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:11,736
I'm sure you do
because he's popular.

1000
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,334
<i>Speedy?</i>

1001
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,012
<i>Speedy?</i>

1002
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:24,345
Oh! You didn't know! His mom used to
call him Speedy when he was a baby.

1003
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:30,085
Oh, I know a lot of
things about Speedy.

1004
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:32,297
That's why I'm sure
that you're happy.

1005
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,995
Just shut your mouth.

1006
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,962
Actually...

1007
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,505
Everybody knows, like I
said, I am very happy.

1008
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:45,565
And that's why...

1009
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:49,558
My only wish for you Tara is that...
someday

1010
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,307
you'll meet the perfect
guy who'll love you.

1011
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:59,022
Someone that would love you
and willing to marry you.

1012
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,496
Ouch.

1013
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,598
Thank you!

1014
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,774
Thank you! Thank you!

1015
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:24,879
Okay! Let's watch French Film Festival
together so you won't go alone!

1016
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:25,481
Huh?

1017
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,052
I'll be out by 5:00!

1018
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,254
Wait! What is the time
of the screening?

1019
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,621
7:30.

1020
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:39,155
Perfect! I'll see you at our office lobby
at 5:00 or 5:15! Do you have a car?

1021
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:40,694
I don't have!

1022
00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:47,166
That's ﬁne! We can take a cab.
Then we will eat there! Okay?

1023
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,536
So I'll see you at 5:15?

1024
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:52,003
Okay!

1025
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:56,291
I'll post this on Twitter!

1026
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:58,005
Finally, it's happening. We
are going out on a date.

1027
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:06,588
I thought you said your ratings peeked up
after you're big romantic announcement?

1028
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:09,257
Yes! For one day!

1029
00:56:09,582 --> 00:56:12,893
Then they went back
watching SpongeBob!

1030
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:17,227
Well maybe it's best since
you're getting married.

1031
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:22,071
Don't you even mention that!

1032
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:26,674
Val?

1033
00:56:28,334 --> 00:56:33,249
Do you think people would be angry
if I would cancel the wedding?

1034
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,155
Yes?

1035
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,122
Sabrina?

1036
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:46,753
- Who's this please?
- Tristan.

1037
00:56:48,455 --> 00:56:49,456
- Tristan?
- Tristan Valderama.

1038
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,004
What can I do for you, sir?

1039
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:55,531
You're ready for tomorrow?

1040
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:59,002
Oh, we will be there with
our campaign proposal, sir.

1041
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:04,278
Good. Miss Madrilejos, impress me!
Okay?

1042
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,211
You will be Mr. Valderama.

1043
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,175
Good! Good.

1044
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:14,220
I admit it.

1045
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:16,688
I just got carried away

1046
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:17,887
because...

1047
00:57:18,485 --> 00:57:19,429
Because what?

1048
00:57:20,086 --> 00:57:21,759
Because I was confused.

1049
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,726
So how are you supposed to tell the people
that you don't to marry him anymore?

1050
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:31,834
That you're cancelling the wedding after
you told everybody that you're so in love.

1051
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:36,376
Do you think people
will get angry?

1052
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:42,778
You seemed to be in a bad mood.

1053
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:45,713
How was your guesting
with Marga Castro?

1054
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:48,285
You didn't watch?

1055
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:50,985
How? I can't watch it at home.

1056
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:53,991
That girl asked about us!

1057
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,499
With names mentioned?

1058
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:03,000
Why? Are you afraid that
your wife would know?

1059
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:07,171
You think Sophia
still doesn't know?

1060
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:12,575
The world talks about us, Dan!

1061
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:15,146
I want to hear it from you.

1062
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:18,512
Not with somebody else, but you.

1063
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:20,188
Are you alright?

1064
00:58:22,182 --> 00:58:25,254
Morn, what makes you
think that I'm not okay?

1065
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,090
I know.

1066
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:29,030
Okay.

1067
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:32,063
I know.

1068
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:36,136
I don't understand.

1069
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,500
You perfectly know what
I am talking about.

1070
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:44,047
If a person does not respect you
there's no reason for you to stay.

1071
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:52,119
Not only because you signed a marriage
contract, he can't treat you like a trash.

1072
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:57,823
Why are you not saying anything?

1073
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,457
You just can't understand me.

1074
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:07,728
You know Tara, Manila
is a small town

1075
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:10,237
pretending to be a big city.

1076
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:16,004
People always talk about each other
because everybody with somebody

1077
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:17,680
knows each other.

1078
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:20,042
So get used to it.

1079
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,345
Dan, I have something
to tell you.

1080
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:24,218
What?

1081
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:30,224
I just hope you'd be happy because I'm sure
that people you know will talk about us.

1082
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:31,922
"M Pregnant!"

1083
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:34,858
What?

1084
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,899
You've always wanted
to be a daddy, right?

1085
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,500
Soon, you'll be a daddy!

1086
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,171
So, did you like it?

1087
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,103
Very much!

1088
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:53,482
All a while I thought
you were already asleep

1089
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,449
because you're eyes were
closed when I glanced at you.

1090
00:59:55,608 --> 01:00:00,580
Oh, no! I was just savoring
every part of the movie.

1091
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,622
Wait.

1092
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,592
How was that if you're not
reading the subtitles?

1093
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,060
So you're telling me that
you can understand French?

1094
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,858
Un p000 mas!

1095
01:00:08,888 --> 01:00:10,026
That's Spanish, right?

1096
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:11,460
Oui!

1097
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,070
If he is hurting you

1098
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,643
because he meant to. Why
are you willing to suffer?

1099
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,842
He humiliates you!

1100
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:25,975
It's my fault because
I can't have a child.

1101
01:00:26,439 --> 01:00:27,417
Sophie.

1102
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,655
It's my responsibility as his
wife to give him a child.

1103
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,821
But Ma, there is
something wrong with me!

1104
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:39,352
The doctor already told that it's
impossible for me to have a baby.

1105
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:40,924
Because of that

1106
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:44,792
you let him treat
you like trash.

1107
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:50,407
You're being punished because
you can't give him a child?

1108
01:00:51,264 --> 01:00:58,239
You're a woman. You're his wife.
Your job isn't only to bear a child.

1109
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:00,947
That's because
you're being stupid!

1110
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:03,983
You should've broken up with him!
He's not respecting you anymore!

1111
01:01:04,043 --> 01:01:06,353
And yet you're acting
like a martyr!

1112
01:01:06,479 --> 01:01:09,926
It's because I love
that stupid guy!

1113
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:16,697
Boys only differ in smell, shape
and size of their package.

1114
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,926
Those are the only possible
differences of their packages.

1115
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,201
Unless...

1116
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:25,572
a horse gets ashamed of
what he's got down there!

1117
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:28,608
You really have a dirty mouth!

1118
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:31,037
You're talking to two women!

1119
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:35,374
Wow! You hypocrite! You're the one who's
crazy over your personal trainer.

1120
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:41,155
Because he carries a huge one and
has a high stamina! Get real!

1121
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:48,792
You can't measure man's love in
the level of you're suffering!

1122
01:01:49,255 --> 01:01:52,793
If that man don't respect
you anymore, it only means

1123
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:55,171
you have to go!

1124
01:01:56,996 --> 01:01:57,940
It's enough.

1125
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,301
But we're not the same, Ma.

1126
01:02:02,702 --> 01:02:05,706
I ﬁght harder for
my relationship.

1127
01:02:06,005 --> 01:02:07,814
I do not give up easily.

1128
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:11,013
And you think

1129
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:16,859
I didn't ﬁght hard
enough for our marriage?

1130
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:18,828
What else could be the reason

1131
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:24,901
but you didn't love him
enough to ﬁght for him.

1132
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:27,400
Are you hungry?

1133
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,062
But the restaurants here inside
the mall are already closed.

1134
01:02:31,063 --> 01:02:34,533
Do you like to order some take-outs
then we could eat it at home.

1135
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,007
We can't go to my place.

1136
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:38,730
I have two room-mates in my condo.
It's small,

1137
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,016
it's a hassle and it's
only one-bedroom.

1138
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,678
We can go to my place. My roommates
are call center agents so

1139
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,784
I'm usually alone at night.

1140
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:59,768
That's alright Yves, I
know I can trust you.

1141
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:06,741
Oh, you have a visitor.

1142
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:07,776
Who?

1143
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:10,508
I thought you're coming
home late from the office.

1144
01:03:10,837 --> 01:03:11,315
<i>HEY</i>

1145
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,981
I brought you food, I
thought I won't see you.

1146
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:23,354
Before you cry over
a boy, be sure that

1147
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:27,253
he will cry more
when you break up.

1148
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:28,631
Keep that in mind!

1149
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:32,501
It seems like he has a
bigger problem than you.

1150
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,597
It's because

1151
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:38,203
our gay friend feels bitter.
You know why?

1152
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,298
His ex-boyfriend, Yves...

1153
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:41,778
is already dating someone new.

1154
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,971
Oh, that hurts!

1155
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:48,135
Of course, he can't accept that his ex is
now with a girl while he's still grieving.

1156
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:50,750
Really?

1157
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,157
Is this for real? Gossiping about
the person who is in front of you?

1158
01:03:53,613 --> 01:03:55,615
What are you
whispering to Pechay?

1159
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,024
Nothing, don't mind it.

1160
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:02,394
This might be one of the
things I'll miss here.

1161
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:10,738
Sabs, stop being cold with me.

1162
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,208
Why on the earth would
I be cold with you?

1163
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:17,046
I knew that it was your plan.

1164
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:20,275
You already told me before
that you want to study in US.

1165
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:25,283
Sabs, would it make you feel bad if I
won't come home in the Philippines ever?

1166
01:04:26,412 --> 01:04:30,952
You thought that I believed when you
said that you'll be gone for 3-4 years?

1167
01:04:33,386 --> 01:04:35,491
You know what our
problems is Niccs?

1168
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:39,626
We know each other so much that we can
no longer hide things from each other.

1169
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:44,204
That's why you've changed when I
told you that I'll be leaving?

1170
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:45,970
That's not true.

1171
01:04:46,732 --> 01:04:47,767
Sabs...

1172
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:51,681
it's just coincidence,
I was busy and...

1173
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:56,351
I thought you said that we know each other
too much that we can't lie to each other?

1174
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:01,054
How can you say you
love my father?

1175
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,217
You left him!

1176
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:06,061
One day Justin and I woke
up and you were gone!

1177
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:10,598
And don't tell us that we're too young
to understand because we understood!

1178
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,300
And would you know the
reason why I did that?

1179
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:16,265
What then?

1180
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:20,801
You fell out of love
with my father!

1181
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:21,911
He didn't love me.

1182
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:24,803
How can you say that?
He gave you everything!

1183
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:26,438
Because he had to.

1184
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:30,216
Because I am his wife,
but he didn't love me

1185
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:34,319
because I was the one
whom he wants to love.

1186
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:42,559
I left him because I
want him to be happy.

1187
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:44,959
I gave him freedom.

1188
01:05:45,057 --> 01:05:46,434
You can't say that.

1189
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:49,739
Until the day he died,
Papa never re-married,

1190
01:05:49,795 --> 01:05:52,867
- he never even searched for another woman.
- But... but you can't say

1191
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:56,512
that your father died unhappy.

1192
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:00,712
If you're going to
make a decision,

1193
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:05,351
please... think of yourself.

1194
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:08,521
And not about what others think.

1195
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,889
Do you think this
would be easy for me?

1196
01:06:13,653 --> 01:06:16,361
That I am happy?
Because ﬁnally...

1197
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,936
- the long wait is over. But...
- But what?

1198
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:27,105
If I would be in
your situation...

1199
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:29,707
I'd choose to leave, Nicoo.

1200
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,985
- Sabs.
- I want you to be happy.

1201
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,854
That's all! That's the important
thing, that you're happy.

1202
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:43,153
- Sabs.
- Don't.

1203
01:06:43,616 --> 01:06:44,651
Please.

1204
01:06:45,284 --> 01:06:48,458
You're not making it any easier
for me, you're hurting me!

1205
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:54,197
Sabs.

1206
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:55,067
Please.

1207
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,800
Just don't say anything, okay?

1208
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:05,238
Don't say anything that I will remember
later on and will only hurt me more.

1209
01:07:05,504 --> 01:07:06,881
Just don't say anything!

1210
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:16,922
How many lives here?

1211
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,823
Four, including me.

1212
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:24,334
And all of them work at night,
so we're totally safe here.

1213
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:26,297
Safe with what?

1214
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:27,969
Whatever!

1215
01:07:36,268 --> 01:07:38,077
Have you had a
girlfriend before?

1216
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:39,472
Yeah!

1217
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,582
Really?!

1218
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,947
Why are so shocked?

1219
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:49,457
Well... You know because...
Because of Winston?

1220
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:52,321
Were you informed that
Winston has a child?

1221
01:07:52,785 --> 01:07:53,729
What?!

1222
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,394
That gay has a child?

1223
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:03,566
So...

1224
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,438
How many girlfriends
did you have?

1225
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:08,473
Serious or ﬂing?

1226
01:08:09,535 --> 01:08:10,536
Whatever.

1227
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:13,941
I had a lot of ﬂing.

1228
01:08:14,106 --> 01:08:17,485
For serious ones? Maybe 3 or 4.

1229
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,688
Oh.

1230
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:29,297
All your serious
girlfriends were girls?

1231
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,126
Of course!

1232
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:32,394
So you were not serious with
your relationship with Winston?

1233
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:33,468
That was only a ﬂing?

1234
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,298
Actually, I don't know.

1235
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:37,632
I'm confused.

1236
01:08:38,831 --> 01:08:41,466
Yves... What?

1237
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:48,908
Let's drink tequila!

1238
01:08:49,308 --> 01:08:51,020
Did you tell her the
truth about Papa?

1239
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:54,483
Did you tell her
why you left him?

1240
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,954
The reason why you left us?

1241
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:57,085
No!

1242
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,589
Not anymore.

1243
01:08:58,884 --> 01:08:59,919
What's the point?

1244
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:01,529
Ma...

1245
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:04,297
We have kept the
secret for years.

1246
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:09,936
Most of people who knew
about the truth were gone.

1247
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:12,107
You know before Papa died,

1248
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:17,075
he told me that it
was his choice.

1249
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:19,476
He was sorry for hurting you,

1250
01:09:19,705 --> 01:09:21,548
sorry for hurting all of us.

1251
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:25,755
You're dad didn't
re-married because

1252
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:27,791
right from the very start,

1253
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,527
he wasn't looking for a woman.

1254
01:09:33,953 --> 01:09:35,933
Marga! What's the
meaning of this?

1255
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:37,496
What's this thing online?

1256
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,600
Why did the reporter said that
our wedding was called off?

1257
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:44,473
Dear, will you do
me a favor, please?

1258
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:47,607
Please just relax, okay?

1259
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,236
What you read from the internet was true.
I changed my mind.

1260
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:52,181
You what?!

1261
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:56,914
You changed your mind about our
wedding and I wasn't informed first?

1262
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,545
Because you are busy.

1263
01:09:58,644 --> 01:09:59,987
I can't believe this!

1264
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,554
After you announced publicly
that we're getting married

1265
01:10:03,716 --> 01:10:06,356
in less than two days,
you'll cancel it!

1266
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:07,585
Is this some kind
of a joke to you?

1267
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:09,896
Hey, you better
watch your words!

1268
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:11,400
You're insulting me!

1269
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:13,230
And will you please
stop shouting at me?

1270
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:15,693
Do you want me to be happy
about how you treat me?!

1271
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:17,298
Marga! I'm the one living
with a peaceful life!

1272
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:19,140
Then you asked for marriage!

1273
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,704
Excuse me!

1274
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:24,870
Are you saying that
I forced you?!

1275
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:30,645
I beg your pardon! And I mean I
really beg your big effin‘ pardon!

1276
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:33,188
You may be Rainier Granada,

1277
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,385
but I am Marga Castro!

1278
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:40,657
And Marga Castro is...
Marga Castro!

1279
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,227
You better remember that!

1280
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:45,699
Hello!

1281
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,235
Hello, Marga!

1282
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:48,360
Hello!

1283
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:49,267
Idiot!

1284
01:10:50,396 --> 01:10:54,572
Come here! Oh, My God!
I'm so stressed!

1285
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,477
You worry me too, you know?

1286
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:01,751
Ma, you don't have
to worry about me.

1287
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:04,444
I can take care of
myself and you know it.

1288
01:11:06,045 --> 01:11:07,615
I don't want you to be alone.

1289
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:10,422
I don't want you to
be all by yourself.

1290
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:12,995
I want you to take risk.

1291
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:17,900
What do you mean? You know
that I always take risk.

1292
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:21,733
Not with this.

1293
01:11:30,235 --> 01:11:30,838
Come on.

1294
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:33,716
Go get a life!

1295
01:11:34,139 --> 01:11:34,549
Okay?

1296
01:11:35,307 --> 01:11:36,513
Enjoy!

1297
01:11:37,343 --> 01:11:38,788
Good night, Ma!

1298
01:11:39,445 --> 01:11:40,048
Good night!

1299
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:41,117
Okay!

1300
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:50,059
Go on! Last shot remaining.

1301
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,067
How am I supposed to go home now.

1302
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,826
I feel the heal in my face.

1303
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:56,773
I can't even feel my nose.

1304
01:11:57,029 --> 01:12:00,306
Ignore it! Don't worry
it's our last shot!

1305
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:05,477
Are you getting me drunk?

1306
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:09,016
No... we're just having fun!

1307
01:12:09,675 --> 01:12:12,713
Imagine... we watched
a French movie...

1308
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:17,483
then we ate pizza, and now
we're drinking tequila!

1309
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,323
Can I ask you something?

1310
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,498
Why are you acting like a cat?
You're so clingy.

1311
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,527
What do you prefer?
A girl or a boy?

1312
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:30,273
- Chloe, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1313
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:32,941
Stop! Let me go home!

1314
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:36,210
Go on! You can do it!
Just give it a try!

1315
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:38,872
Stop Chloe, please.
I respect you!

1316
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:41,450
I'm only helping you
to get a new life!

1317
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,340
What!

1318
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:43,718
I want you to be man again

1319
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,254
by making me a woman!

1320
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:47,320
Yves!

1321
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:49,893
Kiss me. Just kiss me!

1322
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:02,427
Good morning everybody! How's
everybody doing this Friday morning?

1323
01:13:02,428 --> 01:13:03,236
Are you ready?

1324
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:06,437
As promised, Mr. Valderama
our campaign is ready.

1325
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:08,818
Complete with the time
tables subject to the

1326
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,868
approval of your sales
and marketing team.

1327
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:12,405
Great! Let's do this, Sabrina!

1328
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,408
When?!

1329
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,218
When did this news come out?

1330
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:21,519
Obviously, she was the one responsible
of everything that was written there.

1331
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:23,192
Have you heard the
reaction of the people?

1332
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:25,554
- I know!
- What are you up to?

1333
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:28,052
Are the guests lined
up for tomorrow?

1334
01:13:28,053 --> 01:13:29,191
Madame,

1335
01:13:29,588 --> 01:13:32,432
were the stories true?
The ones written in...

1336
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:34,067
- About me and Rainief?
- Yes, yes.

1337
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,230
Yeah it's true, the
Wedding's cancelled.

1338
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:37,965
All the tabloids are
talking about you.

1339
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:41,043
Well, that's good for
the rating of the show!

1340
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:42,238
Let me see that.

1341
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,507
Certiﬁed PPP, what
do you mean by that?

1342
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,856
Tell me! What is the
meaning of certified PPP?

1343
01:13:53,078 --> 01:13:55,880
Pambansang Pekpek ng Pilipinas
(NATIONAL VAGINA OF THE PHILIPPINES)

1344
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:56,951
On the other hand, a whore.

1345
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,492
Oh, my God!

1346
01:14:03,589 --> 01:14:06,190
Is that so?! See?! You're evil!

1347
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:07,992
Once you started
dreaming on somebody,

1348
01:14:07,993 --> 01:14:10,633
you don't care even if you start
to act like a snake around him!

1349
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,898
Hey! I did not!

1350
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,880
Do I look like Galema?
Zuma's daughter?!

1351
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:21,040
I didn't snatched him away and he
already broke up with that gay!

1352
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,243
But still, you knew
his ex-boyfriend!

1353
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:23,820
Shut up!

1354
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,614
I only knew him but
we're not even friends!

1355
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:30,693
He‘s Amelie's friend! He was an
acquaintance! And besides...

1356
01:14:30,849 --> 01:14:32,886
You're a witch!

1357
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:35,089
What have you done to him?! What
happened to you last night?!

1358
01:14:35,187 --> 01:14:37,189
You raped him?!

1359
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:39,831
Madame...

1360
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:43,567
What are you doing here?

1361
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,550
You texted Karen that you
need me here to discuss

1362
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:49,062
the line up of the guests
for the next two weeks.

1363
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:51,937
Okay, follow me.

1364
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:03,092
So Mr. Valderama, is there
anything we can do for you?

1365
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:04,615
Oh no. Everything's good.

1366
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:08,462
It was a great day! Congratulations
on the presentation. Job well done!

1367
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,889
I just like to speak with Ms.
Madrilejos for a minute.

1368
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:12,459
Okay!

1369
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,304
Sabrina...

1370
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,305
I'm sure you're going back
to the ofﬁce after this?

1371
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:26,276
Yes.

1372
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:30,119
What would be the best
time to call you?

1373
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:34,453
You can call me anytime for
suggestions and corrections.

1374
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:39,595
No. This is not about work.
This is...

1375
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:41,592
This is personal.

1376
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,598
I like to see you.

1377
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,563
Are you asking me out?

1378
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:50,131
Yeah.

1379
01:15:51,096 --> 01:15:53,940
What makes you think
I will say yes?

1380
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,642
You're planning to say no?

1381
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,278
I don't know yet.

1382
01:15:59,605 --> 01:16:01,050
I know you're not gonna say no.

1383
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,816
How are you so sure?

1384
01:16:06,445 --> 01:16:07,549
Because I'm cute?

1385
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:15,656
I thought you're going
to present me something?

1386
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,233
Right now?

1387
01:16:17,556 --> 01:16:21,231
What do you want to do? Talk
about my personal life ﬁrst?

1388
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:26,298
Then you will tweet it to your followers?
Or you can post it on Facebook

1389
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:28,532
I do not do that, Madame!

1390
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:30,672
You think I don't know what
you do behind my back?

1391
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:33,883
When you're facing
me, you're smiling.

1392
01:16:34,106 --> 01:16:38,350
But the moment my back is turned you
say all these terrible things about me.

1393
01:16:39,077 --> 01:16:40,351
And to think...

1394
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,250
I am the one who's feeding you!

1395
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:47,986
So, what?

1396
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,198
Talk!

1397
01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:56,438
Our theme next week will be "survival“,
and we will start with cancer survivors."

1398
01:16:57,596 --> 01:17:00,042
You don't know how hard it is.

1399
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:01,735
What?

1400
01:17:03,268 --> 01:17:08,718
They say that a career in
media always have a deadline.

1401
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:11,621
People always want
someone younger,

1402
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:14,154
someone more beautiful.

1403
01:17:15,514 --> 01:17:17,187
And the networks?

1404
01:17:17,516 --> 01:17:18,790
They want someone cheap...

1405
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:21,953
Someone they can easily control.

1406
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:26,528
You know those fans...

1407
01:17:27,526 --> 01:17:28,869
they have no loyalty.

1408
01:17:29,995 --> 01:17:34,068
One day, they scream for
you, they love you...

1409
01:17:34,866 --> 01:17:39,838
And then the next day? Different
insults will be thrown to you.

1410
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:46,180
I don't want to be remembered as
the "Philippine National Vagina“."

1411
01:17:47,813 --> 01:17:50,020
Do you understand me, Winston?

1412
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:54,431
I mean, do you really
understand me?

1413
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,198
I'll try... Promise!

1414
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:02,505
After this day, I won't
be talking about this.

1415
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,238
Because I have to move on.

1416
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:12,112
Getting engaged to Rainier
Ganado was a very big mistake.

1417
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,812
Oh! He's good in bed!

1418
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:19,144
But he is so stupid!

1419
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,448
There! I said it!

1420
01:18:23,682 --> 01:18:24,956
He's an idiot!

1421
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,696
I'm just attracted to his legs!

1422
01:18:28,053 --> 01:18:30,158
That, I understand, Madame.

1423
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:33,464
You may go now.

1424
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,668
Yes. Thank you, ma'am.

1425
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:46,813
Did you have breakfast?

1426
01:18:47,005 --> 01:18:48,177
Yeah, I ate already.

1427
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:50,350
I took a bath ﬁrst.
I'm in hurry.

1428
01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:01,495
What the hell are you doing?

1429
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:04,398
Diorissimo.

1430
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:05,430
Huh?

1431
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,294
Sometimes Lily Dior.

1432
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:11,272
And on special occasions,
like your birthday?

1433
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,409
Chanel No. 5

1434
01:19:13,932 --> 01:19:16,879
I know these scents because
these are my perfumes too.

1435
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,171
You're with your woman
all night long.

1436
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:22,909
And you bring home all
of her expensive scents.

1437
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:25,051
I'm not stupid, Daniel.

1438
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:29,382
And don't treat
me like an idiot.

1439
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,756
So what are you
trying to tell me?

1440
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:35,424
You're leaving me?
You're leaving home?

1441
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:37,623
No.

1442
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:40,463
This is my house.

1443
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,531
I live here.

1444
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:47,335
And there is no space for your
woman's smell in my house.

1445
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:50,974
I'm not going to stop you if you
want to be with your woman.

1446
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,947
If it will make you happy.

1447
01:19:53,104 --> 01:19:54,640
I will respect that.

1448
01:19:54,973 --> 01:20:00,446
But don't you ever bring the scent of
your cheap woman here in my house.

1449
01:20:01,513 --> 01:20:05,893
If you can't leave without
her, then go with her.

1450
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:16,599
I want to tell you this
before it reaches you.

1451
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:20,808
She is pregnant.

1452
01:20:27,706 --> 01:20:28,343
Get out.

1453
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:30,985
What?

1454
01:20:31,376 --> 01:20:36,121
I know you heard me. But I
will repeat it for emphasis.

1455
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:38,624
Get out of my house!

1456
01:20:39,518 --> 01:20:42,829
Wear your clothes, and get lost!

1457
01:20:46,157 --> 01:20:48,603
What are you doing? Sophie stop!

1458
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,968
Sophie, stop that!

1459
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:51,033
Stop!

1460
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:58,541
Don't you ever touch me while you
still smell like your cheap woman!

1461
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:05,676
That disgusting woman
is such a primadonna!

1462
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:08,556
She thinks that Gretchen Barreto
will give a damn of her beauty!

1463
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,726
I thought you won't be angry?

1464
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:12,550
I'm not angry. Do I
look like I'm angry?!

1465
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:16,787
Fine! You're not mad! But I thought you
already moved on from your boyfriend?

1466
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:21,862
I never knew that your friends are
that kind of people. You tramp!

1467
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,199
So it's my fault
that you broke up?

1468
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:28,208
Marga?

1469
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,948
I went all the way here for you.
Open this freakin door right now.

1470
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:35,041
Marga?

1471
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:37,986
Fine. If you want,
I'm gonna leave.

1472
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,256
I just go and I won't
even go to your funeral.

1473
01:21:50,555 --> 01:21:52,865
I want to die...

1474
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,406
Okay.

1475
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:04,445
So you want to die.

1476
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,244
And so?

1477
01:22:13,278 --> 01:22:16,259
Do you know what people
are calling me right now?

1478
01:22:17,048 --> 01:22:23,090
PPP. Pambansang Pekpek ng Pilipinas.
(PHILIPPINE NATIONAL VAGINA)

1479
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:29,035
Well, it's cute...
And it suits you.

1480
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:30,763
It's not cute.

1481
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,900
They are insulting me.

1482
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:37,568
Marga, in all the things
you've done in your life,

1483
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:39,776
you think you will be the
next Pedro Calungsod?

1484
01:22:41,773 --> 01:22:44,219
Does she know what you
really feel about her?

1485
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:48,083
So what will Nicoo get
when he tells her that?

1486
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,929
You will go to America and
you will never go back.

1487
01:22:53,084 --> 01:22:56,554
And God knows what can
happen when you're gone.

1488
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,166
Now tell me.

1489
01:22:59,591 --> 01:23:01,525
Can you really take the fact

1490
01:23:01,526 --> 01:23:05,599
that you're leaving and she doesn't even
know about your true feelings for her?

1491
01:23:06,865 --> 01:23:08,310
I want to die!

1492
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,111
I would rather die
than be a loser

1493
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:15,707
I would rather die right now than
be a loser and they even insult me!

1494
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:20,151
Okay. But before you die, get dressed.
Because we're going out.

1495
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:21,920
No!

1496
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,784
I don't want to go out! I
don't want people to see me.

1497
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,587
Can't you see my
fans are mad at me?!

1498
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,657
Stop that! What fans?

1499
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:34,303
There are no fans to where
we're going. Hurry!

1500
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,440
Huh? Really?!

1501
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:39,975
No fans?!

1502
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:44,274
What now?

1503
01:23:44,469 --> 01:23:47,109
Have you decided? Are
you going to tell her?

1504
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:49,978
Pressure. Pressure. Pressure!

1505
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:50,678
So, what?

1506
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:53,079
You're going to
propose to Sabrina?

1507
01:23:53,378 --> 01:23:57,121
Are you crazy? She knows taekwondo.
Do you want her to kick my butt?

1508
01:23:57,649 --> 01:23:58,753
So what are you going to say?

1509
01:23:59,017 --> 01:24:02,931
You know, she already knows what
you really want to tell her.

1510
01:24:03,054 --> 01:24:04,965
You seem different.

1511
01:24:08,059 --> 01:24:11,404
Just answer it. You're
such a drama queen.

1512
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,275
But why are you mad?

1513
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:16,103
Because you always insult
me every time I call

1514
01:24:16,115 --> 01:24:18,531
or text Jason when we're
not in good terms.

1515
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:22,950
- Now you're the one...
- And who told you I'm gonna answer?

1516
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:24,679
My friend.

1517
01:24:25,677 --> 01:24:29,147
If you really don't want to answer that,
you should have cancelled that call.

1518
01:24:29,848 --> 01:24:30,986
Answer it.

1519
01:24:33,017 --> 01:24:33,722
Why did you call?

1520
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,989
"“Hello" is the standard
opening line right?

1521
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:39,524
Don't waste my time,
what do you really want?

1522
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:41,761
Hello? Hello?

1523
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:43,400
Are you busy?

1524
01:24:44,362 --> 01:24:45,371
Are you with anyone?

1525
01:24:47,365 --> 01:24:50,209
If I'm in a relationship, do you
think I would go out with you?

1526
01:24:50,568 --> 01:24:54,607
Even if you gave my company one
of our biggest project this year

1527
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:56,749
I don't know... Would you?

1528
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:00,746
No.

1529
01:25:01,713 --> 01:25:03,659
I take relationship seriously.

1530
01:25:04,115 --> 01:25:04,923
What about you?

1531
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,123
What do you mean what about me?

1532
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:11,795
Do you take relationship
seriously considering

1533
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:14,233
that you can get
anyone you want.

1534
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:20,063
You know, my situation
is not that easy.

1535
01:25:20,064 --> 01:25:20,769
Because...

1536
01:25:21,733 --> 01:25:26,182
They just... they just want
me for what I can give them.

1537
01:25:26,971 --> 01:25:28,848
They don't really need me...

1538
01:25:30,175 --> 01:25:31,984
Other than just use me.

1539
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:36,420
Nicco, you want us
to take you home?

1540
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:39,493
No. Just take me to the cab.

1541
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:41,764
Why? Where are you going?

1542
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:45,499
Did you call her? Maybe
she's not at her house.

1543
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:50,569
What? I'm assuming she is.

1544
01:25:56,668 --> 01:25:58,147
Hi, Jason.

1545
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,081
- Good evening.
- Let's go.

1546
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:09,315
We went here to take your
mind off your problems.

1547
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:11,654
Not to bring you at
the emergency room.

1548
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:16,396
You know, I really don't know what to
do If I lose my job at the network.

1549
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:21,162
Come on, you know that's
not gonna happen.

1550
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,667
On TV, when you're not bringing
in cash for the network,

1551
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,074
they won't care
about you anymore.

1552
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:31,840
They won't even accompany
you to the gate.

1553
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,583
I don't want to live this life anymore.
I'm so tired.

1554
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:41,984
I'll drink to that.

1555
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:45,325
What do you mean.

1556
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:48,223
You're happy in your life!
You, crazy woman.

1557
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:51,128
Margs. I'm the one
getting married.

1558
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:56,738
What?

1559
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,372
How could you do this to me?

1560
01:27:03,001 --> 01:27:06,881
Of all people in the world,
how could you do this to me?

1561
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,010
Do what?

1562
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:12,346
What food did you give Tristan
Valderama to marry you?

1563
01:27:17,548 --> 01:27:21,189
Don't say that you're expecting
to be that guy's girlfriend.

1564
01:27:21,619 --> 01:27:23,963
Well, he already told
me that he is bisexual.

1565
01:27:24,055 --> 01:27:26,035
My gosh, you crazy woman!

1566
01:27:26,357 --> 01:27:29,531
Hey, at your age, you still
believe in bisexuals?

1567
01:27:29,627 --> 01:27:32,403
Friend, a man nowadays is
either straight or gay!

1568
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:37,773
Being bisexual is just his excuse because
he wants to learn how to use an eye liner!

1569
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:41,876
You're late.

1570
01:27:42,407 --> 01:27:49,518
Gosh, I was with Winston at the mall. He
is so depressed because of what you did!

1571
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:55,126
Valentina, the mortal enemy of Darna,
and above all, Queen of Snakes!

1572
01:27:55,253 --> 01:27:57,426
Look who's talking!

1573
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,256
As if it's a big sin to...

1574
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:02,670
Hey! You seduced the
boyfriend of a gay!

1575
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,597
You're more gay than any gay!

1576
01:28:04,762 --> 01:28:07,333
Girl, is it my fault?

1577
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:11,670
Is it my fault that I can give him
what he can't give to his boyfriend?

1578
01:28:12,003 --> 01:28:14,574
But you are not
effective after all.

1579
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:15,913
Why?

1580
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:18,085
Ask Winston where he is.

1581
01:28:18,242 --> 01:28:21,416
"What? The boylel had a “return
of the comeback" to sis?!

1582
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:25,221
Correct! And he's even the
one who called fairy.

1583
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:31,360
You know, you're such a meddler! I
don't believe in your press release!

1584
01:28:31,589 --> 01:28:37,335
Press release?! I'm was with
Winston when his boylel called.

1585
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:38,765
What?

1586
01:28:45,003 --> 01:28:47,313
Hey. I'm sorry...

1587
01:28:47,705 --> 01:28:50,743
Now, you're begging me?
After you have insulted me?

1588
01:28:50,842 --> 01:28:52,014
I didn't insult you.

1589
01:28:52,343 --> 01:28:53,321
I just punched you.

1590
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:56,954
If I take a nap, you'll suddenly
pursue anyone you want?!

1591
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,393
You're making me crazy!

1592
01:28:58,483 --> 01:28:59,518
Who are you talking about?

1593
01:28:59,784 --> 01:29:04,130
That ﬂirty friend of Amelie you're dating
while watching Hiroshima Mon Amour!

1594
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:05,898
And you even did it with her!

1595
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:14,437
What are you laughing at?

1596
01:29:14,832 --> 01:29:16,539
It didn't drive you crazy?

1597
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:20,608
You gave him a clam to eat, but
he still chosen the eggplant!

1598
01:29:21,339 --> 01:29:21,976
Wait, wait, wait...

1599
01:29:22,206 --> 01:29:25,813
Maybe the clam is not... Fresh!

1600
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,154
Disgusting!

1601
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:30,657
Stinky!

1602
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:34,291
You're a maniac! Doesn't
your conscience hunt you?!

1603
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,359
That girl, she looks
like a Rottweiler!

1604
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:38,529
Wait!

1605
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,331
Who told you that I did
it with Amelie‘s friend?!

1606
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,801
I didn't touch her!

1607
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:49,845
Babe, even though I'm jerk,
I still have fear from God.

1608
01:29:51,202 --> 01:29:52,044
Babe...

1609
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,815
Oh, Hi Tristan!

1610
01:30:06,084 --> 01:30:06,653
Hi.

1611
01:30:07,452 --> 01:30:07,953
Hi.

1612
01:30:09,187 --> 01:30:11,599
Margo Castro, this is
my good friend Sabrina.

1613
01:30:11,856 --> 01:30:13,290
Hi. Hello.

1614
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,770
And this is Valeria, Sabrina.

1615
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,005
Let's go? I think we need to go.

1616
01:30:24,368 --> 01:30:25,711
It's nice to see you.

1617
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:28,145
Take care.

1618
01:30:31,242 --> 01:30:32,152
You okay?

1619
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:33,518
Yeah I'm okay.

1620
01:30:34,278 --> 01:30:35,222
I'm always okay. Let's go.

1621
01:30:37,715 --> 01:30:38,693
Do I have any messages?

1622
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,054
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1623
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:42,986
Mr. Chao called. Andrew Chao.

1624
01:30:42,987 --> 01:30:44,091
Andy called here?

1625
01:30:44,388 --> 01:30:47,028
Yes. He said he was trying to
call you but no one answered.

1626
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:51,263
My phone is in mute.
Did he say anything?

1627
01:30:52,463 --> 01:30:53,567
Sir, we have a problem.

1628
01:30:53,898 --> 01:30:57,004
Room 1505 called. There's something
going on the other room.

1629
01:30:57,135 --> 01:30:57,977
What's going on?

1630
01:30:58,236 --> 01:31:00,079
They said there's a ﬁght and
they might kill each other.

1631
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,746
Call the duty manager.
Let's go to the 15th ﬂoor.

1632
01:31:03,908 --> 01:31:05,216
Let's go.

1633
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:08,056
You animal! I will kill you!

1634
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:10,390
Let me go! I will kill that!

1635
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:12,018
What's happening?

1636
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,783
Damn you! Damn you!

1637
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:14,184
Oh my gosh!

1638
01:31:14,185 --> 01:31:15,755
- Jason!
- Let me go!

1639
01:31:19,323 --> 01:31:20,233
What the hell is that?

1640
01:31:20,658 --> 01:31:22,069
Oh my! Did you see that?

1641
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:43,988
Sabrina, can I take you home?

1642
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:48,930
I can't leave my car here at
the parking lot overnight.

1643
01:31:51,322 --> 01:31:54,394
It's a Saturday today right? You
don't have work tomorrow right?

1644
01:31:56,127 --> 01:31:56,628
It's okay.

1645
01:31:56,894 --> 01:32:00,000
It's just that my mom might wonder
why I didn't bring the car home.

1646
01:32:00,798 --> 01:32:02,436
Thanks for tonight though.

1647
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:05,844
<i>HEY</i>

1648
01:32:07,004 --> 01:32:08,540
I just wanna...

1649
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,648
thank you also.

1650
01:32:11,008 --> 01:32:12,180
You're welcome.

1651
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:16,451
<i>May n?</i>

1652
01:32:16,881 --> 01:32:18,258
Yes, you can.

1653
01:32:26,023 --> 01:32:27,195
Sabrina?

1654
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,834
Nicco! What are you doing here?

1655
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:43,577
Do you know him?

1656
01:32:44,842 --> 01:32:46,549
Yes, he's my friend.

1657
01:32:53,217 --> 01:32:54,218
<i>F ﬁend?</i>

1658
01:32:55,219 --> 01:32:56,857
Yes, as in...

1659
01:32:57,788 --> 01:32:58,960
friend.

1660
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,697
<i>Tristan, {his is
Niece, my best (ﬁend.</i>

1661
01:33:08,032 --> 01:33:09,636
- Nicoo.
- How are you?

1662
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:15,782
I called your house, they said
that you're still in office.

1663
01:33:16,574 --> 01:33:18,144
So I went here for you.

1664
01:33:18,409 --> 01:33:19,979
But there's no one around.

1665
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:23,153
And then I saw your
car, and I got nervous.

1666
01:33:24,582 --> 01:33:25,822
It's okay.

1667
01:33:29,353 --> 01:33:30,923
Sabrina...

1668
01:33:31,555 --> 01:33:33,865
It's okay. He's my best friend.

1669
01:33:36,661 --> 01:33:37,901
Anyways...

1670
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:40,404
call me when you get home.

1671
01:33:40,798 --> 01:33:42,098
Yes, sure.

1672
01:33:42,099 --> 01:33:43,339
Promise?

1673
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:46,112
Okay.

1674
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,441
Nice meeting you.

1675
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:23,516
I got the mail from
the US Embassy.

1676
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:27,947
I will have my interview
in two weeks.

1677
01:34:30,114 --> 01:34:31,525
Then?

1678
01:34:34,018 --> 01:34:35,258
That's it.

1679
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,199
That's all you're
going to say to me?

1680
01:34:52,069 --> 01:34:53,912
I want you to know that...

1681
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,883
That this is ﬁnal decision.

1682
01:35:05,316 --> 01:35:07,296
It seems that everything
is okay already.

1683
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:20,138
Ma'am is asleep.

1684
01:35:20,698 --> 01:35:22,766
She told me to come
here at 12:30.

1685
01:35:22,767 --> 01:35:24,440
So where is she? I'll go to her.

1686
01:35:24,668 --> 01:35:26,909
But she might get mad.

1687
01:35:27,037 --> 01:35:30,575
She's the one who told me to go here!
Get out of my way!

1688
01:35:31,742 --> 01:35:33,619
- Oh no!
- Ma'am Marga?

1689
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:35,121
It's Karen.

1690
01:35:35,379 --> 01:35:37,882
Madame, it's already 12:30.

1691
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:41,955
Madame?

1692
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:44,629
Madame! Oh, My God!

1693
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,161
Oh, my God!

1694
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:47,892
What happened to her?!

1695
01:35:48,893 --> 01:35:49,564
I don't know!

1696
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:50,895
I don't know!

1697
01:35:52,696 --> 01:35:54,039
Call the guards downstairs.

1698
01:35:54,265 --> 01:35:56,245
Tell them to call an ambulance!
Hurry!

1699
01:35:57,067 --> 01:35:59,172
Oh God! Oh God!

1700
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:07,789
You son of a bitch!

1701
01:36:08,245 --> 01:36:11,055
You bitch! You never
did anything right!

1702
01:36:11,715 --> 01:36:14,025
And I'm the one you
choose to call!

1703
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,688
You're now dragging
me to this stupidity!

1704
01:36:16,921 --> 01:36:19,697
Damn you! Damn you, asshole!

1705
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:23,062
Die!

1706
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:31,541
I admit.

1707
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:34,514
I was wrong.

1708
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,687
I was so wrong to try
take my own life.

1709
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:42,789
Because this is a
precious give from God.

1710
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:51,358
And I know I have no right to take what
is only loan to me by the Lord God.

1711
01:36:52,756 --> 01:36:54,133
And you know...

1712
01:36:55,025 --> 01:36:56,504
To all of you...

1713
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:03,376
Through this situation and all the
things I've been through, I realized

1714
01:37:04,368 --> 01:37:07,474
I don't need a man to be happy.

1715
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:10,982
Because I know

1716
01:37:11,275 --> 01:37:15,018
that unless I can
be happy on my own,

1717
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:19,922
I can never be happy in
the arms of someone else.

1718
01:37:38,068 --> 01:37:39,638
I left him, Ma.

1719
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:43,677
It's strange.

1720
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:46,385
I know that I should be sad.

1721
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,150
But I'm actually quite happy.

1722
01:37:54,251 --> 01:37:56,231
I don't understand.

1723
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:06,275
I know exactly what you mean.

1724
01:38:23,447 --> 01:38:24,653
Hello, Val.

1725
01:38:25,082 --> 01:38:26,288
Hello?

1726
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:27,658
Hello?

1727
01:38:28,218 --> 01:38:29,458
Hello?

1728
01:38:29,887 --> 01:38:32,163
Hello? Are you there?

1729
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,667
Val?

1730
01:38:36,727 --> 01:38:37,933
Val?

1731
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:47,248
Have a safe trip!

1732
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:55,483
Andy?

1733
01:38:55,813 --> 01:38:57,588
I'm on the way home.

1734
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,487
See you.

1735
01:39:02,152 --> 01:39:04,564
What did the people
say about me?

1736
01:39:04,722 --> 01:39:08,636
How many columns in this newspaper
is about my suicide attempt?

1737
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:10,134
Hurry! Tell me!

1738
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,501
You're the topic of
the nation tonight!

1739
01:39:12,596 --> 01:39:14,041
Oh, my God, me?!

1740
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:18,538
What about me? Why? Me?
Oh my God that's good!

1741
01:39:18,602 --> 01:39:22,675
It's about depression
and abandonment.

1742
01:39:22,973 --> 01:39:24,601
Well, I guess it's good.
It's a good exposure.

1743
01:39:24,613 --> 01:39:26,113
How about the response
of people about me?

1744
01:39:26,443 --> 01:39:29,185
What's the response of the people about me?
What about the network?

1745
01:39:29,413 --> 01:39:31,814
Are they happy with all of
this audience response?

1746
01:39:31,815 --> 01:39:34,550
Oh yes, ma'am!
They're very happy!

1747
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:36,963
They even though
you're going to die.

1748
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,668
They are happy about what
happened that you're okay!

1749
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:42,904
Oh come on!

1750
01:39:43,894 --> 01:39:45,428
But you know, Karen...

1751
01:39:45,429 --> 01:39:47,340
I just don't get it...

1752
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:49,935
where do my bruises come from?

1753
01:39:50,267 --> 01:39:52,076
I mean, it really hurts.

1754
01:39:52,703 --> 01:39:57,709
Because when you passed out, you
rolled all over and you hit you head!

1755
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:00,109
I carried you!

1756
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:01,611
Wasn't I in the bed?

1757
01:40:01,612 --> 01:40:03,558
No, you're not. I
carried her, right?

1758
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,126
You're the relative?

1759
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,212
Babe.

1760
01:40:30,174 --> 01:40:31,676
Hi, babe.

1761
01:40:36,647 --> 01:40:38,149
Hey, why are you late?

1762
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:41,862
There's an issue with my roommates.
It's so irritating!

1763
01:40:52,162 --> 01:40:57,271
<i>Who's mad, Who's sulking.</i>

1764
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:04,677
<i>Who's to blame</i> Hey, what is it?

1765
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:08,394
Good morning sir.

1766
01:41:08,406 --> 01:41:10,982
Good morning Jessica, can
you fix up my papers?

1767
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:12,821
- Yes. Sir.
- Thank you very much.

1768
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:15,757
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1769
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:25,499

1770

Good morning.

1771
