1
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,170
This morning, there were 3 cockroaches

2
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,161
Around me when I woke up.

3
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,166
I put them into an empty instant coffee
can and filled it with boiling water.

4
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,171
I had to drink it that while
everybody was looking at me.

5
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,187
So I opened the door
and went in my bedroom.

6
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,178
Because I wanted to get rid of the roaches.

7
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:17,185
I found that I was standing
on a ship made of wood.

8
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,192
The ship was slowly sinking.

9
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,198
That was like a silkworms'
bunkhouse or maybe a cabin.

10
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,205
I managed to save a drowning little boy.

11
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,225
I felt like all the children were mine.

12
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,228
I then found out that my second
child had disappeared.

13
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,221
The boy I rescued told
me while crying:

14
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,229
"Dad, why didn't you rescue
my younger brother?"

15
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,235
Who are those children?

16
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,240
In my dream, they are all mine.

17
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,256
The children's faces appeared once again
in front of me, then disappeared.

18
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,249
Those are perhaps my children
who faded away before being born.

19
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,256
What do those dreams foretell?

20
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,262
Is it a good omen?
A bad omen?

21
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:15,296
Actors:
Okada Mariko
Kamoda Kaizo
Iwasaki Kaneko
Takeuchi Toru
Kimura Naho
Makita Yoshiaki
Tsutsui Kazumi

22
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,382
I'm lost.

23
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:41,388
Don't make fun of me. Can someone
who's lost be able to know he's lost?

24
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,393
But... Everybody's lost, right?

25
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,410
- Everybody?
- You are too!

26
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,403
Once you understand you're lost,
you're not lost anymore.

27
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,408
You can go back from where you
came, you can ask your way too.

28
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,423
That's to say you're
heading to a destination.

29
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,427
I'm looking for my mother.

30
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,431
In my shop, you can find
everything you want...

31
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,424
My mother has given birth to me
But she didn't notice I was born.

32
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,443
Are you her mother?

33
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,464
Director: Yoshida Kiju (a.k.a Yoshihige)

34
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,480
What on earth is the matter?
Tell me...

35
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,485
I went shopping today.

36
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
I saw this girl accidentally.

37
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,505
She told me she was lost.

38
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,496
I can't explain it well.

39
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,505
We have to find the truth.

40
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
I'm going to tell her the truth.

41
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,529
You're a lost girl. This is
what you said at least.

42
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,532
I can't believe a girl of
your age can be lost.

43
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,536
You followed my wife here...

44
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,527
Why?

45
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:08,536
It's all right not to answer. But
what's sure is we don't know you.

46
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,543
I have to send you back to your mother.

47
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
Do you understand?

48
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,551
Where is your family?

49
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,583
Should I cut my eyebrows?

50
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,576
Should I cut it as thin as
those of a Daibatsu?

51
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,595
Why you suddenly bring that up?

52
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,599
If I cut it like that, when
I will look in the miror,

53
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,602
I will see the face of someone else.
It might be interesting.

54
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,595
Why did you take this girl home?

55
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,611
Tell me.

56
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,604
Why not let her live here?

57
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:22,609
If she's lost, you could have
taken her to a police station.

58
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,610
But you didn't.

59
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,673
Who are you?

60
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,678
I'm Keisaka Ayu's father.

61
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
Keisaka Ayu?

62
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,683
Do you know her?

63
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,702
Mum, save me!

64
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,693
I don't know this man.

65
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,707
He's not my father.

66
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,700
She's always lying.
She's my daughter.

67
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,706
He's not my father.
My daddy is here.

68
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,721
She's a very troubled daughter.

69
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,712
She doesn't like me.

70
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,748
A hidden microphone. That's how
I could trace her to your house.

71
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,804
Ifd rather leave.

72
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,822
There were those stairs
made of used bricks.

73
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
When you climb the stairs,

74
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,817
You can see the dome on the right.

75
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,834
If you climb the narrow stairs,

76
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,837
There is a road from where
you can see the dome.

77
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
Do you know that place?

78
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,832
I'm not sure...
I think the dome is on the left.

79
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,840
It was a long time ago...
It might be on the left.

80
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,852
It was the summer of 1952.

81
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,858
I was a university student
in engineering.

82
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,866
That's a pity. I first walked
along this road in april.

83
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,881
It's the place where I live now.

84
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,874
I haven't been there before.

85
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,950
Well... Where should we go
next to find your house?

86
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,954
To the television tower?
To a chapel?

87
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,947
Maybe you even live in a wrecker car?

88
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,957
You don't want to go home at all.

89
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,116
The situation has changed.

90
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,126
If we don't stop our plan before
4 o'clock, we might get arrested.

91
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,131
The situation has changed?
How?

92
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,151
On April 28, the San Francisco
Treaty was signed.

93
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,154
Japan announced its independence
from American occupation.

94
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,157
The same day the Tokyo
Ambassador M. took up his post.

95
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,160
On May Day, gathering in public
squares was strictly forbidden.

96
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,164
Several thousands of workers assembled
anyway and took back the squares by force.

97
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
The Police were then sent to
break up the demonstrators.

98
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
Many of the demonstrators were killed.

99
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
800 wounded,

100
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
and 1230 people caught.

101
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,174
May the 30th,

102
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,178
During the anticolonialism fights,

103
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,181
Beside Shinjuku, Kabata and Itabashi,

104
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,184
People rebeled in five other places.
The armed conflict started.

105
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,188
According to reports : 3 comrades
killed and 102 arrested.

106
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,190
June the 2nd, Sugo incident took place.

107
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,183
The 7th, 4,000,000 workers
were on strike.

108
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,188
On the 24th, Suita incident.
60 comrades were arrested.

109
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,205
On the 25th, during the
events in Shinjuku Station,

110
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,198
30 people were caught by the Police.

111
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,203
July the 4th, 1952.
Today.

112
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
What is the situation right now?

113
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,210
3 comrades, 3 killed, 2 comrades,
2 killed, 60 arrested, 102 arrested...

114
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
Why do you always use statistics?

115
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,227
We are not statistics!

116
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,218
Explain... Why do we have to stop?

117
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,223
Always explain, explain, explain!
What the hell do I know?

118
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,239
We can't stop now! What should
we do about our comrades?

119
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,243
We only have one chance to stop this plan.

120
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
At 4 o'clock, the man in charge of the
attack will receive the weapon.

121
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,248
It is on platform 3 of Shinjuku station.

122
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,251
If we can't give it, we won't be
able to proceed with the plan.

123
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,255
But we don't even know what they look like.

124
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
Who should we give the weapon to?
How do we find them?

125
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,248
Comrade Onko knows.

126
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,254
That is her task.

127
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,259
Time is up. I have to go.

128
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,290
Well, everyone...

129
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,294
This has nothing to do with me.
I object to this plan.

130
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,298
Plan D is about getting rid of the spy.
What happened?

131
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,302
There was a traitor among us. Our plan
has gone straight to the ennemy.

132
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,293
I won't go.

133
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,298
Then don't.
I don't wanna go either.

134
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,313
Who would want such a role?

135
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
But it has to be done.

136
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,319
Otherwise we will be annihilated.

137
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
I was against this plan,

138
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,325
But it's been carried out anyway.

139
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,329
Nobody can stop it now.
Even if we should stop it,

140
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,332
That is to say, even if you
give up, Plan D will go on.

141
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
This is a responsibility we all share.

142
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,325
Even if you don't want to.

143
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,337
I will go.

144
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,363
It will be over soon.

145
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,367
Who is the other?

146
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,383
The man who drafted this plan,
Ato Hakuchi.

147
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,376
He is from the Political Bureau.

148
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,584
It is all right to only help.

149
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,598
If I refuse, what happens?

150
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:46,591
Because he abducted a young girl,
Japan will lose an outstanding engineer.

151
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,609
40 years old.

152
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,602
Graduated in 1953 from Tokyo University
of Electronics and Optics.

153
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,607
Became a graduate student at MIT in 1957.

154
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,622
Was the backbone of the group that
developed the atomic bomb two years later.

155
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,625
He received numerous awards,
including the famous Faraday prize.

156
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,618
And came back to Japan
in 1960 to get married.

157
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,635
Ambassador J will arrive soon.

158
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,628
What will you do about him?

159
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,635
The property of laser beams
is to travel straight.

160
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,644
The directivity of these high frequencies
has an impressive demolition power.

161
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,650
From this day, from this moment,

162
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,655
Ato and Sei have disappeared.

163
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,672
If there's something or someone interfering,

164
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,676
We want to destroy the organization
and keep going forward. Forward.

165
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,669
We don't want to be diffused like
light or electric waves.

166
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,686
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

167
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,677
Tell me!

168
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,685
I can't tell you.

169
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,693
I will contact you later.

170
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,712
- I haven't said I will help you.
- You will.

171
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,705
- I will call the police.
- Go ahead.

172
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,738
Mom, let's kill daddy.

173
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,741
Daddy? How many daddies?

174
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,745
19, 20. A lot of them.

175
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,748
So many! How will we kill them?

176
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,752
I will stretch a naked wire tight at
the entrance. Daddies will be caught.

177
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,745
Awful! Don't you have
a better method?

178
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,759
I will tie them to a chair.

179
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,752
- They will struggle.
- That's why we have to tie them.

180
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,769
- Then cut their necks off.
- There will be some blood.

181
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,773
Let's hit them with a stick like pigs.

182
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:37,766
- They will cry.
- We make them get down on all fours.

183
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,780
They will beg on their hind
legs for food, like dogs.

184
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,774
But because they can't beg
nicely, I won't give them food.

185
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,788
That's sad.

186
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,792
If I were you, I would
give them some bread.

187
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,794
Mom, you are too kind to them.

188
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,787
Any other method?

189
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:06,795
We could make a big room
with no doors or windows.

190
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:12,800
Then, we take their clothes off, and make
them breathe gas until they are dead.

191
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:16,815
But daddies are coming one
after another. There's no end.

192
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,819
This room will be very busy.

193
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,822
Why do you want to kill them?

194
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:27,815
Because they are happy to be killed.

195
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,842
I've done some research,
but didn't find anything.

196
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,844
It seems there's no lost child anywhere...

197
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,837
- Maybe she always run away from home.
So there's no reported lost child.

198
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,852
The Police might think she will
go back home anyway.

199
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,856
- Let's kill him quick, Mom.
- Kill?

200
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,858
Kill who?

201
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,862
- Daddy.
- That man is your father, after all?

202
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,855
My father is you.

203
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,886
I want to go to the bathroom.
Can someone replace me?

204
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,889
Your break is in 15 minutes.
Can't you wait for a while?

205
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,882
My period just started...

206
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,899
Let's take a look at what you have!
Finally, I know what you're up to...

207
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,916
They will make a scene.
It will be their death cry.

208
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,919
What are you talking about?

209
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,920
Give it back to me!

210
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,922
No way!

211
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,925
Come on! Let me see your body.

212
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,918
I wanna know if you're really
on your period...

213
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,933
- What are you doing?
- You violated office regulations.

214
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,926
I need to look for proof.

215
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,950
Why are you following me?

216
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,943
Your friend blurted
out your little secret.

217
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,975
Ritsuko!

218
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,005
Why are you looking at me like this?

219
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:52,019
You look tired. You have only
been released for three days.

220
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,023
That's not it.

221
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,028
I betrayed us!

222
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,044
What?

223
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,046
- Wait!
- But...

224
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,037
Let me talk to her.

225
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,065
What's wrong? Tell me.

226
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,056
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

227
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,073
What did you say?

228
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,066
I didn't say anything about the
plan. Men can't understand.

229
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,078
It can't be explained.

230
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,122
I will make you some tea.
Give me a minute.

231
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,125
Do you want some milk with it?

232
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,118
All these numbers fell into the milk.

233
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
What numbers?

234
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,123
I am talking about this brain of yours.

235
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,146
I watched you when you were sleeping.
And sometimes I just wonder...

236
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,150
Who is the person sleeping at my side?

237
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,143
In his slowly growing beard,
there's one white hair.

238
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,159
I also wonder what's inside your head.

239
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,161
When I opened your skull
in halves with a knife,

240
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,154
There were a lot of numbers,
equations, plans with symbols...

241
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,171
Those numbers seemed to come
up from a network of wires.

242
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,164
They were coming one by one. Overflowing.
And there was not even a drop of blood.

243
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:23,169
I was scared. I kept my hand on your
skull, but the numbers kept coming.

244
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,190
Don't add sugar... or numbers
into the milk, will you.

245
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,192
That's how you really are.

246
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,185
I had already decided to marry
you before even knowing you.

247
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,189
I don't know if I should
be happy to hear that.

248
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,207
That day, my grandmother
talked to me about you.

249
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,211
That was the day I had to
decide at last what to do.

250
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,204
That was a beautiful day in June.

251
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,220
I woke up and then I opened
the window like I am doing now.

252
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,222
My entire body could feel the nice

253
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,225
Taste of salt the wind carried from the sea.

254
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,227
At the time,

255
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,231
I spontaneously thought I would
get married with the man that was

256
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,222
To be introduced to me that same day.

257
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,237
Already ten years ago?

258
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:25,230
But sometimes, I can't help but thinking
I could have led a very different life.

259
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,236
I could have chosen any life.

260
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,275
I slept with this girl...

261
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,278
Why are you telling me this?

262
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,271
I had to confess it to you.
This is the right time.

263
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,274
I love you.

264
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,310
- I have nothing to tell you.
- I didn't come for your answer.

265
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,324
I just transmit the order.

266
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:51,317
Ambassador J. will visit you the 4th. You
will hold him one hour later than planned.

267
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,323
I don't have the right to change his schedule.

268
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,328
But you will have to.

269
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,349
I'm in love with him.

270
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,352
So I came to see him.

271
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,357
Unfortunately, he pays no attention to me.

272
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,365
Yesterday, I tried tempting him.

273
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,371
I pretended I was lost.

274
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,378
Then, I took him to a deserted place.

275
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,387
I took off my clothes and asked
him to make love to me.

276
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,393
But he just stood there. He
didn't even look at me.

277
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,411
I am telling you the truth.

278
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,503
Try to tell me you love me.

279
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,504
It has absolutely nothing to do with love.

280
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:50,506
You did something terrible.

281
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:52,510
Are you talking about when
we were watching the movie?

282
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,512
I didn't sleep with you.

283
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,514
You did something terrible.

284
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,516
That's it.

285
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,507
So, tell me,

286
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,511
What is love?

287
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,516
This morning, 12 employees from N. chemicals
got nabbed for making barricades.

288
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,519
What is love?

289
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,524
Freedom.

290
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,529
The workers that would die to continue
with their strike at N. chemicals,

291
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,534
Do you feel love for them?

292
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,540
I never thought in such
an old-fashioned way.

293
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,555
You should clearly state that
you don't care about them.

294
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:39,558
I am starting the revolution for myself.

295
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,561
One becomes a spy for his own interest.

296
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,563
Are you talking about Ritsuko?

297
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,567
You start as a revolutionary
and you end up becoming a lesbian.

298
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,570
It is the times we are living.

299
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,573
Or should I say surprising rats?

300
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,576
No. When she got caught that night,

301
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,569
She had been beaten with a club,
jabbed, and then she had been raped.

302
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,575
She eventually managed to take
refuge in a pitch-black alley.

303
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,582
In other words, becoming a treacherous
spy is very similar to a sexual act.

304
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,593
A shudder of pleasure
goes through your body...

305
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,597
Stop!

306
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,603
I don't want to defend Ritsuko.

307
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,707
I was waiting for you.

308
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,709
I knew you would come.

309
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,702
I already told you you were not my father.

310
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,709
Could you please tell me
what's going on?

311
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,714
I am that child's father.

312
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,728
You don't believe me...

313
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,730
That's natural.

314
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,723
Even my child does not believe me.

315
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,733
What does it mean to believe?

316
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,753
You can't answer?

317
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,756
I will tell the truth.

318
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,749
I don't have any proof to show you,
so you will certainly not believe me.

319
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,764
There are many truths for everything.

320
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,757
The one who can give evidence wins.

321
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,778
I also had my own dream
when I was a kid.

322
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,782
I should be designing spaceships by now.

323
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,785
I had already come up with a name for it.

324
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,789
I wanted to call this nice,
pink capsule "Lion".

325
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,793
After graduating from high
school, I went to Tokyo.

326
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,797
Instead of spaceships,
I found something else.

327
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,799
Are you talking about this child's mother?

328
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,792
The very first time we met,

329
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,797
She told me that my hands and
feet were covering the earth.

330
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,805
And that for this reason, she would
change my world completely.

331
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,810
I was madly in love with her.

332
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,814
But one day,

333
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,829
Shortly after giving birth to this child.

334
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,822
She just disappeared.

335
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,829
I kept looking for her,
wandering up and down.

336
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:26,833
For a long time.

337
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,854
Three months ago, I saw her in the street.

338
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,858
I decided to follow her. She was alone.

339
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,851
She was working at the same place.

340
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,857
She treated her daughter as if
she was just another customer.

341
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,863
What do you think she told
me when she saw my face?

342
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,869
Can you imagine ?

343
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,884
17 years had passed.

344
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,888
From that day, we started
living together again.

345
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,881
But it didn't last two weeks.

346
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,910
If this is about an individual privacy
matter, I should not get involved...

347
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,913
But this woman seems to have problems.

348
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,917
She's just very interested in my research.

349
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,908
I see.

350
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
If you send laser beams on this material,

351
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,925
It creates three-dimensional images.

352
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,927
A space with enough depth to make

353
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,929
People think they can actually enter in it.

354
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,931
But of course, that's impossible.

355
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,933
It seems impossible to change the
schedule of Ambassador J too.

356
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,926
Whatever happens, everything
will soon be over.

357
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,941
If people can't enter this space,

358
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,934
It also means that we don't possess it.

359
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,939
If you ask me why,

360
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,955
It is because we can't possess time...

361
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:18,957
If I had known you 17 years
ago, we could have teamed up.

362
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,950
I was already there 17 years ago.

363
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,956
I was invisible to you at the time.

364
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,983
There is something I absolutely
have to tell you.

365
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,974
We have to stop the plan.

366
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,993
I know what happened to your friends

367
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,984
Who attacked the Ambassador's
car at 4 this afternoon.

368
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,001
You betrayed us, right?

369
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,005
Betrayed you? I don't have
enough freedom to do so.

370
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,998
How do you know this, then?

371
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:18,004
I was there when it happened.

372
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,018
I am not afraid of failing.

373
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,022
I am only afraid of having
to stop the plan from going on.

374
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:29,015
And what's more...
It doesn't serve our purpose anymore.

375
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,033
Comrade Shoda,

376
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,036
You have been accused of being
a spy by your comrades.

377
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,040
That's a matter of great importance.

378
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,033
In view of this charge, the present
central committee will examine you.

379
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,047
You are accused of helping the
infiltrated spy called Sei escape.

380
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,050
I don't know anything about that.

381
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,066
He disappeared while I was waiting.

382
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,070
Did you think we would believe
such a childish excuse?

383
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,074
I didn't know Sei was a spy.

384
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,077
He introduced himself as
the dispatch organizer.

385
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,079
He showed me his credentials.

386
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,081
Are you telling me you
didn't know all this?

387
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,083
I was sceptical about him
since the beginning.

388
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:30,076
That's why I reported him
to the Central Committee.

389
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,091
There is noone called Sei at
any level of the organization,

390
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:38,095
Anywhere.

391
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,086
But...

392
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,094
Enough is enough. Just spit out the truth.

393
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,135
The second charge against you

394
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,137
Concerns the raid on Ambassador M.

395
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,141
Even if you knew that it might provoke

396
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,143
The destruction of the organization,

397
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,145
You decided to actively help actively Sei
and jeopardized everything we built.

398
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:34,136
Me?

399
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,145
What about all of you?

400
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,167
Me... You know we were against
the plan from the beginning.

401
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,158
Don't you remember?

402
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,178
But this plan was ordered by Comrade Ato.

403
00:53:05,178 --> 00:53:07,171
At the time...

404
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:13,177
He was a member of this
present committee, right?

405
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,194
Comrade Ato was a spy who managed
to infiltrate the Central Committee.

406
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,196
We got rid of him six months ago.

407
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,187
Half a year ago?

408
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,202
Sei planned this attack only to
jeopoardize the organization.

409
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,193
Impossible!

410
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:36,202
At first, when the organization fell into pieces,

411
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,219
We ended up isolated from the others.

412
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,222
We had to find something
to strike the enemy.

413
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:47,224
We had a cell meeting to decide what to do.

414
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,217
You remember, don't you? Answer me!

415
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,220
At the time,

416
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:00,226
Sei brought up the plan.

417
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,243
He told us he was the organizer
and explained the plan to us.

418
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,245
I see...

419
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,230
You imagined the plan. Sei just had
to bring it up during the meeting.

420
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,500
That's why everything went so smoothly.

421
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,241
No.

422
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,256
Sei discovered there was a spy.

423
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,249
He decided to stop the plan because
it was too dangerous to go on.

424
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,264
You are protecting him again!

425
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,266
That's a common method among spies.

426
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,259
Besides, Comrade Ato was already
expelled from the organization.

427
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:39,250
In other words, Sei is a spy, an informer
and a counter-revolutionary.

428
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,278
And you are the one who helped him.

429
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,280
To our organization,

430
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,283
Comrade Shoda, you too are an informer,
a counter-revolutionary and a spy.

431
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,286
We want to expel you from the organization.

432
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:53,279
Do you have an objection?

433
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,315
Daddy is still standing on the main road.

434
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,308
Daddy comes back everyday
with a different face.

435
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,321
And Mommy is always looking for him.

436
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:43,329
Daddy lies on the bed stealthily.

437
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,336
And mommy takes off his socks.

438
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,359
Mother often said that I couldn't
open the door without knocking.

439
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,399
Please, tie me up.

440
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,392
Why would I do that?

441
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,398
I am mommy.

442
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,432
Mommy speaks with a weird voice.

443
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,435
She says she's a slave.
She asks me to hit her.

444
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,428
She shows me her big bottom.

445
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,443
Daddy is big but he is nice.

446
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,436
He always said he hated hitting mommy.

447
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,452
They're urinating together.

448
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,456
After that, Daddy calls me.

449
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,460
He seems nice, so I come
and sit on his knees.

450
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,462
He leads me to the toilet.

451
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,464
He helps me sit and pee.

452
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,468
I suddenly feel very sad and put my
cheek on daddy's chest. I start crying.

453
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,461
Mommy makes daddy drink alcohol.

454
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,467
He falls off the chair.
He's now on his knees.

455
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,482
Mommy rides him like a horse.

456
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,475
Daddy's feet are flapping.

457
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,491
Daddy's stomach is bleeding.

458
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,495
Giddyup, giddyup, mommy says happily.

459
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,488
The next morning, when I wake up,
Mommy is nowhere to be found.

460
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,502
This house is different.

461
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,509
Please stop!

462
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,578
Do you want a drink?

463
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,571
There are so many things
I don't want to remember...

464
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,586
Ideally, I want to be alone
but you will not let me, right?

465
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,588
No mistake.

466
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,590
You're Sei.

467
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,593
As we speak, many things are happening.

468
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,597
That's scary.

469
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
You're Sei!

470
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,600
No.

471
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,602
I'm Ayu Keisaka's father.

472
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,605
I came to pick up my daughter.

473
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,607
You can see she's not here.

474
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,608
I thought you already took her home.

475
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,599
Didn't you?

476
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,620
Why are you angry?

477
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,613
Are you afraid I might accuse you
of kidnapping my daughter?

478
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,627
Just think about this...

479
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,620
After Ato and you disappeared,

480
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,623
Some terrible things happened.

481
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,637
You seem to have misunderstood
something...

482
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,630
Not only am I not Sei...
There's no such person like Sei.

483
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,634
What did you just say?

484
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,649
There's no Sei.

485
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,642
There's a rumor that he was in West
Germany 2 years ago to work...

486
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,659
...for an atomic organization.
It could be him.

487
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,652
I've talked to him, worked with him...

488
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,657
For that reason, Onko ruined herself.

489
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,689
Sei talked you into failing to

490
01:01:33,689 --> 01:01:35,692
report at the Shinjuku Station.

491
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,694
You failed on purpose!

492
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,696
No doubt about that...

493
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,698
The group reported as planned
but because of you,

494
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,700
Four team members died for nothing!

495
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,702
Answer me!

496
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,695
Don't you think it's time for you
to admit what you did wrong?

497
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,715
You're really stubborn!

498
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,717
A spy obviously...

499
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,718
How about it?

500
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,711
If we rape her, she will maybe
come out with the truth...

501
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,738
Will you confess already?

502
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,742
Comrade Onko, if as you say, you are
fighting for the freedom of the proletariat,

503
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,745
Why did you abandon your companions?

504
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,748
Tell us...

505
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,751
Just admit you're a spy...

506
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,744
We could find out who the traitor isC
catch him. We could destroy him.

507
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,300
It's been 10 years since we first met.

508
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,843
- 27 years.
- What?

509
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,845
It's mid-June in 1980.

510
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,838
It was in 1952 when I first
met the man known as Sei.

511
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,853
I don't believe this man ever existed.

512
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,855
10 years ago, you told
me the same story.

513
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:20,846
Wait a moment...

514
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,860
If it is 1980 now, isn't there something strange?

515
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,862
- What's strange?
- There are too many people here.

516
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,855
Someone here should be already dead.

517
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,880
I don't know you. Who are you?

518
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,883
You will soon understand.

519
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,885
Why did you die?

520
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:49,886
That's a horrible thing to ask...

521
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,877
Why did you die?

522
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,893
That's a scary story.

523
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,896
I don't think any of you really
want to be confronted by the truth.

524
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,899
I don't mind hearing the truth.

525
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,901
Me neither.

526
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,894
It could be helpful for our next battle.

527
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,899
What are you talking about?

528
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,907
Everyone has the right
to find out the truth.

529
01:05:20,908 --> 01:05:25,922
I've never seen you.
Why are you here?

530
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,924
We are holding a meeting to
determine our plan of action.

531
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,917
- A plan?
- We will start the revolution.

532
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,943
She took me here.

533
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,945
This girl... she's my daughter.

534
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,947
- There's no girl here.
- No?

535
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,949
I can't see anything.

536
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,951
You can't?

537
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,944
What's going on?

538
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,964
You should know her.

539
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,980
I know the girl.

540
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,983
I touched her with this hand.

541
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,985
How is that possible?

542
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,978
You recorded everything on film...

543
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,984
All right, let's watch it then.

544
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,040
What's wrong with you?

545
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,041
She's my child...

546
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,044
I don't see anyone.

547
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:32,037
I don't want to see it. Stop the film!

548
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:05,081
What can you see?

549
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,082
The girl, of course.

550
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:10,075
There's no girl...

551
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,565
Your emotions are getting
the better of you.

552
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,082
It's just a shadow.

553
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,098
No, you're wrong.

554
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,089
Then, show her to us.

555
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,104
I'm going to introduce you all to her.

556
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,095
We have to look for her.

557
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,169
Let's get back to what's important.

558
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,174
The death of Onko was politically motivated!

559
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,193
No... She died by accident.

560
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,196
It was at the beginning of autumn.

561
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,199
Hoodlums did it

562
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,203
They were infamous
for their sordid dealings.

563
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,206
They got arrested and said...

564
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,197
...they did it for fun.

565
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,115
That's not true.

566
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,253
Onko was killed by order.

567
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,269
On March 29 1952,

568
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,271
I was in the mountains in west Tama

569
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,274
With 50 comrades.

570
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,276
When we woke up in the morning,

571
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,279
Everything was covered with dew.

572
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,282
Surrounded by more than 130 policemen,

573
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,285
We ran away like monkeys.

574
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:33,289
We almost died of starvation
and cold the next day.

575
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,292
We only had chocolates at that time.

576
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,294
Our only weapon...

577
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,296
At that time,

578
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,299
We ran away from the swamp that
was swollen because of the rain.

579
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,301
I kept repeating to myself :

580
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,304
"Comrade Joseph Vissarionovitch Stalin...

581
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,306
The situation is growing strained,

582
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,310
But we, the proletariat, we
will eventually win in the end."

583
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,314
He appeared many times in front of me.

584
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,316
He was smiling at me.

585
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,319
So many times...

586
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:05,312
Stop it! You have to tell us the truth!

587
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,397
Ambassador M.?

588
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,413
Come with us!

589
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:41,406
Who are you? I don't
need to come with you!

590
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:53,418
My wife has nothing to do
with all that. Let her go.

591
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:58,434
Is this a ploy? A ruse? Do you
really have to use your guns?

592
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:02,427
You're talking too much!
The bullets in this gun are real...

593
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:36,915
What happened?

594
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:37,474
Tell me!

595
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:40,476
You, the 70's guerrilla...
You were one step behind us.

596
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,479
Ambassador M. and his wife
are gone on a very private trip.

597
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,482
We won't tell you the destination.

598
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,484
Ambassador M.?

599
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,486
We're after Ambassador J.

600
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,488
Whoever you're talking about...
Just find him quickly!

601
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,481
He's right. Let's have
them lead us to him.

602
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,518
Do the V sign please...

603
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,520
Please, look at the camera!

604
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,523
Please, smile at the camera.

605
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,516
One more time please.

606
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,520
Look here, please.

607
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,540
AFP. What are your impressions?

608
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,542
Freedom is everything.

609
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,543
AP News Agency.

610
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:51,547
Have you read the statement of your
President that asks for your security.

611
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,540
The group that kidnapped me told me.

612
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,555
News Weekly.

613
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,558
Before I ask a question that represents
800 million Chinese people.

614
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,561
In 1980, at the beginning of a glorious era,

615
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,563
I want to express my respect for the courage...

616
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,554
...you showed during the incident.

617
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,560
Please, do the V sign.

618
01:16:13,572 --> 01:16:16,565
Could you both smile, please.

619
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,586
Of the 4.6 billion humans on this planet,

620
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,589
3.6 billion, regardless of their political system,

621
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,592
have been liberated from fear and hunger.

622
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,594
Do you think it's the result
of a peaceful coexistence?

623
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,598
Tell us, what are the results
of this war of liberation?

624
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,591
The beef steak was particularly excellent.

625
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,614
People of the world...

626
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,617
Just imagine... Without previous
notice, one day, suddenly,

627
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,619
You find yourself involved in an accident.

628
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,621
The greatest happening show being aired :

629
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,623
"You are a hero of the world".

630
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,624
This week, it was "A diplomat kidnapped."

631
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:14,915
It was broadcasted live at the same
time in 140 countries by satellite.

632
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,621
See you again next week!

633
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,635
Is that all? Nothing has been figured out yet!

634
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,639
It's only just begun!

635
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:27,632
We must keep fighting!

636
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,655
We had wonderful, ideal times.

637
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,658
At least, for three months...

638
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,651
While the Proletariats of the world
unified to fight on the same front,

639
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:52,657
Our Proletariat got nylon stockings and toothpaste.

640
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,672
And a face that shows no hunger.

641
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,675
Instead of standing in the front,

642
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:03,668
They chose to go to a Peace Festival and dance.

643
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,674
Not to forget the nice presents
Ambassador M. brought.

644
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:16,679
Weapons with very good performance
and machines to manufacture stockings.

645
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:28,705
They all think I killed myself, right?

646
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,696
You do too?

647
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,706
Given the circumstances, it's
natural to think like that.

648
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,728
However, I swear I won't die.

649
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:54,730
We failed to carry out the plan.

650
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,733
We will all be arrested soon.

651
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,724
So...

652
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:06,743
We won't be able to see
each other for 3, 4 years.

653
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,747
It wasn't our plan's fault though.

654
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,740
It's our phantom democracy
that should be blamed.

655
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,778
After 4 or 5 years, we'll see each other again.

656
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,780
In a dark corner of this society...

657
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,773
Even if it's not the kind of society we want.

658
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,784
The truth is I knew the spy.

659
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,803
I was the lover of Comrade Ato Hakuji,

660
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,806
And I knew the spy from the beginning.

661
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,797
Ato was the spy.

662
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,834
I swear it's here.

663
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,850
It's all right to open the door?

664
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,843
I don't want to see my mother.

665
01:20:57,855 --> 01:20:59,857
Am I not your mother?

666
01:20:59,857 --> 01:21:04,859
She killed my father. She's
certainly still in there. Hanged.

667
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:05,862
I could help her.

668
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,864
She might still be alive.

669
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,866
Why?

670
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,868
That's my duty.

671
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,872
People always have obligations.

672
01:21:14,872 --> 01:21:18,875
If there were no obligation at all,
People could do whatever they wanted.

673
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,877
No, I don't think so.

674
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,870
I don't want to rescue my mother.

675
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:33,009
Now the committee will interrogate
the comrade Shoda.

676
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:38,002
The Party approved this fair inquiry.

677
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:43,018
You are guilty of being a counter revolutionary,

678
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:47,022
an informer and a double agent.

679
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:52,015
Shoda, do you want to defend yourself?

680
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:58,033
You now have a chance to speak
freely and give us your side.

681
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,036
Shoda... let's begin.

682
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,039
What I'm looking for...

683
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,032
What I've been trying to find for so long is...

684
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,046
My child.

685
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,048
We absolutely have to hurry now.

686
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:17,041
Please... Help me find her.

687
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,060
Who are you?

688
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,053
Are you here to testify in favor of Shoda?

689
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,069
I'm his wife.

690
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:38,073
A wife's testimony has no credibility.

691
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:42,066
Shoda, do you really know this woman?

692
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,100
Right now, we're very busy with the revolution.

693
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,091
Look.

694
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,114
Please, listen to me.

695
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,107
My daughter has been kidnapped. She's
been enslaved and will be auctioned off.

696
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:34,129
Don't worry...  I was 16 years
old when I was sold.

697
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,131
But I've not been sold to men...

698
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,134
I've sold myself to the revolution.

699
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,138
Did you give birth to a boy or a girl?

700
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:47,131
I'm not sure. Now that you ask me...

701
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,136
How come you don't know?

702
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,152
Wait!

703
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,155
I don't remember clearly.

704
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,157
When I was 13 years old,

705
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,160
The one who was kidnapped was maybe myself.

706
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,161
I can't remember.

707
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,162
In short, you are your own child...

708
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,164
No. Her name is Ayu.

709
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:12,155
So you're Ayu.

710
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:17,161
Wait! A leader has to
take his responsibility.

711
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:22,166
You have to help her find this girl.

712
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,186
Let's play a game to decide
who the leader is.

713
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:35,179
Who is the leader? Who is
qualified to act as the leader?

714
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,199
We should have a democratic election.

715
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,190
You are the leader!

716
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,204
You are the leader!

717
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,195
You are the leader!

718
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,200
You are the leader!

719
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:41,245
Thank you all for electing me.

720
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,265
Bring the file of Shoda's wife, Kanako.

721
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:15,290
There's nothing in her file.

722
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,283
That's all we have.

723
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,304
There's no record...

724
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,295
...from when she was 13 years old.

725
01:28:35,312 --> 01:28:39,314
Take a look at what's written
from when I was 24.

726
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:43,318
It was in 1960.

727
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,309
It's blank.

728
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,312
And when I was 34 years old?

729
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,328
That's the last page.

730
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:55,319
There's no record.

731
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,338
That is the leader's responsibility.

732
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,341
The leader has responsibility for everyone.

733
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,334
He's the one responsible.

734
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:15,339
Let's decide according to
the principle of our squad...

735
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,369
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

736
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,371
Guilty! Guilty!

737
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,373
Guilty!

738
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:42,366
Guilty! Guilty!

739
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,369
What about you?

740
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:51,387
I don't know... I waive my right to vote.

741
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:54,389
You don't have the right to waive...

742
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,392
We must reach a unanimous decision.

743
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,383
Innocent!

744
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,398
I beg your pardon?

745
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,391
Your silence speaks for itself!

746
01:30:06,403 --> 01:30:11,396
In this world, silence makes every
decision sound like its opposite.

747
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:17,402
I can't make such a decision.

748
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:19,407
You have to answer my question then.

749
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:28,423
What's the only qualification
needed to become a leader?

750
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,414
Answer me quickly!

751
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,930
Love...

752
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,432
The correct answer is "heroism".

753
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,425
He never told you this?

754
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:43,438
Then... he's guilty.

755
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,429
Death by hanging!

756
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,507
Comrades...

757
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,513
Goodbye...

758
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,520
Myself...

759
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,586
We have to stay together!

760
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,588
What did that person want to say?

761
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,590
That I shouldn't have opened the door.

762
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:19,583
Let's go back home.

763
01:34:56,691 --> 01:35:00,695
Who's that? Who?

764
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,697
Tell me!

765
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:06,690
He's my father... Ato Hakuji.

766
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,711
The squad already left.

767
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,714
Yes... To kidnap the Ambassador...

768
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,716
The spy has been exposed.

769
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,718
Everything is in order.

770
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,721
The ennemy doesn't have the slightest idea...

771
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:30,714
Yes... This afternoon at 4 o'clock, third street.

772
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:07,752
They will all die soon. Until then,
they will keep playing games.

773
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:51,807
The Ambassador said that in the last 20 years,
you made a great contribution to science.

774
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:56,811
Your government gave you a decoration and
sent you here. What are your impressions?

775
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,813
What Ambassador?

776
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,815
Ambassador F. M.

777
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,817
In September 1989, after 20 years...

778
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,810
...Ambassador M. has been sent again to Japan.

779
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:18,833
The youth are taking the easy
route of going against the past.

780
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,836
Do you want to have a word with them?

781
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,838
About the development of science
plundering people's freedom...

782
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:26,842
What is your opinion?

783
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:30,845
What do you think of the young men
who turn homosexual to feel free?

784
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,848
Do you sometimes feel disillusionment?

785
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:34,850
Do you like the sea?

786
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:37,852
What brand of alcohol do you like?

787
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,855
When do you think the
study of science will end?

788
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,848
Please, ask me questions I can answer?

789
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,866
What did you want to become
when you were a boy?

790
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,859
A film director.

791
01:37:56,871 --> 01:38:00,864
What about you Mrs.?

792
01:38:06,879 --> 01:38:10,416
When your husband does
his research, what do you do?

793
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:12,889
I think about my husband...

794
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:16,893
Doctor, as a scientist, what do you believe in?

795
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,886
I thought the laser beams were necessary...

796
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:27,891
I managed to turn things nobody
can normally see into visible objects.

797
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:32,896
I made a revolution in the
field of electronic engineering.

798
01:38:38,915 --> 01:38:47,908
The next revolution came soon
after and was superior to mine.

799
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:53,917
It was easier than crushing a baby...

800
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:59,923
The life of new technology is now very short.

801
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:06,941
From when it is born to its maturity...

802
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:10,934
And then to its death...

803
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:15,939
In a word, it's the only thing I knew...

804
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,942
...about life.

805
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,946
In a word...

806
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,965
Doctor, my last question...

807
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,968
What is your ultimate purpose in life?

808
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:37,961
To be the best husband.

809
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,161
You called me.

810
01:43:03,178 --> 01:43:06,180
I'm sure you called me.

811
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:10,173
Why?

812
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:24,187
You're the one who called for me to stop.

813
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,201
What?

814
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:29,204
I didn't ask you to stop. I didn't even talk.

815
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:32,195
I'm in a hurry right now...

816
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:40,214
In a hurry? Where are you going?

817
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:44,218
What do you intend to do?

818
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:46,220
It's none of your business.

819
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,222
Then, take me with you!

820
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,615
Take me out of here.

821
01:43:49,616 --> 01:43:51,226
Take you out of here?

822
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:53,228
We're at the terminus of the subway.

823
01:43:53,228 --> 01:43:57,221
Anybody is free to walk here...

824
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,239
What is this place?

825
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:26,249
That's the place where
we're supposed to meet up.

826
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:33,257
Who? Who decided that?

827
01:44:33,269 --> 01:44:37,262
I have to kidnap someone...

828
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:49,272
The person you're going to kidnap... It's me.

829
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:54,457
Nobody can kill me.

830
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,476
What time is it now?

831
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,478
Noon...

832
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:08,471
Our companions are gathering up...

833
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:23,488
- What time is it now?
- 1 o'clock.

834
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:32,495
- I'm talking. What's the time?
- 2 o'clock.

835
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,516
They are waiting for me...

836
01:48:43,516 --> 01:48:46,520
- What time is it now?
- 3 o'clock.

837
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:50,523
They're moving now... The time?

838
01:48:50,523 --> 01:48:52,526
Just half past 3.

839
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:54,517
I didn't go.

840
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:06,529
What time is it really?

841
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:16,550
I didn't give them the weapon.

842
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:18,552
They are certainly confused...

843
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:22,545
What time is it now... What time is it?

844
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:29,563
I have to give them the weapon!

845
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:33,556
You have to? It's impossible...

846
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:38,561
Give it to me! Give it!

847
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:47,570
No! You can't!

848
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,589
It's too late anyway...

849
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:57,580
It's not necessary anymore.

850
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:07,650
My god... my nihilism...

851
01:51:33,686 --> 01:51:35,677
It's not because I was afraid.

852
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:45,686
I know... The uselessness of
all this overwhelmed you.

853
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:59,702
We'll certainly never see each other again...

854
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,732
I'm the spy who betrayed you. Go!

855
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:20,734
Go right now! You have to stop the plan!

856
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:24,727
Otherwise everybody will be caught.

857
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:29,732
There never was any spy...

858
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:38,741
Yes, there was! I knew him!

859
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,744
It's over.

860
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:50,753
You accomplished your task.

861
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:59,762
Hurry! You have to go to the 3rd
line's platform of the Shinjuku Station.

862
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:03,767
On the second bench... a man with
a bandage on his right hand...

863
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:51,994
It's completely over... Nothing's left...

864
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:01,003
- There are still things to do.
- To leave for a distant place?

865
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,013
I'm going to get rid of what
I thought was my God.
