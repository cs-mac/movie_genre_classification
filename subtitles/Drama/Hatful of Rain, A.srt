A
J&H Entertainment
Release

1
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,449
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

2
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,822
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

3
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,294
Three times?
You're on a roll.

4
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,922
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

5
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,558
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

6
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,898
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

7
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,133
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

8
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,719
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

9
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,811
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

10
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,321
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

11
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,292
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,159
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

13
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:30,631
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

14
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,328
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

15
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,894
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

16
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:38,406
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

17
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,942
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

18
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,138
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

19
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:48,048
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?

20
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,483
Babbitt Collectibles.

21
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:53,350
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

22
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,390
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

23
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,618
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.

24
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:01,220
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

25
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,628
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

26
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,535
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

27
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,732
I need this.
Come on.

28
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,741
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

29
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,244
His number?
He's on the road now.

30
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:19,541
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

31
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:22,344
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

32
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,884
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

33
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:27,944
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

34
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:31,822
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

35
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:35,020
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

36
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,154
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

37
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,223
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.

38
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,861
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

39
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:47,304
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

40
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,801
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.

41
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:55,245
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

42
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,839
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

43
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,445
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

44
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,455
And because of your
incredible patience...

45
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:09,085
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

46
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,755
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

47
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,766
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.

48
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,825
Thank you.

49
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,705
Ready for Palm Springs?

50
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,969
You still want to go
with all these problems?

51
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:27,102
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

52
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,147
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.

53
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,149
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

54
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:35,151
I got it under control.

55
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,441
I don't want to be demanding...

56
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,378
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

57
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,974
Consider it foreplay.

58
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:11,417
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

59
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,588
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

60
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:19,526
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

61
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,393
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

62
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,729
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

63
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,702
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

64
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:33,037
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

65
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:37,704
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

66
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,010
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

67
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:44,347
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

68
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,411
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

69
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,582
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

70
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:53,455
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

71
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,826
This is not talking.

72
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:59,833
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.

73
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,596
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

74
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,366
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

75
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,170
He's been trying to reach you.

76
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,733
Your father has died, Charlie.

77
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:18,147
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

78
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,209
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

79
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,346
Anything else?

80
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:26,620
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

81
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:33,029
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

82
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,932
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.

83
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:40,063
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

84
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,403
We just didn't get along.

85
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:45,842
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:50,575
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

87
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,207
I want to.

88
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:56,014
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

89
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:13,697
...to our beloved neighbor...

90
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:18,572
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

91
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:22,100
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

92
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,979
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...

93
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,519
dedication to family...

94
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:32,680
and charity to all.

95
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:36,555
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...

96
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:40,995
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

97
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:54,732
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

98
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,471
I can wait in the car.

99
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:37,018
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

100
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:41,024
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.

101
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:45,529
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

102
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:48,065
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

103
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,569
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

104
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,105
Know it by rote.

105
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,622
You were his only child.

106
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,124
You came along when he was...

107
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,854
what, 45 or something?

108
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,726
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

109
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,095
so he had to love you.

110
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:27,068
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

111
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:31,004
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.

112
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:34,406
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

113
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:36,569
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

114
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:40,308
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

115
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,511
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

116
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:46,679
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

117
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:49,053
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

118
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,820
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.

119
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,487
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

120
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:58,055
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

121
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:02,092
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

122
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,072
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

123
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:08,836
Because l--
I deserved it.

124
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,277
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

125
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:15,110
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

126
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:17,616
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

127
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:20,119
Pulled over.

128
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:23,918
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

129
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,483
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

130
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,622
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

131
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,292
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

132
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,394
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

133
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,904
Two days.

134
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:42,806
Were you scared?

135
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,343
Yeah, I was scared.

136
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,447
Left home.
I never saw him again.

137
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:51,210
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

138
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:53,717
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

139
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,481
It's strange, huh?

140
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:59,490
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

141
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:04,393
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

142
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,863
The rain what?

143
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,596
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

144
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,106
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

145
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,235
Not so much.

146
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:22,278
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

147
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:25,215
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

148
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,342
So full of yourself.

149
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,886
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

150
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:32,081
is understandable as well.

151
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:36,115
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

152
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,821
all these I forgive.

153
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:41,125
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...

154
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,929
has left me without a son.

155
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,960
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

156
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,043
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

157
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:59,048
that certain Buick convertible...

158
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:03,950
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

159
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,149
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

160
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,158
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

161
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,660
and the possibility of perfection.

162
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:15,561
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

163
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:18,794
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

164
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:22,031
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

165
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,799
What does that mean?

166
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:27,467
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

167
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:32,207
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

168
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,840
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

169
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,885
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

170
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:41,353
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

171
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:44,586
What is that?
How does that work?

172
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,526
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

173
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,496
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

174
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,499
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

175
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,728
What's his name got--

176
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:57,828
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

177
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,772
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

178
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,832
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

179
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,606
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

180
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,477
- There's no need--
- To what?

181
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,743
To be upset?

182
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,183
To be upset?

183
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,915
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

184
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,254
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

185
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,090
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

186
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,529
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

187
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,863
Were you?

188
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,962
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

189
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,436
I was looking for you.

190
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,445
How did it go?

191
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,982
I got what I expected.

192
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:02,725
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

193
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,647
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

194
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,156
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

195
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,418
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

196
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:41,603
Is this Wallbrook?

197
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,605
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

198
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,766
Excuse me.

199
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,776
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

200
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,784
Would you Like
to wait in his office?

201
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:59,286
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

202
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:16,636
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

203
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,619
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

204
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,319
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

205
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:44,261
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

206
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,595
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

207
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,157
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.

208
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:53,227
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

209
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,069
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

210
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,540
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

211
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,544
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

212
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:03,275
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

213
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:32,406
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

214
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,911
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

215
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,412
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

216
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,142
The year my mother died.

217
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:42,448
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

218
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,113
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

219
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:49,454
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

220
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,619
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

221
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,926
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

222
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:57,489
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

223
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,832
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

224
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:03,771
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

225
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,774
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

226
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:08,935
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

227
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:11,775
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

228
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,349
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

229
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,908
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

230
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,887
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

231
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:23,891
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

232
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:27,416
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

233
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,087
Of course, today's Monday.

234
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,100
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

235
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,795
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

236
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,303
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

237
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:41,206
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

238
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,972
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

239
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:47,503
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

240
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,879
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

241
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,418
Now they're pitiful red.

242
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,921
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

243
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:58,717
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

244
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,754
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

245
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:06,994
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

246
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,535
Only 8,095 production models.

247
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:12,128
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

248
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,140
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

249
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,641
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

250
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:20,305
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

251
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,473
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

252
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,540
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

253
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:29,076
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

254
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:32,818
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

255
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:35,452
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

256
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,587
I wanna ask you a question.

257
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:40,268
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

258
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:43,203
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

259
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:45,501
Bruner, who is this guy?

260
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,838
Raymond is your brother.

261
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:52,744
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

262
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:55,476
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

263
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,451
'The People's Court.'

264
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,010
'The People's Court.'

265
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:07,223
'The People's Court.'

266
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:12,529
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

267
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,534
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

268
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,068
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

269
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:19,368
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

270
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,374
I don't know what that means.

271
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,932
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

272
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,878
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

273
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:29,142
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

274
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:32,742
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

275
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,050
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

276
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,113
and how it's processed.

277
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,625
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.

278
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:42,990
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

279
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,997
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

280
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:48,329
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

281
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:55,232
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

282
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,833
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

283
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,845
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

284
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:03,313
Rituals. That's a good one.

285
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:06,146
Well, it's the way he acts...

286
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:10,153
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

287
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:14,214
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?

288
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:17,659
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

289
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:20,322
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

290
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,094
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.

291
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:26,897
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

292
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,963
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

293
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,875
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

294
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:37,345
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

295
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,577
I don't know.

296
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,914
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

297
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:48,150
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

298
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,989
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

299
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,327
He's just inherited $3 million...

300
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,230
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

301
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:02,567
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

302
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,767
Good ol' Dad.

303
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,878
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

304
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,176
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

305
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,240
Why is he doin' that?

306
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:18,343
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

307
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,353
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

308
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:23,254
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

309
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:27,819
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

310
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:30,330
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.

311
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:33,026
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.

312
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,694
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

313
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,865
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

314
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,842
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

315
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:49,239
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.

316
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:51,716
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

317
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:55,551
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.

318
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:58,785
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.

319
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,692
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

320
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:04,389
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.

321
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,658
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

322
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:09,030
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

323
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,502
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

324
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,563
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

325
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,869
- Stop it!
- Yes.

326
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:20,675
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

327
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:22,771
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

328
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:23,974
Maybe you'd better put it back.

329
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:30,015
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

330
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:32,353
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

331
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:35,518
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

332
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,893
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

333
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:41,364
It's okay, Ray.

334
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,424
- My main man.
- My main man.

335
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:48,631
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.

336
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:52,540
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

337
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:57,580
That's his way of showing he likes you.

338
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,481
But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

339
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,714
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

340
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:08,315
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

341
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:12,795
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

342
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,797
He wouldn't notice?

343
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:18,631
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

344
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:21,534
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

345
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,635
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?

346
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,941
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

347
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:33,414
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

348
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:36,110
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.

349
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,949
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

350
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:41,990
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.

351
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:44,389
I won't do it.

352
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:49,363
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

353
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:53,925
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

354
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,768
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

355
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,035
No. Just stay there.

356
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:08,378
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

357
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,284
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--

358
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:14,186
What?

359
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,985
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...

360
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,390
and wait for you again
at the gate?

361
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:22,793
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

362
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:24,797
The car disturbs him.

363
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,992
- That's why?
- That's why.

364
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:30,368
Okay, Raymond.

365
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:43,812
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.

366
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:45,646
I don't know.

367
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:52,281
Listen, our father died last week.

368
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:54,349
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

369
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,124
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

370
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:02,267
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

371
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,701
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

372
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:09,138
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

373
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:16,938
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

374
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:21,348
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

375
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,910
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.

376
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:28,391
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

377
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,553
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

378
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:34,063
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

379
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:36,600
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

380
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,396
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,630
Come on, Ray.

382
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,103
It's a Long way
to California...

383
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:48,906
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

384
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:51,504
Have to be back in two hours.

385
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:55,381
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.

386
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,443
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

387
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,983
Here is Raymond's room.

388
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,885
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

389
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,890
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

390
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,121
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.

391
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,222
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--

392
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,065
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.

393
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,729
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

394
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,638
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

395
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,938
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.

396
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,412
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.

397
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:14,474
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.

398
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,576
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.

399
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:21,556
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.

400
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,592
Pick up, Lenny.

401
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,097
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.

402
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:30,962
- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.

403
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:32,296
6:30 p.m. is dinner.

404
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:35,303
It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

405
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,305
Orange soda.

406
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,432
Has to be in a can with a straw.

407
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:43,877
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

408
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:46,380
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

409
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,792
V-E-R-N!

410
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,306
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.

411
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,903
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

412
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:18,241
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

413
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:21,577
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.

414
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,742
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.

415
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,809
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

416
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,945
Hamburger, Ray?

417
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:32,651
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?

418
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:36,457
- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.

419
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:39,896
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.

420
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:44,369
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.

421
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:47,133
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

422
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,572
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

423
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:58,616
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.

424
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,053
'Wheel of Fortune'!

425
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:08,082
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...

426
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,627
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.

427
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:15,133
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

428
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,225
Thousands of dollars in cash.

429
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:23,706
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...

430
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:27,302
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...

431
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:31,212
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!

432
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:35,650
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?

433
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,084
I don't want pepperoni.

434
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:41,250
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?

435
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:45,158
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?

436
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:48,493
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.

437
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,934
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.

438
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:55,995
I'll be right back.

439
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:03,271
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.

440
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:06,638
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.

441
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,466
- Si! Si!
- Si.

442
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,850
What is that?

443
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,761
I think Raymond is in the room.

444
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:45,459
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.

445
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,798
Well, get out!
Get out!

446
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,804
- Go!
- Stop it.

447
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:56,909
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

448
00:33:56,977 --> 00:33:59,445
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

449
00:33:59,514 --> 00:34:02,971
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

450
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,984
Go in there.

451
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,859
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?

452
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,326
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?

453
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:18,728
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.

454
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,063
You understand that?

455
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,624
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.

456
00:34:23,703 --> 00:34:26,001
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!

457
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,131
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.

458
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:31,665
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

459
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:47,114
You don't listen to me.

460
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:50,060
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

461
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,224
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.

462
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:56,392
Charlie, you're his brother!

463
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,936
They tell you today
that you have a brother...

464
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,699
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.

465
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:05,470
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.

466
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:08,535
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

467
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,706
You don't tell me anything.

468
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:13,545
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?

469
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:17,781
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

470
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:21,052
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?

471
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,490
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

472
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,051
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

473
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,224
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

474
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,666
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?

475
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:34,862
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?

476
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,065
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!

477
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,370
What is this, huh?
Susanna?

478
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,947
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

479
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:49,813
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.

480
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:52,912
You're leaving me now?
I need you!

481
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:55,513
You need nobody.

482
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,990
What does that mean?

483
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,928
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?

484
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:03,556
Your crime is
that you use people!

485
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:07,591
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?

486
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:10,660
Raymond, am I using you?

487
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,571
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!

488
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:16,576
What good is $3 million to him?

489
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:20,444
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.

490
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:24,780
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?

491
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:28,788
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.

492
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,257
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.

493
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:36,660
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?

494
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,358
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!

495
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,561
I did not take him.
I took my half.

496
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,604
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

497
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:50,132
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
Leave in the middle of the night. Wait.

498
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,646
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?

499
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,806
I want out.

500
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,990
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

501
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,900
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

502
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:58,306
Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

503
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,866
How did you know
my phone number?

504
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:03,178
How'd you know that?

505
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:07,443
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

506
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:12,219
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

507
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,918
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

508
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:18,858
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

509
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:21,123
Did you memorize the whole book?

510
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:24,132
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'

511
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,498
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.

512
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:29,367
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'

513
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:33,966
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'

514
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,343
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.

515
00:38:42,484 --> 00:38:45,078
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

516
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,883
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

517
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:50,447
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

518
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:54,393
They got pancakes.

519
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:58,694
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

520
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:01,029
You don't need toothpicks.

521
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:04,401
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

522
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,962
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

523
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,167
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.

524
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:12,804
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

525
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,075
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?

526
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:17,447
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.

527
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:21,420
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

528
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:24,581
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

529
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:26,090
We haven't ordered yet.

530
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,425
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.

531
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:34,228
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

532
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,667
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

533
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:41,673
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--

534
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,005
Don't make a scene.

535
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:46,942
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.

536
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:10,634
What are you writing?

537
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,636
What the fuck is this?

538
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:18,575
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?

539
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:21,543
'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

540
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:24,978
Number 18 in 1988.

541
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,013
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.

542
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:31,714
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?

543
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,325
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

544
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,860
Where are you, son?

545
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:40,192
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

546
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:42,993
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

547
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,192
No problem.

548
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:47,464
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

549
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:48,970
Don't touch that.

550
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:52,097
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

551
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:54,575
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

552
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:56,076
He belongs here.

553
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:59,308
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?

554
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:02,407
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.

555
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:05,544
This is where he can get
the best care.

556
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:07,782
We're talking about his well-being.

557
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,484
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

558
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,527
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

559
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,893
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

560
00:41:15,964 --> 00:41:17,898
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...

561
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:21,424
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

562
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,231
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

563
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:25,397
Could you get him some?
Thank you.

564
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,498
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?

565
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:30,840
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.

566
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,879
Or we can cut a deal right now.

567
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,438
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.

568
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:38,280
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

569
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:41,378
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?

570
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,820
I cannot make
money deals with you.

571
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,824
Then I'll see you in court.

572
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,395
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

573
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:55,934
82, 82, 82.

574
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,697
82 what, Ray?

575
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,205
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

576
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,309
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

577
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:07,540
246 total.

578
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:08,944
Keep the change.

579
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:12,609
How many toothpicks are in there?

580
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:15,916
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

581
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:17,478
246.

582
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:20,921
There's four left in the box.

583
00:42:22,494 --> 00:42:24,587
I have to get my backpack.

584
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:30,158
97X.

585
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:32,726
The future of rock and roll.

586
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:35,500
97X.

587
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:38,972
The future of rock and roll.

588
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,375
97X.

589
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:47,141
The future of rock and roll.

590
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:54,349
The future of rock and roll.

591
00:42:54,424 --> 00:42:55,414
Ray.

592
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,461
Enough already.
Change the channel.

593
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,325
The future of rock and roll.

594
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:11,698
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

595
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:13,969
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.

596
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:16,569
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.

597
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:19,478
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.

598
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:21,607
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?

599
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:24,346
- My Loan is past due.
- I'll call the Loan officer...

600
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:26,582
tell him we have
a little problem.

601
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,023
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.

602
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:33,118
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?

603
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:37,097
Now, remember, the Buick
is in A-3, main terminal.

604
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:40,134
Make sure they pick it up.
All right? See you in a few.

605
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:48,370
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

606
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:51,071
please pick up
a white courtesy phone?

607
00:43:51,146 --> 00:43:53,080
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

608
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,914
Ray, let's go. Come on.

609
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:03,018
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

610
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,388
You don't know?

611
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:07,916
Final call for flight 1559...

612
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:11,619
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

613
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:15,546
There's an airplane out there.

614
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:17,648
That's right,
and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

615
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:19,660
- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.

616
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:22,128
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.

617
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:24,420
Now come on.

618
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:29,299
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

619
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,929
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.

620
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,939
In 1987, there were
30 airline accidents.

621
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,204
211 were fatalities
and 230 were definitely passengers.

622
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:39,211
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

623
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:41,473
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.

624
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:44,176
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

625
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,843
- You don't know?
- No.

626
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:48,046
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

627
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:52,354
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.

628
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,155
American flight 625...

629
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:56,752
crashed April 27, 1976.

630
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:00,056
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.

631
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,395
Pick another airline.

632
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:05,836
- Continental. We'll take Continental.
- Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

633
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:08,372
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

634
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:11,509
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

635
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:15,069
I have to get to Los Angeles.
So you're gonna get on that plane.

636
00:45:15,148 --> 00:45:16,671
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

637
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,978
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

638
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:22,916
Now, there's a Delta.

639
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:25,183
- Yeah.
- It leaves at midnight.

640
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:26,383
How's Delta?

641
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:29,950
Delta crashed August 2, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

642
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,019
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.

643
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,292
- All airlines--
- 135 passengers.

644
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:36,766
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

645
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,802
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

646
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,598
- Quantas.
- Quantas?

647
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,230
Quantas never crashed.

648
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,274
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

649
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,472
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.

650
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,480
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.

651
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,982
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.

652
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,518
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

653
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,917
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.

654
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,683
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

655
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,452
- 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

656
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,856
Very lovely beaches.

657
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,827
We're getting on this plane!

658
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,990
Ray! Ray! Ray!

659
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,767
We're not gonna take the plane.
He's okay. He's okay!

660
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,832
We're not gonna take the plane.

661
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,571
Just relax.
He was upset.

662
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:27,638
We were gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna take it now.

663
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:30,344
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

664
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:35,920
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

665
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:39,026
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

666
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:41,187
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

667
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,264
Okay? Come on, Ray.

668
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:45,822
Ray? Come on.

669
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,663
- Yeah.
- Come here.

670
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,669
- No flying.
- We're not taking the plane.

671
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:51,796
- Just grab the fuckin' bag.
- No flying.

672
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:56,543
You're killin' me, Ray.
I just want you to know.

673
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:58,545
- No flying.
- I gotta be in L.A. in three hours.

674
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:00,581
It's gonna take me three days.

675
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:02,047
Come on!

676
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:06,318
No flying.

677
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:07,979
- No flying.
- No flying.

678
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:12,852
I got 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

679
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:15,258
- I watch 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.
- Don't start with that.

680
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:17,262
'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

681
00:47:51,797 --> 00:47:54,459
- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.

682
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:57,160
Can you get another unit here
for point control?

683
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:59,704
Two more over to you. 10-40.

684
00:48:01,606 --> 00:48:03,267
Let's go!

685
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,868
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A.?

686
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,207
Ray?

687
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:15,176
Get in the car.

688
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,280
Get in the car.
Are you crazy?

689
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,186
We'll be outta this in a second.

690
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:21,747
- Yeah.
- That's good.

691
00:48:21,825 --> 00:48:23,952
It's okay. That's right.

692
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,861
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

693
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:30,263
- That's good. That's good.
- There's a fatal accident over there.

694
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,526
We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

695
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:36,730
Just a minute!

696
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,937
Son of a bitch! Ray?

697
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,712
Excuse-- Hey--

698
00:48:45,782 --> 00:48:47,773
- Just wait--
- There's nothing to see here.

699
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:50,114
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

700
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:52,586
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

701
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:55,215
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

702
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:57,316
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

703
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,758
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

704
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,764
A lot of work for $3 million.

705
00:49:02,832 --> 00:49:05,459
I'd Like to Leave him on the highway
and get outta here.

706
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:08,229
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

707
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:15,736
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!

708
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,784
What's it gonna be, Ray?

709
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:26,820
This is
a very dangerous highway.

710
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:28,354
How will I get to L.A.?

711
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:30,982
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.

712
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:33,151
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

713
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:35,458
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...

714
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,463
in order to get off the highway!

715
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:40,466
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.

716
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:45,596
I got a great idea.

717
00:49:45,671 --> 00:49:48,368
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

718
00:49:48,442 --> 00:49:52,208
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

719
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:53,711
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

720
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,044
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

721
00:49:56,115 --> 00:49:58,812
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

722
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,891
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

723
00:50:09,962 --> 00:50:12,589
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

724
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:15,225
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

725
00:50:15,301 --> 00:50:16,460
Who is on first.

726
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,702
Whose wife? Yes.

727
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:22,035
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

728
00:50:22,107 --> 00:50:23,039
Absolutely.

729
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:25,736
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.

730
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:27,745
No, what is on second base.

731
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:30,543
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

732
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:32,913
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
- Get in the car!

733
00:50:32,984 --> 00:50:35,213
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

734
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:38,381
Get in the car. Yeah.
I have to be in bed by 11:00.

735
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:40,925
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

736
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:49,126
Now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

737
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,259
We have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out.

738
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:53,269
We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

739
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:56,170
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up time.

740
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,230
I should've been in Los Angeles
this afternoon.

741
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,173
My business needs me.
I gotta make up time.

742
00:51:00,243 --> 00:51:03,940
Definitely watch TV, but be
in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

743
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:05,208
Forget it.

744
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:07,216
19 minutes to 11:00.

745
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,232
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'

746
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,734
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...

747
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:29,202
because my business
is going down the toilet.

748
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:30,898
I should be in L.A.

749
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:34,966
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

750
00:51:35,043 --> 00:51:37,136
because you won't
go out when it rains.

751
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:40,305
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.

752
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:46,714
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

753
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:49,657
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.

754
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:51,817
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

755
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:55,295
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.

756
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:58,298
So many leftover details.
My family is...

757
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,459
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

758
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,765
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

759
00:52:02,837 --> 00:52:04,964
It is a shock, to say the least.

760
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:09,135
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?

761
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,179
A couple of days
would make a big difference.

762
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:22,288
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

763
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,660
What? Speak up, Lenny.

764
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,662
I didn't buy that kind of time.

765
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,698
I want you to go down--
How much?

766
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:33,993
- It's 12:30.
- What?

767
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:35,500
Lunch is 12:30.

768
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,934
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

769
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:39,868
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

770
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:42,806
Green lime Jell-O.
Want another apple juice?

771
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,605
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

772
00:52:45,678 --> 00:52:47,612
I gotta go.
He's startin' to rock and moan.

773
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,114
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

774
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:52,309
- Give me that gun.
- Where is he?

775
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:54,946
Where is he?

776
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:56,987
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

777
00:52:57,055 --> 00:53:00,048
'Frame'? Where is he?

778
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,184
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

779
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,694
There's supposed to be eight.
There's only four.

780
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:06,525
There's eight.

781
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:08,828
You take a shower, Ray?

782
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,198
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

783
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,898
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

784
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:17,407
What do you say, Ray?

785
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,443
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

786
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:22,340
That's the end
of that conversation.

787
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,415
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

788
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:30,283
The answer: 'Shakespeare wrote
over 150 poems in this 14-line form.'

789
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,322
- What is a sonnet?
- What is a sonnet?

790
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:34,323
- You got it.
- Double letters for 200.

791
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:38,760
The top of that one. 'The last word
in the Pledge of Allegiance.' Mark.

792
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:40,194
- What is 'stands'?
- No.

793
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:41,697
Stu, Stu, Stu.

794
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:45,598
Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

795
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,499
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.

796
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:53,872
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...

797
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:55,877
and the $3 million, right?

798
00:53:55,945 --> 00:54:00,405
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.

799
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,951
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

800
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:05,510
I found that it wasn't
an original record...

801
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:07,748
because the original song
had two verses--

802
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:11,259
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

803
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:14,295
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.

804
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,670
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.

805
00:54:32,613 --> 00:54:36,141
Look at that.
1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

806
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:37,706
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

807
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:40,253
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

808
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,812
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

809
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,824
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

810
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,055
When did you drive?

811
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:50,061
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

812
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:54,129
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

813
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,327
Yeah.

814
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,938
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

815
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:04,236
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.

816
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:10,113
You never touch this steering wheel
when I'm driving! Do you hear me?

817
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:11,309
- Yeah.
- Do you hear me?

818
00:55:11,384 --> 00:55:14,285
- I don't have my underwear.
- What?

819
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,288
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

820
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:19,450
-I gave you a pair of mine this morning.
-They're not my underwear.

821
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:23,156
I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?

822
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:25,321
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

823
00:55:25,397 --> 00:55:26,694
- Where?
- Here.

824
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:30,261
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

825
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:32,963
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?

826
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,801
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

827
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:37,932
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

828
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:41,137
All right. When we pass a store,
we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

829
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,079
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

830
00:55:44,148 --> 00:55:46,412
We're not going back.
Don't start with that.

831
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:48,452
- 400 Oak Street.
- We're not going back.

832
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,715
You don't have to go
to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

833
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,188
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

834
00:55:53,257 --> 00:55:55,817
- It's Kmart.
- I know you hear me.

835
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,520
- My boxer shorts have--
- You don't fool me.

836
00:55:58,595 --> 00:55:59,688
Yours are too tight.

837
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:02,664
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

838
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:03,825
Shut up!

839
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:09,262
Cincinnati's a Long way off.

840
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:12,172
You're getting further away
from Kmart.

841
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:14,972
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.

842
00:56:15,044 --> 00:56:16,978
You have to go to Kmart,
400 Oak Street.

843
00:56:17,046 --> 00:56:19,310
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.

844
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:22,909
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- That is final. Did you hear me?

845
00:56:29,391 --> 00:56:32,326
I'm goin' out of my mind!

846
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:36,593
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

847
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:40,294
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

848
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:43,861
It is underwear wherever you buy it,
in Cincinnati or wherever!

849
00:56:44,973 --> 00:56:46,964
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

850
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:50,374
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit.

851
00:56:50,445 --> 00:56:53,472
You can't tell me that you're
not in there somewhere.

852
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:54,879
Boxer shorts.

853
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,375
Boxer shorts. Kmart.

854
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,517
These are--
These are Hanes 32.

855
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,955
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

856
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,721
We have to make a little stop,
find a psychiatrist...

857
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:08,728
'cause you're driving me crazy.

858
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:10,730
- Oak and Burnett.
- You are driving me--

859
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:12,857
We have to buy them at Kmart,
Oak and Burnett...

860
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,629
back in--

861
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:17,966
You put your shorts
on the highway.

862
00:57:18,038 --> 00:57:20,371
We have to go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

863
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:48,533
Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.

864
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:21,058
Raymond?

865
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,335
Hey, you.

866
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,170
Dipshit, move it!

867
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:11,846
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

868
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:14,007
Hey, buddy.

869
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,550
You'll get run over.

870
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,109
- You're gonna get hurt.
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

871
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,917
- Do you hear me?
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

872
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,448
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

873
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,518
I'm sorry. Raymond?

874
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,756
- Yeah.
- Come on.

875
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,799
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

876
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,800
Raymond, come on.

877
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:34,893
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

878
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,904
- It said, 'Don't walk.'
- Yes, it's broken.

879
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:38,906
It said, 'Don't walk.'

880
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,069
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

881
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,874
400 Oak and Burnett.

882
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:50,279
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

883
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,820
and this is the way
our country developed...

884
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:55,618
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

885
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:58,454
During that period of time...

886
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:01,052
there was initiated...

887
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:05,326
what was known as
the Pony Express.

888
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:09,199
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.

889
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,103
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...

890
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:16,768
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.

891
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:19,677
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?

892
01:00:19,747 --> 01:00:21,304
No, he's autistic.

893
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:24,112
I'm not familiar with that.

894
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:26,085
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

895
01:00:26,153 --> 01:00:27,676
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--

896
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,087
He lives in a world of his own.

897
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:33,785
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

898
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:36,920
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--

899
01:00:36,996 --> 01:00:41,092
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.

900
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:47,638
They set up an initial program...

901
01:00:47,706 --> 01:00:49,765
where the Pony Express...

902
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:53,835
would ride for approximately
20 miles--

903
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:56,642
What am I supposed to do?

904
01:00:56,715 --> 01:00:59,479
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

905
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:01,485
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

906
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:04,147
but I do know his brain doesn't work
Like other people.

907
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:06,191
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.

908
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:09,283
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.

909
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,227
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.

910
01:01:12,296 --> 01:01:14,287
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

911
01:01:14,365 --> 01:01:17,493
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?

912
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:19,661
I just gotta deal with it.

913
01:01:19,737 --> 01:01:22,638
Yeah, that's about it.

914
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:25,641
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?

915
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:29,579
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

916
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:31,637
He counts toothpicks.

917
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:33,910
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...

918
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:36,954
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

919
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:40,285
- He counted 'em in seconds.
- Ray.

920
01:01:40,357 --> 01:01:41,654
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

921
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:43,693
Are you good with numbers?

922
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,593
- Yeah.
- I read about this.

923
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,721
- I wanna try somethin' here.
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

924
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:51,130
What'd I tell you?
After this.

925
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,669
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

926
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:56,671
Do you know how much 312...

927
01:01:56,739 --> 01:01:59,037
times 123 is?

928
01:01:59,108 --> 01:02:01,599
38,376.

929
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,235
He's right.

930
01:02:03,312 --> 01:02:05,075
- What?
- He's right.

931
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,115
- He's right?
- Yeah. Ray.

932
01:02:07,183 --> 01:02:10,584
How much is 4,343...

933
01:02:10,653 --> 01:02:13,849
times 1,234?

934
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:15,913
5,359,262.

935
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,958
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

936
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:21,019
- He's a genius.
- Ray.

937
01:02:21,095 --> 01:02:24,462
Do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

938
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:29,867
46.15192304.

939
01:02:30,605 --> 01:02:32,765
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

940
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,935
That is amazing. He should
work for NASA or something.

941
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:41,873
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents...

942
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,043
how much money
would you have left?

943
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:48,981
About 70.

944
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,990
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

945
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,152
- So much for NASA.
- We should go to Kmart.

946
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,888
After this, Ray.

947
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:57,623
400 Oak Street.

948
01:02:57,697 --> 01:02:59,631
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

949
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:03,394
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

950
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:05,801
You know how much one of those
new compact cars costs?

951
01:03:05,872 --> 01:03:07,362
About $100.

952
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:12,507
In his case, he's pretty well off.
He's very high-functioning.

953
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:16,947
Most autistics can't speak
or communicate.

954
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,609
Do you know what 'autistic' is?

955
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:22,176
- Yeah.
- You know that word?

956
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,824
Are you autistic?

957
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:29,794
I don't think so.

958
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:33,330
No. Definitely not.

959
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,033
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

960
01:03:40,105 --> 01:03:42,505
Let me see if I understand this.

961
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:45,508
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additional for each car.

962
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:49,569
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

963
01:03:49,647 --> 01:03:50,910
What?

964
01:03:50,982 --> 01:03:53,313
They wanna take out the manifold
and the carburetors...

965
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:55,443
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

966
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:56,986
That is nonsense.

967
01:03:57,054 --> 01:03:59,784
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

968
01:03:59,857 --> 01:04:04,294
Just Leave this on. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet E.P.A. now.

969
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:05,988
What? No.

970
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:09,829
You give me the number.
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

971
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,834
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

972
01:04:11,902 --> 01:04:14,062
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

973
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,571
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

974
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,370
Forgive me. I've lost
my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

975
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:22,172
- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

976
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,475
It's my book.
That's my pen.

977
01:04:24,547 --> 01:04:26,572
12 minutes to Wapner.

978
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:30,312
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

979
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:33,115
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

980
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:36,022
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

981
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:39,185
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

982
01:04:39,261 --> 01:04:42,162
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

983
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,164
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

984
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:46,166
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

985
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:48,668
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

986
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:50,830
- Fart.
- Did you fart?

987
01:04:50,906 --> 01:04:53,033
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

988
01:04:53,108 --> 01:04:56,042
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

989
01:04:57,379 --> 01:05:00,404
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

990
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,415
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

991
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,417
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

992
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,419
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

993
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,682
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

994
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:11,020
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

995
01:05:11,092 --> 01:05:14,994
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

996
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:17,758
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

997
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:20,801
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

998
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:23,631
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

999
01:05:23,703 --> 01:05:26,264
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1000
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,773
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1001
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,935
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1002
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,673
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1003
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:52,857
Come on. Come on.

1004
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:55,794
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

1005
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:59,169
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

1006
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,335
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

1007
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:07,579
You act weird, we don't get in.
You Listening to me?

1008
01:06:07,648 --> 01:06:09,582
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1009
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,675
As normal as possible, all right?

1010
01:06:11,752 --> 01:06:13,879
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1011
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:16,515
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1012
01:06:16,591 --> 01:06:19,754
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

1013
01:06:19,827 --> 01:06:21,385
Put your hands down.

1014
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:28,668
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1015
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:32,136
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1016
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:35,141
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

1017
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:38,302
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

1018
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:41,404
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1019
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:45,247
television programming
viewed by our entire nation...

1020
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:47,343
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

1021
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,014
in the amount of $286 each month.

1022
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,081
Who's he?

1023
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,856
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

1024
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:02,467
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1025
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:03,866
You'll miss your program.

1026
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,336
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1027
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:08,133
One minute to Wapner.

1028
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:11,540
I had you in there, Ray!

1029
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,771
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1030
01:07:13,845 --> 01:07:16,872
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1031
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,883
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1032
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,317
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1033
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:25,846
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

1034
01:07:25,924 --> 01:07:28,051
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

1035
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,060
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1036
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:33,119
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

1037
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:37,732
We Like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1038
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:41,259
...and she sees an identical twin.

1039
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:44,466
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

1040
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:47,009
but they sure look alike to me.

1041
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:50,569
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

1042
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:53,616
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1043
01:07:53,684 --> 01:07:57,552
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1044
01:07:57,621 --> 01:08:00,522
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1045
01:08:00,591 --> 01:08:03,082
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

1046
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,253
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

1047
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:11,830
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1048
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:17,238
We'll be back for the reaction...

1049
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,797
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1050
01:08:57,211 --> 01:09:00,044
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1051
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:02,582
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

1052
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,912
Twenty dollars, sir.

1053
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:09,546
Thank you.

1054
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:51,059
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a Long time.

1055
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:54,064
- Definitely gonna be a Long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1056
01:09:54,132 --> 01:09:57,101
You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1057
01:09:57,169 --> 01:10:00,161
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1058
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:03,104
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

1059
01:10:03,174 --> 01:10:05,108
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

1060
01:10:05,176 --> 01:10:07,839
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1061
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:11,177
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

1062
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,216
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1063
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:16,481
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1064
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:19,681
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

1065
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:23,487
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

1066
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,551
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1067
01:10:25,628 --> 01:10:26,891
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1068
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:29,022
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1069
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:31,033
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1070
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,035
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

1071
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:36,163
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

1072
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,638
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1073
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:39,902
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1074
01:10:39,976 --> 01:10:41,238
Whose wife? Yeah.

1075
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:43,472
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1076
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:45,480
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1077
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:48,175
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

1078
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,184
And if you understood that...

1079
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:53,620
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

1080
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,214
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

1081
01:10:56,291 --> 01:11:00,352
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

1082
01:11:00,429 --> 01:11:02,363
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1083
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:04,365
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1084
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:07,833
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

1085
01:11:07,903 --> 01:11:09,836
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:11,872
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

1087
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,907
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

1088
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,840
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

1089
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,311
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1090
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,313
All right, Ray. Come on.

1091
01:11:20,382 --> 01:11:22,645
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

1092
01:11:22,717 --> 01:11:26,949
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

1093
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:30,522
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1094
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,059
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1095
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:36,186
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1096
01:11:36,263 --> 01:11:38,629
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1097
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:40,723
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

1098
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:42,234
Where's my toothpaste?

1099
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:45,566
Raymond.

1100
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:50,801
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

1101
01:11:50,877 --> 01:11:53,344
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1102
01:11:53,412 --> 01:11:55,107
I see it.

1103
01:11:55,181 --> 01:11:56,706
I see it.

1104
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:58,751
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

1105
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:00,252
I see it.

1106
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,810
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

1107
01:12:02,888 --> 01:12:05,152
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1108
01:12:05,224 --> 01:12:08,193
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?

1109
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,626
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1110
01:12:10,696 --> 01:12:12,664
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1111
01:12:12,731 --> 01:12:14,699
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1112
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:16,199
Rinse.

1113
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,940
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

1114
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,977
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1115
01:12:28,346 --> 01:12:30,337
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

1116
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:32,349
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1117
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:38,153
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?

1118
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:40,191
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

1119
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,119
You? You're the rain man?

1120
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:01,403
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

1121
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,878
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

1122
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,542
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1123
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,179
When did you Leave?

1124
01:13:11,255 --> 01:13:13,189
January 21, 1965.

1125
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:16,748
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

1126
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,488
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

1127
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,332
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

1128
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,334
January 5, 1965.

1129
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,461
And you remember that day
that you left?

1130
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:31,597
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

1131
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:35,199
Was I there? Where was l?

1132
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,303
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

1133
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,008
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'

1134
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,317
So, you--

1135
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,785
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

1136
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:53,494
What did you sing?
What was that song?

1137
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:57,630
What did you sing?

1138
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:02,200
She was just seventeen

1139
01:14:02,269 --> 01:14:05,898
You know what I mean

1140
01:14:05,973 --> 01:14:10,137
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

1141
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:17,111
So how could I dance
with another

1142
01:14:19,052 --> 01:14:23,512
When I saw her standing there

1143
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:30,462
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?

1144
01:14:32,932 --> 01:14:36,298
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?

1145
01:14:40,506 --> 01:14:42,770
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

1146
01:14:42,842 --> 01:14:45,708
Scary bad! Scary!

1147
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:52,642
What's scary about it?

1148
01:14:52,718 --> 01:14:54,810
Hot water burn baby!

1149
01:14:54,885 --> 01:14:58,185
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?

1150
01:14:58,256 --> 01:15:00,417
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

1151
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:02,187
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

1152
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,718
- Water-- Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

1153
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:08,061
I'm not burned.
Look at me, please.

1154
01:15:08,133 --> 01:15:10,191
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

1155
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:13,168
Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

1156
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:15,671
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1157
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,674
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1158
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:21,706
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1159
01:15:23,813 --> 01:15:26,247
It's okay.

1160
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:35,320
Time for Wallbrook now.

1161
01:15:35,392 --> 01:15:37,792
That's why they put you away.

1162
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:39,795
They thought you'd hurt me.

1163
01:15:42,432 --> 01:15:44,592
Never hurt baby.

1164
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:47,101
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1165
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:50,071
Never hurt Charlie.

1166
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,074
What? What?

1167
01:15:52,142 --> 01:15:55,508
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1168
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:57,470
What, Ray?

1169
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:02,712
What?

1170
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:09,223
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

1171
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,225
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1172
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:24,130
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1173
01:16:31,312 --> 01:16:34,247
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.

1174
01:16:46,293 --> 01:16:47,555
Come on, Ray.

1175
01:17:35,306 --> 01:17:37,240
Hi, it's me.

1176
01:17:37,308 --> 01:17:39,468
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1177
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:42,170
Listen, l, uh--

1178
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:46,450
I just wanna hear it's not over.

1179
01:17:48,453 --> 01:17:50,478
I'm scared it's over.

1180
01:17:50,555 --> 01:17:53,489
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.

1181
01:17:53,557 --> 01:17:56,958
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

1182
01:17:57,027 --> 01:17:59,962
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.

1183
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:01,964
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

1184
01:18:06,003 --> 01:18:07,937
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

1185
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:39,539
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

1186
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,405
I don't know.

1187
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,569
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...

1188
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:47,411
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?

1189
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,074
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?

1190
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:52,609
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.

1191
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:54,711
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

1192
01:19:54,788 --> 01:19:57,052
Then where will you be
at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1193
01:19:57,123 --> 01:19:59,524
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.

1194
01:19:59,593 --> 01:20:01,754
Why don't you listen to me?

1195
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:03,763
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?

1196
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:05,765
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

1197
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,665
I gotta make
a phone call.

1198
01:20:19,445 --> 01:20:20,935
Lenny, it's me.

1199
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:23,948
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.

1200
01:20:24,016 --> 01:20:25,950
I had to buy some clothes.

1201
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:28,954
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.

1202
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:31,252
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.

1203
01:20:31,324 --> 01:20:33,258
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--

1204
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:36,089
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.

1205
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:38,823
The cars are gone, Charlie.

1206
01:20:38,897 --> 01:20:41,764
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.

1207
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,698
That's 80,000, Charlie.

1208
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:47,538
80,000. I don't have it.

1209
01:20:47,606 --> 01:20:50,631
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.

1210
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:54,042
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

1211
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:55,237
I don't know.

1212
01:21:12,362 --> 01:21:14,957
Son of a bitch!

1213
01:21:15,032 --> 01:21:17,761
Son of a bitch!

1214
01:21:51,966 --> 01:21:55,061
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.

1215
01:21:55,137 --> 01:21:57,071
You wouldn't have to fry.

1216
01:21:57,139 --> 01:21:59,538
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.

1217
01:21:59,607 --> 01:22:02,600
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

1218
01:22:02,678 --> 01:22:06,272
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.

1219
01:22:06,347 --> 01:22:09,646
Definitely Like it
when the top's--

1220
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:12,049
It's all right.
Just take it easy.

1221
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,213
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

1222
01:22:14,288 --> 01:22:16,552
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1223
01:22:16,624 --> 01:22:18,148
Very slippery.

1224
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:32,769
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.

1225
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:35,438
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.

1226
01:22:35,509 --> 01:22:37,943
The throw by Davis... not in time.

1227
01:22:39,446 --> 01:22:41,845
Brenly in safely
at third base...

1228
01:22:41,914 --> 01:22:43,848
on Maldonado's single.

1229
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:47,579
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?

1230
01:22:47,653 --> 01:22:49,644
We'll look at it again.

1231
01:22:49,722 --> 01:22:54,854
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.

1232
01:22:56,495 --> 01:22:57,427
Here's Davis.

1233
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:02,696
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.

1234
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:05,532
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.

1235
01:23:05,604 --> 01:23:08,595
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...

1236
01:23:08,673 --> 01:23:11,700
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.

1237
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:17,107
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.

1238
01:23:49,179 --> 01:23:51,113
Will you give me
a break with this?

1239
01:23:55,219 --> 01:23:56,480
Ray, stop it.

1240
01:24:11,868 --> 01:24:13,199
J-7.

1241
01:24:15,104 --> 01:24:17,038
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.

1242
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:20,504
What's J-7?

1243
01:24:22,712 --> 01:24:24,771
What's J-7? The song?

1244
01:24:34,222 --> 01:24:37,658
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

1245
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:42,261
'18 Wheels and A Dozen Roses.'

1246
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:44,854
- What's the number?
- E-5.

1247
01:24:48,736 --> 01:24:51,204
'Cheating Heart,' Hank Williams.

1248
01:24:51,273 --> 01:24:54,639
'Your Cheating Heart.'
'Course, that's Hank Williams, Jr.

1249
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,642
D-1. D-1.

1250
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:02,215
'Blue Moon of Kentucky,'
Bill Monroe.

1251
01:25:02,283 --> 01:25:04,217
And the Bluegrass Boys. K-5.

1252
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:09,411
How many toothpicks
came out of that box?

1253
01:25:09,489 --> 01:25:10,787
246.

1254
01:25:12,426 --> 01:25:14,394
- Yeah.
- 246.

1255
01:25:15,762 --> 01:25:17,787
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

1256
01:25:23,269 --> 01:25:25,237
- You watching that?
- Yeah.

1257
01:25:29,275 --> 01:25:32,209
- You seeing that, Ray?
- Yeah. Falling on the ground.

1258
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:39,240
Okay. Now what do I have left?

1259
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:41,513
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6...

1260
01:25:41,587 --> 01:25:45,352
two aces, one 10, one 9, one 5.

1261
01:25:45,423 --> 01:25:47,357
One 5.

1262
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:49,393
You are beautiful, man.

1263
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:14,516
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.

1264
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,815
You Listening to me?
This is very important.

1265
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:20,378
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.

1266
01:26:20,457 --> 01:26:22,925
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.

1267
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:25,962
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.

1268
01:26:26,029 --> 01:26:29,294
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.

1269
01:26:29,366 --> 01:26:31,596
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.

1270
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:35,269
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.

1271
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,637
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1272
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:41,973
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

1273
01:26:42,045 --> 01:26:44,672
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.

1274
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:47,614
Yeah. Counting is bad.

1275
01:26:47,683 --> 01:26:49,275
Yes. Counting is bad.

1276
01:26:50,186 --> 01:26:52,119
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.

1277
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:56,419
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.

1278
01:26:56,492 --> 01:26:58,653
I'm an excellent driver.

1279
01:27:30,457 --> 01:27:33,858
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up
the hotel courtesy phone.

1280
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:21,862
- Rain Man?
- Yeah.

1281
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:24,301
- Let's play some cards.
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:36,574
- You want a hit?
- No. You've got 18.

1283
01:29:36,647 --> 01:29:38,739
- Want a hit.
- Sir, you have 18.

1284
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,216
- He doesn't want a hit. Hit me.
- Definitely want a hit.

1285
01:29:41,285 --> 01:29:42,252
Hitting 18.

1286
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:44,582
- He doesn't want a hit.
- Hit me.

1287
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,792
You took my queen. I've got a ten.
I needed that queen.

1288
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:52,123
- I can't take it.
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.

1289
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,530
- I need my own queen.
- There's lots of them.

1290
01:29:57,033 --> 01:29:59,001
- 'There's lots of them'?
- Lots and lots of them.

1291
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:02,037
Hold on here for a second.

1292
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,209
I'm gonna double down.

1293
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,712
Queen. Queen.

1294
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,475
- Queen.
- Yes!

1295
01:30:12,549 --> 01:30:14,982
Yes, sir.
You gotta love this town.

1296
01:30:16,653 --> 01:30:19,018
I'm goin' for it, Nick.

1297
01:30:19,087 --> 01:30:22,079
It certainly looks Like it.

1298
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:41,039
- You wanna bet one chip or two chips?
- Bet two.

1299
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:42,901
Bet two?

1300
01:31:29,722 --> 01:31:31,212
What's your secret, guys?

1301
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:34,623
We cheat.

1302
01:31:34,693 --> 01:31:38,288
This is Sam.
Tape table 47.

1303
01:31:44,969 --> 01:31:47,096
- About 85,000.
- 85,000?

1304
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:49,605
- Yeah.
- Did you call the eye in the sky?

1305
01:31:49,674 --> 01:31:52,837
- Sam did.
- Okay, I'll take over from here.

1306
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,514
Do it again. Do it again.

1307
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:01,512
- Do it again. All right!
- Yes!

1308
01:32:01,586 --> 01:32:04,053
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1309
01:32:09,427 --> 01:32:10,859
What do you see?

1310
01:32:10,928 --> 01:32:14,329
He's not catching the hole card,
and he's not past posting us.

1311
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:18,095
- He's not using a computer.
- No, but something's not right.

1312
01:32:18,168 --> 01:32:20,693
No one can count
into a six-deck shoe.

1313
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:56,165
Hold it here.

1314
01:32:58,473 --> 01:33:01,375
- Watch my chips. I'll be back.
- Go ahead, sir.

1315
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,379
What are you doing?
You don't Leave in the middle of a hand.

1316
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:11,783
We are red hot! The Babbitt brothers,
kickin' ass in Vegas!

1317
01:33:11,853 --> 01:33:14,787
- Wheel of Fortune.
- Cleopatra and Caesar are over there.

1318
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,016
-Come on, Ray.
-Look at all this glamorous merchandise.

1319
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,559
- A little one for bad, two for good.
- Yeah. Twenty.

1320
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:21,561
- Twenty?
- Yeah.

1321
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:24,792
- It's gonna hit on twenty?
- Yeah. Definitely twenty.

1322
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:26,799
$3,000 on 20.

1323
01:33:28,902 --> 01:33:30,665
- Definitely twenty.
- Definitely twenty?

1324
01:33:42,415 --> 01:33:44,076
- It's not your game.
- Yeah.

1325
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,118
- I lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

1326
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:48,653
That's $3,000 I lost.
Come on, Ray.

1327
01:33:48,721 --> 01:33:51,349
Little black-- No? Easy, easy.

1328
01:33:51,424 --> 01:33:53,517
Don't start banging yourself.

1329
01:33:53,593 --> 01:33:56,221
- Maybe we'll play later.
- Yeah.

1330
01:33:56,295 --> 01:33:58,819
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

1331
01:33:58,897 --> 01:34:01,195
- You make me sad, Ray.
- Yeah.

1332
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:03,762
Twenty.

1333
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:08,739
We won $86,000 and some change.

1334
01:34:08,807 --> 01:34:10,741
- Right, Ray?
- 86,500.

1335
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:14,836
$80,000.
Refund on the car payments.

1336
01:34:14,913 --> 01:34:16,174
And I owe--

1337
01:34:16,248 --> 01:34:18,648
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1338
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:22,152
- $3,500, six months to pay.
- $3,500.

1339
01:34:22,219 --> 01:34:25,553
We don't have to pay for a room.
That's comped. I'm free and clear.

1340
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:27,682
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1341
01:34:30,494 --> 01:34:33,657
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back,
the sign says, 'Don't walk.'

1342
01:34:33,731 --> 01:34:35,722
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1343
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:00,248
Are you lookin' for a date?

1344
01:35:00,323 --> 01:35:01,654
I don't know.

1345
01:35:01,725 --> 01:35:03,659
- What's your name?
- Raymond.

1346
01:35:03,727 --> 01:35:05,819
My name is Iris.

1347
01:35:05,894 --> 01:35:07,828
Raymond, you like me?

1348
01:35:07,896 --> 01:35:09,421
I don't know.

1349
01:35:09,499 --> 01:35:11,160
You don't know.

1350
01:35:11,234 --> 01:35:14,931
If you gave me a chance, you would.
Why don't we get to know each other?

1351
01:35:15,004 --> 01:35:18,439
- To get to know each other.
- He doesn't have any money, honey.

1352
01:35:20,175 --> 01:35:22,666
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talkin'.

1353
01:35:22,745 --> 01:35:24,713
Yeah, we're just talking.

1354
01:35:25,948 --> 01:35:29,714
- Let's go upstairs. What are you doin'?
- Getting to know each other.

1355
01:35:29,785 --> 01:35:31,719
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

1356
01:35:31,787 --> 01:35:33,219
That's all right.

1357
01:35:34,622 --> 01:35:37,056
Do you want to stay
and get to know each other?

1358
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,788
Yeah, get to know each other.
Just talking.

1359
01:35:40,595 --> 01:35:43,564
This will be interesting.
I'll be over here.

1360
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,102
- He doesn't seem to Like me. Who is he?
- My brother. I'm living in his room.

1361
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:53,868
- He seems young to be your brother.
- He was born August 12, 1962.

1362
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:55,374
It was a Sunday.

1363
01:35:57,078 --> 01:35:59,239
What exactly do you guys do here?

1364
01:36:00,313 --> 01:36:03,544
- We're counting cards.
- You're counting cards?

1365
01:36:03,617 --> 01:36:05,915
We're counting cards.

1366
01:36:05,986 --> 01:36:08,147
We're counting cards.

1367
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,314
What else do you do?

1368
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,324
We're counting cards.

1369
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:14,553
I know that.
What else do you do?

1370
01:36:14,627 --> 01:36:16,618
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

1371
01:36:16,695 --> 01:36:19,597
Whoa. Look, I'm outta here.

1372
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,166

1373
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:25,169
- What time is the date?

1374
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:27,432
I have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out at 11:00.

1375
01:36:27,507 --> 01:36:31,033
10:00, daylight saving time.

1376
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,907
- 10:00, daylight saving--
- 10:00?

1377
01:36:32,978 --> 01:36:35,503
- 10:00, daylight saving time.
- You Like her? You think she's pretty?

1378
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:37,515
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1379
01:36:37,582 --> 01:36:40,643
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1380
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,890
I've never seen you in a suit.
He did a great job.

1381
01:36:44,957 --> 01:36:47,481
You don't realize how good you look.
Do you Like it?

1382
01:36:47,559 --> 01:36:49,493
It's not Kmart.

1383
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:53,622
How could you not Like that suit?
You look fantastic, Ray?

1384
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:56,963
- It's not a Kmart suit.
- Let me let you in on a secret.

1385
01:36:57,035 --> 01:36:59,435
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1386
01:37:02,806 --> 01:37:04,671
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1387
01:37:04,741 --> 01:37:08,768
It's a high roller's suite.
This is for you.

1388
01:37:08,846 --> 01:37:11,315
- You ever seen a room Like this before?
- Yeah.

1389
01:37:11,382 --> 01:37:12,814
What's up there?

1390
01:37:12,883 --> 01:37:15,283
What's up there?
You're not even looking.

1391
01:37:15,352 --> 01:37:18,219
- Yeah. Bed.
- That's your bed.

1392
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:21,086
I had them put it by the window,
just the way you Like it.

1393
01:37:21,158 --> 01:37:23,854
- Right by the window.
- Go on up.

1394
01:37:23,927 --> 01:37:26,862
- Just the way you Like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1395
01:37:28,332 --> 01:37:30,664
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

1396
01:37:30,734 --> 01:37:33,201
You are Mr. Las Vegas now.

1397
01:37:33,269 --> 01:37:35,237
What do you think?

1398
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:38,536
There's a lot of lights out there.
It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1399
01:37:39,442 --> 01:37:42,843
We made a lot of money today.

1400
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:47,076
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1401
01:37:47,149 --> 01:37:49,140
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

1402
01:37:49,218 --> 01:37:52,516
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.

1403
01:37:52,587 --> 01:37:56,318
I got a little hot, Ray.

1404
01:37:56,391 --> 01:38:00,657
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1405
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:06,967
I'm apologizing. I got
a little carried away. The money.

1406
01:38:07,035 --> 01:38:11,165
I got a little greedy.
Wanna say somethin'?

1407
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,833
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

1408
01:38:13,909 --> 01:38:16,139
I gotta thank you, man.

1409
01:38:18,113 --> 01:38:20,046
You did it.

1410
01:38:20,115 --> 01:38:23,242
I was just there.
You saved my ass.

1411
01:38:23,317 --> 01:38:26,106
I'm just along for the ride.

1412
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:30,200
Be at the bar at 10:00.
Have to go to a date with Iris.

1413
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:32,403
Iris, that's her name.

1414
01:38:32,478 --> 01:38:34,343
Big date. Gonna go dancing.

1415
01:38:34,414 --> 01:38:37,282
I have to go to a date
with Iris at the bar.

1416
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:39,410
- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

1417
01:38:39,486 --> 01:38:41,976
You ought to learn sometime.

1418
01:38:42,055 --> 01:38:44,717
Yeah, have to learn
to dance with a date.

1419
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:48,056
- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

1420
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:50,357
You're not gonna have to
dance on this date.

1421
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,161
I have to go to the date,
learn to dance. Definitely. Now.

1422
01:38:54,234 --> 01:38:56,259
You don't have to dance now...

1423
01:38:56,336 --> 01:38:58,998
but I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

1424
01:38:59,072 --> 01:39:02,599
- You won't have to dance on this.
- Have to learn how to dance now.

1425
01:39:02,675 --> 01:39:06,940
I'm sorry I brought this up.
All right, Ray, my mistake.

1426
01:39:07,012 --> 01:39:09,947
You got the only
famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

1427
01:39:10,015 --> 01:39:11,448
Stand over there.

1428
01:39:19,925 --> 01:39:22,290
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

1429
01:39:23,395 --> 01:39:26,727
You hear the music?
Just watch my feet.

1430
01:39:26,798 --> 01:39:29,266
Raymond, watch my feet.

1431
01:39:29,334 --> 01:39:32,359
Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

1432
01:39:32,436 --> 01:39:36,372
You feel the rhythm of the music?
We're just movin' our feet.

1433
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,773
You're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1434
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:42,369
I'm the date, so you want to--

1435
01:39:44,482 --> 01:39:47,815
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.

1436
01:39:47,885 --> 01:39:51,342
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

1437
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:55,323
Put your left hand up Like this.
Left hand. That's good.

1438
01:39:55,392 --> 01:39:58,623
Don't stop movin'.
Good. Just Like that.

1439
01:39:58,695 --> 01:40:01,129
Take this other hand,
put it behind my back.

1440
01:40:01,197 --> 01:40:04,222
- Ray, you wanna learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

1441
01:40:04,301 --> 01:40:07,600
You gotta touch someone when you dance.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1442
01:40:07,671 --> 01:40:11,004
All right?
Just put it right there.

1443
01:40:11,074 --> 01:40:13,565
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

1444
01:40:13,643 --> 01:40:15,735
Watch my feet, Ray.

1445
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:19,872
The rhythm, the rhythm.
All right?

1446
01:40:19,948 --> 01:40:24,112
You can't watch my feet the whole time,
so you're gonna have to look up.

1447
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:27,849
Now when I tell you to,
I want you to just look up...

1448
01:40:27,923 --> 01:40:30,448
real slow, just keep movin'.

1449
01:40:30,526 --> 01:40:32,460
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1450
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:34,758
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

1451
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:37,093
A little more.
Keep movin'.

1452
01:40:37,165 --> 01:40:39,794
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

1453
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:41,995
A little more, Ray.

1454
01:40:42,071 --> 01:40:44,164
All the way up.

1455
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,108
There you go, Ray.
You're dancin'.

1456
01:40:49,177 --> 01:40:53,477
- Yeah, dancin'.
- You wanna close your hand here.

1457
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:57,211
You wanna put it Like that.
You're gonna turn me Like this.

1458
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:00,914
Just turn me.
That's good.

1459
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:03,456
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

1460
01:41:03,523 --> 01:41:06,960
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

1461
01:41:40,192 --> 01:41:42,854
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1462
01:41:42,928 --> 01:41:44,189
All right!

1463
01:41:44,295 --> 01:41:46,263
You are a good dancer.

1464
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:48,892
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

1465
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:04,106
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

1466
01:42:05,483 --> 01:42:08,849
I just felt Like givin' you a hug.

1467
01:42:24,001 --> 01:42:25,434
What are you doin' here?

1468
01:42:25,502 --> 01:42:28,903
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

1469
01:42:28,972 --> 01:42:32,840
- You don't know about the business?
- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

1470
01:42:35,078 --> 01:42:38,103
I'm glad to see you.

1471
01:42:38,181 --> 01:42:39,773
Ray, look who's here.

1472
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:07,872
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

1473
01:43:07,943 --> 01:43:10,468
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

1474
01:43:10,545 --> 01:43:15,244
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.

1475
01:43:15,317 --> 01:43:17,443
Six minutes to my date.

1476
01:43:17,518 --> 01:43:20,214
Six minutes to Iris.

1477
01:43:20,288 --> 01:43:21,720
He has a date?

1478
01:43:23,324 --> 01:43:27,317
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.

1479
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:29,988
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?

1480
01:43:30,064 --> 01:43:31,998
A man's dancing.

1481
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:35,331
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?

1482
01:43:35,402 --> 01:43:38,166
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.

1483
01:43:40,274 --> 01:43:43,175
- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?

1484
01:43:43,244 --> 01:43:46,440
- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.

1485
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:50,074
He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?

1486
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:52,481
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.

1487
01:43:52,552 --> 01:43:54,986
- Right this way.
- Certainly.

1488
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,193
10:01, she's not here.

1489
01:44:12,271 --> 01:44:14,570
She'll come. She will.

1490
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:27,909
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.

1491
01:44:27,986 --> 01:44:30,852
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1492
01:44:30,922 --> 01:44:34,085
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...

1493
01:44:34,158 --> 01:44:37,526
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1494
01:44:37,596 --> 01:44:41,190
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.

1495
01:44:41,265 --> 01:44:43,733
Someone has a good day
at the tables...

1496
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:46,395
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

1497
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:48,665
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1498
01:44:48,739 --> 01:44:51,003
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

1499
01:44:51,075 --> 01:44:55,807
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.

1500
01:45:04,955 --> 01:45:07,890
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.

1501
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:12,189
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.

1502
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:14,695
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

1503
01:45:32,448 --> 01:45:35,348
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.

1504
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:39,716
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?

1505
01:45:39,787 --> 01:45:41,652
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1506
01:45:41,723 --> 01:45:44,988
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.

1507
01:45:45,059 --> 01:45:47,459
- Give me this.
- Yeah.

1508
01:45:49,998 --> 01:45:52,558
- Yeah.
- Show me how.

1509
01:45:52,634 --> 01:45:54,727
Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1510
01:45:54,802 --> 01:45:57,236
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

1511
01:45:58,071 --> 01:46:01,132
Dancing in the elevator.

1512
01:46:01,209 --> 01:46:02,972
It's nice.

1513
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,013
You're very good.

1514
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,291
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.

1515
01:46:25,531 --> 01:46:28,296
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.

1516
01:46:28,368 --> 01:46:31,461
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.

1517
01:46:32,705 --> 01:46:34,969
You don't know?

1518
01:46:36,309 --> 01:46:39,277
Open your mouth. Open.

1519
01:46:39,345 --> 01:46:41,745
- Yeah.
- Like this.

1520
01:46:41,814 --> 01:46:45,580
Like you were tasting
something very good...

1521
01:46:45,651 --> 01:46:48,118
and very soft.

1522
01:46:51,257 --> 01:46:54,419
Like this.
Close your eyes.

1523
01:47:01,232 --> 01:47:03,666
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

1524
01:47:11,943 --> 01:47:14,434
- How was that?
- Wet.

1525
01:47:16,281 --> 01:47:19,249
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.

1526
01:47:19,316 --> 01:47:20,806
No, it's not stuck.

1527
01:47:25,389 --> 01:47:26,515
Here.

1528
01:47:28,592 --> 01:47:31,390
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1529
01:47:32,663 --> 01:47:34,993
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.

1530
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:39,087
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.

1531
01:47:39,164 --> 01:47:42,894
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?

1532
01:47:42,968 --> 01:47:45,401
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.

1533
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,423
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

1534
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:50,497
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

1535
01:48:50,565 --> 01:48:53,227
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

1536
01:48:53,301 --> 01:48:55,701
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.

1537
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:59,604
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.

1538
01:48:59,674 --> 01:49:02,268
I know.

1539
01:49:03,278 --> 01:49:04,711
Ciao.

1540
01:49:06,213 --> 01:49:10,149
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.

1541
01:49:10,217 --> 01:49:12,151
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

1542
01:49:12,219 --> 01:49:15,416
- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.

1543
01:49:15,489 --> 01:49:17,855
- Between us?
- Us.

1544
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:23,191
Us, Ray?

1545
01:49:28,568 --> 01:49:31,538
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

1546
01:49:31,605 --> 01:49:34,232
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.

1547
01:49:34,307 --> 01:49:38,437
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.

1548
01:49:38,511 --> 01:49:42,538
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

1549
01:49:42,615 --> 01:49:45,550
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.

1550
01:49:45,618 --> 01:49:48,280
Picked up a video for you.

1551
01:49:48,354 --> 01:49:51,481
Don't start with that, Ray.

1552
01:49:51,556 --> 01:49:55,220
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.

1553
01:49:55,293 --> 01:49:57,955
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.

1554
01:49:58,029 --> 01:50:00,521
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.

1555
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:04,091
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?

1556
01:50:07,706 --> 01:50:10,140
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?

1557
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:12,301
Yes.

1558
01:50:12,377 --> 01:50:14,311
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

1559
01:50:14,379 --> 01:50:16,312
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1560
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:18,974
- Whose wife?
- Yes.

1561
01:50:19,049 --> 01:50:20,983
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

1562
01:50:21,051 --> 01:50:22,746
Absolutely.

1563
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:25,220
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

1564
01:50:25,289 --> 01:50:27,484
No, What is on second base.

1565
01:50:27,558 --> 01:50:31,153
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

1566
01:50:33,163 --> 01:50:36,394
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

1567
01:50:36,467 --> 01:50:38,628
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.

1568
01:50:38,702 --> 01:50:41,636
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

1569
01:50:43,172 --> 01:50:46,870
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.

1570
01:50:46,943 --> 01:50:48,468
Yeah, what is it?

1571
01:50:48,545 --> 01:50:51,809
I thought I got the machine.

1572
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:55,612
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.

1573
01:50:55,685 --> 01:50:57,710
Yes, sir, I know that.

1574
01:50:57,787 --> 01:51:00,119
I thought we should
get together and talk.

1575
01:51:00,189 --> 01:51:04,147
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.

1576
01:51:04,226 --> 01:51:05,489
When?

1577
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:08,723
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?

1578
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:35,077
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.

1579
01:51:35,156 --> 01:51:38,648
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.

1580
01:51:38,726 --> 01:51:41,524
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.

1581
01:51:41,595 --> 01:51:44,495
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

1582
01:51:44,564 --> 01:51:47,432
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

1583
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:50,560
No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.

1584
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:53,402
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

1585
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:56,135
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.

1586
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:59,076
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.

1587
01:51:59,145 --> 01:52:02,444
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.

1588
01:52:02,515 --> 01:52:06,713
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.

1589
01:52:06,786 --> 01:52:09,583
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.

1590
01:52:09,655 --> 01:52:12,921
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...

1591
01:52:12,992 --> 01:52:15,323
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

1592
01:52:15,394 --> 01:52:17,259
What is this?

1593
01:52:17,329 --> 01:52:18,921
It's a very big check.

1594
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:24,195
$250,000.

1595
01:52:24,269 --> 01:52:27,670
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.

1596
01:52:28,941 --> 01:52:31,375
This isn't about you and me.

1597
01:52:31,443 --> 01:52:33,604
It's not about winning or losing.

1598
01:52:35,948 --> 01:52:39,782
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

1599
01:52:39,851 --> 01:52:41,910
You didn't have an answer.

1600
01:52:42,987 --> 01:52:45,114
I don't know.

1601
01:52:46,524 --> 01:52:48,788
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...

1602
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:51,226
my father cut me out of his will.

1603
01:52:52,797 --> 01:52:56,460
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.

1604
01:52:56,534 --> 01:52:59,093
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

1605
01:52:59,169 --> 01:53:03,003
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.

1606
01:53:03,073 --> 01:53:05,667
But it's not about
the money anymore.

1607
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:09,936
You know,
I just don't understand.

1608
01:53:10,013 --> 01:53:13,039
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

1609
01:53:13,116 --> 01:53:16,779
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?

1610
01:53:20,322 --> 01:53:24,486
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

1611
01:55:09,294 --> 01:55:11,888
Ray! Come on.

1612
01:55:11,963 --> 01:55:14,931
It stopped.
It's all right.

1613
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:23,697
V-E-R-N.

1614
01:55:23,775 --> 01:55:26,039
Vern. Vern.

1615
01:55:26,111 --> 01:55:28,977
My main man, Vern.

1616
01:55:29,046 --> 01:55:31,480
V-E-R-N.

1617
01:55:38,322 --> 01:55:40,586
My main man, Vern.

1618
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,615
V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.

1619
01:55:46,682 --> 01:55:49,275
They got raspberry, blueberry...

1620
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:52,046
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

1621
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:55,419
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

1622
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:57,355
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

1623
01:55:57,425 --> 01:55:59,222
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

1624
01:55:59,294 --> 01:56:02,127
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--

1625
01:56:06,267 --> 01:56:08,860
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1626
01:56:08,936 --> 01:56:11,370
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

1627
01:56:31,091 --> 01:56:33,025
Step back a little bit.

1628
01:56:53,312 --> 01:56:54,744
Hello?

1629
01:56:55,815 --> 01:56:58,578
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

1630
01:57:02,254 --> 01:57:03,688
Hello?

1631
01:57:03,756 --> 01:57:07,555
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...

1632
01:57:07,625 --> 01:57:10,459
just the people
who care about Raymond.

1633
01:57:10,529 --> 01:57:14,397
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

1634
01:57:14,466 --> 01:57:17,026
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?

1635
01:57:17,102 --> 01:57:20,469
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

1636
01:57:20,539 --> 01:57:23,803
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

1637
01:57:23,874 --> 01:57:28,106
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.

1638
01:57:28,179 --> 01:57:31,478
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

1639
01:57:31,549 --> 01:57:33,483
Have I lost already?

1640
01:57:33,551 --> 01:57:36,019
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.

1641
01:57:36,086 --> 01:57:38,280
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.

1642
01:57:38,354 --> 01:57:42,018
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.

1643
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:45,083
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...

1644
01:57:45,161 --> 01:57:48,130
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

1645
01:57:48,198 --> 01:57:50,632
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.

1646
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:54,227
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.

1647
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:56,795
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.

1648
01:57:56,873 --> 01:58:00,400
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

1649
01:58:00,476 --> 01:58:02,740
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

1650
01:58:02,812 --> 01:58:05,541
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

1651
01:58:05,614 --> 01:58:08,812
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

1652
01:58:08,884 --> 01:58:10,875
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

1653
01:58:10,953 --> 01:58:13,046
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1654
01:58:13,121 --> 01:58:17,023
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

1655
01:58:17,092 --> 01:58:19,026
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

1656
01:58:19,094 --> 01:58:22,256
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

1657
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:24,696
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

1658
01:58:24,765 --> 01:58:27,860
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1659
01:58:27,936 --> 01:58:29,926
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

1660
01:58:30,004 --> 01:58:32,837
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.

1661
01:58:32,907 --> 01:58:35,171
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

1662
01:58:35,243 --> 01:58:38,303
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

1663
01:58:38,379 --> 01:58:40,643
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

1664
01:58:40,715 --> 01:58:42,182
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1665
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,980
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

1666
01:58:45,052 --> 01:58:48,112
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

1667
01:58:48,189 --> 01:58:50,282
- You drove?
- Yeah.

1668
01:58:50,358 --> 01:58:53,849
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

1669
01:58:53,927 --> 01:58:57,260
He didn't drive on the highway.

1670
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,992
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

1671
01:59:00,066 --> 01:59:04,331
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

1672
01:59:04,403 --> 01:59:06,895
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

1673
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:10,567
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

1674
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:13,511
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

1675
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,809
- This morning when--
- This morning?

1676
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:19,477
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

1677
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:22,816
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

1678
01:59:22,888 --> 01:59:24,822
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

1679
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:27,222
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

1680
01:59:27,292 --> 01:59:29,887
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

1681
01:59:29,962 --> 01:59:33,328
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

1682
01:59:33,398 --> 01:59:36,232
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

1683
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:38,270
I'm not placing any blame--

1684
01:59:38,337 --> 01:59:41,430
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

1685
01:59:41,506 --> 01:59:45,237
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

1686
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:47,244
No one is saying anything.

1687
01:59:47,312 --> 01:59:50,110
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

1688
01:59:50,181 --> 01:59:52,615
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

1689
01:59:52,684 --> 01:59:55,517
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

1690
01:59:55,586 --> 01:59:59,386
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

1691
01:59:59,457 --> 02:00:04,018
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

1692
02:00:04,094 --> 02:00:07,326
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

1693
02:00:07,398 --> 02:00:10,161
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

1694
02:00:10,233 --> 02:00:12,167
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.

1695
02:00:12,235 --> 02:00:15,864
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

1696
02:00:15,939 --> 02:00:18,806
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

1697
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:20,706
My father died.
I was upset.

1698
02:00:20,777 --> 02:00:22,472
That was wrong.

1699
02:00:22,546 --> 02:00:25,947
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

1700
02:00:26,016 --> 02:00:28,575
and you want to
take care of him.

1701
02:00:28,651 --> 02:00:30,812
Yes.

1702
02:00:30,886 --> 02:00:33,980
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.

1703
02:00:34,056 --> 02:00:36,854
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

1704
02:00:36,926 --> 02:00:40,589
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

1705
02:00:40,663 --> 02:00:41,924
Yes.

1706
02:00:41,997 --> 02:00:44,261
- Look, that--
- Yes?

1707
02:00:44,332 --> 02:00:47,359
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

1708
02:00:47,436 --> 02:00:49,427
When it started out--

1709
02:00:49,505 --> 02:00:52,439
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

1710
02:00:52,507 --> 02:00:55,170
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

1711
02:00:55,244 --> 02:00:58,076
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

1712
02:00:58,146 --> 02:01:00,546
No accusations?

1713
02:01:00,615 --> 02:01:03,641
See, you have to understand...

1714
02:01:03,718 --> 02:01:07,950
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

1715
02:01:08,023 --> 02:01:09,615
in name.

1716
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,052
And then...

1717
02:01:18,199 --> 02:01:20,393
this morning we had pancakes.

1718
02:01:20,467 --> 02:01:22,492
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

1719
02:01:22,569 --> 02:01:25,060
Maple syrup on the table.

1720
02:01:25,139 --> 02:01:27,573
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

1721
02:01:28,742 --> 02:01:30,003
See, we--

1722
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:33,473
I made a connection.

1723
02:01:33,546 --> 02:01:35,946
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

1724
02:01:36,015 --> 02:01:39,416
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

1725
02:01:39,485 --> 02:01:42,283
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

1726
02:01:42,355 --> 02:01:45,950
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

1727
02:01:46,025 --> 02:01:47,390
I'm all for that.

1728
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:50,623
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

1729
02:01:50,696 --> 02:01:52,630
He can't decide for himself.

1730
02:01:52,697 --> 02:01:55,063
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

1731
02:01:55,133 --> 02:01:57,499
Why don't we ask Raymond?

1732
02:01:57,570 --> 02:02:01,369
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

1733
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,170
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1734
02:02:07,145 --> 02:02:09,079
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

1735
02:02:10,782 --> 02:02:14,080
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

1736
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:16,643
The doctor's asking you a question.

1737
02:02:16,721 --> 02:02:18,848
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

1738
02:02:18,924 --> 02:02:22,917
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

1739
02:02:22,994 --> 02:02:26,053
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1740
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:28,189
- You do?
- Yeah.

1741
02:02:28,265 --> 02:02:29,527
You wanna stay with your brother?

1742
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,001
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

1743
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:35,538
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

1744
02:02:36,773 --> 02:02:39,504
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1745
02:02:42,879 --> 02:02:45,576
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

1746
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:48,708
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1747
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:52,744
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

1748
02:02:52,822 --> 02:02:54,255
Yeah.

1749
02:02:55,592 --> 02:02:59,755
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

1750
02:02:59,828 --> 02:03:01,728
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

1751
02:03:01,797 --> 02:03:03,856
They're two separate things.

1752
02:03:03,932 --> 02:03:07,766
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

1753
02:03:07,836 --> 02:03:11,363
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

1754
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:15,399
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

1755
02:03:15,477 --> 02:03:17,911
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

1756
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,379
All right.

1757
02:03:19,448 --> 02:03:21,609
Just hold on here.

1758
02:03:21,683 --> 02:03:23,275
All right.

1759
02:03:23,352 --> 02:03:26,582
All right.
You made your point.

1760
02:03:26,654 --> 02:03:30,784
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

1761
02:03:30,858 --> 02:03:32,985
- It's over.
- Yeah.

1762
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:35,995
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

1763
02:03:36,063 --> 02:03:38,293
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

1764
02:03:39,333 --> 02:03:41,324
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1765
02:03:44,138 --> 02:03:46,129
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

1766
02:03:46,207 --> 02:03:48,003
Excuse me.

1767
02:03:56,101 --> 02:03:58,536
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1768
02:04:00,372 --> 02:04:03,830
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1769
02:04:06,244 --> 02:04:08,178
I don't know.

1770
02:04:13,551 --> 02:04:17,077
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

1771
02:04:20,991 --> 02:04:23,722
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

1772
02:04:23,794 --> 02:04:27,321
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

1773
02:04:28,666 --> 02:04:30,827
- What?
- My main man.

1774
02:04:35,405 --> 02:04:36,839
Listen.

1775
02:04:40,477 --> 02:04:43,741
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

1776
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:49,643
Because you see, these--

1777
02:04:49,719 --> 02:04:53,985
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

1778
02:04:54,891 --> 02:04:57,018
- You know?
- Yeah.

1779
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:02,790
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

1780
02:05:03,866 --> 02:05:05,663
Connecting.

1781
02:05:07,002 --> 02:05:11,371
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

1782
02:05:11,441 --> 02:05:14,341
Yes, you are.

1783
02:05:41,602 --> 02:05:44,229
I Like having you
for my big brother.

1784
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:05,253
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1785
02:06:08,361 --> 02:06:10,988
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

1786
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:13,961
Main man.

1787
02:06:47,165 --> 02:06:49,291
