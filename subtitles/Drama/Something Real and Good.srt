1
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:25,474
[announcer]: Renee Johns, please
come to your party at gate 33.

2
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,504
Renee Johns, please
come to your party at gate 33.

3
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,525
Passengers on flight 435,
service to Chicago,

4
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,457
the flight has been delayed
due to severe weather

5
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:40,424
and is now scheduled
to depart at 11:35pm.

6
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:45,900
Once again, flight 435 service to Chicago
will now depart at 11:35pm.

7
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,718
What?

8
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:08,746
What?

9
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,566
No, really.
What?

10
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,088
I should be the one
saying what.

11
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:18,740
You were watching me.

12
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:19,872
Was I?

13
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,837
Yeah.

14
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:23,971
Hmm.

15
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:44,525
While I was reading my book, I thought if I gave you a sort of a glance and looked amused

16
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,814
you might be impressed.

17
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,851
Impressed?

18
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,915
With a glance?

19
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:57,712
Well, I tried to make it charming
or coy or maybe both.

20
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,444
I'm not really sure
at this point.

21
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,846
What more do you want?

22
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,518
Do you know any tricks?

23
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:08,859
What kind of tricks
are you looking for?

24
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,589
I don't know.

25
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:12,485
Like carney tricks or...

26
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,734
slight of hand, something like that.

27
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,265
Maybe juggling.

28
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,760
Would it really matter
if I knew carney tricks?

29
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:27,006
Glad we had this talk.

30
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,586
Hmm-mm.

31
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,999
Diary?

32
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,207
No.

33
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:03,492
Journal?

34
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:04,654
No.

35
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,278
Then what is it?

36
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,694
You know, stuff.

37
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:10,400
Stuff?

38
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,874
Well, now I know.

39
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,854
What?

40
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:26,469
It's got all your secrets.

41
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,809
Why do you rub the lining
of your jacket?

42
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,084
I noticed you
over in the ticketing line

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,282
rubbing the lining of your jacket.

44
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:24,464
Guess I could ask you why
you feel the need to talk to strangers?

45
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:26,409
It's a human need I suppose.

46
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,380
So that's what you do
when you're pretending to read?

47
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:33,168
Come up with things to say
that might sound profound and...

48
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:35,592
wait for someone to say them to?

49
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:36,701
No.

50
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,310
Sometimes,

51
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:42,142
when I'm not reading,

52
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,550
but pretending to be.

53
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:47,913
All right, listen.

54
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,859
I have a little black notebook
that I write them down in and...

55
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,540
I find strangers to test them out on.

56
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,551
How's that working out
for you?

57
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,733
Usually better.

58
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,688
But see, there was this girl
down there earlier,

59
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:02,110
she just would not get onboard.

60
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,352
It's a tough nut to crack.

61
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,731
Not that I'm into nuts or anything

62
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,429
as I'm extremely allergic to peanuts.

63
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:14,956
You're crazy.

64
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,051
Crazy good or crazy bad?

65
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:21,590
Crazy ba... good.

66
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:23,032
But good?

67
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:24,254
Yes.

68
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,251
The jury's still out.

69
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:27,437
I'll let you know when they
come back with a verdict.

70
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,657
All right.
I can work with that.

71
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,126
You know what else
I can work with?

72
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,118
Coffee.

73
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,279
Coffee?

74
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,521
Yeah, let's get some.

75
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:48,188
Now?

76
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,220
Yes.

77
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,586
With you?

78
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,491
Yes.

79
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,507
No.

80
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,715
All right, listen.

81
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,453
I am desperate for
human contact.

82
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,603
I've spent the last two years
mining for precious metals

83
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:10,095
in the Western hills of Sierra Leone
with my mute companion named Becky.

84
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:16,315
It is a pleasure to meet you

85
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,500
This is where you reciprocate.

86
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:31,165
I usually tell people I'm a drummer
in an all girl punk band.

87
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,295
But I'm not.

88
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,309
I love travel-sized
accouterments and...

89
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,383
I'm a wizard at parallel parking.

90
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,599
Oh, and I'm not jaded.

91
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:44,895
I'm depressed.

92
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:46,714
Super.

93
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:47,829
Strangers no more.

94
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,840
Let's go get some coffee.

95
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,575
It's just the mixture
of me and coffee.

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,214
It's...
I get really, uh...

97
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,970
I have this sense of immediacy that all of the
spaces in my mind have got to be filled,

98
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,765
but all the world is there for me
to consume and envelop.

99
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,259
It's mine to crack open and
spill into my hands,

100
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:10,065
but if I don't do it now
nothing will ever be mine.

101
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,888
What I want, what I need,
all I see, now, now, now.

102
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:28,274
I see I've momentarily
forgotten how to function.

103
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,059
So,

104
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,426
maybe I should go.

105
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,095
What were you saying earlier?

106
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,083
I don't know.

107
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,900
Oh.

108
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:43,884
Something about the
immediate need for Self-fulfillment.

109
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,299
How's it working out for you?

110
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,434
Kind of feels like it's not.

111
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,712
Welcome to your 20's.

112
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,638
How old are you?

113
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,786
27.

114
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:05,819
So what you're saying is when I turn 27,
I can get smug and all knowing?

115
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,283
I don't claim to know
everything.

116
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,970
You act like you do.

117
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,073
It's a common misconception.

118
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,644
How old are you?

119
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,045
23.

120
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,740
You're just a little niblet.

121
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,095
A niblet?

122
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,472
Yeah.

123
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,587
Young.

124
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,214
Like corn?

125
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:28,093
Corn?

126
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,196
Why are you talking about vegetables?

127
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,821
You called me a niblet.

128
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,053
Oh, right.

129
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,210
Corn niblets.

130
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,819
Tell me something.

131
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:09,725
Something?

132
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,801
Yeah.

133
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:11,935
Something real.

134
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,711
Something real.

135
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:25,352
I had this blanket when I was a kid
that had satin all around the edges,

136
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:29,021
and I used to rub the satin
in between my fingers, you know,

137
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,121
just between my fingers all the time.

138
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:36,516
That's why I rub the lining
of my jacket.

139
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,510
It reminds me of the satin.

140
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,066
That wasn't so hard.

141
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,066
I guess.

142
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:52,435
I just don't like the whole revealing myself
process all that much.

143
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,059
Afraid people won't like
what they see?

144
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,278
No.

145
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,016
Afraid they will?

146
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,916
Aha.

147
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,989
That I am afraid,

148
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,608
that you're gonna have to tell me something.

149
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:07,891
Something good.

150
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:10,844
Fair enough.

151
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,473
My first true love
was Gwen Stefani.

152
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:23,570
Gwen Stefani?

153
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,902
Hell yeah.

154
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,815
I'm just a girl.

155
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,469
That song rocked!

156
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,845
You know she was like a little punk,
you know?

157
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,489
And when she would get on stage,
she'd just jump around

158
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:37,632
like she was possessed
by something.

159
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,016
She led me to steal
for the first time.

160
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,928
She made you steal?

161
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,758
I was in the store in the mall,

162
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,101
and there was this little poster of her

163
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,234
on stage completely possessed.

164
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,909
And I had to have it.

165
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,326
I mean I had to take it
for myself.

166
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,606
I mean I had the money for it,
but it wasn't about buying.

167
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,927
She wanted me to take her.

168
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:03,965
So, I did.

169
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,495
I've never stolen
anything before.

170
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:10,987
Not even like a pack of gum?

171
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:12,544
Not even.

172
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,261
How is that even possible?

173
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,329
I don't know.

174
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,606
I was kind of a goody-goody
growing up.

175
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,334
Let's go steal some shit.

176
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,117
No.

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,097
Yeah.

178
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,800
Be part of your life education.

179
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,512
How?

180
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:33,848
It's good to grow.

181
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,604
No.

182
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,087
I can't.

183
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,039
Here, put this in your pants.

184
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,879
No, are you crazy?

185
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,397
What's the problem?

186
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,355
What am I gonna do with
a travelling compass?

187
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,336
Does it matter?
Well, it should be useful

188
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,221
Well, it should be useful,
shouldn't it?

189
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,049
No.

190
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,020
Okay, fine.

191
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,894
It will help you along your path
in these crazy days of life we live.

192
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,433
All right, all right.

193
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,293
Take these tampons if you're
so into practicality.

194
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,789
Hey, why don't you just let me
pick something?

195
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,918
You're getting a little overexcited.

196
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,641
Fine.

197
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,181
Pick something yourself.

198
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:31,389
Thank you.

199
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:35,148
I mean honestly, is this how Gwen's poster
spoke to you, because...

200
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,383
Feeling a little excluded,
aren't you?

201
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:05,813
Maybe.

202
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,366
'cause I could use some help.

203
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,873
You don't mean that.

204
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:14,408
Of course I do.

205
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:16,909
Yeah?

206
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:17,845
Yes.

207
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,790
I need a wingman,

208
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,369
and I think you are
the man for my wing.

209
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,449
Now we're talking.

210
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,202
All right, what's my handle?

211
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,190
What are you?
A trucker?

212
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,916
No, but if we're gonna be covert,
we can't use our real names.

213
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,211
Fine.

214
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:35,762
I'm Cher, you're Dion.

215
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,139
Why can't I be Cher?

216
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,592
'cause you're the sidekick
in this operation.

217
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:41,550
Touche.

218
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:45,663
I need you
to neutralize Elton.

219
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:46,297
Done.

220
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:47,109
Great.

221
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,164
Wait.

222
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,215
Who's Elton?

223
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:52,900
The creeps old lady
over at the register.

224
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,442
Cake.

225
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,224
So, Peggy,

226
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,891
what do you do when you're not working
at Zene's & Things?

227
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,562
You seem like you'd be into...

228
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:14,586
Well that sounds very interesting.
Good day, madam.

229
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,072
Hey, hey.

230
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,342
What did you get?

231
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,047
What the hell is that?

232
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:29,931
It's a koosh ball.

233
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:31,024
A koosh ball?

234
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,061
Yeah.

235
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:35,177
You think that's more useful
than a travelling compass?

236
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,370
Yeah.

237
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,135
It spoke to me.

238
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,015
Time out.
Time out.

239
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:55,625
So, are we tight now?

240
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,583
Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,133
We're an open book.

242
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,070
I tried.

243
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,154
I mean, I'm not all that interesting
really.

244
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,761
I mean what's to know?

245
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:04,170
I don't know.

246
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,067
Stuff.

247
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,702
Well, I don't know you.

248
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:09,725
So, like, telling you stuff
would be weird.

249
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,912
That's weird.
Why?

250
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,921
Why?

251
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:12,748
Just is.

252
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,119
No it's not.

253
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:14,924
You just said it was.

254
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:15,631
I didn't.

255
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,013
Yes you did.

256
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,531
Okay, I did.

257
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,733
You interest me.

258
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:26,212
Okay.

259
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,845
I wanna crack your head open
and see what's inside.

260
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,389
It's filled with candy corn,
psycho.

261
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:33,997
See?

262
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,416
That's interesting.

263
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,575
What?

264
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,419
Sarcasm as a deflection mechanism.

265
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,134
Is that your armchair
psychology?

266
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,283
I prefer pocket philosopher.

267
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,098
Interesting.

268
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,299
Intriguing.

269
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:48,612
Indubitably.

270
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:00,483
Passengers on flight 435
service to Chicago, we'd like

271
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:04,396
we'd like to thank you for your patience this evening
and apologize for the delay.

272
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,184
We will now begin boarding
at gate 35.

273
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,306
What row are you in?

274
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,603
16.

275
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,137
Me too.

276
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:26,751
No way.

277
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:27,824
Wait, what seat are you in?

278
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,366
Um, A.

279
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,017
I'm in B.

280
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:31,994
Get out of town.

281
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:32,998
I am.

282
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,018
Can I slap you?

283
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:43,776
Why?

284
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,579
Because I love the sound.

285
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,931
It's so satisfying.

286
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,650
How hard would you hit me?

287
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,964
Oh, not too hard.

288
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:53,081
Just enough to get a good whap.

289
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,432
Okay.

290
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,225
I guess.

291
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,871
Damn, that sounded great!

292
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:03,741
Treachery.

293
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,820
You just slapped the shit
out of me.

294
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,649
Don't be such a little bitch
about it.

295
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:09,740
It hurt.

296
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:11,179
Take it like a man.

297
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,527
Legit, you're crazy.

298
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,685
I think I like it.

299
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,190
Don't get fresh.

300
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,623
Thank you.

301
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:25,474
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:31,718
On the behalf of captain groom, the entire crew would like
to welcome you onboard flight 435 service to Chicago.

303
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,927
Our flight time will be
four hours and ten minutes

304
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:37,543
we are scheduled to land
at 5:40 local time.

305
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,834
You know what this is?

306
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:48,874
Tell me.

307
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:51,166
This is fate.

308
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:52,734
That's what this is.

309
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,641
We meet,

310
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,836
make this connection,

311
00:18:56,861 --> 00:19:01,244
it can only be attributed to the Gods of
divine connectionednesssion.

312
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:05,176
Steal a koosh,
and then...

313
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:08,377
Well, and then, out of all the
seats on this plane,

314
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:09,431
our seats are exactly...

315
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:10,750
You, dude.

316
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,694
You're in my seat.

317
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,494
Are you sure?

318
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,627
Check it, sucker.

319
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:26,545
Listen, I was hoping
we could switch seats.

320
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,361
Don't cockblock, dude.

321
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,262
Let's go this way.

322
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,556
Cockblock?

323
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,819
What are you, like 10?

324
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,776
Old enough to negotiate.

325
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:46,949
As in bribery?

326
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:48,888
No, extortion.

327
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,838
How much?

328
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,109
A hundo.

329
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:54,864
Ha!

330
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:56,785
Twenty.

331
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:01,093
Done and done.

332
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,432
How'd that go?

333
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,030
We had a little tet-a-tet.

334
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:23,315
I told him you'd shank him
with a plastic spork.

335
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,718
So, you mean he swindled you?

336
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,624
Like a little bitch.

337
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,417
It's a little premature
don't you think?

338
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:54,945
Touche.

339
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,988
Small acts of defiance,
you know?

340
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,503
Right.

341
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,180
So, where are you
connecting to?

342
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,666
I'm going to North Carolina.

343
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,322
Going home or leaving home?

344
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,224
Well, both I guess.

345
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,388
I mean I'm going to my
parent's house,

346
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,483
which used to be my house,

347
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:29,756
but Los Angeles's my home now.

348
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:34,342
So, I guess you could say I'm leaving home and
going home at the same time.

349
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,053
I like that.

350
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,018
Sounds more poetic
than it really is.

351
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,169
Don't do that.

352
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,962
What?

353
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:46,154
Don't not let yourself
be profound.

354
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,283
Well, okay.

355
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,774
I won't not.

356
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:53,456
Good.

357
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,826
Aren't you gonna ask me?

358
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,143
Ask you what?

359
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,880
About my connection.

360
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:41,630
So, I was wondering what's
your connecting flight?

361
00:22:42,397 --> 00:22:43,571
New York.

362
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,234
Why didn't you just fly direct?

363
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,636
It's cheaper this way.

364
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,158
I'd love to be able to
afford to fly direct.

365
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:54,428
It's almost like a novelty,
you know?

366
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:57,034
Flying directly from
one place to another.

367
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,036
I don't know.

368
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,610
I kind of like connecting.

369
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,921
I get a weird joy
from being in airports.

370
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,479
Direct.

371
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:04,988
First class.

372
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,688
It'd be like a dream.

373
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:11,001
Have you ever been
to first class?

374
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:12,965
I got bumped one time.

375
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,807
It was amazing.

376
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,759
I think I was born
for first class.

377
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,798
Everyone thinks they're
born for first class.

378
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:31,580
What were we talking about before I started talking
about first class and then I talked too much?

379
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:32,925
Ur, connecting flights.

380
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,660
Right.
New York.

381
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,518
Leaving home or returning home?

382
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:37,870
Returning.

383
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:39,568
Why were you in LA?

384
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,190
I was visiting a friend.

385
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,012
A lady friend?

386
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,708
A man friend.

387
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,583
You homo.

388
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,264
Don't worry.
I'm accepting.

389
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,240
A hetero man friend.

390
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,914
I'm not one of the gays.

391
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:57,014
Ugh, must you call them
the gays?

392
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,643
No need to get homophobic.

393
00:23:58,668 --> 00:23:59,906
I'm not homophobic.

394
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:00,589
Some of my best...

395
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,941
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

396
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,108
Let me guess.

397
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:06,290
You're gonna tell me that some
of your best friends are gay?

398
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:08,414
That's what racist people say.

399
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,136
Some of my best friends
are black people.

400
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:11,963
Some of my best friends
are gay people.

401
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:16,043
Some of my best friends are
Buddhist midgets with no arms people.

402
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,411
What?

403
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:20,195
Well, I mean it's an easy
claim to make.

404
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,232
I actually don't know
a Buddhist midget,

405
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:23,991
let alone one with no arms,

406
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:27,662
but I can claim to be best friends
with one, now, can't I?

407
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,649
Tangenting again, aren't I?

408
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,190
Yeah.

409
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,155
Where were we?

410
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:38,178
Visiting my man friend.

411
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:39,272
Right.

412
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,766
How was it?

413
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,387
Anti-climatic.

414
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,441
Why so?

415
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,376
Well, we're not friends
like we used to be.

416
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:52,228
It's one of the things you don't really realize
until you're there, you know?

417
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:55,510
It's like on the phone you both can
pretend it's the same,

418
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,108
like you're still friends
in the real sense.

419
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:02,327
But then you get face to face
and...

420
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,072
That's sad.

421
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,262
Such is life.

422
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,004
I suppose.

423
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

424
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:06,696
We have just been informed that the snow has
picked up again in Chicago.

425
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,075
Visibility is too low
for us to land.

426
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,068
So, we've been rerouted to Denver where we
will be grounded until tomorrow morning.

427
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:19,070
Airline representatives will be available to assist you on
rebooking your flight and will help you arrange for a hotel.

428
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,581
We greatly apologize for
the inconvenience.

429
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:25,749
We'll be landing at 2:30am
local Denver time.

430
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,208
Snow?

431
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,172
Snow.

432
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,688
Denver?

433
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,549
Denver.

434
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:20,392
Hey.

435
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:22,214
Hey.

436
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,537
Hey.

437
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,170
Hey what?

438
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:27,947
Hey, listen.

439
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:28,844
Hey, listen to what?

440
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:30,184
Hey, listen.

441
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,869
Please, tell me what's in that
black notebook.

442
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:34,676
I don't want to.

443
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,610
You have to.

444
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,393
Why?

445
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,549
Because I asked politely.

446
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:40,501
I suppose you did.

447
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,898
Yes, I did.

448
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:46,398
Thanks.

449
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,757
Well, I guess I fancy myself
a writer.

450
00:27:54,494 --> 00:27:55,700
You guess?

451
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:59,338
No, I fancy myself a writer.

452
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:00,499
You fancy?

453
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:02,716
Ugh, leave me alone.

454
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:09,344
Well, I'm just trying to figure out if you're guessing about
how you fancy yourself a guess or if you're a writer?

455
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,335
I'd like to be a writer.

456
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,691
Do you write?

457
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:13,656
Well, yeah.

458
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:15,211
So, you're a writer.

459
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,154
I guess.

460
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:18,577
Why?

461
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:22,043
I guess I just feel self-conscious
talking about it.

462
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,921
You know what I want?

463
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:25,966
What?

464
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,712
I wanna feel awake.

465
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:29,909
Have a coffee.

466
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,028
I mean metaphorically.

467
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:35,753
Maybe an espresso would be best.

468
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,876
Perhaps a cappuccino?

469
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,379
No?

470
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,117
Maybe a cafe au lait?

471
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,163
Are you belittling me?

472
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:44,937
No.

473
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:46,854
Just tryna call you out
on your bullshit.

474
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:47,814
Thanks.

475
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,807
That and help you espress yourself.

476
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,962
Say what?

477
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:56,102
Espress yourself.

478
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,763
I'm sorry.
Again, please.

479
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:01,364
Espresso self.

480
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:44,897
816,

481
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,632
817,

482
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,800
 818.

483
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,355
So, what are you gonna do
now?

484
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,211
Like right now?

485
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,234
Yeah.
Now, now.

486
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:04,179
Well, I'm gonna brush my teeth,

487
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,726
maybe contemplate life,

488
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:07,596
You know, the usual.

489
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,610
Well, all right.

490
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,654
Good luck with that.

491
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,506
Probably just gonna ponder
the cosmos.

492
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:23,900
Well, okay.

493
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,033
That's that...

494
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:36,206
What time is your flight
tomorrow?

495
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,386
7:30.

496
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,024
Mine's at 8.

497
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,655
What shuttle are you
gonna take?

498
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,514
Probably the one at 6.

499
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,756
I probably will too.

500
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,908
So, I'll see you in the
morning.

501
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:52,314
I guess you will.

502
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:56,657
Well, I guess this is
good night.

503
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,270
I guess it is.

504
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:01,555
Good night.

505
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:25,766
Hello.

506
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,810
Hello.

507
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,410
God?

508
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,201
Yes, my child.

509
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:32,319
Oh, hey.

510
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,296
What are you doing?

511
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,366
Contemplating life.

512
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,012
Did you brush your teeth?

513
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:39,933
I did.

514
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:41,884
Was it marvelous?

515
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,035
It was.

516
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:48,218
You wanna come over
and watch some TV?

517
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:52,016
In heaven?

518
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:55,044
Otherwise known as room 825.

519
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,542
I'll be there shortly.

520
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,658
Well, I look forward
to your arrival.

521
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:00,783
Why thank you.

522
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,450
You're quite welcome.

523
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,477
You like that movie?

524
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:17,794
Sure, it's sweet.

525
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,248
It's movies like that that fuck real life
and real love.

526
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:22,655
How?

527
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:28,418
They perpetuate these insane ideas
about love and the idea of it.

528
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,083
What do you mean?

529
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:31,871
Well...

530
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,439
it's like we'll never be satisfied
with real life love

531
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:39,821
because movies have led us to believe that
love is lived out in a never-ending montage.

532
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:45,334
They make it into this magical thing it's
just gonna somehow solve all your problems.

533
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,873
Maybe it is.

534
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:47,926
Maybe it does.

535
00:35:47,951 --> 00:35:49,362
But does it really exist?

536
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:50,734
In real life?

537
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:52,393
I'm not so sure it does.

538
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:55,816
I mean maybe it does,
but my parents never really had it,

539
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:58,692
so maybe it's just that
I haven't had a glimpse of it.

540
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:00,034
Or maybe that's not the point.

541
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,138
Maybe the point is,

542
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:06,572
is that life and love will never be as easy,
or glamorous or exciting as it is in the movie.

543
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:15,293
That was quite a little rant
you just went on there.

544
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:17,462
Yeah, I guess it was.

545
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:20,243
Are you feeling
any better now?

546
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:24,593
I mean, do rants really ever
make you feel any better?

547
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:26,814
It's not their purpose really.

548
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:32,353
Are you a divorce baby?

549
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:33,954
A what?

550
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,915
You know,
child of a broken home.

551
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,661
I'm not. Actually,
my parents are still married.

552
00:36:39,686 --> 00:36:42,009
My anger just comes naturally.

553
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,680
Fair enough.

554
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,293
Are yours?

555
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:46,399
Divorced?

556
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,420
They are.

557
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:50,333
Yeah?

558
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:51,434
Yeah.

559
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:55,173
Guess you could chalk it up
to having too much passion.

560
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:56,685
So, they had it?

561
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,958
They did.

562
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,695
Didn't do them a lot of good
though.

563
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,983
Kind of cracked
under the pressure of it.

564
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,871
But I mean at least
you've seen it.

565
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:06,526
I mean my parents just bickered
and were in this marriage

566
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:08,862
where I never really felt
like they were in love.

567
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:11,974
They just sort of kept it going I guess
for my brother and me,

568
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,731
which was very noble of them,

569
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:15,519
But I don't know.

570
00:37:15,544 --> 00:37:18,858
Sometimes I think they ruined
marriage for me.

571
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:21,781
That's a grand statement.

572
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:23,398
I know.

573
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:27,852
Sometimes I'm scared to say it out loud
because I'm afraid my parents will hear me

574
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:29,786
somewhere across the Miles.

575
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,288
And I don't wanna hurt them like that.

576
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:38,652
But at the same time I just
don't think marriage works for anyone.

577
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:43,103
Well, maybe it does,
but it's just not for you.

578
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:46,151
So, you're saying you think
marriage can work?

579
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,287
No.

580
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:50,068
I'm saying maybe it's just
not for you.

581
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:52,402
Maybe you're right.

582
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:55,381
I mean who am I to say
something as broad as that.

583
00:37:55,406 --> 00:38:01,083
It just seems like our generation's parents
are either divorced or unhappy or both.

584
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:02,744
I mean, look at you.

585
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,335
Your parents are divorced.

586
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,276
Doesn't that fuck you up?

587
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:13,707
Well, them being divorced hasn't fucked me up
quite as much as the actual divorce did.

588
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:15,141
Well, how so?

589
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:18,697
Well, I mean we were little
my brother and I.

590
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:20,963
I was six and he was eight.

591
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,464
So, I don't know how much this
is actually coming from my own memory

592
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:26,817
or from what I was told
later what happened,

593
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:28,477
but...

594
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:31,296
my brother and I were
assets to my dad.

595
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,524
Another thing he could fight
my mom for.

596
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:37,141
Just to hurt her.

597
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:40,080
Just to win, you know?

598
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,312
And did he?

599
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:45,942
Win I mean?

600
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:52,485
It's nothing you haven't heard from any other tale
of divorce woe.

601
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,758
All our stories are the same.

602
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,232
Half our generation's
fucked up from divorce.

603
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:01,673
Or lack of.

604
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:14,380
And I was just sort of nodding like it was
all so completely understandable.

605
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:15,194
Wasn't it?

606
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,887
Well, she was all,
"my heart is broken."

607
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:21,591
And it really fucking
bothered me.

608
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:22,599
Why?

609
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,876
The way people talk about
a broken heart is ridiculous,

610
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:30,697
like it's a tangible object, something you could
hold or sit on a shelf,

611
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:35,065
could bring your friends over and say,
"look at here what I got on my knickknack shelf.

612
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,047
It's the two pieces
of my broken heart.

613
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,253
Would you like to hold them?"

614
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,276
It just makes it all seem like
bullshit.

615
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:46,204
Have you ever been in love?

616
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:48,773
No.

617
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:51,893
So, you've never had your
heart broken?

618
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:53,243
Well, no.

619
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:55,799
Hmm.

620
00:39:55,824 --> 00:39:56,924
What?

621
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,698
Just awfully critical of something
you know nothing about.

622
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:02,601
Oh, please.

623
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,695
I reserve the right
to be cynical.

624
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,839
How is that possible anyway?

625
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,686
That you've never been in love?

626
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:10,796
I don't know.

627
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,875
I'm just better at being alone.

628
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:17,754
Actually, not better
because I've never been bad at together,

629
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:21,596
because I've never actually been
that together with a person.

630
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:23,706
You never know.

631
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:24,960
You might like it.

632
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:26,664
Do you like it?

633
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:27,749
I do.

634
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,623
Do tell why.

635
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:33,247
Well, it's hard to talk about love
without sounding trite.

636
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:35,110
Well, do it anyway.

637
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:40,255
Talking about love is like trying to put words
to something you can't define.

638
00:40:41,194 --> 00:40:42,134
You're right.

639
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,928
That was pretty trite.

640
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:48,932
I mean, here I am, young and naive
in the ways of love

641
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:51,604
and you have nothing
to throw at me but cliche.

642
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:00,423
Now you're going to die.

643
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,485
I think maybe we've been
in this room too long.

644
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,440
Maybe.

645
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,669
We should leave this place.

646
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:24,521
We could.

647
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:25,892
We will find sustenance.

648
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,778
We will?

649
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:28,547
Yes, we will.

650
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:47,764
Hi, there.

651
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:49,720
How may I burger you?

652
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:51,003
Pardon?

653
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,732
How may I burger you?

654
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:55,574
I'm sorry. What?

655
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,339
I didn't write it,
but I'm required to say it.

656
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:00,253
How's that working out for you?

657
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,285
Look, man, let's not torture
the 20-year-old college student

658
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,907
who's flipping burgers to pay
his parents rent money

659
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:09,356
because they refuse to let him live
in their basement for free.

660
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,594
Do you really live in your
parent's basement?

661
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:19,127
Well, then...

662
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,596
I think I'll get the
number one.

663
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,877
I think I'm gonna go
with number four.

664
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,614
No, one.

665
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,761
No, four.

666
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,067
One, no, four.

667
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:31,840
One.

668
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:33,075
No, four.

669
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:33,915
Four.

670
00:43:34,413 --> 00:43:35,378
Four, please.

671
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,836
And can I have some ketchup
with that?

672
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:40,109
Anything else?

673
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:42,748
Uh, no.

674
00:43:42,773 --> 00:43:44,412
I think that's about it.

675
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,406
Thank you.

676
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:07,522
I mean I want to love things.

677
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:08,759
What?

678
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,760
Just because I've never been in love
doesn't mean I don't want to.

679
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:15,434
Just not sure I'll ever get to.

680
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,789
What are you talking about?

681
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:19,535
You've never felt like that?

682
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,654
Like nothing will ever be yours?

683
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,324
You can love something
without it being yours.

684
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,489
No, you can't.

685
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,200
You've been burgered.

686
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:36,300
I'm sorry, what?

687
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,056
Burgered.

688
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,306
Pardon?

689
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:10,969
What?

690
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:13,120
You want me to be anorexic?

691
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:16,482
Well, you may wanna actually breathe
while you eat.

692
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:26,806
You might wanna wipe that
ketchup off your chin.

693
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:31,358
Higher.

694
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:33,496
Lower.

695
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,028
Lower again.

696
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:36,180
Higher again.

697
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:38,331
No, let me get it.

698
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,814
I'll never wash this cheek
again.

699
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:04,291
Oh, what a wicked web we weave.

700
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:06,393
What?

701
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:09,859
The web that we weave.

702
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:11,710
It's kind of wicked.

703
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,134
Don't you think?

704
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:17,639
I don't know if I'd use
the word wicked, per se.

705
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,065
Or web for that matter.

706
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,088
But whatever it is, we've
definitely weaved it.

707
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:25,051
I think you're right.

708
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:26,732
We did weave it.

709
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:34,280
Do you know how to weave?

710
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,689
No.

711
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah, me either.

712
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:42,097
Maybe that's why we're so
unhappy.

713
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,175
Because we can't weave?

714
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,552
Yeah.

715
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:50,571
I mean we spend all our time
reminiscing about what we've weaved,

716
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:52,928
but we don't know how to weave.

717
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:55,429
So, we've really weaved nothing.

718
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:58,745
Ipso facto we're reminiscing
about nothing.

719
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:02,890
My God, that's brilliant.

720
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:03,820
Thank you.

721
00:47:03,845 --> 00:47:05,941
Did you just come up with that?

722
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:06,846
I did.

723
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,169
Good for you.

724
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:10,128
Thank you.

725
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,785
Have you ever felt nostalgic for something
without knowing what you're nostalgic for?

726
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:20,764
Like what?

727
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:22,088
I just...

728
00:47:22,113 --> 00:47:23,172
I don't know.

729
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:25,739
Something about interstate exits.

730
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:28,424
Interstate exits?

731
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:29,314
Yeah.

732
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:32,155
My family never really flew
all that often.

733
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,422
We always drove.

734
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:34,463
Always.

735
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:37,158
It was this really
well practiced routine.

736
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:39,839
I'd remember specific exits,

737
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:41,439
know what gas station we
went to,

738
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:44,580
and what fast food restaurant
we stopped at.

739
00:47:45,224 --> 00:47:47,321
And for some reason I miss it.

740
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,504
I mean maybe it's just the neon
going straight to my brain,

741
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:55,522
but I miss this
when I shouldn't really.

742
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,149
It's just some exit
off of some interstate.

743
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:00,977
I could really be anywhere.

744
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,418
There's a small amount
of romance to that.

745
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:08,938
Like the idea that everywhere
seems a little bit familiar.

746
00:48:08,963 --> 00:48:10,560
Kind of like home.

747
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:12,477
Yeah.
I guess.

748
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,595
But it's also kind of depressing that
you can never go anywhere new.

749
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:27,994
There's all these trips in my life that I remember
in mile markers and exit signs.

750
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:30,019
Gas, food, lodging.

751
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:32,582
The options were always
the same.

752
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:35,746
But there was this weird sort
of comfort in knowing that

753
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,489
if you pass an exit with
something you wanted,

754
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:39,623
no worries.

755
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:42,637
Just go a few more exits
and you'll find it again.

756
00:48:43,062 --> 00:48:45,447
Maybe that's what I miss,
you know?

757
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:49,067
Feeling that you can never
miss out on something.

758
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:53,033
Maybe you're just nostalgic
for childhood.

759
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,809
Could be.

760
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,370
Maybe it's just past
your bedtime.

761
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,093
I think it is.

762
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:18,874
Do you ever think
that you think too much?

763
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:24,566
Because I think that
all the time.

764
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,889
but not that thinking
is a bad thing.

765
00:49:28,914 --> 00:49:32,326
It's just the incessant thinking about
what I'm thinking about,

766
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:36,793
and how it makes me think of things
that I don't wanna think about.

767
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:38,343
What are you thinking about?

768
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:40,592
About how I'm thinking.

769
00:49:41,984 --> 00:49:43,621
No, I'm just kidding.

770
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:50,901
I'm thinking about how I can't seem to get through a day without feeling nostalgic about my past

771
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:58,191
or nostalgic for some future I haven't even
lived and probably never will.

772
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:01,622
That makes me sad.

773
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:07,233
Like lives you know you'll never live,
but would like to?

774
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:08,682
Exactly.

775
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:11,871
I feel that too.

776
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:15,807
I always wish there could be
like six of me

777
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:17,663
and we all lived these different lives,

778
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:20,774
but had a collective memory bank
we shared.

779
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,295
Or if you could live one life by day
and another by night.

780
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:30,233
So, you go to bed in one life
and you transport to say Russia

781
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:31,550
and you live your life there.

782
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:35,111
Then you go to bed in Russia
and immediately wake up here.

783
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:36,643
Exactly.

784
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,136
But I mean not Russia.

785
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,865
No, of course not.

786
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,534
I'd look terrible in a babushka.

787
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:44,999
And I hate in vodka.

788
00:50:45,024 --> 00:50:46,168
Ugh.

789
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:52,435
We talk too much.

790
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:55,116
Legit... such assholes.

791
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:59,429
I mean seriously where do we get off
taking up so much oxygen?

792
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:02,273
That's it.

793
00:51:02,298 --> 00:51:03,756
It's cold out here.

794
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,259
Let's go explore some shit.

795
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:13,230
Nice.

796
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:19,726
Where do you suppose
those doors lead?

797
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:21,966
I don't know.

798
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:25,198
Let's find out.
Okay.

799
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:30,263
Let's go in.

800
00:53:30,288 --> 00:53:31,838
Are you sure about this?

801
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:32,883
What are you scared of?

802
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:34,931
What if they catch us
in there?

803
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:38,605
I am seriously questioning
you right now.

804
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:39,387
Why?

805
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,053
I thought you had balls.

806
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:42,279
You wish, homo.

807
00:53:51,516 --> 00:53:52,907
Hey.

808
00:53:52,932 --> 00:53:54,157
Hey.

809
00:53:58,651 --> 00:53:59,932
Hey.

810
00:53:59,957 --> 00:54:01,356
Hey.

811
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,726
Hey.

812
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,749
Hey.

813
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,571
Oh my God.

814
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,793
I'm honored.
I'm so honored.

815
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:31,418
Ah, let me think.
I'd like to thank the academy.

816
00:54:31,443 --> 00:54:32,442
What an honor!

817
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:35,061
I mean, I'm honored.

818
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:37,762
And to my fellow nominees,

819
00:54:37,787 --> 00:54:41,060
you inspire me.

820
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:42,989
And last not but not least,

821
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:46,474
my parents for the acting class
when I was two.

822
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:49,043
You can never start too early.

823
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:51,290
Thank you.
Thank you all.

824
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:53,585
I love the world.

825
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:55,904
Wait, stop the music.

826
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,232
Just stop!

827
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:01,360
I forgot to thank my
best friends.

828
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,932
My agent, my publicist,
and my lawyer.

829
00:55:03,957 --> 00:55:04,977
Thank you.

830
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,311
Thank you so much.

831
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,552
Thank you.

832
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,849
I wish I could be happy
with something simple.

833
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,448
Like a farm with some animals.

834
00:55:23,205 --> 00:55:26,222
Maybe some sheep that I shear,

835
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:29,592
weave my fabric on an
old-fashioned loom,

836
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,465
and be happy doing that.

837
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,044
You'd like to shear sheep?

838
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,906
Not literally.

839
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:38,409
Actually, I'm strangely
frightened by sheep.

840
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:40,948
I just mean something
like that, you know?

841
00:55:40,973 --> 00:55:43,135
Simpler way of life.

842
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:46,405
Yeah, but it'd probably suck.

843
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,903
But maybe I'd be happy.

844
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:53,444
Do you believe that?

845
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:54,366
Yes.

846
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:56,195
No.

847
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,660
Fuck.
I don't know.

848
00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:03,249
It's just that I've decided what to do with myself
because it's what I want,

849
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:08,379
but I can think of nothing worse than
chasing after something you've always wanted,

850
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:12,635
and then realizing it doesn't make you happy
even after you struggled to get it.

851
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,505
Yeah, but how do you know
you're gonna hate it once you get there?

852
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,969
I don't know.

853
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:19,416
Maybe I won't.

854
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:22,635
But it's what I want at 23.

855
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,032
By the time I get there,
I won't be 23 anymore,

856
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:29,630
which makes me think I'm always
gonna want what I want now.

857
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:51,549
Can you tell me something?

858
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:53,493
I'm a little worried.

859
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,088
Why?

860
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:58,659
I'm sensing you're no longer
looking for amusement.

861
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:00,912
Maybe I'm not.

862
00:57:01,911 --> 00:57:03,865
What are you looking for?

863
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:05,856
Enlightenment.

864
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:06,948
Cute.

865
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:08,172
Thanks.

866
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:10,261
You've been saving that one,
haven't you?

867
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:11,402
I have.

868
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,075
For how long?

869
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,563
A couple hours.

870
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:17,352
Now seemed right.

871
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:18,897
So, I threw it out there.

872
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,804
Right.

873
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:27,031
You know what I'm tryna do with my possibly
insignificant life.

874
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:30,641
It's not my fault you caved
so easily.

875
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:35,678
Okay, could you check your self-loathing at the door
for maybe the next I don't know two minutes?

876
00:57:35,941 --> 00:57:36,670
What?

877
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:38,790
Enough with the game
of mystery.

878
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,825
Just fucking tell me.

879
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:42,094
Jeez.

880
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:43,665
I am...

881
00:57:46,703 --> 00:57:48,902
I am...

882
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,672
absolutely nothing.

883
00:57:51,993 --> 00:57:52,752
Come on.

884
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:54,036
Just tell me.

885
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,176
I am a trust fund.

886
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,011
How do you like me now?

887
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:09,767
So, you're rich?

888
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:12,313
You could say that.

889
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:14,171
Like really rich?

890
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:22,279
Well, I can't say I'm
completely okay with it.

891
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:25,341
Probably because I'm somewhat
jealous,

892
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:29,313
but besides that, I mean it can't
be so bad to be rich.

893
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:30,537
Now can it?

894
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:32,993
It's not bad.

895
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:34,132
It's great.

896
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:35,494
It's fucking awesome.

897
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,520
Then why are you so upset
about having money?

898
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:39,048
I mean everybody wants it.

899
00:58:39,073 --> 00:58:40,186
You've got it.

900
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:42,624
Why am I upset?

901
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:47,683
Because I'm a waste
of human flesh.

902
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,871
'cause I'm fucking weak.

903
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:51,986
'cause instead of a spine
I've a birthright.

904
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:53,333
Take your pick.

905
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,635
I'll go with birthright.

906
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,669
That one sounds intriguing.

907
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:00,866
Oh, you're intrigued?

908
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:01,846
Well, yeah.

909
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:06,280
I mean, ooh, secret identity
Kind of intrigued.

910
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,714
It's no secret or anything.

911
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:13,900
I mean this money was made
before there was a me.

912
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:17,306
I thought I hated it.

913
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:19,374
I thought I could hate it.

914
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,505
I really thought I could live
without my parent's money.

915
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:25,695
I had all these great intentions of just
walking away.

916
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:28,989
But I tell myself,
"self, you don't need this.

917
00:59:29,014 --> 00:59:29,922
Let's live.

918
00:59:29,947 --> 00:59:32,222
Let's see if we can just cut
the rope away."

919
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:34,228
Romantic, right?

920
00:59:35,684 --> 00:59:37,721
It's got some romance to it.

921
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:43,555
So, I decided to go on a
spiritualistic journey

922
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,397
where I could actually do something on my own
without my parent's money for once.

923
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,509
I decided to become a real
old-fashioned troubadour.

924
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:53,928
A troubadour?

925
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,394
Fancy.

926
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:56,490
I like it.

927
00:59:57,517 --> 01:00:01,099
Well, I don't know if you could actually
technically refer to it as a troubadour

928
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,470
when you finance it with
trust fundage.

929
01:00:04,703 --> 01:00:05,764
Oh.

930
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,513
Yeah.

931
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:10,056
That's where the weak part
comes in.

932
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:14,354
Apparently, cutting the net takes a stronger knife
than what I was using.

933
01:00:14,379 --> 01:00:18,443
You need like a serrated blade
or a pocketknife even.

934
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:21,964
And you are?

935
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,188
Butter knife.

936
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,326
Really dull butter knife.

937
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:30,877
It's kind of like cutting with a spoon
come to think of it.

938
01:00:30,902 --> 01:00:32,896
Hell, it probably was a spoon.

939
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:36,431
So, there you were.

940
01:00:36,456 --> 01:00:38,458
Troubadour with a spoon.

941
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:45,163
Graduated from college and I moved to
San Francisco because it was kerouacian.

942
01:00:46,504 --> 01:00:48,849
I started using the money
right away.

943
01:00:48,874 --> 01:00:50,550
Just small amounts.

944
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:53,132
Then I used more of it.

945
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:55,995
And then I forgot to forget
about the money.

946
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,186
Well...

947
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:03,121
so, what is that you're
doing in New York?

948
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,984
Eating with a spoon.

949
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:09,168
Oh.

950
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:10,386
Yeah.

951
01:01:11,457 --> 01:01:12,751
Silver one?

952
01:01:13,756 --> 01:01:15,227
I believe it may be.

953
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:17,078
How's it taste?

954
01:01:17,321 --> 01:01:18,191
A little bitter.

955
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,572
Kind of like crow.

956
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:22,789
I heard that's an
acquired taste.

957
01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:24,335
What? Crow?

958
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,380
Yeah, I'm still working
on that one.

959
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:31,420
So, you aren't doing anything?

960
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:33,660
Not really.

961
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:39,054
What do you wanna do?

962
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:42,331
I don't know.

963
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:44,693
Well, there must be something.

964
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,370
I'm kind of at this point
of in between.

965
01:01:50,284 --> 01:01:52,358
It's like I know I can do
anything.

966
01:01:52,383 --> 01:01:54,282
I mean I really believe that.

967
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:57,917
It's just when I think about
actually doing it,

968
01:01:57,942 --> 01:01:59,224
I'm petrified.

969
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:04,167
Guess I'm just kind of in a
holding pattern.

970
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,835
Well, why don't you just,

971
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,280
I don't know, do something?

972
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,649
I mean if I pick something,

973
01:02:26,674 --> 01:02:30,377
I'll have to finally
really define myself.

974
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:33,504
That scares me,

975
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:35,889
'cause there's nothing
I really wanna be.

976
01:02:55,631 --> 01:02:59,398
When I ask you what's the world,

977
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:04,062
you're gonna raise your spoon
and say, "my fucking oyster,"

978
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:07,241
and then I'm gonna ask you,
"and whatcha you looking for?"

979
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:10,181
and you're gonna say,
"my fucking pearl."

980
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:12,765
You ready?

981
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,901
Ready.

982
01:03:20,341 --> 01:03:21,671
What's the world?

983
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:23,895
My fucking oyster.
No, no, no, no, no.

984
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,919
No, no, no, no, no.

985
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:26,939
My fucking oyster!

986
01:03:26,964 --> 01:03:28,518
Come on, get excited about it.

987
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,431
Make it an exclamation.

988
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:31,328
Okay?

989
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:34,065
What's the world?

990
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:37,495
My fucking oyster!

991
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,219
Whatcha looking for?

992
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,587
My fucking pearl!

993
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:41,820
There you fucking go!

994
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,442
I like to brush my teeth
in the shower.

995
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:08,509
Me too.

996
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,184
I like travel sized
accouterments.

997
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:13,182
I know.

998
01:04:13,544 --> 01:04:14,647
You do?

999
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:17,303
Yeah, you told me already
when we first met.

1000
01:04:17,328 --> 01:04:18,879
I tend to repeat stories.

1001
01:04:18,904 --> 01:04:20,671
Occupational hazard.

1002
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:22,430
What occupation is that?

1003
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,217
Being forgetful.

1004
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:25,405
Ah, yes.

1005
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:56,022
I've got something.

1006
01:04:57,209 --> 01:04:58,288
Yeah?

1007
01:04:58,313 --> 01:05:00,029
You know that feeling you get

1008
01:05:00,054 --> 01:05:03,256
when you stretch your arm out the car window

1009
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:06,252
and the wind catches under your fingers

1010
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:10,333
and your hand just seems to float there
with all the air rushing around it?

1011
01:05:12,498 --> 01:05:14,385
That makes me feel free.

1012
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:17,167
I wish I could live up inside
that feeling.

1013
01:05:17,192 --> 01:05:19,874
Just right up inside it.

1014
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:24,050
Takes a lot to impress you.

1015
01:05:24,696 --> 01:05:25,548
What?

1016
01:05:26,787 --> 01:05:28,370
It's probably 'cause
you're jaded.

1017
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:32,086
Just because I'm not easily impressed
doesn't mean I'm jaded.

1018
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,669
You know I think it does actually.

1019
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:36,923
You've got me all wrong.

1020
01:05:36,948 --> 01:05:37,802
You think so?

1021
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:38,873
I do.

1022
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:41,346
Tell me,

1023
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,049
what impresses you?

1024
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,627
I'm impressed...

1025
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,520
by someone who holds my attention.

1026
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:53,492
Ha!

1027
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,788
So, you admit you're easily
distracted.

1028
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:56,733
Shit.

1029
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:58,029
No,

1030
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,099
that's not what I meant.

1031
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,764
I mean,

1032
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,420
someone who can make me laugh

1033
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:04,648
or...

1034
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:08,140
who I don't have to pretend to be
completely interested in.

1035
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:12,103
Or, holy shit.

1036
01:06:12,128 --> 01:06:14,451
I'm completely self-absorbed.

1037
01:06:17,148 --> 01:06:18,194
But we all are, aren't we?

1038
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:18,899
I mean,

1039
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:21,600
don't we all just really care about ourselves?

1040
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,850
Not necessarily.

1041
01:06:23,422 --> 01:06:25,626
I mean there's people 
who go to third world countries

1042
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:28,589
and help poverty stricken children
learn to read,

1043
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:31,434
or help build homes after earthquakes,
shit like that.

1044
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:34,525
I hate when people spew
that altruistic bullshit.

1045
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,540
They don't go there
to build a house,

1046
01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:38,538
they go there so when they 
get back

1047
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:41,676
they can tell everyone about 
how they built a house.

1048
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:44,356
It's like they're better than
everyone else or some shit.

1049
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:46,391
My God you're cynical.

1050
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,878
And you aren't?

1051
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:50,611
Well, I prefer disenchanted.

1052
01:06:51,672 --> 01:06:52,932
Disenchanted?

1053
01:06:52,957 --> 01:06:53,880
Yes.

1054
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:54,989
By what?

1055
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,164
Everything.

1056
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,620
You're mocking me.

1057
01:07:01,261 --> 01:07:02,012
I am,

1058
01:07:02,037 --> 01:07:03,251
but in good fun.

1059
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:04,353
And was it?

1060
01:07:04,908 --> 01:07:05,697
What?

1061
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,775
Fun?

1062
01:07:08,552 --> 01:07:09,552
Well, I thought it would be,

1063
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:12,790
but now I'm sensing it might
not end so well.

1064
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:14,891
It might not.

1065
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:19,046
Look, I was only kidding.

1066
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:20,709
Whatever.

1067
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:21,668
It's fine.

1068
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,198
I guess it's just one of those things 
where you can insult yourself,

1069
01:07:25,223 --> 01:07:28,452
but you never really believe it 
until you hear it from someone else.

1070
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:37,715
I can't seem to stop hiding behind 
sarcasm and irony

1071
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,426
and mock sincerity.

1072
01:07:40,563 --> 01:07:42,391
I hide from real emotions

1073
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:45,184
or I hide from talking about them,

1074
01:07:45,209 --> 01:07:49,524
because I'm afraid of the embarrassment 
or self-loathing it could cause.

1075
01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:54,257
It's as if I'm afraid to take
myself seriously.

1076
01:07:56,398 --> 01:07:59,764
And sometimes I hate myself
for that.

1077
01:08:02,138 --> 01:08:05,897
People are cheesy every day
and they don't care.

1078
01:08:05,922 --> 01:08:09,600
They gush about puppies and
rainbows and they like it.

1079
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:12,236
I mean maybe they don't know
they're being cheesy,

1080
01:08:12,261 --> 01:08:12,859
and...

1081
01:08:12,884 --> 01:08:15,151
they think of it as being deep.

1082
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:19,641
But maybe they do realize it and they do it
anyway because they wanna feel.

1083
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:23,089
And they don't care what
people will think about that.

1084
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:28,600
There are days when I wish
I could just be one of them,

1085
01:08:29,365 --> 01:08:31,591
smiling at a rainbow.

1086
01:08:36,717 --> 01:08:40,484
I've been uncomfortably numb to emotion 
for quite some time now.

1087
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:43,834
Doesn't that make you sick?

1088
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:46,428
Sometimes

1089
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:48,212
when I really think about it.

1090
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:51,228
And how often do you do that?

1091
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:54,627
I think you know.

1092
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:56,266
I do.

1093
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:58,159
Say it anyway.

1094
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:02,825
Constantly.

1095
01:09:06,086 --> 01:09:08,772
All day, every day, my friend.

1096
01:09:15,841 --> 01:09:17,545
What if we start now?

1097
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:20,461
You and me.

1098
01:09:20,486 --> 01:09:23,494
We'll be emotional
and honest all the time.

1099
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:25,642
What are you saying?

1100
01:09:26,135 --> 01:09:30,116
I'm saying maybe we decide to make some sort of
true effort to be cliched,

1101
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:32,800
filled with honesty and emotion.

1102
01:09:32,825 --> 01:09:34,633
And we agree, you and me,

1103
01:09:34,658 --> 01:09:38,179
to smile and to sing and to believe.

1104
01:09:38,204 --> 01:09:41,703
And we ditch our cynicism and 
we're happy all the time.

1105
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:43,846
And we throw away our need to be tragic 
because...

1106
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:47,240
tragedy doesn't go well with
the colors of our new self.

1107
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:50,289
And every morning we smile
because we're alive.

1108
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:53,116
I mean, we're young 
and we're open,

1109
01:09:53,141 --> 01:09:55,600
and there's no one
that's gonna stop us.

1110
01:09:58,376 --> 01:10:00,497
Except maybe ourselves.

1111
01:10:02,554 --> 01:10:03,859
Valid concern.

1112
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,843
I think I hate us.

1113
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,829
Let's kill us off.

1114
01:10:10,854 --> 01:10:12,017
Should we?

1115
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,563
We'll put an end to our
self-inflicted misery.

1116
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:16,728
I like that.

1117
01:10:16,753 --> 01:10:19,358
And in our place we'll live our
new self.

1118
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,376
But how do we get rid of us?

1119
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:28,406
Going to need a chariot.

1120
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:47,879
Get on.

1121
01:10:55,412 --> 01:10:56,406
Ready?

1122
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:47,206
Ginger ale for the lady.

1123
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:49,310
I'd adore a ginger ale.

1124
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:13,136
Why does our thought process
have to be so random?

1125
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,792
What do you mean?

1126
01:12:14,817 --> 01:12:16,844
Well, I'm drinking this
ginger ale,

1127
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:19,454
but you can't just
drink a ginger ale.

1128
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:23,211
Suddenly, I'm thinking about
how this ginger ale affects me.

1129
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,211
Tell me.

1130
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,249
It's nothing really.

1131
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:30,919
Look at the cart.

1132
01:12:31,284 --> 01:12:32,387
We agreed.

1133
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,599
Ginger ale makes me
think of my grandma.

1134
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:42,807
She used to pour a little into
her water.

1135
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:47,271
It was about one quarter ginger ale 
and three quarters Water.

1136
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:49,201
That's how she drank it.

1137
01:12:51,695 --> 01:12:53,726
And then it gets really random.

1138
01:12:57,713 --> 01:12:59,880
Do you believe in reincarnation?

1139
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:03,016
Can't really say that I do.

1140
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:04,934
Yeah, me neither.

1141
01:13:06,205 --> 01:13:08,460
'cept for when I think of
my grandma.

1142
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:10,565
Yeah?

1143
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,439
Yeah.

1144
01:13:14,075 --> 01:13:17,852
I always felt like she knew me
before there was a me to know,

1145
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:18,800
you know?

1146
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,317
Like when I was little,

1147
01:13:22,342 --> 01:13:25,745
I would catch her
looking at me in this way,

1148
01:13:26,495 --> 01:13:28,683
and I would just smile at her,

1149
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:31,712
just happy without thought.

1150
01:13:32,737 --> 01:13:34,504
And maybe I thought it was just love,

1151
01:13:34,529 --> 01:13:35,822
but...

1152
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:39,157
when I remember that look,

1153
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:42,713
she was not looking through me,

1154
01:13:43,161 --> 01:13:45,372
but inside of me,

1155
01:13:45,397 --> 01:13:47,338
to another part of me.

1156
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:52,271
I like to believe she was
thinking of the me I would become.

1157
01:13:53,238 --> 01:13:55,548
Like she knew who that was,

1158
01:13:55,573 --> 01:13:57,764
because she'd seen it before.

1159
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:03,558
She was just waiting for me.

1160
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,566
I guess I just felt like

1161
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:11,407
we knew each other from more than the time 
we've had together.

1162
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:19,334
We were connected without effort
for longer than I can remember.

1163
01:14:21,872 --> 01:14:25,489
So, maybe there really are
these other lives that we live

1164
01:14:25,514 --> 01:14:27,331
and we see people again.

1165
01:14:31,681 --> 01:14:33,703
Or maybe it's just me leaning on mysticism

1166
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:37,719
because I can't stand the idea 
that I might never see her again.

1167
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:42,255
Maybe it's just me being weak.

1168
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:44,236
Oh, don't say that.

1169
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,823
You know,

1170
01:14:50,526 --> 01:14:53,225
I can't remember a single instance

1171
01:14:53,249 --> 01:14:57,870
of her yelling at me 
or getting angry at me ever.

1172
01:14:59,693 --> 01:15:02,081
She would just look at me and
I would...

1173
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:06,475
feel disappointment pouring
from her eyes because...

1174
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:10,412
'cause she knew there was better in me.

1175
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:18,481
And this is me crying.

1176
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:22,900
How is it?

1177
01:15:24,157 --> 01:15:25,292
Well, I mean I'm crying.

1178
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:28,443
I don't really cry
in front of people.

1179
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:35,669
That was a nugget for me.

1180
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:40,767
Can I tell you that was a
nugget of you that I wanna keep?

1181
01:15:41,822 --> 01:15:45,539
You wrap it up, 
save it in a little box.

1182
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:47,723
one that's small enough
to fit in my pocket.

1183
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:49,675
Is that okay with you?

1184
01:15:50,577 --> 01:15:51,694
If you want.

1185
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:53,606
I do.

1186
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:58,702
Made me believe that we should
believe in mysticism.

1187
01:16:02,027 --> 01:16:04,985
Believing mysticism doesn't
have to be a bad thing.

1188
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:06,475
It doesn't.

1189
01:16:07,444 --> 01:16:10,570
I desperately wanna believe
that there's a secret to world,

1190
01:16:10,595 --> 01:16:12,433
just so that I know it exists.

1191
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:16,987
And I will love it without
really knowing what it is I'm loving,

1192
01:16:17,012 --> 01:16:19,734
just so I can breathe it in, 
you know?

1193
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:22,527
Do you know?

1194
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:27,451
I'd like to.

1195
01:16:28,323 --> 01:16:30,132
I think you do,

1196
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:31,552
unconsciously.

1197
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:33,782
Is that possible?

1198
01:16:38,753 --> 01:16:40,167
Who are you?

1199
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,875
No, really.

1200
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:48,170
Who are you?

1201
01:16:52,731 --> 01:16:54,575
I don't know.

1202
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:00,510
I don't either.

1203
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:14,723
We're gonna have to
leave soon.

1204
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:17,404
Yeah, soon.

1205
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,298
I like you.

1206
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:39,533
Yeah?

1207
01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:42,945
Yeah.

1208
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,870
That was really hard
for me to say.

1209
01:17:56,595 --> 01:17:57,939
I like you too.
