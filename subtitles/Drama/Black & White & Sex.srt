1
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:04,260
"My name is Michelle McNally"

2
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:07,855
"The older child of an Anglo Indian
family based in Shimla"

3
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,934
"This story is about me and my teacher"

4
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,636
"A story about two people
left incomplete by god..."

5
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:20,467
"who have fought a battle with fate..."

6
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,871
"and made the impossible, possible"

7
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,244
"The world in my story is different..."

8
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:30,578
"where sound transcends into silence..."

9
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:36,288
"and light into darkness"

10
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:39,557
"This is my world"

11
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:44,066
"Where nothing can be seen nor heard"

12
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,129
"There is only one name for my world..."

13
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,986
"How long can you live in this darkness?"

14
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:08,456
"A few moments... hours... days?"

15
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,955
"For 40 years I've lived
in this darkness..."

16
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:16,928
"for 4 years I've given
my final B.A. Exam..."

17
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,801
"and for twelve years, I've gone
to this church, every Sunday"

18
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,203
"But that Sunday was special"

19
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:28,142
"I felt God would answer my prayers..."

20
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,610
"...my only prayer was..."

21
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,816
"...that my teacher
would come back to me"

22
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:19,563
"My prayers take long to reach God..."

23
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:23,657
"and He takes long in granting them"

24
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,304
"Even that Sunday I didn't
find my teacher"

25
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,531
"That evening Sara and I were
returning home..."

26
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:31,838
"...when suddenly..."

27
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,286
Wait...

28
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,995
Michelle, just wait for me, ok?

29
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:23,423
Oh my God!

30
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:29,789
MICHELLE!! MICHELLE!!

31
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,597
MICHELLE!!
Your prayers have been answered...

32
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,140
it's Debraj... he's there
near the fountain,

33
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:45,941
It's true, I promise, yes promise!
Come! Yes. Yes

34
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,507
"That day my teacher came back to me..."

35
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:16,005
"after 12 years I recognized him..."

36
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:20,374
"but he had forgotten everything..."

37
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:25,722
"even me"

38
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:29,426
"I am writing this story for him..."

39
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,061
"to my teacher - Debraj Sahai"

40
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,357
He doesn't remember anything?

41
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,955
Surely there must be something
we can do.

42
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:07,731
Sara, Mr. Sahai has Alzheimer's disease.

43
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,059
He has forgotten everything.
It's a very scary void.

44
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:14,801
Mr. Sahai has even forgotten his bed.

45
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:19,840
He has forgotten words,
even forgotten how to speak.

46
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,875
No doctor. I refuse to believe this...

47
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,177
he must remember something...

48
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:31,652
otherwise, after all these years,
to find him at our house...

49
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:36,459
and Mr. Sahai can
never forget Michelle.

50
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:40,687
Like a duster wipes the words
of a blackboard...

51
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:45,926
the disease has slowly
wiped out all his memories.

52
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:51,568
A few words or instances
might spark some memory...

53
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,870
but Alzheimer's has no cure.

54
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:56,571
What is Michelle doing?

55
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:01,850
She wants to read to him
her life story, in Braille.

56
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:08,853
Maybe by touching those words
he might remember something...

57
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:12,958
Michelle believes
that this miracle will happen.

58
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,563
Science doesn't believe in miracles.

59
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,106
It is impossible for him
to remember anything...

60
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,605
Impossible is one word that
Mr. Sahai never taught Michelle

61
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,348
And what you call impossible...

62
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,641
she will make possible.

63
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:38,078
"You were written in my destiny..."

64
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,083
"when I was 2 years old"

65
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:48,194
"That night suddenly
all happiness left us..."

66
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,834
"when my life entered a black vaccuum"

67
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,797
Michelle... my beautiful baby.

68
00:07:56,441 --> 00:08:00,104
You're not sick anymore...
now you can play in water.

69
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:07,448
Look who has come! Papa!
What has the doctor told papa?

70
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:11,653
The doctor has said that
Michelle can't see or hear.

71
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:17,818
What did you say?

72
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,694
Our Michelle has gone
blind and deaf.

73
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,746
Look at me! Michelle!

74
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:13,684
"I was like an animal"

75
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,751
"Children loved playing pranks on me."

76
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,385
"So did God."

77
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,657
Mrs. Gomes! Who has tied
these cans on Michelle?

78
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,992
Shh... calm down Michelle,
calm down, baby calm down.

79
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,377
Fire! Fire! Mrs. McNally. Fire!

80
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:50,486
Help Mrs. McNally
Help. Mrs. McNally

81
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:57,925
For eight years... every day
a new accident

82
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,395
Hurting someone with a knife,
or breaking her own head!

83
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,327
She could have burnt
the whole house down.

84
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,469
With Michelle, we can never be happy.

85
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,933
What are you trying to say?

86
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,972
We will send her to an institution.

87
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,367
You mean a mental asylum?

88
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,745
How can you think that?

89
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,009
Cathy, I love her just as much.

90
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,616
But I still want to send her away.

91
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,586
She could cause irreparable damage.

92
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,384
No. I'm sorry. I don't agree.

93
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:31,061
There is no other solution.

94
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:33,822
I have no more patience left.

95
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,490
Sara! Oh my God!

96
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:43,171
Enough of this!
This child will be the death of us.

97
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,500
Paul, leave her!

98
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,668
She will not stay her another moment.
She almost... killed Sara.

99
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,884
Let her go!

100
00:10:55,052 --> 00:11:02,288
It's not her fault.
For God's sake!

101
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:04,624
Try and understand her.

102
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,194
She is suffering.

103
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,870
She is suffocating
in her own darkness.

104
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,533
My baby is suffering

105
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:30,846
There's this school in Dehradun...

106
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:34,548
where children like Michelle
are given special training.

107
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,890
If you let me,
I can write for a teacher...

108
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:39,995
We do not need a teacher...

109
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,925
We need a magician.

110
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:46,961
I don't want to hear anymore
that there is no cure for our Michelle.

111
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,433
One Last time Paul.

112
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,338
Maybe this is the teacher
who is the magician...

113
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,910
who will bring light
into our Michelle's life.

114
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,219
Debraj.

115
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:15,723
Ah, Ms. Nair. Come into the light.

116
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:20,729
What are you doing, Debraj?
You've just had your eyes operated.

117
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,101
And now what are you doing
holding a dying bulb?

118
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:28,707
This bulb is dying, Ms. Nair.
I need to stand by it

119
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:31,014
Am I right?

120
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:36,849
It's... it's dying.

121
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,116
You've been drinking again all day.
Haven't you, Debraj?

122
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,851
No, no...

123
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:51,066
Trying to find a sign for light.
For my deaf and blind children...

124
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,432
whose light has been
taken away from them.

125
00:12:55,506 --> 00:13:04,539
Light... LIGHT!

126
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:09,649
Just spell it, Debraj.
L.I.G.H.T. Light

127
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:13,551
Ah! The difference between
a teacher... and a magician.

128
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:16,386
You make me so angry sometimes Debraj.

129
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,629
Angry... Angry

130
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,654
Stop this bullshit

131
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:25,302
Bullshit Bullshit
Bull. Bull... Bull... shit Bull... shit

132
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:30,998
I do not have time for your talks.
I have some very important news for you.

133
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:36,874
Three guesses... if it's my termination
letter, put it in the third drawer.

134
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,049
If it's my last salary,
then it goes here in my pocket...

135
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,617
and if it's a notice to vacate this room
then throw it in the dustbin.

136
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,687
And. On your way to any of
these Ms Nair... could you please

137
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,950
fetch me my... eye-drops... from that
table over there. Thank you.

138
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,060
You may have three guesses Debraj...

139
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:53,923
but you have only one choice.
This letter.

140
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:58,096
An eight-year girl,
in Shimla, Michelle.

141
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:02,703
She can't see, she can't hear and
her parents don't understand her.

142
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,709
You are their last hope Debraj.

143
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,273
Otherwise they will put her
in the asylum.

144
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:13,345
You are the best teacher I know.
She needs a teacher, you need a job.

145
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:14,440
Look up

146
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,881
What do you see in this eye, Ms. Nair?

147
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,549
A great love for me.

148
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,988
You need to get your eyes checked.

149
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,393
And this one?
- Nothing

150
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,632
Her name is Michelle, isn't it?

151
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,969
I can see everything clearly.

152
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,840
A beautiful morning...

153
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,139
snow covered streets...

154
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,019
and that little girl...

155
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:55,048
a lost soul, directionless.

156
00:14:56,093 --> 00:15:01,895
I will give her wings
made of words, Ms. Nair.

157
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,433
I will teach her how to fly.

158
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:11,700
You couldn't do anything for yourself
and you're out to change others' lives

159
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,272
What happened, do your eyes hurt?

160
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,778
No, not my eyes...

161
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:24,645
my heart hurts...

162
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:38,528
listening to your cruel words...

163
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:47,808
it hurts... it hurts!

164
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:54,749
That after spending thirty years
in this school...

165
00:15:54,952 --> 00:16:02,825
I'm just an unseen unheard entity.

166
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:09,864
When I saw the school
for the last time...

167
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:16,265
my students were waving to me
in the wrong direction.

168
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:23,738
Waving to me in the
wrong direction Ms. Nair.

169
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:32,417
Oh! Lt... it... it... hurts...

170
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,353
it hurts.

171
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,631
"Destiny had put together
two strange soul- mates."

172
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,431
"I was left incomplete by god..."

173
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,370
"and you were
a battle - weary warrior."

174
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,145
"I was waiting in my darkness..."

175
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,775
"and you were bringing
the flickering light."

176
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,693
Right. Where's the girl?

177
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,294
This is all we needed.
An alcoholic teacher.

178
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:31,478
Mmmm... lnteresting.
Playful, bit of a brat.

179
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:37,212
And very pretty...

180
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:01,268
Yes. Yes... someone new...
a new buddy.

181
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:14,783
You like my glasses, don't you?
Well... you can have them...

182
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,926
here... there you go.

183
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:23,858
Happy?

184
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:30,473
Teacher... Tea... cher

185
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:36,277
Mr. Sahai, she understands?

186
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,506
No, she's just imitating me.

187
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:43,275
Good... good girl

188
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,386
What is she doing?

189
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,792
That's her sign for me.
Her mother

190
00:18:54,999 --> 00:19:00,494
Oh, she's strong.
- I'm really sorry, Mr. Sahai

191
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:01,500
It's alright.

192
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:07,104
What's this!!
What is this bell for?

193
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,106
This is her identity

194
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,344
If she is lost.
We find her through its sound.

195
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,578
Take it off!!!!

196
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:22,249
When you think, that
your child is an animal...

197
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:28,263
what do you expect of others?
- It's your job to make her human.

198
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,661
How do you plan to do this?

199
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,197
These Fingers, Mr. McNally.

200
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,135
They're eyes of the blind...

201
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,134
...Voice of the mute...

202
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,799
poetry of the deaf.

203
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,746
Raise it to a sword...

204
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,143
...clench it for strength.

205
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,349
They can feed you and slap you,

206
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,850
They can point you towards God
and sometimes...

207
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:52,816
even the door.

208
00:19:54,992 --> 00:20:00,897
It isn't as easy as you make it seem.
My daughter is like me...

209
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,366
stubborn...
- Insolent.

210
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,598
Not you. Your daughter

211
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,466
Lunch... will be served
shortly, Mr. Sahai.

212
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,070
Thank you. Mrs. McNally,
I'm so hungry.

213
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,176
Thank you Lord, for the bread
on our plate

214
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:27,949
for the air we breathe,
so fresh and pure.

215
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:31,325
For kindness and faith,
we are thankful to Thee.

216
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:36,957
Life's treasures and loved ones,
we hold and cherish.

217
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:48,410
No

218
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,712
Leave her, Mr. Sahai.

219
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,846
No. She has to learn how to behave.

220
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:56,844
Leave her hand Mr. Sahai!

221
00:20:57,054 --> 00:21:00,319
This is the only reason
she hasn't learnt anything.

222
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,887
I will not tolerate this
in front of my guests.

223
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,963
Michelle eats like this.

224
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:12,399
Either she eats from her plate
or stays hungry. Am I understood?

225
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:16,038
Let her eat, you will
get another plate.

226
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,698
I... don't have a problem
with the plate, Mr. McNally.

227
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,537
The plate... is fine.

228
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:23,940
Let her go.
This is no way to teach.

229
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,776
Don't you feel pity
for this handicapped child?

230
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:31,885
Pity? And on this devil?
So she can do as she pleases?

231
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,284
No Mr. McNally,
I have pity on you...

232
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:36,459
and don't you dare
call her handicapped.

233
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,088
That's enough! Do not forget that you
are a paid servant in this house.

234
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,464
A Teacher! Mr. McNally... not a
paid servant... A paid teacher.

235
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:49,571
Leave her, right now.

236
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,138
No! You leave. All of you.

237
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:52,899
Mr. Sahai,
handling Michelle like this...

238
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,238
Mrs. McNally... you had said that
you'd cooperate.

239
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,310
All right. There's no point in
going on like this.

240
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:01,313
Let's give him a chance.
Let him do his job Paul.

241
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:05,147
Leave! Leave!

242
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,438
Martha, I'm really sorry,
for today's lunch

243
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,106
Don't worry Cathy.

244
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:27,435
He's a new teacher, that's why.
Isn't it, Paul?

245
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,606
Martha, I'll drop you home.

246
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,576
Paul, I will speak to Mr. Sahai...

247
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,849
I am very hungry;
I am going to eat...

248
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:47,127
and if you behave
then you can eat too.

249
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,337
Spoon!

250
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:10,748
No. You will not use
your hands to eat your food.

251
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,980
Open it, open it, open,
and open your hands.

252
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,488
Leave, leave it. Leave it.

253
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:20,322
Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit down.

254
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:27,501
You will not touch the food
with your hands.

255
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:29,171
Sit down... sit.

256
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:39,982
Stop it... stop it.
Just stop it, just stop it.

257
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:44,051
Stop it. Just stop it,
just just stop it. STOP IT.

258
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,517
Spoon. Spoon.

259
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:54,162
There is going to be no mother.
Your mother's not here.

260
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:57,265
Just your teacher.
Your teacher... just me

261
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:04,866
Where you going?
Where do you think you are going...

262
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,600
you are not going to go out...
don't...

263
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,380
wait... where do you think
you are running from?

264
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:12,942
You are not going out...

265
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,647
come along... with me... come on.

266
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:20,513
Come here... Sit.

267
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:28,125
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon. Come on.

268
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:32,697
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon, come on,

269
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,131
Open your mouth... Open it...

270
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:39,801
Open your mouth... Open, Open it...
open it. Open it, open it.

271
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:45,738
Yes. Yes. Yes... very good.

272
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:51,252
You little brat...

273
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,359
That should cool you down.

274
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,425
This is no way to teach...

275
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:13,034
We thank you Lord
for the food on this plate...

276
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:21,984
For the air we breathe.
So pure and clear.

277
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,021
For good health and peace.
For beauty and love.

278
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,055
Please don't make
a hasty decision

279
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,125
Paul I know that his way
of teaching is eccentric...

280
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,661
He's rude, he's arrogant,
and he's an alcoholic.

281
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:35,889
He's not fit to be a teacher.

282
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,226
But, you didn't see
what he did today...

283
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:42,064
Michelle actually ate today with...
- What do you want Cathy?

284
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:45,740
Get insulted in my own house?

285
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:50,876
No. - Then he's got to go.

286
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:52,878
I hope you understand.

287
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:02,521
The woods are lovely...
dark and deep

288
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,488
But I have promises to keep...
- Mr. Sahai...

289
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,755
And miles to go before I can
find the damn envelope. Ah, yes!

290
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:11,866
I need to talk to you, Mr. Sahai.
Are you busy?

291
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,732
No. Not at all. I was just writing
to my friend, about Michelle.

292
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:20,905
She has learnt her first lesson
today... etiquette, behavior.

293
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:23,612
That you do not possess.

294
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:30,447
Anyway I'll skip the pleasantries.
I want you to leave this house.

295
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:34,954
I will not leave without
completing my job.

296
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:37,852
I've only just started.
Still a long way to go. You know.

297
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,292
I don't like the way you teach.

298
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:44,296
And I don't like your interference.

299
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:50,768
This is your train ticket... Cheque.
And your termination letter.

300
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:59,712
We don't need you anymore.
You're taking the first train tomorrow.

301
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,543
And Michelle takes the next
to the mental asylum?

302
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,656
Now she's deaf blind and also
mentally retarded.

303
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,223
My daughter... is my responsibility.

304
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:13,760
And mine too, Mr. McNally.
You do understand that this will...

305
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:15,564
destroy her completely.

306
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:22,399
Train will leave exactly at seven.

307
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:28,569
And please... put this back
where it belongs.

308
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,541
Goodnight.

309
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,714
Goodnight!

310
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:41,981
Mr. Sahai must have left by now.

311
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:48,662
We'll talk about Michelle
after I return.

312
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:04,310
What is happening in this house?
Mrs. Gomes!

313
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:09,150
What is going on here?
This is ridiculous.

314
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:13,486
Mrs. Gomes, I don't understand what
is going on in this house today.

315
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,250
Good morning, Mrs. McNally.
And how are you today?

316
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:19,895
Mr Sahai?
We thought you would have left.

317
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,031
Just shifting rooms Mrs. McNally.
I never leave my work incomplete.

318
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,200
What do you want?

319
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:28,768
Same thing you want... that
Michelle becomes independent.

320
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:31,031
And for that, I need time.

321
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:33,505
You know that Paul...

322
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,770
Has gone out for twenty days. And those
twenty days belong to Michelle and me.

323
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,777
Now, don't say No, Mrs. McNally.

324
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:43,578
No!! It's not possible. You won't
take advantage of Paul's absence.

325
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,954
Oh my God!! Oh my God!!
I don't believe this!

326
00:28:51,428 --> 00:28:53,020
This is ridiculous.
I don't believe this!

327
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,221
What have you done?
This is Paul's study...

328
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,865
Now this will be Michelle's study.

329
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,832
Mrs. Gomes!!! Put that back!
- No, Ma'am, he's right!

330
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:04,006
Oh ho! So the servants also
listen to you now!

331
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:06,901
Who are you to take over my house?

332
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:09,801
Michelle's teacher.

333
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,414
Were... were Mr. Sahai,
not anymore.

334
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:18,714
I am your last hope.

335
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:23,518
If I leave today
then after a few days...

336
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:25,691
Michelle will reach the asylum.

337
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:30,525
Mr Sahai... Mr Sahai!

338
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,493
Yes?

339
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:36,595
As long as I live, my daughter
will never enter the asylum.

340
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:38,202
Do you understand?

341
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,777
My mother always...

342
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,541
said the same thing.

343
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,612
That as long as I live...

344
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:54,154
my daughter will never leave me.

345
00:29:56,126 --> 00:30:02,292
But one day, she herself...

346
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,235
dragged her to the asylum.

347
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:25,146
And she got lost behind
the asylum's iron doors.

348
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:34,923
Michelle is deaf and
blind, Mrs McNally!

349
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:37,998
She is not mentally retarded!

350
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:48,208
She need to recognize words...

351
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:53,747
every thing that she touches,
that she eats...

352
00:30:55,785 --> 00:31:01,280
has a name; which has a meaning.
I will teach her to speak...

353
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,956
through signs.

354
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:11,862
Till she is secure in her house,
this can't happen.

355
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:15,094
That's why!

356
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:16,963
Firstly...

357
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:21,140
I will have to change
this part of the house.

358
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,906
Everything should be new for her.

359
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:29,817
No papers, no books...
Only empty walls.

360
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,452
I'll even change
the smell of this room.

361
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:34,350
Secondly, only I will have
a right over Michelle.

362
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:35,956
She will rely only on me!

363
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,286
Third thing, no one including you
will be allowed here.

364
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:41,328
No, no no... don't shake your head!
Look at me... look!

365
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:46,131
It's difficult but it will
have to be done for Michelle.

366
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,399
Fourth thing, all I want is
time and trust.

367
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,934
No salary, no allowances,
nothing and...

368
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:54,605
no alcohol

369
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:58,578
And the fifth thing...

370
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:08,085
so, when do I get
charge of my student?

371
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,893
This evening.

372
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:28,203
You know. Mrs. McNally,
I wish I could sing...

373
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:33,144
but my singing is so... pathetic.

374
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:56,771
Dear Ms. Nair,
I have good news.

375
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:06,840
You will be unhappy to know that
the magician is at work

376
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:12,186
Today is Michelle's first day...

377
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:16,984
Mr. Sahai...
- In school. Ah!

378
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:18,759
Your student.

379
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,921
You kept your promise, Mrs. McNally

380
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:30,734
School has started,
and parents are not allowed.

381
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,929
So you should leave.

382
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,547
I have never left her alone.

383
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:45,376
Please take care of her.
Don't be harsh on her

384
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:46,511
No.

385
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:53,022
She is looking for me.
- Yes. I know.

386
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,895
She's going to come to you now.
Leave, Mrs. McNally.

387
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,964
Please leave. Get back.

388
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,407
No, I can't take this...
- 20 days!

389
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:10,470
You cannot touch her for 20 days.
- But its time for her to eat.

390
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,874
Yes I know Mrs. McNally.
You must leave now.

391
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:14,072
Please. Please. Can I?
- I said leave.

392
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:33,726
NO! No. No more mother.
No more father. Just me.

393
00:34:34,203 --> 00:34:35,898
Me, your friend. Your Friend.

394
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:43,876
Look see see ya ya, your teacher.
Friend. Friend!

395
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:09,596
The magic has begun, Ms. Nair!
The magic!

396
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,870
I will change her life.

397
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:17,243
The magic has begun!
Magic!

398
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:40,634
Wake up, Miss... Michelle McNally.
We all pass through this darkness

399
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,235
Once in which you are living.

400
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,639
So don't remain in the dark.

401
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:55,016
Come into the light!
Light. Light.

402
00:35:55,618 --> 00:36:00,021
Yes! Yes! Yes! Light!

403
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,992
The alphabets for the world start
with A, B, C, D, E but yours...

404
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:11,123
start with B, L, A, C, K...

405
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,697
black, black, black

406
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:22,677
Your alphabets, your world
are different Michelle.

407
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:27,213
You are different, you are, you are,
and you are different...

408
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:31,616
and are proud that you're different.

409
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:50,701
Here. This is cake.
Yes cake,

410
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,572
C. Cake, C.A.K.E.

411
00:36:55,845 --> 00:37:00,805
Cake. C.A.K.E. Cake. Cake.

412
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:06,647
C.A.K.E. Spell it.
Spell it spell... cake

413
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,154
cake on my hands.
Spell it. Spell it.

414
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,659
Don't you dare touch the cake!

415
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:27,069
Mrs. McNally, could you...

416
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,615
Mrs, Mrs McNally,
could you get some light?

417
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:34,612
I'm coming! I'm coming.

418
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,710
Oh God! Is Michelle all right?

419
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,615
Can you get some light? Oh. Oh!

420
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:44,583
Mr. Sahai! Mr. Sahai

421
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,459
Good evening Mrs. McNally
- Do you need any help?

422
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:50,928
Do I look... as though
I need some help?

423
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:55,097
Well, that looked
like a knockout to me.

424
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,304
Knockout, Knockout yes.

425
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:08,614
Eyes are not important
as compared to light.

426
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,919
I have learnt this,
while teaching Michelle.

427
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:15,989
In darkness, even eyes are of no use.

428
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:26,896
The first round was a knock out.
But the next round will be mine.

429
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:31,665
Good luck to you, Mr. Sahai.
Good luck.

430
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:37,803
Come along, yes,
come along... Here!

431
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:42,684
This is water. No, no...
don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

432
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,945
Mr. Sahai... - Yes?

433
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,953
Michelle is scared of water.

434
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:53,093
And I want to take this
fear out of her mind.

435
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:57,693
In five days, she will be swimming.
Round Two has begun.

436
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,834
Hey! Where are you going?
Come here.

437
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:04,096
Where are you going?
Come back...

438
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:08,704
careful, careful.
Careful now. Watch it! Watch it!

439
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:12,704
Watch out!
I told you to be careful.

440
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,513
Calm down. Calm down, calm down.
This is a thorn.

441
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:34,134
Balm, balm.

442
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,463
To soothe the pain.

443
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,180
Your first handshake, Mr. Sahai.

444
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,488
Yes, we're friends now.

445
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:04,330
And... my first flying kiss.

446
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:12,898
She needs to learn that
she is destined to thorns.

447
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:19,480
Those very thorns that adorned
Jesus's crown.

448
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,515
Right Mrs. McNally?

449
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:32,417
Yes!

450
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:51,211
"I was slowly understanding
relationships..."

451
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,779
"between a thorn and pain..."

452
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,551
"between water and thirst..."

453
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:01,120
"but one relationship
was still strange to me..."

454
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:04,392
"of names and meanings."

455
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:05,287
Bird... bird... bird

456
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:18,266
Ball. B.A.L.L.
Ball. Ball... ball...

457
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:38,086
W.A.T.E.R.

458
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:42,760
Water. Water... water

459
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:46,431
SPOON

460
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:55,137
This is... Napkin...

461
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:01,846
No. No. This is not spoon

462
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:09,454
This is... napkin, Napkin...
Say ' Napkin'.

463
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,890
Ah! I am fed up.

464
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,904
No, Mrs. McNally, I will not
allow you to take Michelle yet

465
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:32,076
She hasn't learnt anything yet.
She knows words, but not the meanings.

466
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:35,381
She still calls napkin, spoon.
It's still a long way to go, you know

467
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:38,747
How much longer Mr. Sahai?
Nineteen days have passed

468
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:41,923
The promise was for 20 days,
I still have a few hours

469
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,115
What can happen in a few hours?

470
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:48,387
Knowledge can come in a flash Mrs. McNally.
It's like lighting a candle...

471
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:52,432
Once this candle is lit, the whole
house will be filled with light.

472
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,498
Believe me, this miracle
can happen any time...

473
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:59,003
And Paul can come at any moment.
I'm really very sorry.

474
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,245
I will come to get Michelle tomorrow.
At sunrise

475
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:10,751
And I shall pray there is
no sunrise tomorrow, Mrs McNally

476
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,779
Good night

477
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:31,262
What?

478
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:36,643
You've made a fine young lady
out of my Michelle!

479
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:43,913
Thank you.

480
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:03,567
Thank you.

481
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:30,629
Spoon...

482
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:44,302
Try and understand Michelle,
every word has a meaning.

483
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,476
And without words, you will
never come out of darkness.

484
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:51,117
You will never be able
to see the light!

485
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,981
You will you will never be
able to see the light.

486
00:44:54,023 --> 00:45:03,398
They will put this bell around you
and call you a cow. C.O. W... cow.

487
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,926
You will become an animal Michelle.
Just an animal

488
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:07,693
Michelle...

489
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:12,171
They will put you in an asylum.

490
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,137
And this time
I won't let this happen.

491
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:18,109
You will have to learn Michelle.
Are you listening?

492
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:21,374
You are my last hope.
Michelle, Michelle...

493
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:24,451
Michelle, are you listening?
- You'll have to leave now Mr. Sahai.

494
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:27,213
No, I am not going to
leave Mrs. McNally

495
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,248
I will not give up so easily.

496
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,392
I have kept my promise.
Now it's your turn.

497
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:35,086
But it's not yet over Mrs. McNally.
There are still a few minutes left.

498
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,993
Paul can come at any moment.
Mr. Sahai. I'm helpless

499
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,667
Yes. Mrs. McNally.
But she has to learn.

500
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,859
Mr. Sahai...
- She has to learn...

501
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:47,008
that the hand she is holding has a name.
That you are mother, mother...

502
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,405
M.O.T.H.E. R... mother.

503
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:57,749
And that is FATHER.

504
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:04,586
Paul, I was just...
- Leave, Mr. Sahai.

505
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:33,352
Dear Ms. Nair, you will be
delighted to know...

506
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:38,618
that after having spent 20 days
with little Michelle, I have failed.

507
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:43,893
However, if you're smiling at the
thought of looking into my eyes again...

508
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,124
you are terribly mistaken.

509
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,739
Mrs. Gomes, will you stop her?

510
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:02,646
Let her be Mr. Sahai.
She's very happy today

511
00:47:06,555 --> 00:47:09,251
No! Stop it Michelle.
You little brat.

512
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:12,758
I am not going to allow you
to do this to me.

513
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,997
I might have been asked to leave...

514
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:19,895
but I am not going to leave you
to behave like this.

515
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,340
Stop it Michelle.
Stop it!

516
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:30,103
You won't forget what I've
taught you in 20 days... sit down

517
00:47:30,312 --> 00:47:30,778
Please leave her Mr. Sahai,
let her be.

518
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:32,139
Sit... sit down.

519
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:38,184
You will use this napkin on your
neck and use a spoon... to eat.

520
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:40,685
Mo you are not going to throw...

521
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:05,245
Come on, Come here...

522
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,747
You brat... you want to
throw water at me!

523
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:14,280
Let me teach you what water is!
Come here! What water is, come on!

524
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:20,990
This is water... water... water...

525
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:25,997
Give me your hand... This is woah...
Water... water... Understand?

526
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:26,826
Woah!!

527
00:48:31,306 --> 00:48:31,829
Woah!

528
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:55,816
Water... it's water...

529
00:49:56,058 --> 00:50:01,189
W.A.T.E.R.

530
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:25,011
Mrs. McNally!!!

531
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:38,433
Yes... this is 'Grass'.
G.R.A.S.S. Spell it...

532
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:43,560
Very good... Very good...
Mrs. McNally!!!

533
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:52,146
That's 'FLOWER' flower...
flower... F.L.O.W.E. R... flower.

534
00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:58,384
Mrs. McNally!! Mr. McNally!!
Mr. McNally!! Mr. McNally!!

535
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:03,491
What's wrong Mr. Sahai?
Is Michelle all right?

536
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:07,389
Michelle. Michelle she...
Mrs. McNally. She knows, she knows.

537
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:08,620
She knows the meaning of words.

538
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,856
She actually. Actually
knows the meaning of words.

539
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:13,830
Look. Look!

540
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:21,833
Yes, Michelle...
Mother. Mother...

541
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:40,051
Maa...

542
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:55,006
Mother

543
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:56,769
Maa...

544
00:51:57,579 --> 00:51:58,876
Once more

545
00:52:00,749 --> 00:52:01,477
Ma...

546
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:07,982
Pa... Pa...

547
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:55,231
This is 'Teacher'. "Tea... cher"

548
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:08,179
Tee... Tee

549
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,923
Yes... Yes

550
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:14,354
Yes, he's your Tee

551
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:34,044
Dear Ms. Nair...

552
00:53:40,055 --> 00:53:41,647
You'll be happy to know...

553
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:51,995
that I have... I have...

554
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:22,891
"That day you had won your
first battle over my darkness."

555
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,463
"But today you don't
remember anything."

556
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,903
"Now I will fight
against your darkness."

557
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:35,403
"I'll teach you everything
you taught me"

558
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,062
"Water. The first word
that you taught me..."

559
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:42,075
"and after that..."

560
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:48,982
"you typed every little
detail on my hand..."

561
00:55:49,484 --> 00:55:53,147
"like a maestro playing a symphony"

562
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,019
Cathy!

563
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,687
Martha... Martha!
When did you return from London?

564
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:04,854
Oh! It's so good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

565
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:10,729
Mr. McNally...
- Coming, Mr Sahai. Just a moment

566
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:16,533
I'd like you to meet Mr. Fernandez,
principal of the King Edward University.

567
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:19,235
I want Michelle to study
in their college

568
00:56:19,447 --> 00:56:21,210
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Fernandez.

569
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:22,041
It's a pleasure sir.

570
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,211
I don't believe how time
has passed, Martha

571
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:27,980
Let me prove it to you...
Hello... Come

572
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:36,520
Did you recognize her?
My younger daughter, Sara

573
00:56:37,232 --> 00:56:40,133
Sara, this is aunt Martha,
an old friend of mine

574
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:40,801
Oh! Hello, aunt Martha.
I've heard so...

575
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:43,402
But where is my dear Michelle?
I can't wait to see her

576
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:45,368
Ah Michelle.
Have you seen Michelle?

577
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:51,877
Err! Yes... I think
she's inside, excuse me.

578
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:55,709
Come... we'll go look for her.

579
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,278
Ah! There she is

580
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:26,906
Mr. Sahai. Look at that girl.
She can't hear or see,

581
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:30,100
And still... just look at her,
it's wonderful.

582
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:33,636
That's Michelle McNally...

583
00:58:36,284 --> 00:58:40,186
the girl I was talking about.
- That's impossible Mr. Sahai.

584
00:58:40,388 --> 00:58:44,324
Impossible is a word that I have
never taught her Mr. Fernandez.

585
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:47,087
There are special schools
for such children...

586
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:49,927
where they are taught many things.

587
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:55,534
To make baskets, weave carpets...

588
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:01,866
Have you heard of a girl like Michelle
getting admission in a normal college?

589
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:05,102
No, but I would love to.

590
00:59:05,313 --> 00:59:07,645
How will she understand the lectures?

591
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:12,946
I will sit with her in the classroom.
She will learn everything through signs

592
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:15,382
Every word, every letter.

593
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:23,494
Michelle... meet your Principal

594
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:35,102
Yes yes... I've told him... you
want admission in arts, not science

595
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,174
Mr. Sahai I will have to consult
the trustees on this.

596
00:59:40,381 --> 00:59:45,478
You get few chances for good deeds.

597
00:59:46,054 --> 00:59:49,046
And I hope that you will
not lose this opportunity.

598
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,719
Cheers?

599
00:59:55,396 --> 01:00:01,028
Mr. Sahai, you know this university
is for normal students.

600
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:04,197
But because of your faith
in Michelle...

601
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,339
and because we believe
you are a good teacher...

602
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:09,738
We will interview Michelle.
- Thank you.

603
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:12,377
But today, you cannot
interpret for Michelle.

604
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,911
We have called a special teacher,
who doesn't know either of you.

605
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,345
She will interpret.

606
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:22,250
They will interview you.
Another interpreter, not me, ok?

607
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:30,864
Ah, there she is.

608
01:00:35,036 --> 01:00:35,593
Mrs Nair?

609
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:38,705
Welcome Ms. Nair, meet Mr. Sahai.

610
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,702
Hello, Ms. Nair.
- Hello.

611
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,034
Light

612
01:00:52,153 --> 01:00:55,213
Are you ready for the interview?

613
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:58,616
We're ready, Sir.

614
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,155
Why does she want to study?

615
01:01:04,632 --> 01:01:06,964
Why do you want to study?

616
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,900
I want to study... and learn...

617
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:18,275
so that I may live with dignity,
with independence... and to be alive.

618
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:20,740
How many oceans are
there in the world?

619
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:24,008
How many oceans are
there in the world?

620
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:32,424
For me every drop of water is an ocean

621
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:37,087
She is not answering my question.
How many oceans are there in the world?

622
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:40,756
They want a straight answer
to their question

623
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:51,601
If we are in India,
on which side will America be?

624
01:01:51,812 --> 01:01:54,212
If you are in India,
which side is America?

625
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:20,970
The world is round.
So America can be on any side.

626
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:27,646
What does knowledge mean to her?
- What does knowledge mean to you?

627
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:33,078
Knowledge... is everything

628
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:41,894
Knowledge is spirit, wisdom,
courage, light, sound.

629
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:46,727
Knowledge is my Bible, God...

630
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,328
Tee!

631
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:55,434
...knowledge is my teacher
- Bravo! Excellent.

632
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:02,682
Congratulations, Mr. Sahai.

633
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:06,684
Your student is now a
part of our university.

634
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:15,521
Thank you... Thank you

635
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:25,368
I answered every question they asked.

636
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:31,639
Michelle looks so happy today Paul.
Can't stop talking about the interview

637
01:03:32,913 --> 01:03:35,040
She hasn't stopped smiling all day.

638
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:39,652
Why not? A girl who couldn't
sit at the dining table...

639
01:03:40,488 --> 01:03:45,551
has a seat in the university today.
Unbelievable.

640
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,723
Can you imagine? Can you imagine the day
when we see Michelle as a graduate?

641
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:57,065
Ah, it's going to be such a
special day, isn't it Sara?

642
01:03:58,606 --> 01:03:59,732
Yes, of course, mama.

643
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:03,409
Whatever Michelle does is always special.
Isn't it?

644
01:04:04,745 --> 01:04:06,906
Excuse me;
I need to finish my sketch.

645
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:16,584
Good evening Sara.
- Good evening.

646
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:21,083
Mr. Sahai, congratulations.
You have performed yet...

647
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:25,254
another miracle.
Still a long way to go, Mr. McNally

648
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,365
The journey has just begun.

649
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,273
Teacher!

650
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:40,769
She's been waiting for
her gift for so long.

651
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:54,294
What is this?

652
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,521
Your friend, for... life.

653
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:05,036
I don't need

654
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:07,974
I don't want to be dependent on this.

655
01:05:10,177 --> 01:05:14,409
This will not make you dependent.

656
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:21,114
It will make you independent.
Do you understand?

657
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:59,115
"It was the beginning of a new life..."

658
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,695
"a new feeling, a new horizon..."

659
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:04,864
"You had faith in me..."

660
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:07,367
"and I had faith in my wings."

661
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:11,033
Remember how happy I was
that day?

662
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:24,608
Is it wise to let Michelle live alone?

663
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:27,720
She is not alone;
Mrs. Gomes will also live here.

664
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:29,890
I will also live next door.

665
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:35,891
University is close by,
she will meet new people.

666
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:40,759
Besides, we can't protect
her all her life.

667
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:42,230
Don't worry. She'll be fine!

668
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:43,733
What's wrong with you, Sara? Huh?

669
01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:45,803
We were all just laughing
now suddenly you're fighting.

670
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:48,736
It's very irritating, mama.
Anything that I put anywhere...

671
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:50,342
she picks it up and puts it
somewhere else.

672
01:06:51,312 --> 01:06:52,904
Ma, I love her very much,
I really do.

673
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:55,411
But... Please... leave me
out of this. Ok?

674
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,748
She's very excited, sweetie.
Please understand

675
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:01,478
I understand everything.
It's always about her, right?

676
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,852
Her excitement, her happiness, she's
the one who means everything to you

677
01:07:05,326 --> 01:07:09,057
But what about me?
Should I speak to you in sign language?

678
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:11,197
Paul, I can't believe
what she's saying.

679
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:16,702
Oh My God...
Michelle!

680
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:21,505
Michelle!
- No, Mrs. McNally. Leave her alone.

681
01:07:23,344 --> 01:07:26,108
With every fall, she'll rise higher.

682
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:30,116
I fell.

683
01:07:31,018 --> 01:07:32,076
That's the spirit.

684
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:41,519
I want you to walk alone,
without any help.

685
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:47,797
then right. Understood?

686
01:08:02,983 --> 01:08:05,315
JoJo... go slow... l'm getting old.

687
01:08:06,687 --> 01:08:08,154
Oh! I'm so sorry.

688
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:22,827
Where is she going?

689
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,440
Where... are you going?

690
01:08:29,543 --> 01:08:33,070
No no no... This is the
wrong way... it's this way.

691
01:08:33,581 --> 01:08:36,015
No... it's... tch!
We're getting late...

692
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:42,849
Come on... yes, hurry up

693
01:08:45,559 --> 01:08:46,355
Yes, come on...

694
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,522
Run, run, run!
Yes!

695
01:08:56,737 --> 01:08:58,204
Come on, come on... hurry up.

696
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:00,597
- Present.

697
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:03,205
- Present

698
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,205
- Present

699
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,369


700
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:14,218
- Present.

701
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:19,252
"There was so much to learn
and there was such little time."

702
01:09:20,094 --> 01:09:21,220
"24 hours without tiring..."

703
01:09:22,062 --> 01:09:26,726
"Your fingers would speak to me."

704
01:09:27,301 --> 01:09:30,634
Whether life starts from
the womb or from the earth...

705
01:09:31,605 --> 01:09:37,566
its journey starts from darkness
and ends in darkness.

706
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:42,471
One day we will all have to pass
through this darkness...

707
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:49,514
and reach into the light.

708
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:53,222
"One day, we all have to go through
the darkness, to... light..."

709
01:09:53,994 --> 01:09:56,258
"New doors opened up for me..."

710
01:09:56,997 --> 01:10:01,491
"new friends, new stories,
new poetry..."

711
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,433
"a new way of looking at the world"

712
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:08,003
"what you see is what you dream'

713
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:13,040
No. She, she... she disagrees
with the poet

714
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:17,843
Eyes don't see dreams
but the mind does.

715
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:24,386
I can't see with my eyes,
yet I dream.

716
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,622
Our dream is that one-day
I would graduate.

717
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:45,372
Are you ready?

718
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:46,637
Ready...

719
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:50,480
Tree...
- Tree...

720
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,750
Burr...
- Butterfly...

721
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:56,481
Bir...
- Bird...

722
01:10:57,024 --> 01:10:58,821
Fish...
- Fish...

723
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,654
Bee...
- Bee...

724
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:14,501
"The best years of my life..."

725
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:17,536
"memories of which
bring joy even today"

726
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:33,525
It's ok...

727
01:11:34,928 --> 01:11:35,860
It's all right!

728
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:44,864
What? Tickly?

729
01:11:56,216 --> 01:12:00,209
It's not going to snow.
Please concentrate on your studies

730
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:05,217
No, no... you wont need the
umbrella at all, concentrate.

731
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:21,399
Give me the umbrella.
Hey stop it...

732
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:22,575
Give me the umbrella...

733
01:12:22,776 --> 01:12:23,743
Give me the umbrella...
give... me... The umbrella

734
01:12:57,978 --> 01:12:59,104
"Can't you see"?

735
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:00,606
I'm sorry sir

736
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:07,784
Hey... no... no. No.
It's alright... it's alright.

737
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:10,282
No, no...

738
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:14,827
you are too slow!
How will you pass?

739
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:16,959
You'll try?

740
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:18,963
Let's watch it

741
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:25,835
This is ten words in one minute

742
01:13:28,675 --> 01:13:31,303
You're going to try and do thirty.
Thirty words, my foot!

743
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:44,646
Pass?
- No fail.

744
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:55,000
No, not in one or two subjects,
you have failed in all of them.

745
01:14:21,028 --> 01:14:24,862
"People celebrate success
but we celebrated failure"

746
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:29,201
"While eating ice cream
you told me the story of the spider"

747
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:32,537
"Who after a lot of tries
made her home."

748
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:36,367
"After all, failure is
the first step towards success..."

749
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:40,403
"but for me these steps
were never-ending."

750
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:50,419
Mr. Sahai, how are you?
How is Michelle?

751
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:54,226
She's all right,
her results have come out.

752
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:55,659
And what happened?

753
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,064
She has failed again.

754
01:15:01,134 --> 01:15:04,729
But she said that
her papers were easy.

755
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:10,069
She lied, so she could
enjoy her holidays

756
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:17,810
But you said that only after falling
can a person rise higher.

757
01:15:19,753 --> 01:15:23,917
Before I fall, I want her
to learn how to fly.

758
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:29,928
I'm getting old, you know?

759
01:15:30,163 --> 01:15:33,599
Oh no...
- What happened?

760
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:38,664
Michelle has failed again?
- Yes Paul. I'm worried.

761
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:39,973
I think Mr Sahai...

762
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:47,944
Ma... I want to come home.

763
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:58,285
Ma, I failed.

764
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:12,196
Teacher shouted at me.

765
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,473
I love you, my baby, I love you.

766
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:40,998
I was told you were looking
for me Mr. Fernandez

767
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:46,329
Ah Mr. Sahai, please come in.
I have been waiting for you all day...

768
01:16:47,507 --> 01:16:51,500
I want to share my biggest
achievement with you.

769
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,612
Please have a seat.

770
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:03,853
Mr. Sahai Michelle has been studying
in the same class for 2 years.

771
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:07,591
So I thought I would do
something to... help her.

772
01:17:11,264 --> 01:17:14,529
First year Arts, entirely in Braille.

773
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:21,605
You had once said very few chances
are given for doing good deeds.

774
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:26,541
I'm happy that you haven't
wasted this chance.

775
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:30,143
Now no one can stop Michelle
from going ahead. Thank you.

776
01:17:30,383 --> 01:17:34,547
Not at all... It's my duty,
my pleasure, my pride.

777
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:39,818
I trust that was all right?

778
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:49,229
Is anything the matter?

779
01:17:52,405 --> 01:17:54,805
Then the books, Mr. Sahai.
Please take them to Michelle.

780
01:18:01,114 --> 01:18:03,082
How do I go out?

781
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:09,086
How... how do I go out?

782
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,790
I beg your pardon?

783
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,919
The way to go out?

784
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:18,454
The door, Mr. Sahai...
it's right behind you.

785
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:20,264
Exactly the way you came in.

786
01:18:24,304 --> 01:18:25,100
Yes...

787
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:31,938
Mr. Sahai, is everything all right?

788
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,959
Tee... cher...

789
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,854
"New feelings were arising with age..."

790
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,427
"something that I couldn't understand"

791
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:00,524
"I knew no one besides you teacher"

792
01:20:02,535 --> 01:20:05,936
"That's why I thought of another
relationship with you teacher"

793
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,769
"Was it wrong for me to think this way?"

794
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,043
"A lot was changing..."

795
01:20:12,912 --> 01:20:16,871
"but my failure was constant"

796
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:26,390
Time up, Michelle... time up.

797
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:29,121
Michelle, you've already
had extra time.

798
01:20:29,896 --> 01:20:32,888
Michelle... I'll take
the paper out then.

799
01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:37,066
No... no...
- Please...

800
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,237
Leave it...
- Please...

801
01:20:38,438 --> 01:20:41,965
Leave it... no... leave it...

802
01:20:43,076 --> 01:20:45,408
Knowing the answers is not enough...

803
01:20:45,612 --> 01:20:49,605
You have let me down completely.
I am angry... I am very angry...

804
01:20:50,617 --> 01:20:53,916
no... knowing the
answers is not enough...

805
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,145
you need to put them down
on paper too, understand?

806
01:21:03,129 --> 01:21:04,824
Don't just stand there
like a failure!

807
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:11,503
It's all right.
- No. It's not all right, Mrs. McNally.

808
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:13,936
It's not only her failure,
it's mine too.

809
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:16,739
This is the third year in a row
that she's failed.

810
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,939
For three years we have been doing
those same lessons.

811
01:21:19,312 --> 01:21:21,974
She's just too slow at typing.

812
01:21:22,482 --> 01:21:24,347
Hey, Michelle... Michelle...

813
01:21:24,684 --> 01:21:25,946
Where do you think you are going?

814
01:21:26,152 --> 01:21:29,610
Leave this bag...
Leave it, leave it...

815
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:30,753
Leave this bag!

816
01:21:30,957 --> 01:21:33,517
Enough! I want to go home.

817
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,786
No. No... you're not going anywhere.

818
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:37,519
I don't want to stay.
I don't want to study.

819
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:41,292
No... no... You will stay...
you will study. You understand?

820
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:44,299
You will study. In three years even
the Braille letters have worn out...

821
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:48,304
but nothing has entered your brain.
- Let her be, Mr. Sahai!

822
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:51,305
Mrs. McNally, I haven't spent

823
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,478
I'm not going to allow her
to be a failure.

824
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:55,806
Hey... come here... you...
come here...

825
01:21:56,015 --> 01:21:57,710
Listen, you will...
you will not...

826
01:21:57,817 --> 01:22:02,720
you will not run away from failure.
Understand? Not run away from failure!

827
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:07,887
Michelle... what is this? Don't you
dare disrespect a book!

828
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,823
Pick it up... Come on.
Pick it up., pick up the book...

829
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:12,497
pick up the book... Michelle...
Michelle...

830
01:22:12,866 --> 01:22:14,493
Pick up the book...

831
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:16,160
Stop it

832
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:29,011
As long as I am alive,
you will study.

833
01:22:29,549 --> 01:22:32,177
I don't want to learn.

834
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:34,876
Yes! You will learn.
You will graduate.

835
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:37,883
The black robe. Our dream...

836
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:43,351
I don't want a robe.
My world is black

837
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:48,762
No. Your world... your world is
not black. It is full of light!

838
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:53,701
My world is black, black, black!

839
01:22:53,907 --> 01:22:57,365
Black... black...

840
01:23:25,772 --> 01:23:29,902


841
01:23:31,177 --> 01:23:32,405
in less than 2 minutes.

842
01:23:36,115 --> 01:23:39,084
She's not slow anymore Mrs McNally

843
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:43,914
Time for celebration.

844
01:23:45,258 --> 01:23:49,126
Time for... an icecream, my dear

845
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:53,132
Ice-cream?
- Yes...

846
01:23:53,633 --> 01:24:02,666
Mrs. McNally. Life is an ice-cream.
Enjoy it before it melts.

847
01:24:17,624 --> 01:24:18,784
Can I have two?

848
01:24:21,961 --> 01:24:23,360
Ice creams, of course...

849
01:24:29,802 --> 01:24:31,599
Sir... ice-cream...

850
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:34,801
Ice-cream sir.

851
01:24:42,348 --> 01:24:44,145
What happened?
- Tee...

852
01:24:45,018 --> 01:24:45,814
What's wrong with you?

853
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:51,156
Your change, sir.

854
01:24:52,992 --> 01:24:54,152
Sir, your change?

855
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:33,696
Tee... Tee...

856
01:25:39,072 --> 01:25:43,702
tee... tee... tee...

857
01:25:54,587 --> 01:26:01,390
Are you alright?
Call for a doctor!

858
01:26:06,265 --> 01:26:07,061
Mr. Sahai?

859
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:10,569
Mr. Sahai?

860
01:26:12,138 --> 01:26:14,698
You are here...
I've been looking for you.

861
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:16,734
Yes?

862
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,141
Don't you recognize me?

863
01:26:19,846 --> 01:26:21,279
It's me... Fernandez

864
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:25,409
Michelle's Principal.

865
01:26:26,986 --> 01:26:30,717
Oh... yes. Of course.
I'll get Michelle for you.

866
01:26:30,957 --> 01:26:33,653
Michelle!
- Michelle can't hear, Mr. Sahai.

867
01:26:40,099 --> 01:26:43,068
I'll just call her.

868
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:49,105
Mrs. Gomes!!!
- Michelle is not at home.

869
01:26:55,815 --> 01:26:56,509
She's here.

870
01:27:09,996 --> 01:27:13,625
To forget my name,
to forget the door...

871
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:18,269
all this is fine... but to forget
Michelle like this...

872
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:21,339
something is seriously wrong,
Mr. Sahai.

873
01:27:22,008 --> 01:27:24,841
I really think you should
get some help and see a doctor...

874
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:29,307
Good night. Mr. Sahai.

875
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:12,849
I'm... sorry.

876
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:17,890
It's ok.
- It's ok.

877
01:28:19,432 --> 01:28:21,400
Don't ever forget me...

878
01:28:28,741 --> 01:28:29,366
I promise...

879
01:28:30,743 --> 01:28:32,370
I will never forget... you

880
01:28:34,213 --> 01:28:36,943
You worry about me?

881
01:28:40,653 --> 01:28:44,521
No. Don't... worry about me...

882
01:28:46,425 --> 01:28:51,419
just... getting old.

883
01:28:54,634 --> 01:28:57,467
No... Don't worry.

884
01:29:00,606 --> 01:29:03,439
Go to... sleep.

885
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,444
Sing you... a lullaby...

886
01:29:12,218 --> 01:29:13,742
No, I can't sing...

887
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:35,439
Hush, my baby.
On the treetop.

888
01:29:37,476 --> 01:29:43,904
When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock...

889
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:48,115
hush my baby...

890
01:29:49,555 --> 01:29:52,490
"A storm had scattered my dreams"

891
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:55,992
"All those dreams those
were most dear to me"

892
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,965
"That day was the first time
I felt fear..."

893
01:30:02,235 --> 01:30:06,296
"how would I live
if you forget me?"

894
01:30:09,275 --> 01:30:11,470
What happened now?
- She doesn't want to come downstairs

895
01:30:11,644 --> 01:30:14,135
She is feeling awkward to come
in front of your in-laws.

896
01:30:14,347 --> 01:30:15,746
She thinks she'll spoil the evening.

897
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:17,810
Then why did she bother
coming till here?

898
01:30:18,017 --> 01:30:18,984
Stop it Sara!!!

899
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:23,680
She's worried about
Mr. Sahai's health, please...

900
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,725
it really hurts me to see
the two of you fight like this...

901
01:30:27,493 --> 01:30:29,017
now you get her ready
and you bring her down.

902
01:30:29,228 --> 01:30:30,388
I have a lot of work to finish...

903
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:40,170
Michelle, I'm requesting you...

904
01:30:40,773 --> 01:30:43,708
till now whatever you did
was special.

905
01:30:44,477 --> 01:30:47,913
But today is a very
special day for me.

906
01:30:48,614 --> 01:30:52,607
I'm in love and I am getting
engaged before you.

907
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:54,776
I know this could upset you.

908
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:57,815
Maybe this evening will
never come in your life

909
01:30:58,391 --> 01:31:00,985
And you may be feeling that
you will never fall in love.

910
01:31:02,862 --> 01:31:05,353
I hope you will.
I really do...

911
01:31:05,898 --> 01:31:07,866
but, until then...

912
01:31:08,234 --> 01:31:13,638
please don't... spoil. My. Evening. Ok?

913
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:27,875
I am very happy today because all the
people I care about in the world...

914
01:31:28,087 --> 01:31:32,547
are in this room. On this occasion,
I'd love to say a few words.

915
01:31:39,265 --> 01:31:42,462
I'm a very lucky girl that
I got parents like you.

916
01:31:43,269 --> 01:31:44,668
And a sister like Michelle.

917
01:31:45,604 --> 01:31:48,232
I haven't been the best
daughter or the best sister.

918
01:31:48,607 --> 01:31:51,132
But I want to tell you all
I that really love you very much.

919
01:31:52,945 --> 01:31:54,242
And I love this house.

920
01:31:55,448 --> 01:31:57,006
There are so many memories here.

921
01:31:58,451 --> 01:32:01,079
I remember one time Michelle
and I were playing outside.

922
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:03,585
We were running through
the grass holding hands.

923
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:08,590
And while running, both of us fell
down and both of us started crying.

924
01:32:09,128 --> 01:32:16,091
Mama and Papa came running outside and
picked up Michelle and left me outside...

925
01:32:17,636 --> 01:32:20,366
and there I was...
with my arms stretched out.

926
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:21,503
Waiting.

927
01:32:23,642 --> 01:32:24,768
I'm still waiting.

928
01:32:27,646 --> 01:32:31,946
As a child. I...
I used to be so angry with her.

929
01:32:33,486 --> 01:32:36,614
The amount I loved her the
same amount I was jealous of her...

930
01:32:37,156 --> 01:32:39,624
whatever food I didn't like,
I'd feed her.

931
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:44,959
I used to wake Michelle in the
middle of the night and ask her...

932
01:32:45,664 --> 01:32:49,532
do you want to drink water? Michelle
used to nod her head and say yes...

933
01:32:51,003 --> 01:32:52,971
and I used to turn my head
and go back to sleep.

934
01:32:55,341 --> 01:32:57,138
She would wait for me
all night long.

935
01:33:02,181 --> 01:33:03,648
I can't believe I did that.

936
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,214
Can you Marc?

937
01:33:13,692 --> 01:33:17,560
For all those things that I did,
and all the misplaced...

938
01:33:18,364 --> 01:33:21,231
anger... I'd like to say I'm sorry.

939
01:33:23,702 --> 01:33:24,999
Did I say something wrong?

940
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:27,839
Then please let me finish.
- I don't want to listen,

941
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,234
It's important to me. Michelle.

942
01:33:43,556 --> 01:33:47,185
Michelle...
- Enough!!!!

943
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:57,027
Sit down.

944
01:33:59,405 --> 01:34:01,464
SIT... DOWN.

945
01:34:17,256 --> 01:34:19,281
For this joyous and
eventful evening...

946
01:34:21,427 --> 01:34:24,885
Michelle had prepared
a speech for Sara,

947
01:34:25,598 --> 01:34:31,230
I would read and Michelle
would sign...

948
01:34:32,438 --> 01:34:36,738
but I don't think that Michelle
is in any mood for signs.

949
01:34:38,444 --> 01:34:44,576
It's important however, that we
should all hear what she said.

950
01:34:46,952 --> 01:34:53,255
"I was eight years old, wild, violent
always angry at life."

951
01:34:56,462 --> 01:35:00,262
"I felt that I would never experience
the beautiful moments of life."

952
01:35:01,467 --> 01:35:04,595
"Then mother put Sara in my arms
for the first time..."

953
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:17,112
"and then I knew that I'd see the world
through Sara's eyes."

954
01:35:18,317 --> 01:35:24,222
"Ma says, that I couldn't
stop smiling all day."

955
01:35:30,496 --> 01:35:33,795
"Sara shared all her happiness
with me..."

956
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:38,030
"she would hold my hand
and take me everywhere."

957
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:41,033
"When Ma wasn't around
she would feed me..."

958
01:35:41,507 --> 01:35:45,568
"she would wake me at night
and ask me if I wanted water."

959
01:35:51,016 --> 01:35:53,644
"You were the voice
to my silent fingers."

960
01:35:55,854 --> 01:35:58,379
"I am so looking forward
to your wedding day."

961
01:36:00,526 --> 01:36:01,823
"I'll dress up beautifully that day."

962
01:36:10,703 --> 01:36:13,069
"I may never be the bride,
but I will still be the bridesmaid."

963
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:25,609
"Do teach Marc how to sign,
I have lots to complain about you."

964
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:30,745
"Thank you for allowing me
to be your bridesmaid, Sara."

965
01:36:32,224 --> 01:36:40,427
"I promise I will not cry... as you
walk with Marc towards a new life."

966
01:36:58,083 --> 01:37:00,449
So on this happy note...

967
01:37:03,756 --> 01:37:04,780
a toast...

968
01:37:07,593 --> 01:37:10,323
for Sara and Marc

969
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:12,950
Do you, Marc Philip Bragger,
take Sara Maria McNally...

970
01:38:13,158 --> 01:38:16,616
to be you're lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

971
01:38:17,162 --> 01:38:19,460
Marc... says yes.

972
01:38:19,665 --> 01:38:24,466
Do you, Sara Maria McNally...
- Now the priest is asking Sara...

973
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:26,535
take Marc Philip Bragger to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

974
01:38:26,739 --> 01:38:28,297
If she agrees...
- I do.

975
01:38:28,507 --> 01:38:30,407
Sara says..."Yes".

976
01:38:31,343 --> 01:38:34,210
I declare you to be man and wife

977
01:38:37,349 --> 01:38:40,648
Now they are exchanging rings.

978
01:38:40,853 --> 01:38:42,150
You may now kiss the bride.

979
01:38:42,354 --> 01:38:48,816
The priest has asked them
to kiss as man and wife.

980
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:56,331
On the cheek?
- No, no, not on the cheek. On the lips.

981
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:46,877
Tee...

982
01:39:55,761 --> 01:39:56,625
Te...

983
01:40:06,605 --> 01:40:09,403
What are you doing here?

984
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:13,407
Wanted... to talk.

985
01:40:29,628 --> 01:40:33,428
Do you love... me?

986
01:40:43,308 --> 01:40:46,106
I'm suffering...

987
01:40:51,483 --> 01:40:56,546
I understand that you are suffering...

988
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:06,563
I may never know... what it is
to... love... a man.

989
01:41:11,336 --> 01:41:22,144
Maybe you will never
experience physical love

990
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:29,050
but...

991
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:40,320
will you kiss me once...

992
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:45,666
please?

993
01:43:19,965 --> 01:43:20,932
Tee...

994
01:43:26,304 --> 01:43:27,100
Teee...

995
01:43:28,306 --> 01:43:31,503
"In giving me dignity
as a woman..."

996
01:43:31,977 --> 01:43:35,276
"you lost all dignity
as a teacher."

997
01:43:36,314 --> 01:43:38,942
"I realized that
I had asked too much."

998
01:43:39,818 --> 01:43:40,842
"I made a mistake."

999
01:43:41,987 --> 01:43:44,455
"You didn't even give me a chance
to ask for your forgiveness."

1000
01:43:45,824 --> 01:43:47,121
"I'm leaving"

1001
01:43:48,326 --> 01:43:53,195
"Like your walking-stick,
never forget one thing"

1002
01:43:54,332 --> 01:43:59,634
"Darkness is desperately trying
to engulf you"

1003
01:44:00,672 --> 01:44:03,072
"But you must always
walk towards light"

1004
01:44:04,009 --> 01:44:08,412
"Every step of yours, filled with hope,
will keep me alive, Michelle"

1005
01:44:22,027 --> 01:44:24,325
"Once again light transcended
into darkness..."

1006
01:44:25,697 --> 01:44:28,222
"and sound into silence."

1007
01:44:28,867 --> 01:44:34,169
"For twelve years
I walked the path you showed me..."

1008
01:44:35,207 --> 01:44:37,334
"alone in the darkness."

1009
01:44:39,377 --> 01:44:43,438
"When after twelve years I had
found you near the same fountain..."

1010
01:44:44,216 --> 01:44:47,117
"and today after 12 days
this mark sheet."

1011
01:44:47,552 --> 01:44:50,180
"I'm now a graduate in the arts."

1012
01:44:51,223 --> 01:44:53,783
"I want you to be the first one
to hear the good news"

1013
01:44:54,726 --> 01:44:58,025
Mr. Sahai this is your bed,
please lie down.

1014
01:44:58,396 --> 01:45:02,196
Please... that's it. Mr. Sahai...

1015
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,369
This is your bed, Mr. Sahai!

1016
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:06,366
Nurse!

1017
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:08,706
Mr. Sahai...

1018
01:45:10,075 --> 01:45:13,203
please lie down... Mr. Sahai

1019
01:45:31,429 --> 01:45:32,225
Tee...

1020
01:45:50,448 --> 01:45:51,244
Teee!

1021
01:45:52,117 --> 01:45:52,845
Tee...

1022
01:45:56,454 --> 01:45:57,318
Tee!

1023
01:46:33,825 --> 01:46:36,453
"Amidst us today there
is a student..."

1024
01:46:36,661 --> 01:46:39,630
who has set an example
of grit and strength...

1025
01:46:40,165 --> 01:46:45,296
and has proved that
nothing is impossible.

1026
01:46:46,338 --> 01:46:48,966
She is the pride of our university.

1027
01:46:49,174 --> 01:46:52,974
And on this rare achievement, I would
want her to say a few words.

1028
01:46:53,178 --> 01:46:56,238
Ladies and Gentleman - Michelle McNally

1029
01:47:03,188 --> 01:47:04,712
That's my daughter.

1030
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:22,666
After many attempts...

1031
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:26,840
the spider, in spite of
falling several times...

1032
01:47:27,545 --> 01:47:29,012
has finally made her home.

1033
01:47:30,715 --> 01:47:32,615
The ant has climbed her mountain.

1034
01:47:33,718 --> 01:47:36,346
A tortoise has crossed the dessert...

1035
01:47:37,222 --> 01:47:40,680
and today Michelle McNally,
has finally become a graduate.

1036
01:47:45,897 --> 01:47:48,365
But there is a difference
between you and me.

1037
01:47:48,566 --> 01:47:53,196
What took you 20 years
has taken me 40.

1038
01:47:54,072 --> 01:47:55,699
But I finally did it!

1039
01:48:03,581 --> 01:48:08,712
As a child, I always
lagged behind others.

1040
01:48:11,423 --> 01:48:15,883
My parents were always ashamed of me.

1041
01:48:16,928 --> 01:48:20,989
Every year I would call home
and say, "Ma, I failed."

1042
01:48:23,935 --> 01:48:25,402
But today I can say...

1043
01:48:25,603 --> 01:48:27,662
"Ma, I passed."

1044
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,740
I know that my parents
are very proud of me.

1045
01:48:40,785 --> 01:48:44,482
Telling the world proudly that
I am their daughter

1046
01:48:45,123 --> 01:48:47,148
Thank you Mama, Papa...

1047
01:48:55,967 --> 01:49:04,898
As a child, I was always
searching for something.

1048
01:49:05,643 --> 01:49:08,612
But in the end,
I would only find darkness.

1049
01:49:09,647 --> 01:49:16,109
One day, my mother put me
in those unknown arms.

1050
01:49:17,489 --> 01:49:20,856
He was different from every one.
He was a magician.

1051
01:49:21,493 --> 01:49:28,057
For years he dragged me from
darkness into the light.

1052
01:49:31,336 --> 01:49:34,066
When it comes to God,
we are all blind.

1053
01:49:34,672 --> 01:49:37,869
None of you have ever
seen Him or heard Him.

1054
01:49:39,177 --> 01:49:44,638
But I have touched God.
I have felt his presence.

1055
01:49:46,017 --> 01:49:49,680
I call him "Tee.

1056
01:49:57,862 --> 01:49:59,762
For me everything was BLACK

1057
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:07,502
But my teacher taught me
the new meaning of Black

1058
01:50:11,876 --> 01:50:15,437
Black is not only darkness
and suffocation.

1059
01:50:18,716 --> 01:50:20,513
It is the colour of achievement.

1060
01:50:21,886 --> 01:50:23,251
The colour of knowledge.

1061
01:50:25,557 --> 01:50:28,025
The colour of the graduation robe.

1062
01:50:28,726 --> 01:50:30,591
The colour that we all share today.

1063
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:34,595
But there is a difference
between you and me.

1064
01:50:34,899 --> 01:50:38,130
Today you all wear this
to celebrate graduation.

1065
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:39,537
But not me.

1066
01:50:41,906 --> 01:50:46,002
Because I want my teacher
to be the first one to see me...

1067
01:50:46,611 --> 01:50:49,045
wear this black robe.

1068
01:50:56,421 --> 01:51:00,380
Every graduation day,
he brought me here.

1069
01:51:01,092 --> 01:51:03,959
Every year, we would stand
near that door...

1070
01:51:04,429 --> 01:51:07,489
and every year he would
write in my hand...

1071
01:51:08,099 --> 01:51:12,229
"One day I want to see you
on that stage Michelle"

1072
01:51:15,273 --> 01:51:16,570
It has taken me 40 years...

1073
01:51:16,774 --> 01:51:18,833
to fulfill his dream.

1074
01:51:19,777 --> 01:51:24,077
And today, for the first time,
I feel my lack of sight.

1075
01:51:24,782 --> 01:51:32,746
Because I want to see my teacher
standing at the door...

1076
01:51:32,957 --> 01:51:34,925
watching me fulfill our dream
with pride

1077
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:00,050
"Teacher..."

1078
01:53:50,928 --> 01:53:58,733
"Our dream"...Tee... Woah...

1079
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:54,787
Woah... woah

1080
01:55:05,336 --> 01:55:05,961
Woah

1081
01:55:08,005 --> 01:55:09,131
Woah...

1082
01:55:19,016 --> 01:55:19,983
Tee... Woah

1083
01:55:24,689 --> 01:55:25,553
woah

1084
01:55:42,039 --> 01:55:47,500
"Dear Ms. Nair, you'll be happy to
know that we have come into the light:

1085
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:54,011
"Today my teacher has remembered
his first word - Water."

1086
01:55:55,386 --> 01:55:57,354
"He is the greatest teacher
in the world..."

1087
01:55:57,722 --> 01:56:02,182
"who has proved again that there is
nothing impossible in this world."

1088
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:07,690
"Who has taught me that there is so much
happiness in living for someone else"

1089
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:11,596
"Today is my teacher's
first day at school Miss Nair."

1090
01:56:12,069 --> 01:56:16,699
And his alphabets, just like mine,
will not start with A, B, C, D, and E.

1091
01:56:17,241 --> 01:56:22,543
But with B, L, A, C, K

1092
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:24,605
"BLACK"
