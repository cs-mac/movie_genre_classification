1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:02,144
Previously on Shades of Blue...

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:05,214
Loman!

3
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:07,650
A video game?

4
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:08,818
I heard shots. They sounded real.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,819
You heard them too, right?

6
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:10,886
I'll protect you.

7
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:12,054
It wasn't a clean shoot.

8
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,489
You don't say.

9
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,890
There's a new bookie.

10
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,359
You collect, and then you
give him the rundown.

11
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,928
- Get on the ground.
- Lower the weapon,

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,329
- Detective Santos.
- Police.

13
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:22,098
It's you who's under arrest.

14
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,633
Provided your cooperation
leads to convictions,

15
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:26,202
We'll grant you full immunity.

16
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,636
Look, if you planned this whole thing...

17
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:29,305
Thinking I was gonna rat out my crew...

18
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,706
You have a daughter, don't you?

19
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:35,277
Look, the crew's gonna
be hitting the street.

20
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,513
I can't. Cristina's car got hit.

21
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,484
Her friend borrowed it and
smashed in the front end.

22
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:43,285
You never said anything
about wearing a wire.

23
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,287
There's a camera in the stone.

24
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,627
What's the matter?

25
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,829
Every betrayal begins with trust.

26
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:01,470
There's a rat.

27
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,539
There's a rat!

28
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,876
An FBI informant on my team.

29
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:09,912
I need to kill it.

30
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,717
And I need to kill it.

31
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:26,395
And you're gonna help me,

32
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,898
Because you're the only one I trust.

33
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:45,114
How do you know this?

34
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:51,453
Just tell me everything
that you've heard.

35
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:57,026
How many years...

36
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,696
Have we been working together?

37
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,131
Since Cristina was six.

38
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,700
That's ten years.

39
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:07,603
Is that how long it takes before
you really know someone...

40
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,772
Is ten years?

41
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:11,941
Eight?

42
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:15,077
Espada's been with me for eight years.

43
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,246
What about Tess?

44
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,481
15 years.

45
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,917
That's a long time.

46
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,554
Stood up at weddings, at funerals.

47
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:27,556
What about six?

48
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:30,726
Tufo and Saperstein... almost six years.

49
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,995
Six years apiece.

50
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,297
That's six years of roll call,

51
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:39,034
Of tough arrests, stakeouts...

52
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:45,341
Six years of seeing crime
scenes that you're never,

53
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:48,277
ever gonna unsee.

54
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:52,081
If it's too hard to believe, it's...

55
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,983
Probably not true.

56
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,352
45 years.

57
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,656
That's 45 years...

58
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,958
of friendship,

59
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
of loyalty.

60
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:05,861
Boss...

61
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:09,265
What is it really?

62
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,966
What is it that has you suddenly

63
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:14,603
so convinced that someone
would do this to us?

64
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:21,277
Yo, Red Simons keeps calling.

65
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,878
A black sedan with white fenders

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,446
has slow-rolled past his liquor store

67
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,848
three times in the last hour.

68
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,483
All right. So have dispatch send a car.

69
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,852
They did, but Red says
since he pays protection,

70
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,553
he wants one of us to
go and hold his hand.

71
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,555
- Now?
- 15 minutes, max.

72
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,190
I mean, I'd go, but I already had a few.

73
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,893
You know. What you want me to do?

74
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,865
- I'll take you.
- Harlee, no.

75
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,571
You and I will go.

76
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:03,852
You notice any of the team
acting different, agitated?

77
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,821
We're cops. Agitation
comes with the job.

78
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,523
Ducking shifts, private calls...

79
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,091
You know what I'm asking.

80
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,727
I can't believe this is a real question.

81
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,596
I have it on good authority, Harlee.

82
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,234
And this authority definitely
puts an informant in our crew?

83
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:20,636
Yes.

84
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,107
The feds deal in fear.

85
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,710
When people are scared,
they make mistakes.

86
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:29,578
I hand-picked this crew.

87
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,015
I know them. I can read them.

88
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:34,249
We pay attention,

89
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,051
and the decent part of this person,

90
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:37,519
the part that, deep down,

91
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,054
wants to be discovered...

92
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,622
It's gonna reveal itself.

93
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,130
Are you hearing this?

94
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:55,637
Come on. A liquor salesman
needs some coddling.

95
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,873
Can't two patrolmen coddle him?

96
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,776
You know, 20 years ago, a car
goes rolling by twice...

97
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:04,801
Didn't Tufo say black
import, white fenders?

98
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,583
Get down!

99
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,159
You all right?

100
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:18,794
- You're hit.
- No. I'm fine.

101
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,095
I'm fine. Call it in.

102
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:22,698
It's heading West on 68th street.

103
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,634
- Just one shooter?
- Yeah, the driver.

104
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:27,169
Single-grip shotgun.

105
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,637
Was he shooting at you or the store?

106
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,105
Does it matter?

107
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,074
Two officer-involved
shootings in three days?

108
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,176
You might want to start
wearing Kevlar in the shower.

109
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:37,646
- Too soon?
- Copy that.

110
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:39,448
Guys, guess what?

111
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,750
Two more liquor stores shot up
ten minutes before this one.

112
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:42,951
One's a drive-by.

113
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,953
Black import with replacement fenders.

114
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,922
This sounds like our menace.

115
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,424
Intentional or not,

116
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,125
nobody's gonna take a
shot at me, my crew,

117
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,960
or anybody else, all right?

118
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:54,630
Nobody goes home until we put
this son of a bitch in cuffs.

119
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,399
All right? I'll take the heat,
but we got to get this shooter.

120
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:01,703
Oh, speaking of shooters...

121
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:03,939
Harlee, you're gonna be with me, okay?

122
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:05,307
We'll work command at the precinct.

123
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,775
I heard our team numbers on the scanner.

124
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,811
- Where do you want me?
- When we all leave,

125
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:10,479
I want you to go over
to the doughnut shop.

126
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,947
All right? Just stay there.

127
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,215
What am I looking for?

128
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,317
You'll know it when you see it, okay?

129
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,019
Yes, sir.

130
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:19,621
- I'll be back in a minute.
- You like doughnuts?

131
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,523
- No, sir.
- You don't like doughnuts?

132
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,525
What kind of cop is he gonna be?

133
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:32,367
- Restroom?
- Employees only.

134
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,836
Keep it that way.

135
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:38,240
You messed up.

136
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:39,842
Can you hear me?

137
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:42,177
You have no idea what you're doing.

138
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:45,314
He knows there's a mole.

139
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:47,249
There's a leak on your end.

140
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,951
You're gonna get me killed.

141
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,628
Yo, I don't care, man.
Just keep walking.

142
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,862
- Come on, man.
- So you're saying

143
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,479
you were at your girlfriend...

144
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,963
What are you doing? That's
just gonna hurt you.

145
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,350
Listen, can Linda drive you to practice?

146
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,151
Because you know I hate
you dragging that cello

147
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:11,353
on the subway.

148
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,687
Did you get any sleep?

149
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,122
Not really. A little.

150
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:15,490
How about you?

151
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,058
I'm making breakfast.

152
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,526
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

153
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,894
- INCOMING CALL UNKNOWN
- Coward-ass police!

154
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:22,030
- Who is that yelling?
- Nobody, baby.

155
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:23,732
A concerned citizen.

156
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,634
- We're making juices.
- I'm sorry, baby.

157
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,168
I can't hear you.

158
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,870
Never mind.

159
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,905
I'll talk to you later. Be safe.

160
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,707
Okay.

161
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,359
You gonna answer that?

162
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,527
Somebody needs help.

163
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,829
Probably shot by a cop.

164
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,230
Santos.

165
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:41,166
One block North on Garfield. Black SUV.

166
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,968
But we need to debrief now.

167
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,803
Just tell them that you're
gonna get a cup of...

168
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,838
coffee.

169
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,085
Special Agent Stahl?

170
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,319
SA Molly Chen.

171
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,254
I've been assigned to your detail.

172
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:05,023
They're all working,

173
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,425
snatching collars, looking for
the liquor store shooter.

174
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,827
Well, there's nothing
like sleep deprivation

175
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,762
to make an informant crack.

176
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:12,430
You rule anyone out yet?

177
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:13,732
It can't be the rookie.

178
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,767
He killed a guy on his second shift.

179
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,702
The FBI would've pulled him.

180
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:20,005
- That's five left.
- No, four.

181
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:23,208
Tess, Espada, Tufo, Saperstein.

182
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,776
And Harlee.

183
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,446
Well, you're looking at everyone, right?

184
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,615
No, Donny. I forgot how to work a case.

185
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,417
I'm just saying you have
a blind spot for her.

186
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,586
A detective starts with
the most probable.

187
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:36,755
The FBI profiles potential informants

188
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,356
long before they pick them up.

189
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:40,058
They're looking for the most resourceful

190
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,961
with the most to lose and
the biggest secrets.

191
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:45,630
Who is that in your unit?

192
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,923
Lieutenant Wozniak, James Nava,

193
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,725
your new assistant district...
hang on a minute.

194
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,061
- Tufo!
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

195
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:17,896
Loman's at the doughnut shop.
He thinks the theater

196
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,931
across the street might
have some security footage.

197
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,399
Go help him extricate it.

198
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,134
- Yeah, you got it.
- And don't sleep.

199
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:24,169
Yes, sir.

200
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,637
Got a few calls in to you.

201
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,105
Look, I'm swamped, man.

202
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,940
Me too. Public defender just

203
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,909
published a tell-all about
his drug addiction.

204
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,610
92 of his guilty clients

205
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:35,914
immediately filed habeas corpus
petitions for new trials.

206
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,282
All right, so what are you
hounding me about it for?

207
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,117
You supervised four of the cases,

208
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,319
going back as far as 12 years.

209
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,955
Hey, so my frequent flier over
here just mentioned a kid

210
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,291
named Stroke flossing a
dark Sedan, custom rims.

211
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,326
Is Stroke the name on
his birth certificate?

212
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,562
You should meet his
brother, heart attack.

213
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,300
His real name is Clarence Morris.

214
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,602
He has a registered Sedan that
matches our partial plate.

215
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:00,038
There's no one at the address.

216
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,175
- Put Tess and Espada on it.
- Okay.

217
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,146
Heart attack... why would I say that?

218
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,714
Well, she has that effect on everyone.

219
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:11,015
Don't worry about it.

220
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,784
I need archive files and your notes.

221
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,987
Dibble, Foster, Girard, and Zepeda.

222
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:17,722
Miguel Zepeda?

223
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:20,291
Yeah, he has a decent chance
of getting out of prison.

224
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,360
You remember him?

225
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,529
He's one of the douche bags
I have a special place

226
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,698
for in my heart.

227
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,367
I'll swing by tomorrow.

228
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,469
Evidence techs recovered 12-gauge slugs

229
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,037
from all three liquor stores.

230
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,740
A miracle there weren't
bodies to scrape up.

231
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,645
Hey, what is it?

232
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,648
It's just some old business.

233
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,614
NEW YORK CITY POLICE - INFORMATION
IN THIS RECORD IS CONFIDENTIAL

234
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:10,108
Are you afraid?

235
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:14,713
Should I be?

236
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,816
How well do you know Miguel Zepeda?

237
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,784
More than I'd like to.

238
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,887
Why do you ask?

239
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,223
He claims that you
framed him for murder.

240
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:37,744
Look, I haven't seen Miguel
since he went to prison.

241
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,879
And when was that?

242
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,582
Six years ago. Grand theft auto.

243
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:43,750
You have a daughter, right?

244
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:47,487
She's six years old, right?

245
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,656
It's interesting math.

246
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:56,295
THIS WAS NOT THE DEAL...
DON'T TEST ME.

247
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,199
Were you the responding
officer last week

248
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,168
on a homicide at prospect park?

249
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:06,005
Yeah. A homeless girl got stabbed.

250
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,707
Four times.

251
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,245
But there was no murder
weapon found on the scene.

252
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,316
Yeah. Looks like.

253
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,225
Define epic sex.

254
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:27,927
I don't know. Over an hour?

255
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,195
Damn, Joe.

256
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,430
Good for you. Oh, no, no, no.

257
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,764
Joe slept through it.

258
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,933
Son of a bitch's phone lit up at 2 A.M.

259
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,869
"Amber Blue Dock Bar" wanted
to know if my husband

260
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:40,373
wanted to have some late-night
fun, so I obliged on his behalf.

261
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,141
No, you didn't.

262
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,609
Eight ways from Sunday.

263
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,144
Oh, that's messed up.

264
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:46,779
I mean, it's hot, but it's messed up.

265
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,414
- You've got to talk to him.
- Oh, and say what?

266
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,716
Yo, Joe, I boned your girlfriend.

267
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:50,883
Best sex I had in months.

268
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,452
- High five.
- I'm serious.

269
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,320
Serious enough to break his legs for me?

270
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,722
Yeah, if he actually did something.

271
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,490
- But you need confirmation.
- Confirmation?

272
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,092
You want to read the sick
stuff this bitch said?

273
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,827
Absolutely. But that's not the point.

274
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,895
Sexting is one thing,
but actual, physical,

275
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,330
fleshy contact... that's another thing.

276
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:06,099
Oh, no, no, no. Still cheating.

277
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,934
Well, technically, you're the
one that did the typing.

278
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,938
- Police!
- NYPD!

279
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,639
Police!

280
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,742
Stroke! Stroke, you in here?

281
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:16,943
Hands above your head, now!

282
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,344
Police! Get off the girl!

283
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,448
Off the girl! Hands up!

284
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:25,184
Wozniak received $50,000
laundered through a casino.

285
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,353
Have you linked that to a
specific illegal activity?

286
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,122
Not yet.

287
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,124
But his whole crew is dirty.

288
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,925
At some point, Wozniak's
gonna have to share

289
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,295
whatever his greater ambition
is with somebody he trusts.

290
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,532
And I'm betting it's her.

291
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,368
She looks angry.

292
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,671
Yeah. Well, so am I.

293
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:48,541
Are you completely incompetent
or just straight-up crazy?

294
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,009
You are my asset.

295
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,278
That means when I call you,
you pick up the phone.

296
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,279
You blew it on your end.

297
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,647
You have a leak. Now what?

298
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,782
You want me to slap a sign on my back?

299
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:58,551
There is no leak on my end.

300
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,153
There's only a few people
in the Bureau that even

301
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:01,487
know there's an investigation going on.

302
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:02,722
Then stop calling me.

303
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,724
You're not giving me a choice.

304
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,392
You destroyed the surveillance necklace.

305
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,895
- You haven't checked in.
- I wore it as long as I could.

306
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,897
Yeah? And what have you told him since?

307
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,332
- Who?
- You know who.

308
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,001
Harlee, if you think
there's some play here

309
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,303
where you tell Wozniak
that we've approached you

310
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,038
and you beg for his forgiveness,
that's not going to happen.

311
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,640
Trust me, if I knew you were
gonna blow it like this,

312
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,209
- I would have.
- No one has outed you.

313
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,811
If you're worried about the
strike team that arrested you,

314
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,380
I cleared them. They're solid.

315
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:29,215
Someone's talking.

316
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:35,655
Wozniak's Intel is limited at best.

317
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,723
Otherwise, he would have acted already.

318
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,425
Let me find out what he knows,

319
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,562
but we need to develop
some kind of protocol here

320
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,430
while I requisition another wire.

321
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:47,166
Requisition?

322
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,169
What kind of operation
are you running here?

323
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,839
My life is at risk because of you.

324
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,441
My daughter's future is
at risk because of you.

325
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,376
Now leave me alone.

326
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,445
Give me a chance to survive
your incompetence.

327
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:02,849
Agent Chen, draw your service weapon.

328
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,183
Excuse me?

329
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,918
Detective Santos feels
her life is at risk.

330
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,522
We're shutting down.
We're making the arrest.

331
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,590
Draw your weapon now,

332
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:11,958
Agent Chen.

333
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,196
You've got about 85 yards to decide

334
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,866
how you're gonna spend
the next ten years.

335
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:23,035
A bluff this size is
above your pay grade.

336
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:25,104
75 yards.

337
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,106
What do you want me to say?

338
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,542
You're really gonna blow
your whole operation?

339
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,677
Oh, look. Friends across the street.

340
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,617
Okay. Fine, fine.

341
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,951
You win.

342
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,422
I win what?

343
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,492
I'll follow your protocol.

344
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:49,362
And do what you're
told when you're told.

345
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,132
Whatever I'm told.

346
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,883
Two days operational,

347
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,518
and your informant is compromised?

348
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,853
Nervous, not compromised.

349
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,621
Wozniak doesn't know
anything definitive.

350
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:08,457
Only that we accessed his inner circle.

351
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,159
If I didn't think you had a strong lead

352
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,827
in what could be a significant
public corruption case,

353
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,997
I wouldn't have
authorized the operation.

354
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,532
But if your informant is in danger...

355
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,701
Detective Santos was
having second thoughts,

356
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:20,469
and that's to be expected.

357
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:21,971
We work through them.

358
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,140
By ordering an agent
to pull a gun on her?

359
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,041
I did what I had to do to
keep the operation alive.

360
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,177
Just give me 24 hours to find the leak

361
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:31,180
and get her in line.

362
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,983
In another life, I was NYPD.

363
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,185
I knew Harlee Santos as a rookie.

364
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,686
If Wozniak didn't get his hooks in her,

365
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:39,488
you could be working for her.

366
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,825
Well, I'll try to remember that.

367
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,860
24 hours.

368
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,498
If only I had an informant
with your enthusiasm

369
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,866
for backstabbing.

370
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,435
She was at risk. I
followed the protocol.

371
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,236
Four months putting this
operation together.

372
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,738
You almost blow it up in four hours.

373
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,406
Seems like it was already blown up.

374
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,508
Look, at Quantico, protocols
may be hard lines.

375
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,911
Out in the field, protocols are margins.

376
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:05,080
We push them, because
the other side will.

377
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,949
I understand. I've already
asked to be reassigned.

378
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,684
Well, that's a really bad idea.

379
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:09,952
Why?

380
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,922
'Cause this case is gonna make you.

381
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:15,024
I'm not talking till
somebody give me some pants.

382
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,459
Listen, you want pants?

383
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,127
Pants are what we call an
accommodation, all right?

384
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,862
Gangsters that shoot at cops...
you guys don't get those.

385
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,597
Do you want to help yourself?

386
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,933
I want to get out of here
and into some pants.

387
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,968
- That our guy?
- I didn't shoot at no one.

388
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,536
Listen, the only reason
you're still breathing,

389
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,938
Romeo, is because you didn't hit anyone.

390
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,539
I was with my girl all night.

391
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,574
I swear.

392
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:33,375
Strap me to a lie detector.

393
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:35,211
Hey, Tess, there goes an idea.

394
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:37,713
Why don't we strap your husband
to a poly, and if he passes,

395
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,048
then you let him keep his phone?

396
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,115
I wouldn't put it past the bastard

397
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:41,717
to stick a tack in his shoe.

398
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,552
You know, I once had this wheelman

399
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:46,088
that tried to beat the lie
detector by slathering Bengay

400
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,224
all over his junk.

401
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:52,127
That's an interesting strategy.

402
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:55,331
Well, pain spikes the heart
rate on the control questions.

403
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,300
It confuses the machine and
throws off the results.

404
00:17:58,302 --> 00:17:59,835
Did it work?

405
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,770
I never hooked him up.

406
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:05,774
He said that he would confess
if I let him wash it off.

407
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:07,943
Creative police work.

408
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,979
Yeah, I've been known to improvise.

409
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:14,183
James Nava, your new ADA.

410
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:16,352
Yeah. I caught that.

411
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:22,424
Do you believe in coincidence?

412
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,627
Depends on the coincidence, I guess.

413
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,996
Well, for example, say...

414
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,631
Two days ago,

415
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:32,101
a police officer responds to a homicide.

416
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,004
An anonymous call comes in
and places the murder weapon

417
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:38,774
in the car of her ex-boyfriend.

418
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,310
Did you lift a knife
from the crime scene?

419
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,112
Absolutely not.

420
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:45,180
Did you plant the knife
in Miguel Zepeda's car

421
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:47,182
to keep him away from your daughter?

422
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:48,484
No.

423
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,190
Do you remember this
domestic disturbance call?

424
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,059
- What's up?
- Our rookie came through.

425
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,496
The boys upstairs pulled a still
frame from the theater camera.

426
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:02,164
Loman's still there?

427
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,333
Oh, yeah. Eyes still peeled
at the doughnut shop.

428
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:05,701
Didn't even ask if he could go home.

429
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:08,837
He knows we're messing with him.

430
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,739
- It's a battle of will now.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,343
Well, Loman's will just got us
a partial view of the shooter.

432
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,545
There's a woman out there
looking to post bond for you,

433
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:17,880
only she ain't your girl, Yessi,

434
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,515
and she's too young to be your mama.

435
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:21,050
So let her post it.

436
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:23,686
I'm not stupid enough
to shoot at the police.

437
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,688
Oh, but you're stupid enough to cheat.

438
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,389
It's not like that.

439
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,858
I'm loyal. Been with
the missus ten years.

440
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,660
Oh, ain't she lucky?

441
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:35,531
- I didn't shoot at no cop.
- Let me see your arm.

442
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,233
Our shooter has a tattoo on his wrist.

443
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:41,704
Well, I'll take my apology in cash...
small bills.

444
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,772
I'll make this brief.

445
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,542
This still frame tells me
that you're not our shooter,

446
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:50,679
but what it doesn't tell me is
why the shooter was in your car.

447
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,215
You clear that up, maybe you go home.

448
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,918
I... I sold the car, all right?

449
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,686
Off the books.

450
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:00,356
Well, why don't you give
me an off-the-books name?

451
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,757
Reggie.

452
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,727
Hothead gunslinger, holes
up on 61st and 5th.

453
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,397
- Cristina.
- Mom.

454
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,032
Someone shot at a police officer?

455
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,901
No one was hurt.

456
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,570
What are you doing here?

457
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,306
I thought you could use
a change of clothes.

458
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,641
- Really?
- Yeah.

459
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,209
I figured you had caffeine covered.

460
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:21,710
Hey!

461
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,545
Backup has arrived.

462
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:24,813
Hey.

463
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,649
Did motor pool fix your car already?

464
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,485
No, they said it's gonna
be a few days still.

465
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,253
You want me to lean on them?

466
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:33,255
I can manage the subway for a week.

467
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,757
You know what? Why don't
you meet me at my desk,

468
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,258
and I'll grab my things, and we'll go.

469
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
Yeah. Good lesson.

470
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,162
Never loan your wheels to your friends.

471
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,930
Oh, I don't loan it out.

472
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,565
- I'm not allowed.
- Well, I would hope so.

473
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,801
Not after they smashed it.

474
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,802
Who?

475
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,404
Your friends.

476
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,672
No. Someone backed into it

477
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:50,973
when it was parked on the street.

478
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,274
You know what? The activity log is done,

479
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:53,909
so I'm gonna take her home, okay?

480
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:55,678
Oh, I can't.

481
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,446
I was heading to Amy's to
work on a science project.

482
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,281
Speaking of which, I need supplies.

483
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,916
Okay. Supplies it is.

484
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,785
I'll grab my bag and we'll
go to the hobby store.

485
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:06,321
Mrs. Lowrey was gonna take us,
but some cash would be great.

486
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:07,690
Here.

487
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,658
Science is on me.

488
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,326
That's a 50.

489
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:12,828
It's all right. It's only money.

490
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,363
Thanks, uncle Woz.

491
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,165
So I should be home by 11:00,

492
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,766
but I'll text you if we go late.

493
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:20,369
- Okay.
- 10:30.

494
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:21,737
- Bye.
- Bye, gorgeous.

495
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:28,377
We need to take a drive.

496
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,479
I thought we found our shooter.

497
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:32,848
No, there's a new development.

498
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:45,527
Looks like Reggie should've
used some of that car money

499
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,463
on a decorator.

500
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,398
Well, we all have our priorities.

501
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:57,172
It's clear. Har?

502
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:59,908
Do you think this guy did the
shooting to make a statement?

503
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:02,478
Maybe he needs a hug.

504
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,413
Maybe he couldn't help himself.

505
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:07,683
Mood stabilizers... lithium.

506
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,184
And the shotgun.

507
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,853
The American way.

508
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,962
Is she starting to lie to you?

509
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,666
Cristina.

510
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:28,504
I hope she doesn't
ever feel the need to.

511
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:31,073
Wait a second. Am I going nuts?

512
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,909
You told me that her
friend smashed the car.

513
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:39,581
Look, I just let her story slide.

514
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,383
I figured it was better
than interrogating her.

515
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:44,253
You might learn things
you don't want to know.

516
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:47,422
Kids never listen anyway.

517
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:49,992
You got to model the important things.

518
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,730
Yeah.

519
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,266
Like how to get a sucker
to spot you a 50.

520
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,802
Like not to rat on your friends.

521
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:06,375
We should polygraph the crew. Yeah.

522
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:08,110
We can act like it's
about a missing payment,

523
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:09,745
then when they're hooked
up, straight-out ask them

524
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:11,146
about the feds.

525
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,051
Quickest way to know what's real.

526
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,052
Get down!

527
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,223
Police! Down!

528
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,344
Nice shooting, Tex.

529
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,846
Didn't the Marines teach you
to aim for the big circle?

530
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,815
If he wasn't mentally ill,
he'd be meeting the coroner.

531
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,284
As it is, he'll be seeing
the physical therapist.

532
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,057
You okay?

533
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,159
Go home and rest up.

534
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,429
I'll round up the crew and tell
them to come over for dinner.

535
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,230
I'm kind of exhausted, Woz.

536
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,933
It's your polygraph idea.

537
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,105
- My house at 8:30.
- Tonight?

538
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,406
You'll be able to sleep otherwise?

539
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,554
Oh, Joe's gonna be working late tonight.

540
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,856
Doesn't need me to wait up. What a guy.

541
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,058
At least that shouldn't
be too hard to verify.

542
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,862
Well, I shouldn't have to.

543
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,731
Why don't you just talk to Joe?

544
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,067
If I have that conversation,

545
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,534
I don't know where it ends.

546
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,203
So you just grin and bear it.

547
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,271
No. We make a detour.

548
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,639
- For what?
- Housekeeping.

549
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,318
- What are we doing here?
- Go take a leak, all right?

550
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,656
Amber?

551
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,228
Yeah. What are you drinking?

552
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,063
PBR and a tequila shot.

553
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,067
PBR, tequila shot.

554
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,904
Little rude not to text on the
day after, don't you think?

555
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,739
I'm sorry. Day after what?

556
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,641
Oh, come on. Don't play coy.

557
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,176
Do I know you?

558
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,612
Seriously?

559
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,579
We had sex last night.

560
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,815
I mean, you thought it
was my husband, Joe,

561
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,618
but trust me, honey, he would
never dine at the Y that long.

562
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,856
Did I pull your hair too
hard when I was behind you?

563
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,693
Look, bitch,

564
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,295
I don't know what you're talking about.

565
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,532
No? Let me jog your memory.

566
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,116
Do you remember now?!

567
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,242
Tess! Tess!

568
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,878
- Stop!
- Two kids!

569
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,382
- Two beautiful kids.
- Hey, hey!

570
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,451
Police business, all right?
This never happened.

571
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,484
It's better for both of us.

572
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:55,552
Trust me.

573
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,786
Let's go.

574
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,054
What, you and your girlfriend broke up?

575
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,289
Way to show some restraint.

576
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,157
That was restraint.

577
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,309
Hello, Harlee.

578
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,545
I told you to stay out of my apartment.

579
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,380
It's a very nice apartment,
especially for your pay grade.

580
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,915
Did anyone see you come in here?

581
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,219
My associate followed
Wozniak to his house.

582
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,520
He's probably in his barcalounger,

583
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,355
scratching his crotch.

584
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,492
Well, she missed the polygraph
equipment that he snuck in.

585
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,862
We're testing the whole crew.

586
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,431
Tonight.

587
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,865
You couldn't talk him out of that?

588
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,336
I suggested it.

589
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,404
Big move.

590
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,838
I thought he was looking at me.

591
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,673
I wanted to appear like
I was just as concerned

592
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,509
as he was... on his side.

593
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,545
Paranoia leads to over-thinking.

594
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,746
Over-thinking can get you
in this kind of trouble.

595
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,016
Wozniak confided in you
as soon as he knew,

596
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,384
and you have to own that, Harlee.

597
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,886
You have to own that trust.

598
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,721
I didn't think he'd agree to it.

599
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,257
I thought he'd want to be more careful.

600
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:09,225
- Is he testing you?
- No.

601
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,894
Just everyone else.

602
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,395
And they'll pass.

603
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,731
This actually could work in our favor...

604
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,567
Give him reason to doubt his Intel,

605
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:20,538
and you can nudge him
into another reality.

606
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,540
Suddenly, there is no informant.

607
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,442
Or someone has a bad day,

608
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,045
gets nervous, indigestion...

609
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,380
God knows.

610
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,253
If he gets a false read...

611
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,422
Just hope no one else in
your crooked little family

612
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,025
is hiding any secrets.

613
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,304
Hey, killer.

614
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:56,005
I almost forgot about you.

615
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,574
You here to relieve me?

616
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,742
No, I think the one
place we know is secure

617
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,779
is the doughnut shop, Loman.

618
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,580
So what is this? Penance?

619
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,148
Initiation. Stand down.

620
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,916
We booked the shooter.

621
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,085
Hey, doughnut boy?

622
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,452
An apple fritter for my friend here.

623
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,487
No. I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

624
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,922
Hey, and an orange juice.

625
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,856
He logged some genuine
detective work today,

626
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,793
and all without shooting anybody.

627
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,494
There's hope for you yet, bro.

628
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,330
So what's the story?

629
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,165
Liquor store shooter.

630
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,667
I don't track the whys and
the what-fors, Loman.

631
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,802
Oh, my bad.

632
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,270
I thought you were a detective.

633
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,471
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah.

634
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,106
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

635
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,942
Well, listen up. Intentions
aren't the point.

636
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,143
The street is an us
versus them situation.

637
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,313
It's best you understand that.

638
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

639
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,683
Where'd you grow up?

640
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,985
Don't even, man.

641
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:45,855
No, we... we are not
social workers, Loman.

642
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,057
I mean, if I'm chasing some
thug through my old hood,

643
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,659
the only color he sees is blue.

644
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,893
Shouldn't we want to change that?

645
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,529
- You want change?
- Yeah.

646
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,297
Yeah? Yeah? Become a
kindergarten teacher, Loman.

647
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,298
Funny.

648
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
They give us a gun and a badge

649
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,369
and dropkick us into calamity.

650
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,704
By the time I pull my cuffs
out, the die is cast,

651
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,306
and that's funny to you?

652
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,507
Look, I'm just saying,

653
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,509
we're meeting these
people at their worst.

654
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,145
No, do not put your guilt on me.

655
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,214
Or yourself, for that matter.

656
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:15,085
You killed a man, and he was black.

657
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,253
There it is.

658
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,324
Yeah, he also was slinging dope
and had a gun pointed at you.

659
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:23,393
We had to put the brother down.
That was his call, not yours.

660
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,804
- You don't know what I did.
- I know you're still breathing, Loman.

661
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,364
I know the politicians and the crybabies

662
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,166
that want to stand around the sidelines

663
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,504
and criticize how we do our job
never had to do our damn job.

664
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,839
Or had the sack to try.

665
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,375
Listen, man. You ain't...
you ain't hearing me.

666
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,677
The public don't give a damn

667
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,413
about your vulnerability in the street.

668
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,882
That's not interesting.

669
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:46,916
What it feels like to...
to bust through that door.

670
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,585
You think they care?

671
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,257
All that matters is that you get
home the same way you showed up.

672
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,393
- Same way I showed up?
- Yes.

673
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,560
The same way you showed up.

674
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:00,096
The same way I showed up.

675
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,099
Same way I showed up.

676
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,335
I don't think that's possible.

677
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,389
Hello?

678
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,299
Woz?

679
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:40,036
Have a seat. I'll be right there.

680
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,809
What, do you have everybody
tied up in the basement?

681
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,980
I changed my mind.

682
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,717
Even with a decent cover story,
we'd still be tipping them.

683
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,154
I'll just clear you tonight, Harlee.

684
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,023
Linda has me on green tea.

685
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,826
I made enough for two.

686
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,761
I'll get it. No rush.

687
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,963
I have to hit the bathroom.

688
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,365
The sooner we start,
the sooner we're done.

689
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,002
You can poly me if you want, Woz,

690
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,371
but I'm not gonna do
it on a full bladder.

691
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,512
Where is Linda, anyway?

692
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,315
She's talking her sister
through this week's crisis.

693
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,217
Can't let her know I have a polygraph.

694
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,885
She'll want to use it on me.

695
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,487
Nothing to hide, nothing to fear.

696
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,014
No one else has gone in?

697
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,050
Not since he's gotten home.

698
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,256
Hello?

699
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:39,757
Who's this?

700
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,460
I said don't answer it.

701
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,096
Put Cristina on the phone now.

702
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,431
It's not funny.

703
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,538
Pick up. Pick up.

704
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,806
Pick up, Cristina.

705
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,381
Mom, I'm fine.

706
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,149
Where are you?

707
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,585
We finished our work early and
went out to meet some friends.

708
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:09,721
That's all.

709
00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:12,757
I'm not mad. Just tell me where you are.

710
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,160
Bushwick, I think.

711
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,262
Baby, you're not old
enough to be in some...

712
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,198
Hello?

713
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,667
Mom?

714
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,602
Hold on. I can't hear you.

715
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,307
When did you get to be 16?

716
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,275
I'm gonna go find somewhere quieter.

717
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,077
Baby, listen to me.

718
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,513
Don't get in a car where
someone's been drinking.

719
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,281
Mom... you hear me?

720
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,816
Can you hear me?

721
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:41,252
Make your own decisions.

722
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:42,420
Think big.

723
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,989
Don't... don't sell yourself short.

724
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,324
You're the most talented
girl in any room.

725
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,359
Mom are you there?

726
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,461
Never settle.

727
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,964
And never hold back.

728
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,665
I can't hear you. I'm gonna hang up.

729
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,067
Okay?

730
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:14,852
And some day, have a daughter.

731
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,525
She'll be the best part of your life.

732
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,160
Mom, I'm headed home.

733
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,701
Don't ever forget.

734
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:34,172
Hey, Harlee, you okay?

735
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,674
Yeah. I'll be... I'll be right out.

736
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,831
Don't take it personally, Harlee.

737
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,766
I need a good night's sleep.

738
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,268
No, I get it. Basic police work.

739
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,706
Start from the inside
and work your way out.

740
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,541
Doesn't mean I won't give
you crap for it later.

741
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:14,345
Well, I hope so.

742
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:15,780
We should call this in.

743
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,216
He could know it's her.

744
00:35:18,218 --> 00:35:20,551
Or maybe they're having dinner.

745
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,256
You willing to bet her life on that?

746
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,291
She's a good liar.

747
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:31,295
What's your full name?

748
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,567
Harlee Grace Santos.

749
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,039
What's your badge number?

750
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,574
You think I framed my ex-boyfriend

751
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,409
for a fight we had seven years ago?

752
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,778
- Just one?
- No.

753
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,314
Miguel could run hot.

754
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,049
Things could get loud.

755
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:55,753
We had thin walls and nosy neighbors.

756
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,322
He ever get physical with you?

757
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,591
You see any charges?

758
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,566
Here.

759
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:10,201
Here.

760
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:11,736
Here.

761
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,086
Have you ever received
an unsanctioned gratuity

762
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:32,623
while working as a police officer?

763
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:37,028
Yes.

764
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,730
Who pinned your detective badge on you?

765
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,169
You did.

766
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,372
I used to like when he got jealous.

767
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,341
Can you believe that?

768
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:56,714
But I knew I had to get
away from him, and...

769
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,952
I was searching for a way out,

770
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:03,087
when I found out I was pregnant.

771
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,062
I almost lost the baby.

772
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,266
I tried to get away.

773
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,237
But he threatened to kill me.

774
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:24,275
And I knew he would.

775
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:40,257
And then a miracle.

776
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,761
Miguel got sent down
for grand theft auto,

777
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,763
and my whole life changed.

778
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:49,333
You know, I wasn't scared anymore.

779
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:52,737
But six years later, he got out.

780
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,672
I was already a cop,

781
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,375
so I knew I could handle him.

782
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,610
But he didn't come after me.

783
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:06,217
He started hanging around
Cristina's school.

784
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,252
Watching.

785
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,887
Taunting.

786
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,425
Just...

787
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:18,095
Like, letting me know that he
could control me at any time.

788
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:26,771
You know what I see?

789
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:30,274
I see a woman...

790
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:33,110
Pushed past her limit.

791
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:37,314
You did what you had to do

792
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,316
to protect your daughter,

793
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,753
to keep Miguel away from her.

794
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,656
I would do anything to protect Cristina.

795
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:55,833
Are you now or have you ever
been an informant for the FBI?

796
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,701
No.

797
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:11,248
I don't need you to confess.

798
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,217
I already got you.

799
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,321
You're the responding officer

800
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:21,192
to the murder that you're
framing Miguel Zepeda for.

801
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:24,328
Miguel Zepeda.

802
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,331
The paper trail leads right back to you.

803
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:31,602
This is a big mistake.

804
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:34,772
You can explain the theory to my lawyer.

805
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:38,109
Lawyer can't help you, Harlee.

806
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:40,244
But you could help yourself.

807
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,149
Erase the trail.

808
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:51,055
How would I do that?

809
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:53,757
Trust the right person.

810
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,595
Something I should know?

811
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,466
I never doubted you.

812
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:08,072
Yeah, you did.

813
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:11,675
You got to trust the right people?

814
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:15,346
Right now, that's just you.

815
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:17,014
You hungry?

816
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,215
Famished.

817
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:20,050
But I got to go.

818
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:24,088
Cristina ran off to some
club without telling me.

819
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,590
Why didn't you tell me?

820
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,593
Would've seemed like an excuse.

821
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,228
Now it's done.

822
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,467
See you tomorrow.

823
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:28,752
Are you now or have you ever
been an informant for the FBI?

824
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,621
No.

825
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,430
Did you plant the knife
in Miguel Zepeda's car

826
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:41,999
to keep him away from your daughter?

827
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,367
No.

828
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,371
No.

829
00:41:49,108 --> 00:41:50,341
No.
