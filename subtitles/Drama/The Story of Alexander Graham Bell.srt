1
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,957
Our world is gone now.

2
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,335
Smashed by the wars.

3
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,845
Now I am the keeper of his body...

4
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:58,134
...embalmed here, in the Egyptian ways.

5
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:02,191
I followed him as Pharaoh
and have now ruled 40 years.

6
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,537
Hello, Papa.

7
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,941
I am the victor...

8
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,846
...but what does it all mean, when
there is no one left to remember...

9
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:12,694
...the great cavalry charge at Gaugamela...

10
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:16,206
...or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

11
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:22,041
...when we crossed
a 100,000-man army into India?

12
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:31,089
He was a god, Cadmos...

13
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,778
...or as close as anything I've ever seen.

14
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:37,624
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

15
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:40,405
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

16
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,532
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

17
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,576
It takes strong men to rule.

18
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,970
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

19
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:57,523
Before him, there were tribes...

20
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:01,849
...and after him, all was possible.

21
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:06,650
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

22
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,202
...and be better for all.

23
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:12,120
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built.

24
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:17,304
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

25
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,438
A Hellenic civilization...

26
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:24,633
...open to all.

27
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:31,291
But how can I say it?
How can I tell you what it was like...

28
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:35,798
...to be young, to dream big dreams?

29
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:40,638
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

30
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,588
Anything.

31
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:50,647
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

32
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,047
Truly...

33
00:04:54,625 --> 00:05:00,856
...I've known many great men
in my life, but only one colossus.

34
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,775
And only now, when old,
do I understand...

35
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:08,248
...who this force of nature really was.

36
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,631
Or do I?

37
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:19,256
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

38
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,624
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

39
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:27,392
Men, all men, reach and fall...

40
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,683
...reach and fall.

41
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:41,883
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

42
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,113
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

43
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:51,460
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

44
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:55,998
For 100 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

45
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,298
...with their gold to fight as mercenaries.

46
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:04,604
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

47
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:09,379
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

48
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:13,537
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

49
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:17,348
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

50
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,733
He then turned his eye on Persia...

51
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:24,803
...where it was said
the new Great King Darius himself...

52
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,060
...on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.

53
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:39,395
It was from these loins of war
that Alexander was born, in Pella.

54
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:53,663
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

55
00:06:53,834 --> 00:07:00,065
...and said that Alexander was the
child of Dionysus. Others, Zeus.

56
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:06,152
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

57
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:10,887
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

58
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:17,283
Fortune follows bold ones

59
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,931
Trust the ones who give you love

60
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:31,564
Life has just begun, son

61
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:35,304
Her skin is water.

62
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,673
Her tongue is fire.

63
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:41,131
She is your friend.

64
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,899
Take it.

65
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:54,638
If you hesitate, she will strike.
Remember that.

66
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:57,676
Never hesitate.

67
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,696
Yes.

68
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,631
They are like people.

69
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:13,927
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

70
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,018
...but still, they can turn on you.

71
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:28,583
Don't hurt her.

72
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,694
Good.

73
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,409
Come.

74
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,282
He calls me a barbarian.

75
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:47,153
Philip makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

76
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:17,106
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

77
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,808
My little Achilles.

78
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:14,322
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

79
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:17,658
What is it you want?

80
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,608
Six months. Did you miss me?

81
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:23,284
- No. Not here!
- Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

82
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:26,354
King of what? Sheepherders?

83
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,835
- I am of Achilles' royal blood.
- The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

84
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,844
- You are nothing but a drunken whore.
- Shut your mouth.

85
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,695
You 10-titted bitch from Hades!

86
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,210
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

87
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:47,098
Do you think people respect you?

88
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:50,011
You think they don't know your bastards?

89
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:01,429
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

90
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:04,413
I told you not!
I told you not.

91
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:07,160
- You'll obey me.
- I will not.

92
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,484
You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.

93
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,909
No! No! Stop! Papa!

94
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,189
- Obey me!
- Your Majesty! No!

95
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,621
In the name of the gods.

96
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:31,771
He will never be yours! Never!

97
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:36,410
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

98
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,607
In the world he grew up to...

99
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:53,506
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

100
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,962
You don't need much to fight.

101
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:03,288
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

102
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,354
...courage won't be in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

103
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:11,298
It's in the heart of a man.

104
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,585
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

105
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,051
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

106
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:22,239
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

107
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:27,294
Come on, Alexander. Come on.

108
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,244
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

109
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:36,320
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

110
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:41,247
Good. That's it.

111
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:45,758
Well done, Hephaistion. Good wrestling.
That's what I want.

112
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,388
Come, come, come.

113
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,282
You did well, but you lost.

114
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:54,718
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

115
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,506
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

116
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,635
You're right.

117
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,735
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

118
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:11,680
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

119
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:15,165
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

120
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,817
Although an inferior race...

121
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:23,525
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

122
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,741
But is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

123
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:32,420
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

124
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:38,403
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

125
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:43,045
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

126
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:47,620
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

127
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,530
...and by this route up the Nile...

128
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:57,541
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

129
00:13:58,188 --> 00:14:00,938
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

130
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,036
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

131
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,027
...Greece could rule the world.

132
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:11,683
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

133
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:17,869
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

134
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,082
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

135
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,148
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

136
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,799
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

137
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:33,612
Tales of Amazons? No, Alexander.

138
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:37,387
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

139
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:41,992
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

140
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:48,109
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

141
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:53,423
It is... It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

142
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,370
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

143
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,569
Master?

144
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:03,916
- Master?
- Yes?

145
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:05,358
- Master!
- Out with it!

146
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:08,337
- Why are the Persians so cruel?
- Oh, come on, Nearchus.

147
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,670
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

148
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:15,275
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

149
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:18,160
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

150
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:22,001
Excess in all things is the undoing of men.

151
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,652
That is why we Greeks are superior.

152
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,275
We practice control of our senses.

153
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,713
Moderation, we hope.

154
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,178
And what of Achilles at Troy, master?

155
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,075
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

156
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,066
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

157
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,336
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

158
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:49,203
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

159
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,108
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

160
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,579
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

161
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,427
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

162
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,846
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

163
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:11,180
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

164
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:14,799
...that is pure and excellent.

165
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:18,962
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

166
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:22,903
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

167
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,453
...and lift us from our frog pond.

168
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:34,543
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

169
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:38,969
And growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.

170
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,141
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.

171
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,576
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

172
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:53,649
Not with your leg.

173
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,598
He's been beaten far too often.

174
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,306
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

175
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:04,120
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

176
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,357
For three and a half talents...

177
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,077
...I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you...

178
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:11,895
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

179
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,322
Do I seem so old?

180
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,537
- Stay down, stay down.
- Hold him!

181
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:42,330
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

182
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,756
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

183
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,517
And if you don't?

184
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,128
- I'll pay for him myself.
- With what, your singing voice?

185
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,987
I'll pay you!

186
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,447
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

187
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,102
He can be ridden. By me.

188
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,924
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

189
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,976
...at half the price.

190
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,309
That horse will kill him, Philip.

191
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:15,513
- He'll break the boy in two.
- Will he?

192
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:18,365
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

193
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,452
The boy doesn't have the craft.
He could hurt himself.

194
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:35,328
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

195
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:44,347
You don't like your shadow, do you?

196
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:48,291
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

197
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:52,194
Do you see? That's us.

198
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:55,907
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

199
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,346
He's the god of the sun.

200
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,584
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

201
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,556
Bucephalus.

202
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,517
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

203
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,152
Bucephalus and Alexander.

204
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:46,082
Come now, let's ride together.

205
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,238
He's got some Titan in him yet.

206
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:23,844
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

207
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:31,848
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

208
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,716
My son.

209
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,472
My son!

210
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:20,136
You remember Achilles.

211
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:22,726
- He's my favorite.
- Why?

212
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:26,573
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

213
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:28,493
And his fate?

214
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,756
That he must die young
but with great glory.

215
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:33,514
Did he have a choice?

216
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:37,937
Yes. He could live a long life,
but there would be no glory.

217
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:42,124
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

218
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,414
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

219
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,521
One day, I'll be on walls like these.

220
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:58,953
Prometheus stole the secret
of fire and gave it to man.

221
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:01,807
It made Zeus so angry...

222
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:04,906
...he chained Prometheus to a rock
in the Great Caucasus...

223
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:09,233
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

224
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:13,739
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

225
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,119
Miserable fate.

226
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,098
Why?

227
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:24,755
Who knows these things?

228
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,859
Anyway...

229
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:36,364
Oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out he'd murdered his father...

230
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:42,357
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

231
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:46,316
Medea, she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance...

232
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:49,204
...when Jason left her for a younger wife.

233
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:01,523
My mother would never hurt me.

234
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:05,262
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

235
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:12,047
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

236
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:21,235
Herakles. Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

237
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,908
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

238
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:28,722
Poor Herakles.

239
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,836
Great Herakles.

240
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:35,319
All greatness comes from loss.

241
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:41,430
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

242
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:43,384
When I'm king like you, Father?

243
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,192
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

244
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:52,179
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

245
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,804
When I killed my first man, he said:

246
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,111
"Now you know."

247
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:01,588
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

248
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,994
A king isn't born, Alexander.

249
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:08,052
He's made by steel and by suffering.

250
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,049
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

251
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,004
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

252
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,511
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

253
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:29,945
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

254
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:36,342
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

255
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:40,791
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

256
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,141
They make of us slaves.

257
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:13,981
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

258
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:18,300
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

259
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:21,151
...and when her first son is born...

260
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:26,433
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

261
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:28,963
...with himself as regent.

262
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:31,034
And you...

263
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,067
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

264
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:37,692
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

265
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:43,099
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

266
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:46,979
And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

267
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:51,036
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

268
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:55,746
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

269
00:25:55,911 --> 00:26:00,483
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

270
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,261
The only way is to strike.

271
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:07,074
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

272
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:11,748
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

273
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:15,173
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

274
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:17,343
There is still Kynnane.

275
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:22,791
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

276
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:25,669
Say nothing more of my father.

277
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:28,647
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

278
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:31,139
You're right.

279
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:34,081
Forgive me.

280
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,967
A mother loves too much.

281
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:45,442
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

282
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:55,136
I wish... I wish we could spend
more time together.

283
00:26:55,851 --> 00:27:00,128
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

284
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,234
There's never been time, Mother.

285
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:12,779
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

286
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,018
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

287
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,556
...cursed by your greatness.

288
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,892
Take my strength.

289
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:38,597
You must never confuse your feelings
with your duties, Alexander.

290
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:44,390
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

291
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,854
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

292
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:52,522
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

293
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:55,983
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

294
00:27:56,144 --> 00:28:00,170
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

295
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:06,283
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

296
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,758
...not who.

297
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:12,518
Loves? Loves?

298
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,905
In the name of Dionysus...

299
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:23,693
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

300
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:27,753
Your life hangs in the balance.

301
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:32,657
- His spies are inside your closest circle.
- Stop!

302
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:37,585
I'm his only worthy son.

303
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,570
You crazed woman.

304
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,570
He'd never hurt me.

305
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:48,207
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

306
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:51,634
Yes, and you would be 40.

307
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:57,940
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

308
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:04,211
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

309
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:07,692
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

310
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:10,220
Never.

311
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:29,843
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

312
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:32,310
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

313
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:39,662
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

314
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:42,965
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

315
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:47,951
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

316
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,739
Pausanias, you bore me.
Be gone with you.

317
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,945
Alexander, I found you the right girl.

318
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:55,568
- What's your name, darling?
- Antigone.

319
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,625
- What's your name?
- Antigone.

320
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:01,558
I love you, my little imp.

321
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,375
And I love you, Cleitus.

322
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:06,962
- Please, no!
- There you go.

323
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,742
Would you prefer a seat, Cleitus?

324
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,729
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

325
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:16,120
While alive, I prefer dancing.

326
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,745
Pausanias.

327
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,148
Who's your new friend?

328
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:22,869
- There's your new friend.
- Please don't!

329
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,427
A toast.

330
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:27,865
A toast!

331
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:33,810
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

332
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:39,645
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

333
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:48,244
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

334
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,261
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

335
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:58,419
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

336
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:01,493
...a Macedonian queen we can be proud of!

337
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:07,547
To Philip and Eurydice...

338
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:10,711
...and to their legitimate sons!

339
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:13,947
Alexander, don't!

340
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,959
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

341
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:31,480
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

342
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:33,504
Shut up, all of you!

343
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,376
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

344
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,455
Insolent pup.

345
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,724
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

346
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,152
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

347
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:48,381
- And I dishonor you?
- You listen like your mother.

348
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:50,652
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

349
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,339
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

350
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:56,573
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

351
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:59,609
- You insult me!
- I insult you!

352
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,747
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

353
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:05,698
- You dog, questioning your queen.
- Shame?

354
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,537
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

355
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,377
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

356
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,962
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

357
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,988
Why, drunken man, must you think...

358
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:20,538
...everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

359
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:23,524
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

360
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:25,791
...and I see her in your eyes.

361
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,292
You covet this throne too much.

362
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,756
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

363
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,122
Well, you can both dream, boy.

364
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:40,286
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.

365
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:41,949
Now!

366
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,901
I command you.

367
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,028
Apologize to your kinsman.

368
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,018
Apologize.

369
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,640
No kinsman to me.

370
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,928
Good night, old man.

371
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:11,615
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

372
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,024
You bastard!

373
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,187
You'll obey me. Come here.

374
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:43,268
And this is the man who is going
to take you from Greece to Persia?

375
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,857
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

376
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:49,923
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

377
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,836
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

378
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,838
You're no son of mine!

379
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,700
Everything suddenly changed for him.

380
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:11,916
His father, King Philip, was murdered.

381
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,045
And Alexander, at 20...

382
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:20,004
...became the new ruler of Macedonia.

383
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:25,226
And breaking their treaties with us,
dismissing Alexander as an untried boy...

384
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:29,548
...several Greek city-states
rose up in revolt...

385
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:35,047
...much to Persia's delight
and perhaps sponsored by their gold.

386
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:42,191
Truly, Alexander could love like no other.

387
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:46,892
But to betray him was to rouse
a vast and frightening anger.

388
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:50,854
And he massacred several thousand
men of that tragic city, Thebes...

389
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:54,222
...and sold the survivors into slavery.

390
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:58,478
This, as intended,
stunned and defeated the Greeks.

391
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:03,279
And though, in the end, he treated
most populations with magnanimity...

392
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:05,297
...it is these exceptions...

393
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:10,893
...Thebes, Gaza in Syria and, later,
Persepolis in Persia and others...

394
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:16,329
...that are always remembered by those
who hate Alexander and all he stood for.

395
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:23,144
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia
with an army of 40,000 trained men.

396
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:26,578
And liberating one city-state
after the other...

397
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,603
...he conquered all of western Asia
south to Egypt...

398
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:36,469
...where he was declared Pharaoh
of Egypt, worshipped as a god.

399
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:43,789
It was in Egypt that the
respected oracle at Siwah...

400
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:46,478
...declared him the...

401
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,941
...true son of Zeus.

402
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:55,057
He finally provoked
Darius himself to battle...

403
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:59,281
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

404
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,286
It was mad.

405
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:11,955
Forty thousand of us
against 250,000 barbarians.

406
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:18,680
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

407
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:25,459
Alexander, son of a god.

408
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:28,047
It was a myth, of course.

409
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:30,999
At least it started as a myth.

410
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:33,201
I know.

411
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:35,573
I was there.

412
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,014
I saw his eyes.

413
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:38,967
There.

414
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,992
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

415
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:44,916
Kill Darius?

416
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:48,116
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

417
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:51,255
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

418
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,997
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

419
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:56,625
Here.

420
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:59,349
Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian Army.

421
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:02,680
This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.

422
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:04,916
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

423
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:09,208
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

424
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:13,650
...with your son Philotas,
for just one, two hours tomorrow.

425
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:19,578
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

426
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,498
Perdiccas.

427
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:23,702
Leonnatus.

428
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,725
Nearchus.

429
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:27,602
Polyperchon.

430
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:31,735
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas here, in the center...

431
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:34,750
...their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

432
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,179
And when bold Cassander breaks...

433
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:40,212
...stretching their left, a hole will open.

434
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,910
Then I and my cavalry...

435
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,709
...our revered Cleitus,
Ptolemy and Hephaistion...

436
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,814
...will strike through that gap...

437
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,146
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

438
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,956
Alexander, even with luck, timing,
the gods, we must rout them tomorrow.

439
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,779
Destroy their army completely.

440
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,360
Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.

441
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,569
Right.

442
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:06,973
You speak of home.

443
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:09,080
And retreat.

444
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:12,828
But do you understand, Parmenion...

445
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:15,482
...Babylon's my new home?

446
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,387
Alexander...

447
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,561
...if we must fight...

448
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,105
...do so with stealth.

449
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:28,056
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

450
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:33,213
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

451
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:36,379
No, you are too honorable for that.

452
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:41,567
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

453
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:45,115
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

454
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,127
The lands west
of the Euphrates, Alexander...

455
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,449
...the hand of his daughter in marriage.
When has a Greek been given such honors?

456
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:56,388
These are not honors.
Parmenion, they're bribes...

457
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:59,778
...which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

458
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:03,997
Do you forget the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley?

459
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:08,868
Alexander, we're still not sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

460
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,925
- That is no matter!
- Parmenion, you know that's not true.

461
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:17,563
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

462
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,517
Now I urge you, regroup.

463
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,679
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

464
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:27,972
I would, if I were Parmenion.

465
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:30,528
But I am Alexander.

466
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,525
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

467
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:36,607
These are my terms.

468
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:41,185
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

469
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:44,515
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

470
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:50,119
And when he bows down to Greece...

471
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:52,932
...Alexander will be merciful.

472
00:39:57,386 --> 00:40:00,998
By Ares' chains, he's got balls, men.

473
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:03,879
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

474
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,478
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

475
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:23,381
To whom do you pray?

476
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,689
Phobos.

477
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,402
Fear?

478
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,051
A bad omen.

479
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,297
More so for Darius.

480
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:52,023
I've come to believe that fear
of death drives all men, Hephaistion.

481
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:55,091
This we didn't learn as schoolboys.

482
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:59,091
It is the cause of all our misfortunes.

483
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:02,644
- So, mighty Crateros.
- Your Majesty.

484
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:07,581
- Are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?
- It's been too long coming.

485
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:11,604
- The men are skittish as colts.
- Good.

486
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:14,011
Fear makes men fight better.

487
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:17,054
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

488
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:21,306
Don't worry, general. I'm known to sleep
with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

489
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:25,049
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

490
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,951
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

491
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,877
The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
You'll stain the ground with Persian blood.

492
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,018
I've always believed, Alexander.

493
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:41,014
But this seems so much bigger than us.

494
00:41:41,185 --> 00:41:45,462
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when
they stood side by side at the siege of Troy?

495
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,481
Patroclus died first.

496
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,235
If you do...

497
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:55,361
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

498
00:41:55,522 --> 00:41:58,107
...I will avenge you...

499
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,925
...and follow you down
to the house of death.

500
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,545
I would do the same.

501
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:17,182
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

502
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,195
Then perhaps...

503
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,938
Perhaps this is farewell...

504
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:30,753
...my Alexander.

505
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,535
Fear not, Hephaistion.

506
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:37,018
We are at the beginning.

507
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:13,409
Blood makes the world rise.

508
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:17,822
Blood makes the rain fall.

509
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:24,263
Blood makes the earth grow.

510
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:31,424
And in blood, all men are born and die.

511
00:43:33,097 --> 00:43:38,597
Blood is the food of the gods below.

512
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:55,589
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

513
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:02,114
Company, group! Regroup!

514
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:15,908
Phalanx, turn right!

515
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,777
Phalanx, attention!

516
00:44:57,296 --> 00:44:59,850
Neoptolemus.

517
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:02,951
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tire.

518
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:06,285
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

519
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,060
Dexippos, by Athena.

520
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:18,220
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

521
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:20,907
Will you match it with your spear?

522
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:30,385
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

523
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:35,087
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

524
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:38,700
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

525
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:41,682
You fight for them today.

526
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,876
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

527
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:53,584
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

528
00:45:53,909 --> 00:46:00,107
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army...

529
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,012
But ask yourselves, who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

530
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:35,598
...to murder my father, our king...

531
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:40,405
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

532
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,620
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

533
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:50,063
Who is this king but a king of air?

534
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:53,332
These men do not fight for their homes.

535
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:56,847
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

536
00:46:57,435 --> 00:47:00,817
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

537
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:03,921
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

538
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:08,151
But we are not here today as slaves.

539
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:10,355
We are here today...

540
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:14,135
...as Macedonian freemen!

541
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:29,849
Some of you...

542
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,754
...perhaps myself...

543
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:38,555
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

544
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:41,461
But I say to you...

545
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,372
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

546
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,836
Conquer your fear...

547
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:51,315
...and I promise you,
you will conquer death.

548
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:16,987
When they ask why you fought
so bravely, you will answer:

549
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:19,935
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

550
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:24,287
...for the freedom...

551
00:48:25,377 --> 00:48:28,345
...and glory...

552
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:32,575
...of Greece!"

553
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,403
Zeus be with us!

554
00:49:07,268 --> 00:49:10,717
Cassander! Four columns, go!

555
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:17,819
Where does he go?

556
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,226
I don't know, Majesty.

557
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,172
Envelop him, Bessus.

558
00:49:26,694 --> 00:49:29,662
Hephaistion, go!

559
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:40,448
Phalanx!

560
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:01,349
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

561
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:05,855
Yes, great king.

562
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:07,909
Be brave, men.

563
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:10,789
Steady on the left, lads!

564
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,548
Bend if you must, but never break.

565
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:16,806
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

566
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:47,657
Pick up the pace!

567
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,620
Prepare to repel chariots!

568
00:53:22,457 --> 00:53:24,432
Cassander!

569
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,837
Forward, men!

570
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:41,270
- Left turn!
- Infantry, clear! Out now!

571
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:29,176
Hold your positions!

572
00:54:29,342 --> 00:54:32,026
Hold your positions!

573
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,807
We must fall back to the gully, Father.

574
00:54:50,976 --> 00:54:52,405
No, hold.

575
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:56,318
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

576
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,782
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

577
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:19,961
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

578
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,735
- Shields, break off!
- Break off.

579
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,136
The shields are here!

580
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,497
Drive for the hole!

581
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:37,914
- Drive for the hole!
- Drive for the hole!

582
00:56:19,303 --> 00:56:22,533
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

583
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:27,357
- Philotas! Philotas!
- Father.

584
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:29,502
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

585
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:35,368
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

586
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:55,777
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

587
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,278
Darius!

588
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:40,421
Find your horses.

589
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:57,901
Darius!

590
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:20,591
Go! Go!

591
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:39,657
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

592
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:42,729
Provision the horses.

593
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:46,696
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

594
00:58:46,867 --> 00:58:49,770
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

595
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:51,979
Parmenion's crumbling.

596
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:56,425
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

597
00:58:56,596 --> 00:58:59,912
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

598
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:11,054
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

599
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:14,091
...but you'll never run far enough!

600
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:16,847
To Parmenion!

601
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,934
You bleed free, my lord.

602
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:41,333
- May I tend to your wound?
- No, Hermolaus, not now.

603
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:43,635
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

604
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,523
Help them.

605
01:00:11,994 --> 01:00:15,125
- Your Majesty.
- You're very brave.

606
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,814
What shall I call you?

607
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:20,729
- Glaukos, my king.
- Glaukos.

608
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:25,466
- And where's your home?
- Illyria.

609
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:29,044
Let your body go loose.

610
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:32,372
Think of home now.

611
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,907
Be brave again, Glaukos...

612
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:38,705
...and you will live on in glory.

613
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:41,593
Alexander.

614
01:00:50,941 --> 01:00:55,032
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

615
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:57,303
...was destroyed.

616
01:01:04,446 --> 01:01:10,142
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

617
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,577
Alexander once said to me:

618
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:28,381
"We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

619
01:01:29,216 --> 01:01:30,907
Phalanx!

620
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:39,008
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

621
01:01:39,169 --> 01:01:42,966
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

622
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:46,203
At this one glorious moment in time...

623
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,395
...Alexander was loved by all.

624
01:01:52,706 --> 01:01:57,081
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

625
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,934
...than she was to leave.

626
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:52,317
Sikander! Sikander!

627
01:03:18,537 --> 01:03:23,239
Imagine the minds that conceived this.
With architects and engineers like these...

628
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:25,736
...we could build cities
as we've only dreamed.

629
01:03:25,898 --> 01:03:30,502
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

630
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:36,067
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

631
01:03:36,234 --> 01:03:38,722
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

632
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:42,375
Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.

633
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,976
Not for the men who fought, I trust.

634
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:52,133
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

635
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:53,892
Now you sound like Philip.

636
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:56,615
Philip never saw Babylon.

637
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,170
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

638
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,853
- Hello!
- Hello!

639
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:06,411
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

640
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:08,995
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

641
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:12,547
...your father would be very proud of you.

642
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:15,908
Thank you, Parmenion.

643
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:21,029
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

644
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:23,303
They, too, blind me.

645
01:04:27,855 --> 01:04:31,368
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders...

646
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:34,405
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

647
01:04:34,575 --> 01:04:37,892
Not if you keep giving it all away.

648
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,855
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

649
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:45,963
You overvalue us.

650
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:49,641
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

651
01:04:49,808 --> 01:04:52,045
...and I but the king of air.

652
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:57,065
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

653
01:04:57,233 --> 01:05:00,495
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

654
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:03,853
Only when he's found will it be decided.

655
01:05:05,457 --> 01:05:07,530
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

656
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:10,513
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

657
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:12,430
We must hunt Darius down to.

658
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:15,910
- That was not your father's mission.
- And I am not my father.

659
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,906
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

660
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:22,667
Fortune favors the bold.

661
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:27,826
By the gods, what is this?

662
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:30,857
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

663
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,475
I venture one for every night of the year.

664
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,553
Help me, Aphrodite.

665
01:06:01,718 --> 01:06:03,987
How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?

666
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:08,885
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

667
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,672
Apologies.

668
01:06:49,082 --> 01:06:51,221
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

669
01:06:52,602 --> 01:06:56,858
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

670
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:16,627
Great King Alexander.

671
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:21,333
The princess of the thousand roses...

672
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,599
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

673
01:07:25,725 --> 01:07:27,700
...Stateira.

674
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:29,942
Noble Alexander...

675
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:39,669
...I come to beg for the lives...

676
01:07:40,094 --> 01:07:41,621
...of my sisters...

677
01:07:42,622 --> 01:07:45,404
...my mother, my grandmother.

678
01:07:49,823 --> 01:07:53,752
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

679
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:55,959
He, too, is Alexander.

680
01:07:59,616 --> 01:08:00,793
Please.

681
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:05,240
I plead for my family's lives.

682
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:09,495
- Sell me as a slave, great king, but...
- Look now...

683
01:08:09,664 --> 01:08:11,704
...in my eyes...

684
01:08:12,865 --> 01:08:14,043
...princess...

685
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:17,528
...and tell me...

686
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:20,152
...how would you like to be treated?

687
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:24,537
As I am...

688
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:26,680
...a princess.

689
01:08:29,762 --> 01:08:31,485
Then so be it.

690
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:36,056
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

691
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:41,660
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

692
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,564
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

693
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:49,530
No.

694
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:53,435
Everything I wish...

695
01:08:53,603 --> 01:08:55,294
...I have...

696
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:58,464
Requested.

697
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:00,636
Requested.

698
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:04,609
You truly are...

699
01:09:04,772 --> 01:09:06,016
...a queen.

700
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:15,328
Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...

701
01:09:15,974 --> 01:09:17,763
...but you do nothing.

702
01:09:17,926 --> 01:09:21,374
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

703
01:09:21,543 --> 01:09:25,220
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

704
01:09:25,383 --> 01:09:28,961
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

705
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:31,548
I must watch him grow stronger.

706
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:41,468
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

707
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,542
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

708
01:09:44,968 --> 01:09:46,146
They are like snakes...

709
01:09:47,176 --> 01:09:48,518
...and can be turned.

710
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,240
General Crateros.

711
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:56,546
Cassander is Antipater's son.

712
01:09:56,712 --> 01:10:00,160
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

713
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,232
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

714
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:05,540
But beware of men who think too much.

715
01:10:05,898 --> 01:10:08,265
They blind themselves.

716
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:13,474
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.

717
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:17,059
But all of them you make rich...

718
01:10:17,227 --> 01:10:22,792
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.

719
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:26,880
Why won't you ever believe me?

720
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:32,486
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

721
01:10:32,652 --> 01:10:35,107
For they are dark, Alexander.

722
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:37,578
So dark.

723
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:39,148
But in you...

724
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:43,979
...the son of Zeus,
lies the light of the world.

725
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:48,003
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

726
01:10:48,173 --> 01:10:52,363
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

727
01:10:52,525 --> 01:10:56,748
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

728
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,292
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

729
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:03,277
Alexander the Great.

730
01:11:04,078 --> 01:11:07,461
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

731
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,697
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

732
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:14,954
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

733
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:19,879
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

734
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:21,957
Bring her, Alexander.

735
01:11:22,128 --> 01:11:25,128
- It'll give her such joy.
- Joy?

736
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:29,004
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

737
01:11:31,568 --> 01:11:34,121
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

738
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:42,119
I'll take my own bath.

739
01:11:43,058 --> 01:11:44,584
Thank you, Bagoas.

740
01:12:00,595 --> 01:12:04,457
The generals question your obsession
with Darius.

741
01:12:04,627 --> 01:12:07,661
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

742
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:09,289
Naturally.

743
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:13,616
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

744
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,944
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

745
01:12:17,108 --> 01:12:19,148
These people want...

746
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:22,129
Need change.

747
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,453
Aristotle was wrong about them.

748
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,444
How so?

749
01:12:27,605 --> 01:12:29,427
Look at those we've conquered.

750
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:31,531
They leave their dead unburied.

751
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:34,549
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

752
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,619
They mate in public.

753
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:41,460
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

754
01:12:41,622 --> 01:12:46,063
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

755
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:49,166
They can soldier or work in the cities.

756
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:53,361
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

757
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:56,662
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

758
01:12:56,823 --> 01:12:58,001
...and the people.

759
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:03,569
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

760
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:07,248
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

761
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:12,467
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

762
01:13:13,465 --> 01:13:16,564
To free the people of the world...

763
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:21,137
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

764
01:13:21,306 --> 01:13:23,826
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

765
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:27,154
...who was always a friend to man.

766
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:29,592
Remember the fates of these heroes.

767
01:13:29,754 --> 01:13:33,780
- They suffered greatly.
- We all suffer.

768
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:37,617
Your father, mine.

769
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:40,369
They all came to the end of their time.

770
01:13:40,539 --> 01:13:44,434
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

771
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:50,296
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

772
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:52,561
Are there no other forces?

773
01:13:53,564 --> 01:13:56,411
Is there not love in your life...

774
01:13:57,692 --> 01:13:59,601
...Alexander?

775
01:14:06,205 --> 01:14:11,257
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

776
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:16,408
So many years,
so many miles between you.

777
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:19,635
What is it you fear?

778
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:23,258
Who knows these things?

779
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:29,687
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

780
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,712
Which am I, Hephaistion?

781
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,920
Weak or divine?

782
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:41,406
All I know is...

783
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:44,502
...I trust only you in this world.

784
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:46,680
I've missed you.

785
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:48,605
I need you.

786
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,189
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

787
01:14:54,305 --> 01:14:56,377
No other.

788
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,929
You still hold your head cocked.

789
01:15:05,122 --> 01:15:06,780
- Like that.
- I've stopped that.

790
01:15:06,946 --> 01:15:08,768
Like a deer, listening in the wind.

791
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:11,680
You strike me still, Alexander.

792
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:15,578
And you have eyes like no other.

793
01:15:16,963 --> 01:15:20,957
I sound as stupid as a schoolboy, but...

794
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:26,370
...you're everything I care for...

795
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:30,044
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

796
01:15:30,532 --> 01:15:33,565
...I'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

797
01:15:33,732 --> 01:15:36,253
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

798
01:15:36,868 --> 01:15:40,000
I'll be with you always.

799
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,435
Till the end.

800
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,823
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

801
01:15:57,990 --> 01:16:03,009
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

802
01:16:05,415 --> 01:16:11,198
We chased Darius towards Bactria
but missed taking him by hours.

803
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:16,196
He was dying when we found him, sire.

804
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,181
He asked for water.

805
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:20,613
He drank and died.

806
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:31,523
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

807
01:16:58,442 --> 01:17:00,352
Fully honoring his corpse...

808
01:17:00,523 --> 01:17:05,641
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

809
01:17:06,156 --> 01:17:10,793
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

810
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:18,985
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

811
01:17:19,693 --> 01:17:22,824
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

812
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:28,205
The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

813
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:31,878
In fact, we were totally lost.

814
01:17:32,878 --> 01:17:35,780
Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...

815
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:41,100
...and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.

816
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:44,997
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

817
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:49,390
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...

818
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:53,326
...until the day he received the head
of his last enemy in surrender.

819
01:17:57,871 --> 01:18:02,312
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

820
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,663
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

821
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:15,367
It was here that Alexander made
one of his most mysterious decisions.

822
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:51,291
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

823
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,171
Perhaps too much.

824
01:19:56,445 --> 01:19:58,834
In the ways of my country...

825
01:19:59,006 --> 01:20:03,513
...those who love too much
lose everything...

826
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:06,645
...and those who love with irony...

827
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:09,309
...last.

828
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:25,623
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this, a hill chief's daughter.

829
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:27,996
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

830
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,743
But what's the point, Alexander?
Just take her as your concubine.

831
01:20:31,905 --> 01:20:34,622
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

832
01:20:34,785 --> 01:20:39,258
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

833
01:20:39,425 --> 01:20:43,255
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive, is a sign of deep respect.

834
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:45,498
It will bring us together, unify us.

835
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:48,032
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

836
01:20:48,193 --> 01:20:52,536
- As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.
- Alexander!

837
01:20:52,994 --> 01:20:55,547
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

838
01:20:55,714 --> 01:20:57,885
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

839
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:01,433
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

840
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:05,051
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

841
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:08,961
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

842
01:21:09,123 --> 01:21:11,098
For what? To build roads in Asia?

843
01:21:11,268 --> 01:21:13,340
To give these people cities?

844
01:21:13,507 --> 01:21:16,769
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

845
01:21:16,932 --> 01:21:19,234
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It's far richer!

846
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:21,535
- Look what you give them.
- With respect...

847
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,377
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling...

848
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,737
- How dare you, Nearchus?!
- General Nearchus to you, boy.

849
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:32,250
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

850
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,658
...or any of you could've done!
- Philotas!

851
01:21:40,358 --> 01:21:42,878
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

852
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:46,395
I supported you at your father's death.

853
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:49,349
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

854
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:52,358
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

855
01:21:52,518 --> 01:21:54,526
...give us a Macedonian heir.

856
01:21:54,695 --> 01:21:56,320
A Macedonian heir.

857
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,382
- You've been heard clearly.
- But...

858
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:09,887
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

859
01:22:10,056 --> 01:22:14,977
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

860
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:17,440
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

861
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:21,384
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

862
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:24,262
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

863
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:27,775
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

864
01:22:27,945 --> 01:22:31,393
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

865
01:22:31,562 --> 01:22:36,451
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

866
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:39,204
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

867
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:42,567
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

868
01:22:42,731 --> 01:22:43,975
Old man...

869
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:46,692
...we're in new worlds.

870
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,917
Alexander, be reasonable!

871
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,418
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

872
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,369
Share our rewards?

873
01:22:55,532 --> 01:22:57,572
You remember what Aristotle said.

874
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,017
An Asian?

875
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,792
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

876
01:23:02,956 --> 01:23:04,964
- Aristotle be damned!
- Alexander!

877
01:23:05,132 --> 01:23:06,561
By Zeus and all the gods...

878
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:10,694
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

879
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:16,077
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

880
01:23:16,461 --> 01:23:18,218
Alexander.

881
01:23:20,782 --> 01:23:25,289
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

882
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:30,824
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

883
01:23:45,456 --> 01:23:49,711
And so 10 years after his mother's
insistence he marry a Macedonian...

884
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:51,596
Through our union...

885
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,997
...Greek and barbarian...

886
01:23:54,161 --> 01:24:00,009
...the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

887
01:24:00,177 --> 01:24:01,606
Why?

888
01:24:07,954 --> 01:24:11,434
Some say it was for alliance
with the tribes.

889
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:15,311
Others, the desire for a successor.

890
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:22,704
And yet others said Alexander
truly fell in love.

891
01:24:23,603 --> 01:24:25,458
Who Roxane really was...

892
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:31,599
...I doubt any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.

893
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:35,283
Alexander...

894
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:39,404
...special for you.

895
01:24:42,741 --> 01:24:45,359
On this glorious occasion...

896
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:49,684
...I toast this great army
that has given so much.

897
01:24:49,845 --> 01:24:53,774
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

898
01:24:53,941 --> 01:24:59,921
...I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

899
01:25:00,246 --> 01:25:01,456
Praise Alexander!

900
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,374
And in honor of my bride...

901
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:10,828
...my beautiful bride...

902
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:15,374
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

903
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,892
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

904
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:25,363
And what about our boys?

905
01:25:25,528 --> 01:25:26,957
And lastly...

906
01:25:27,128 --> 01:25:30,259
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

907
01:25:30,424 --> 01:25:33,621
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

908
01:25:33,784 --> 01:25:38,192
...and military training
under our protection...

909
01:25:38,361 --> 01:25:42,420
...so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

910
01:25:42,585 --> 01:25:44,952
...in Asia.

911
01:26:22,908 --> 01:26:24,435
I found it in Egypt.

912
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:29,266
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

913
01:26:29,437 --> 01:26:33,627
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

914
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:40,857
I'll always think of you...

915
01:26:41,598 --> 01:26:43,834
...as the sun, Alexander.

916
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:47,992
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

917
01:26:56,351 --> 01:26:58,685
I wish you a son.

918
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:02,430
You're a great man.

919
01:27:06,592 --> 01:27:09,724
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep...

920
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:27,104
You...

921
01:27:27,266 --> 01:27:28,892
...love him?

922
01:27:37,411 --> 01:27:40,313
He is Hephaistion.

923
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:56,825
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

924
01:27:57,348 --> 01:27:59,323
Come.

925
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,432
No.

926
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:16,124
No, no.

927
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:06,274
You have no fear.

928
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:09,381
It's fitting.

929
01:29:10,602 --> 01:29:13,952
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

930
01:29:14,122 --> 01:29:16,010
...and finds her.

931
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,408
The myth becomes real.

932
01:29:44,972 --> 01:29:46,663
Great man?

933
01:29:46,829 --> 01:29:48,771
Sikander.

934
01:29:48,941 --> 01:29:50,665
You, I kill now.

935
01:29:56,014 --> 01:29:57,574
Do it.

936
01:29:57,998 --> 01:30:00,584
End it. I would do...

937
01:30:01,006 --> 01:30:03,079
I would do the same.

938
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,503
I'll die a fool for this...

939
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:08,616
...love.

940
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,785
My life is now yours.

941
01:31:19,444 --> 01:31:23,057
You will have my son.

942
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:02,672
Who is this woman you call
your queen, Alexander?

943
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,207
A hill girl?

944
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,789
You, with your breeding.

945
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,914
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

946
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:18,231
Do not confuse us.

947
01:32:18,393 --> 01:32:22,103
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

948
01:32:22,266 --> 01:32:24,917
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

949
01:32:25,594 --> 01:32:28,496
Zeus is your father.

950
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:33,807
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

951
01:32:33,978 --> 01:32:35,637
...but hear me when I tell you...

952
01:32:35,803 --> 01:32:37,942
...act and act soon.

953
01:32:38,107 --> 01:32:40,016
After seven years, people wonder:

954
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:42,391
"Who is this King Alexander?"

955
01:32:42,555 --> 01:32:48,120
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

956
01:32:48,284 --> 01:32:51,251
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

957
01:32:52,028 --> 01:32:54,068
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

958
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,658
But do not chase your dream...

959
01:32:56,829 --> 01:32:58,803
...further east.

960
01:32:58,972 --> 01:33:02,617
Your life and mine depend on it.

961
01:33:03,452 --> 01:33:05,078
Remember...

962
01:33:05,245 --> 01:33:08,791
...my only thoughts are of you.

963
01:33:08,957 --> 01:33:13,081
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

964
01:33:13,246 --> 01:33:15,253
Think kindly of your mother.

965
01:33:15,422 --> 01:33:16,916
Provide for me.

966
01:33:17,086 --> 01:33:20,534
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

967
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:24,439
And remember always...

968
01:33:24,606 --> 01:33:28,022
...it is I who love you more than any.

969
01:33:34,047 --> 01:33:37,146
If only you were not a pale reflection...

970
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:38,740
...of my mother's heart.

971
01:34:16,611 --> 01:34:18,466
Who did this?

972
01:34:19,747 --> 01:34:21,635
- Tell me.
- Hermolaus!

973
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:27,104
Never will you find a man
as devoted as I. Yes.

974
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:31,523
The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander...

975
01:34:31,683 --> 01:34:34,334
...not only because it involved
the young pages...

976
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,289
...who'd shared his dream...

977
01:34:36,452 --> 01:34:39,965
...but, more intimately,
it implicated Philotas...

978
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:45,730
...his companion from boyhood, who was
captain of Alexander's royal guards.

979
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:47,137
Alexander.

980
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:50,076
Remember me for who I am.

981
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:53,952
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

982
01:34:54,117 --> 01:34:58,144
It appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition.

983
01:34:58,309 --> 01:34:59,487
No.

984
01:34:59,654 --> 01:35:02,076
- None of us defended Philotas.
- I didn't do this!

985
01:35:02,246 --> 01:35:04,548
Then again, none of us ever liked him.

986
01:35:05,063 --> 01:35:09,471
And, of course, his power
was carved up by the rest of us.

987
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:22,754
Before he died, we tortured him to find out
what his father, Parmenion, knew.

988
01:35:22,919 --> 01:35:24,992
But this we never learned.

989
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:29,088
What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supply lines...

990
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:31,395
...was a far more delicate matter.

991
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,237
Was he innocent in this,
or had he decided to act...

992
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,183
...before age further withered his power?

993
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,815
They'll be divided.

994
01:35:39,977 --> 01:35:43,327
- The men will follow their king.
- Alexander won't be there.

995
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,344
Necessity required Alexander to act.

996
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:47,913
The infantry will follow me.

997
01:35:48,074 --> 01:35:52,809
And he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

998
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:57,737
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

999
01:35:57,898 --> 01:35:59,687
And go quickly.

1000
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:07,336
Three days' hard riding sent Antigonus
and Cleitus to Parmenion.

1001
01:36:10,123 --> 01:36:13,473
His soldiers accepted the finding
of guilt against Parmenion...

1002
01:36:13,644 --> 01:36:18,566
...as they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all.

1003
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:49,930
Cleitus. Antigonus.

1004
01:36:50,095 --> 01:36:51,655
Parmenion.

1005
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,359
I remember a remark of Bagoas' once...

1006
01:37:57,524 --> 01:38:01,354
...that love eluded Alexander as much,
if not more...

1007
01:38:01,525 --> 01:38:03,664
...than finding the end of the world.

1008
01:38:10,037 --> 01:38:13,966
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...

1009
01:38:14,134 --> 01:38:17,068
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

1010
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,500
...into the unknown.

1011
01:38:20,726 --> 01:38:25,331
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

1012
01:38:25,494 --> 01:38:27,317
We were now a mobile empire...

1013
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:31,189
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

1014
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:34,133
Cooks and architects,
doctors and surveyors...

1015
01:38:34,295 --> 01:38:35,702
...moneylenders and wives...

1016
01:38:35,863 --> 01:38:38,613
...children, lovers, whores.

1017
01:38:38,775 --> 01:38:40,269
And forget not the slaves...

1018
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:45,109
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

1019
01:38:45,272 --> 01:38:48,949
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

1020
01:38:49,784 --> 01:38:54,192
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

1021
01:38:56,152 --> 01:38:58,193
Although devoted to Roxane...

1022
01:38:58,361 --> 01:39:01,111
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

1023
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:06,287
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

1024
01:39:07,194 --> 01:39:10,161
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

1025
01:39:12,698 --> 01:39:16,146
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

1026
01:39:16,314 --> 01:39:18,551
In one of those caves.

1027
01:39:19,354 --> 01:39:21,973
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

1028
01:39:22,267 --> 01:39:26,872
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

1029
01:39:29,403 --> 01:39:32,720
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

1030
01:39:33,564 --> 01:39:35,091
Yes, I do.

1031
01:39:35,932 --> 01:39:37,939
That when we reach these heights...

1032
01:39:38,108 --> 01:39:41,174
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

1033
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,861
...and the outer ocean to the east.

1034
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:52,563
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

1035
01:39:52,734 --> 01:39:54,806
A world of Titans.

1036
01:39:54,973 --> 01:39:58,803
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

1037
01:39:58,974 --> 01:40:01,113
There is no way across.

1038
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,656
Except to the south, into India.

1039
01:40:06,046 --> 01:40:08,981
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

1040
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:11,416
We will, Alexander.

1041
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:14,136
In a few years' time, we will return.

1042
01:40:14,303 --> 01:40:17,948
But first, the men must see their homes.

1043
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,302
Have you found your home...

1044
01:40:21,472 --> 01:40:23,097
...Ptolemy?

1045
01:40:27,553 --> 01:40:30,651
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

1046
01:40:32,672 --> 01:40:34,745
Well, at least it's hot.

1047
01:40:35,713 --> 01:40:37,371
And Thais...

1048
01:40:38,209 --> 01:40:40,184
...she loved it there.

1049
01:40:41,889 --> 01:40:44,061
Women bring men home.

1050
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:49,824
- I have no such feeling.
- You have Babylon, Alexander.

1051
01:40:49,986 --> 01:40:52,059
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

1052
01:40:52,482 --> 01:40:54,871
Yes, I have Babylon.

1053
01:40:55,043 --> 01:40:59,233
But each land, each boundary I cross...

1054
01:40:59,394 --> 01:41:01,631
...I strip away another illusion.

1055
01:41:02,947 --> 01:41:05,184
I sense death will be the last.

1056
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:11,128
Yet still I push harder and harder...

1057
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:14,715
...to reach this home.

1058
01:41:20,068 --> 01:41:21,377
Where has our eagle gone?

1059
01:41:25,861 --> 01:41:27,869
We must go on, Ptolemy.

1060
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,718
Until we find an end.

1061
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:42,369
India, the land where the sun was born...

1062
01:41:42,535 --> 01:41:45,022
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

1063
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:49,085
...had never been explored or conquered.

1064
01:41:49,255 --> 01:41:54,373
From the beginning, Alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center.

1065
01:41:54,535 --> 01:41:57,153
Kings who conspired against one another.

1066
01:41:57,319 --> 01:42:01,214
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

1067
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:05,410
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

1068
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,473
Crateros, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...

1069
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:12,989
...who were tiny and lived
in the tops of trees.

1070
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:23,427
Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals...

1071
01:42:23,593 --> 01:42:25,765
...who imitated men
but wore their own skin.

1072
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,490
Keep that away from me.

1073
01:42:27,658 --> 01:42:30,593
They called this tribe "monkey."

1074
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:34,113
Monkey.

1075
01:42:35,658 --> 01:42:37,600
- Incredible.
- Look at his hands.

1076
01:42:39,691 --> 01:42:41,601
Look, Roxane.

1077
01:42:43,019 --> 01:42:44,197
Hello, little man.

1078
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:47,909
- Do they speak?
- No, but they do sing.

1079
01:42:48,076 --> 01:42:50,694
And then, there was the rain.

1080
01:42:56,973 --> 01:43:00,551
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

1081
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:03,270
...for 60 days and nights.

1082
01:43:06,605 --> 01:43:08,361
You know better, Machatas.

1083
01:43:08,685 --> 01:43:10,147
What's your son going to say?

1084
01:43:10,381 --> 01:43:12,748
Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.

1085
01:43:12,909 --> 01:43:14,797
Right, my king.

1086
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:16,365
Give me my horse, Alexander.

1087
01:43:16,526 --> 01:43:18,631
I'll be with you at your side.

1088
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:22,825
Watch out for the serpent.

1089
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:25,446
Hold it, hold it tight.

1090
01:43:26,702 --> 01:43:29,321
Cleitus, bring the snake healers!

1091
01:43:29,487 --> 01:43:32,302
- Pauvanus. Someone bring Pauvanus.
- Where's the bite?

1092
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:34,121
- What happened?
- It's to the neck.

1093
01:43:34,287 --> 01:43:36,524
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

1094
01:43:36,688 --> 01:43:38,182
Hold on. Hold on.

1095
01:43:38,352 --> 01:43:39,628
Be brave.

1096
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:41,417
Be brave.

1097
01:43:41,584 --> 01:43:43,472
Oh, Zeus.

1098
01:43:45,233 --> 01:43:48,746
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

1099
01:43:48,913 --> 01:43:51,149
...there was none to be had.

1100
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,357
Tempers worsened.

1101
01:43:53,521 --> 01:43:56,369
We massacred all Indians who resisted.

1102
01:43:56,529 --> 01:43:58,569
And with the local water putrid...

1103
01:43:58,737 --> 01:44:01,519
...we drank the strong wine.

1104
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:53,105
As we moved southeast...

1105
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:57,492
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

1106
01:44:57,974 --> 01:45:00,592
...so as to make of them allies.

1107
01:45:00,758 --> 01:45:03,180
But this did not sit well with the army...

1108
01:45:03,351 --> 01:45:06,646
...who began to wonder if Alexander
was on some crazed quest...

1109
01:45:06,806 --> 01:45:09,938
...to imitate the glory of Herakles.

1110
01:45:32,697 --> 01:45:33,875
Give him a kiss.

1111
01:45:34,041 --> 01:45:35,928
Go on, kiss him.

1112
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,622
Give him a kiss.

1113
01:45:52,026 --> 01:45:54,481
- To Bagoas.
- To Bagoas!

1114
01:45:59,003 --> 01:46:02,964
- And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
- Dionysus!

1115
01:46:03,132 --> 01:46:07,223
...who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1116
01:46:07,387 --> 01:46:10,006
...some 6000 years ago.

1117
01:46:10,172 --> 01:46:11,633
To a hero.

1118
01:46:11,804 --> 01:46:13,714
To a hero!

1119
01:46:32,189 --> 01:46:33,466
Roxane.

1120
01:46:39,967 --> 01:46:42,301
You lose face.

1121
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:43,957
These Indians...

1122
01:46:44,126 --> 01:46:45,817
...they are a low, evil people.

1123
01:46:45,982 --> 01:46:48,349
You don't try to understand them.

1124
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:50,682
I try.

1125
01:46:50,847 --> 01:46:53,749
But this I know, Alexander.

1126
01:46:53,919 --> 01:46:56,886
In Persia, you are a great king.

1127
01:46:57,055 --> 01:46:58,549
Here...

1128
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,607
...they hate you.

1129
01:47:03,104 --> 01:47:06,454
Let us go back to Babylon.

1130
01:47:07,393 --> 01:47:09,051
There, you are strong.

1131
01:47:11,104 --> 01:47:13,374
We'll talk about this later.

1132
01:47:13,537 --> 01:47:14,878
Yes.

1133
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:16,502
Later.

1134
01:47:16,673 --> 01:47:18,135
Talk.

1135
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,721
I shall come.

1136
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:24,191
Tonight.

1137
01:47:25,058 --> 01:47:26,846
And I shall wait.

1138
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,618
Good night, my king.

1139
01:47:32,259 --> 01:47:34,331
Your Majesty.

1140
01:47:35,266 --> 01:47:36,990
I'll toast to Bagoas.

1141
01:47:39,042 --> 01:47:42,338
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1142
01:47:42,499 --> 01:47:45,347
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

1143
01:47:48,643 --> 01:47:50,498
And to the memory of Philip.

1144
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,602
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1145
01:47:53,764 --> 01:47:56,666
...transformed into such...

1146
01:47:56,836 --> 01:47:58,494
...a pretty army.

1147
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:01,824
To Philip.

1148
01:48:01,988 --> 01:48:04,094
To a real hero.

1149
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:06,333
Philip!

1150
01:48:09,029 --> 01:48:13,732
And to Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

1151
01:48:13,894 --> 01:48:15,356
Cleitus.

1152
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,230
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1153
01:48:19,398 --> 01:48:22,268
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1154
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:24,195
...after 30 years' service.

1155
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:28,254
You call governing
this major province exile?

1156
01:48:28,455 --> 01:48:31,455
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

1157
01:48:32,103 --> 01:48:34,143
...a province so far from home?

1158
01:48:34,312 --> 01:48:37,607
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

1159
01:48:40,328 --> 01:48:42,368
So be it.

1160
01:48:42,536 --> 01:48:45,853
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

1161
01:48:46,024 --> 01:48:48,097
...rather than shine...

1162
01:48:48,265 --> 01:48:49,542
...in Eastern pomp.

1163
01:48:50,921 --> 01:48:54,533
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

1164
01:48:54,697 --> 01:48:58,112
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

1165
01:48:58,570 --> 01:49:02,726
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1166
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:07,647
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

1167
01:49:07,818 --> 01:49:10,819
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1168
01:49:10,986 --> 01:49:13,637
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1169
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:17,250
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

1170
01:49:20,459 --> 01:49:21,888
Only when offered.

1171
01:49:22,059 --> 01:49:24,394
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1172
01:49:24,844 --> 01:49:27,397
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1173
01:49:27,564 --> 01:49:30,052
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

1174
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,780
...but a son of Zeus.

1175
01:49:31,948 --> 01:49:35,494
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1176
01:49:36,684 --> 01:49:38,572
Why not?

1177
01:49:40,972 --> 01:49:42,914
I've achieved more in my years.

1178
01:49:43,085 --> 01:49:44,973
Traveled as far.

1179
01:49:45,133 --> 01:49:46,311
Probably farther.

1180
01:49:46,477 --> 01:49:48,582
Herakles did it by himself.

1181
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:51,652
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

1182
01:49:51,822 --> 01:49:53,545
Who planned the Asian invasion?

1183
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:55,368
Was it not your father?

1184
01:49:55,534 --> 01:49:57,541
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1185
01:49:57,870 --> 01:50:01,285
- Zeus-Amon, is it?
- You insult me, Cleitus.

1186
01:50:01,454 --> 01:50:04,105
You mock my family. Be careful.

1187
01:50:04,463 --> 01:50:07,911
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

1188
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:10,632
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

1189
01:50:10,799 --> 01:50:12,621
Are we not good enough any longer?

1190
01:50:12,783 --> 01:50:14,791
I remember a time...

1191
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,448
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1192
01:50:17,615 --> 01:50:20,365
None of this scraping, groveling.

1193
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,974
Now you kiss them?

1194
01:50:24,592 --> 01:50:29,414
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

1195
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,754
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

1196
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:42,630
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1197
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:47,312
This army...
This army is your blood, boy!

1198
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,449
Without it, you're nothing!

1199
01:50:54,323 --> 01:50:56,625
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

1200
01:50:56,787 --> 01:50:59,438
- Get him from my sight!
- I don't serve your purpose?!

1201
01:50:59,603 --> 01:51:03,498
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1202
01:51:03,667 --> 01:51:06,929
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1203
01:51:07,091 --> 01:51:08,433
Alexander!

1204
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:10,832
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1205
01:51:17,908 --> 01:51:19,665
- Who's with him?
- No.

1206
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:21,290
Who's with him?

1207
01:51:21,909 --> 01:51:23,982
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1208
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:26,353
I call you to trial before him!

1209
01:51:26,517 --> 01:51:28,907
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1210
01:51:29,077 --> 01:51:31,216
- Take him!
- You speak of plots against you?

1211
01:51:31,381 --> 01:51:32,788
What about poor Parmenion?

1212
01:51:32,982 --> 01:51:35,666
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

1213
01:51:36,630 --> 01:51:39,565
Hypocrite. Despot. False king.

1214
01:51:40,374 --> 01:51:43,221
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

1215
01:52:06,904 --> 01:52:08,562
Cleitus.

1216
01:52:08,728 --> 01:52:10,517
Oh, my Cleitus.

1217
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:19,151
- Let me pass.
- None can enter.

1218
01:52:19,322 --> 01:52:21,144
I am the queen.

1219
01:52:24,793 --> 01:52:26,932
I want to see him. I've waited three days.

1220
01:52:27,098 --> 01:52:29,749
He says none, not even you.

1221
01:52:30,778 --> 01:52:34,521
- He needs me.
- No, he doesn't.

1222
01:52:34,683 --> 01:52:36,439
And he needs you?

1223
01:52:38,011 --> 01:52:40,400
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

1224
01:52:46,331 --> 01:52:49,114
The army needs your reassurance.

1225
01:52:49,564 --> 01:52:51,222
Alexander.

1226
01:52:53,148 --> 01:52:54,708
Yes.

1227
01:52:54,876 --> 01:52:58,553
Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.

1228
01:53:00,253 --> 01:53:01,530
You know more than any...

1229
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:06,068
...great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

1230
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:08,212
You're Alexander.

1231
01:53:08,382 --> 01:53:11,099
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

1232
01:53:11,262 --> 01:53:14,972
Have I become so arrogant
that I am blind?

1233
01:53:16,446 --> 01:53:18,235
Sometimes...

1234
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:20,439
...to expect the best of everyone...

1235
01:53:21,086 --> 01:53:23,061
...is arrogance.

1236
01:53:25,886 --> 01:53:28,472
Then Cleitus spoke true.

1237
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:30,549
I am become a tyrant.

1238
01:53:30,943 --> 01:53:32,983
You're mortal.

1239
01:53:33,152 --> 01:53:35,007
And they know it.

1240
01:53:35,168 --> 01:53:39,641
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

1241
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,396
I've failed...

1242
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,283
...utterly.

1243
01:54:12,578 --> 01:54:15,644
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1244
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:17,599
...and leader of the Greeks.

1245
01:54:18,339 --> 01:54:23,096
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1246
01:54:24,324 --> 01:54:26,364
Today is that day.

1247
01:54:33,637 --> 01:54:36,255
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1248
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:40,130
...but Alexander is simply great."

1249
01:54:41,445 --> 01:54:44,031
But if you ever insult me again...

1250
01:54:44,197 --> 01:54:46,085
...Ill kill you.

1251
01:54:51,654 --> 01:54:52,995
I've missed you.

1252
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:55,711
In the spring, Persia.

1253
01:54:55,878 --> 01:54:57,950
You'll command my horse from the right.

1254
01:54:58,118 --> 01:55:00,257
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1255
01:55:00,422 --> 01:55:02,080
...for all the gold in the world.

1256
01:55:02,246 --> 01:55:04,767
Which, one day, you'll have.

1257
01:55:09,191 --> 01:55:11,646
Making himself a 13th god.

1258
01:55:11,815 --> 01:55:13,855
He's drunk so much wine, my poor Philip.

1259
01:55:14,023 --> 01:55:15,812
He's lost his mind.

1260
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:21,346
- Your Majesty.
- Attalus.

1261
01:55:25,673 --> 01:55:28,455
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

1262
01:55:28,617 --> 01:55:31,367
...as much as our regent.

1263
01:55:31,529 --> 01:55:33,089
He's very tired.

1264
01:55:37,129 --> 01:55:39,333
Hey.

1265
01:55:41,642 --> 01:55:44,609
- Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
- Royal guard!

1266
01:55:44,874 --> 01:55:47,460
To the arena! March!

1267
01:55:47,626 --> 01:55:50,408
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

1268
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,800
- Greeks all over the place.
- Cleitus, Cleitus.

1269
01:55:53,963 --> 01:55:55,938
My Cleitus.

1270
01:55:56,362 --> 01:55:58,916
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1271
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,866
Treat him as you would me.

1272
01:56:01,035 --> 01:56:03,141
He'll guard your back for you.

1273
01:56:03,628 --> 01:56:05,733
Yes, Father.

1274
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:08,202
My people are guard enough today.

1275
01:56:08,364 --> 01:56:11,812
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.

1276
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:13,441
Then let them call me tyrant.

1277
01:56:13,964 --> 01:56:17,063
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1278
01:56:17,228 --> 01:56:20,741
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

1279
01:56:20,909 --> 01:56:22,884
I want them to like me.

1280
01:56:29,709 --> 01:56:32,230
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

1281
01:56:32,397 --> 01:56:34,405
Follow with the main guard.

1282
01:56:34,574 --> 01:56:35,948
Go on.

1283
01:56:38,862 --> 01:56:42,059
- Go on.
- Father, it's best I go with you.

1284
01:56:44,878 --> 01:56:47,846
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

1285
01:56:48,015 --> 01:56:49,924
Is that what she wants?

1286
01:56:50,383 --> 01:56:53,034
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1287
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:57,226
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

1288
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:02,920
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1289
01:57:03,088 --> 01:57:05,544
...obey me this once!

1290
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,255
Have courage, Father.

1291
01:57:09,425 --> 01:57:11,847
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

1292
01:57:12,017 --> 01:57:14,122
...you may recall your valor.

1293
01:57:48,435 --> 01:57:52,210
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1294
01:57:52,373 --> 01:57:55,373
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1295
01:58:12,597 --> 01:58:14,932
Pausanias, I told you...

1296
01:59:03,066 --> 01:59:04,659
The king is slain!

1297
01:59:52,126 --> 01:59:54,515
The king lives!

1298
01:59:54,686 --> 01:59:57,948
Alexander, son of Philip!

1299
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,834
May the gods bless the king!

1300
02:00:04,222 --> 02:00:06,841
You're king now. You're king.

1301
02:00:14,687 --> 02:00:18,004
May the gods bless Alexander!

1302
02:00:19,904 --> 02:00:21,977
- Alexander!
- Alexander!

1303
02:00:30,592 --> 02:00:31,902
Get out.

1304
02:00:33,313 --> 02:00:34,721
Go.

1305
02:00:39,458 --> 02:00:41,759
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1306
02:00:41,922 --> 02:00:44,093
Because it was meant to be.

1307
02:00:44,258 --> 02:00:46,233
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1308
02:00:46,403 --> 02:00:50,559
- No one blames you.
- They blame me behind my back! In secret.

1309
02:00:50,722 --> 02:00:52,217
- Slander is not power.
- Shame is?

1310
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:56,791
Who killed my father?

1311
02:00:57,282 --> 02:00:58,809
Tell me.

1312
02:00:58,978 --> 02:01:01,563
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1313
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:04,218
- Pausanias.
- He had help!

1314
02:01:04,386 --> 02:01:06,426
Did you help him?

1315
02:01:13,251 --> 02:01:15,455
No, never.

1316
02:01:15,907 --> 02:01:18,722
Why? Why would I?

1317
02:01:19,812 --> 02:01:21,405
So many wanted it.

1318
02:01:21,572 --> 02:01:22,881
Greeks, Persians, men...

1319
02:01:23,044 --> 02:01:24,931
You're mad. You're cursed.

1320
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:27,645
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

1321
02:01:27,812 --> 02:01:30,594
Now who is exaggerating?

1322
02:01:31,493 --> 02:01:33,697
Even if it was the wish of your heart...

1323
02:01:33,861 --> 02:01:36,446
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1324
02:01:36,612 --> 02:01:38,401
He was not your father!

1325
02:01:38,565 --> 02:01:40,605
You owe no blood debt to that man.

1326
02:01:40,773 --> 02:01:43,457
You lie and lie and lie.

1327
02:01:43,622 --> 02:01:46,557
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1328
02:01:46,725 --> 02:01:49,987
Look at you. Look at you.

1329
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:53,499
You are everything that he was not.

1330
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:56,834
He was coarse, you are refined.

1331
02:01:56,998 --> 02:02:00,741
He was a general, and you are a king.

1332
02:02:00,903 --> 02:02:02,845
He could not rule himself...

1333
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:06,111
...and you shall rule the world.

1334
02:02:06,279 --> 02:02:09,825
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

1335
02:02:09,992 --> 02:02:11,814
Such thick pride...

1336
02:02:11,975 --> 02:02:13,797
...and no mourning for your husband.

1337
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:15,301
Mourn...

1338
02:02:15,463 --> 02:02:16,958
...him?

1339
02:02:17,896 --> 02:02:20,317
What do you know of Philip?

1340
02:02:21,769 --> 02:02:25,893
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

1341
02:02:26,601 --> 02:02:30,179
- Act like it.
- My first act would be to kill you!

1342
02:02:31,401 --> 02:02:33,638
You murdered me in my cradle.

1343
02:02:33,802 --> 02:02:35,941
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

1344
02:02:36,106 --> 02:02:38,178
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1345
02:02:38,346 --> 02:02:42,056
- Hate you have for men.
- I taught you my heart, Alexander!

1346
02:02:42,218 --> 02:02:45,895
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1347
02:02:46,058 --> 02:02:48,262
Damn your sorceress soul.

1348
02:02:48,426 --> 02:02:51,012
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

1349
02:02:52,427 --> 02:02:53,889
No! No!

1350
02:02:54,475 --> 02:02:58,217
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

1351
02:02:58,827 --> 02:03:00,769
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1352
02:03:00,939 --> 02:03:03,306
You're a king. Act like one.

1353
02:03:03,467 --> 02:03:05,158
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1354
02:03:05,324 --> 02:03:07,113
Execute Attalus without delay.

1355
02:03:07,276 --> 02:03:10,091
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

1356
02:03:10,252 --> 02:03:11,626
Eurydice? Never.

1357
02:03:11,789 --> 02:03:13,163
Laugh, you monster.

1358
02:03:13,324 --> 02:03:14,633
You heartbreaker.

1359
02:03:14,796 --> 02:03:17,579
How will you live out the year like this?

1360
02:03:17,741 --> 02:03:22,280
- Have you learned nothing from Philip?
- No. From you, Mother.

1361
02:03:25,326 --> 02:03:26,951
The best.

1362
02:03:36,559 --> 02:03:40,967
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

1363
02:03:42,671 --> 02:03:47,112
One day, you will understand this.

1364
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:50,694
But I have only you in my heart.

1365
02:03:53,232 --> 02:03:56,331
I know what you need.

1366
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,404
Now is the time.

1367
02:03:59,568 --> 02:04:01,739
The gods favor you.

1368
02:04:02,065 --> 02:04:05,229
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1369
02:04:05,393 --> 02:04:07,084
All you desire.

1370
02:04:07,249 --> 02:04:09,769
The world is yours!

1371
02:04:09,937 --> 02:04:11,792
Take it.

1372
02:04:16,145 --> 02:04:17,836
Take it.

1373
02:04:39,091 --> 02:04:42,387
He never saw his mother again.

1374
02:04:45,076 --> 02:04:48,143
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

1375
02:04:48,308 --> 02:04:53,743
...Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

1376
02:04:55,252 --> 02:04:56,747
By necessity...

1377
02:04:56,917 --> 02:05:00,529
...he had her uncle Attalus executed.

1378
02:05:21,591 --> 02:05:23,151
Of course you have fears.

1379
02:05:23,319 --> 02:05:24,694
We all have fears...

1380
02:05:24,855 --> 02:05:27,888
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1381
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:32,694
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1382
02:05:32,983 --> 02:05:34,544
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1383
02:05:34,712 --> 02:05:37,559
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

1384
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:40,720
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1385
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,219
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1386
02:05:43,385 --> 02:05:46,833
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1387
02:05:47,001 --> 02:05:51,638
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

1388
02:05:52,793 --> 02:05:56,142
- Follow Alexander.
- I'll follow you.

1389
02:06:00,602 --> 02:06:02,195
What?

1390
02:06:02,362 --> 02:06:05,624
- Silence?
- We're with you, Alexander!

1391
02:06:05,786 --> 02:06:06,964
Peucestas.

1392
02:06:07,258 --> 02:06:09,298
A hero.

1393
02:06:09,466 --> 02:06:12,532
Where are the Amazons of myth
who dare to fight and kill men?

1394
02:06:12,891 --> 02:06:14,418
Where have they gone?

1395
02:06:15,867 --> 02:06:18,551
We'll never leave you, Alexander!

1396
02:06:19,612 --> 02:06:20,789
You, Meleager.

1397
02:06:20,955 --> 02:06:24,272
Who are these tribes ahead
compared to those we've vanquished?

1398
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,951
Lysimachus?

1399
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:32,947
Antigonus.

1400
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:37,493
You break my heart, you men.

1401
02:06:37,661 --> 02:06:39,450
Afraid.

1402
02:06:40,349 --> 02:06:41,810
Crateros.

1403
02:06:43,901 --> 02:06:45,079
Crateros.

1404
02:06:45,245 --> 02:06:46,325
And another one.

1405
02:06:46,494 --> 02:06:48,250
Crateros.

1406
02:06:49,662 --> 02:06:51,451
Crateros.

1407
02:06:57,855 --> 02:06:59,415
My king.

1408
02:07:00,703 --> 02:07:04,697
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1409
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:08,505
I lost many a man.

1410
02:07:09,567 --> 02:07:12,088
Young ones, never been with a woman.

1411
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,353
Some died of disease.

1412
02:07:15,904 --> 02:07:19,931
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1413
02:07:20,097 --> 02:07:21,787
Some died good.

1414
02:07:21,952 --> 02:07:24,855
Some just didn't get no luck.

1415
02:07:25,665 --> 02:07:27,323
But they died.

1416
02:07:29,569 --> 02:07:32,351
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

1417
02:07:32,513 --> 02:07:36,408
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

1418
02:07:37,441 --> 02:07:41,053
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1419
02:07:41,218 --> 02:07:44,186
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1420
02:07:44,898 --> 02:07:47,200
We killed many a barbarian.

1421
02:07:48,803 --> 02:07:53,440
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

1422
02:07:53,603 --> 02:07:57,215
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

1423
02:07:57,379 --> 02:08:00,795
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1424
02:08:00,964 --> 02:08:03,779
...cross a hundred more rivers.

1425
02:08:04,612 --> 02:08:08,541
Crateros. Good Crateros.

1426
02:08:09,348 --> 02:08:14,269
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1427
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:19,010
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1428
02:08:19,173 --> 02:08:24,738
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1429
02:08:24,901 --> 02:08:28,163
You have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1430
02:08:29,094 --> 02:08:32,542
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1431
02:08:33,126 --> 02:08:36,509
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

1432
02:08:36,678 --> 02:08:41,185
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1433
02:08:41,351 --> 02:08:47,582
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1434
02:08:48,039 --> 02:08:51,684
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1435
02:08:55,464 --> 02:08:58,977
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

1436
02:08:59,145 --> 02:09:00,389
I have been negligent.

1437
02:09:02,473 --> 02:09:05,190
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1438
02:09:05,353 --> 02:09:07,971
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1439
02:09:08,137 --> 02:09:12,993
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1440
02:09:14,281 --> 02:09:17,762
And respected, rich, loved.

1441
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:22,600
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

1442
02:09:22,762 --> 02:09:26,788
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

1443
02:09:28,043 --> 02:09:30,083
But you dream, Crateros.

1444
02:09:30,795 --> 02:09:34,951
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

1445
02:09:35,115 --> 02:09:39,240
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1446
02:09:39,947 --> 02:09:45,065
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1447
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:48,265
Do you not see?

1448
02:09:49,388 --> 02:09:52,520
And you, as well as I, know...

1449
02:09:52,685 --> 02:09:56,776
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1450
02:09:56,941 --> 02:09:59,625
...and all your great victories fade...

1451
02:09:59,789 --> 02:10:05,223
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1452
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:07,943
For I will go on, with my Asians.

1453
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:15,401
- To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
- We come for you, and you discard us.

1454
02:10:15,566 --> 02:10:17,868
- Shame!
- We want to go home, Alexander.

1455
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:19,688
We're tired of glory.

1456
02:10:19,854 --> 02:10:22,637
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1457
02:10:24,592 --> 02:10:26,566
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1458
02:10:30,223 --> 02:10:33,126
I want to see my children.

1459
02:10:33,296 --> 02:10:36,908
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1460
02:10:37,073 --> 02:10:40,171
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

1461
02:10:42,929 --> 02:10:44,718
- Shame.
- That's your king.

1462
02:10:45,616 --> 02:10:47,143
What would your father say?

1463
02:10:47,313 --> 02:10:50,347
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1464
02:10:50,514 --> 02:10:54,311
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1465
02:10:55,537 --> 02:10:57,064
I go east.

1466
02:10:57,234 --> 02:10:59,176
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1467
02:10:59,346 --> 02:11:01,451
- Who said that?
- We won't make it to Macedonia.

1468
02:11:01,618 --> 02:11:03,342
You despicable coward. Come forth.

1469
02:11:03,506 --> 02:11:06,288
- Make your accusations public.
- So you can have us killed?

1470
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:09,320
- Son of Zeus.
- You desecrate your real father's memory.

1471
02:11:09,491 --> 02:11:15,372
- Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
- Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1472
02:11:23,924 --> 02:11:28,496
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

1473
02:11:28,661 --> 02:11:32,403
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1474
02:11:32,564 --> 02:11:36,045
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

1475
02:11:36,213 --> 02:11:39,213
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

1476
02:11:40,373 --> 02:11:44,170
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

1477
02:11:44,886 --> 02:11:48,498
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

1478
02:11:48,662 --> 02:11:50,484
You cowards. Traitors.

1479
02:11:52,919 --> 02:11:55,220
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

1480
02:11:57,495 --> 02:12:01,837
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

1481
02:12:03,447 --> 02:12:07,604
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

1482
02:12:07,768 --> 02:12:12,689
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

1483
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:16,182
But clearly, the army was divided.

1484
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:21,335
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

1485
02:12:32,921 --> 02:12:34,776
Stay calm.

1486
02:12:35,098 --> 02:12:36,854
Together we are strong as gods.

1487
02:12:38,426 --> 02:12:42,834
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

1488
02:12:46,523 --> 02:12:48,857
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1489
02:12:54,651 --> 02:12:56,757
Lock shields.

1490
02:12:59,227 --> 02:13:01,300
Battle positions.

1491
02:13:03,132 --> 02:13:04,659
Move.

1492
02:13:10,588 --> 02:13:13,687
Choppers, prepare your knives.

1493
02:13:13,853 --> 02:13:15,544
Follow me.

1494
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:34,526
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1495
02:13:51,904 --> 02:13:56,279
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

1496
02:13:56,448 --> 02:13:58,587
Cavalry!

1497
02:14:06,785 --> 02:14:09,949
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1498
02:14:55,045 --> 02:15:00,130
- Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
- Follow Alexander.

1499
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:07,008
Charge. Charge. Charge.

1500
02:15:10,118 --> 02:15:11,874
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1501
02:15:12,038 --> 02:15:15,235
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1502
02:15:15,398 --> 02:15:19,075
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1503
02:15:19,238 --> 02:15:22,272
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1504
02:15:37,768 --> 02:15:40,835
Hephaistion. To the center.

1505
02:15:43,496 --> 02:15:45,733
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

1506
02:15:45,897 --> 02:15:48,231
Ride.

1507
02:16:29,357 --> 02:16:31,877
Coenus! Get out of there.

1508
02:16:33,005 --> 02:16:34,434
No.

1509
02:17:02,895 --> 02:17:05,645
- The horses won't go.
- On foot, then.

1510
02:17:11,888 --> 02:17:15,783
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1511
02:17:17,073 --> 02:17:18,600
Come, Bucephalus.

1512
02:17:26,865 --> 02:17:29,037
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1513
02:17:31,697 --> 02:17:34,381
You and I together,
one last time, Bucephalus.

1514
02:17:36,594 --> 02:17:39,725
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1515
02:17:39,890 --> 02:17:42,541
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1516
02:17:43,091 --> 02:17:46,386
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

1517
02:17:46,546 --> 02:17:52,144
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1518
02:18:07,508 --> 02:18:09,679
Attack.

1519
02:18:10,581 --> 02:18:13,036
Alexander!

1520
02:18:23,477 --> 02:18:25,387
Alexander.

1521
02:19:54,365 --> 02:19:55,991
- The king is down!
- To the king!

1522
02:21:14,979 --> 02:21:21,209
It was the bloodiest of his battles.
Pure butchery, the end of all reason.

1523
02:21:24,996 --> 02:21:26,938
We'd never be men again.

1524
02:23:05,964 --> 02:23:09,445
He lives! Alexander!

1525
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:37,610
Men of Macedon...

1526
02:23:38,287 --> 02:23:40,327
...we're going home.

1527
02:23:41,391 --> 02:23:43,693
- What?
- What?

1528
02:23:43,855 --> 02:23:45,481
- We're going home.
- Home?

1529
02:23:45,679 --> 02:23:47,719
We're going.

1530
02:23:52,144 --> 02:23:54,054
We're going home.

1531
02:24:56,373 --> 02:24:59,308
His life should have ended in India...

1532
02:25:00,437 --> 02:25:02,347
...but that's myth.

1533
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:09,587
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

1534
02:25:13,078 --> 02:25:16,788
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

1535
02:25:16,951 --> 02:25:21,621
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

1536
02:25:21,783 --> 02:25:23,856
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

1537
02:25:24,055 --> 02:25:27,351
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

1538
02:25:28,535 --> 02:25:33,238
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

1539
02:25:35,128 --> 02:25:38,740
It was the worst blunder of his life.

1540
02:25:38,904 --> 02:25:43,182
And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...

1541
02:25:43,353 --> 02:25:49,104
...Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.

1542
02:26:10,235 --> 02:26:13,082
- Just last night he was...
- It's the water, Your Majesty.

1543
02:26:13,244 --> 02:26:15,382
He mixed it with the wine.

1544
02:26:16,412 --> 02:26:17,972
But how can this be?

1545
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:22,002
- Typhus of India?
- I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1546
02:26:22,172 --> 02:26:26,842
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold...

1547
02:26:27,932 --> 02:26:29,307
Come, doctor.

1548
02:26:37,533 --> 02:26:39,770
I feel better.

1549
02:26:40,382 --> 02:26:44,092
Soon, I'll be up.

1550
02:26:44,958 --> 02:26:48,733
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

1551
02:26:49,310 --> 02:26:51,612
Arabia.

1552
02:26:54,271 --> 02:26:59,356
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

1553
02:27:00,031 --> 02:27:01,854
...wave your wooden scimitar.

1554
02:27:02,015 --> 02:27:04,982
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

1555
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:09,621
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1556
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:12,895
You saved me from myself.

1557
02:27:15,232 --> 02:27:18,266
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1558
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:22,495
My Alexander.

1559
02:27:24,001 --> 02:27:29,533
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles and then outdid him.

1560
02:27:29,698 --> 02:27:33,855
And you, Patroclus.
And then what happened?

1561
02:27:34,018 --> 02:27:37,247
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1562
02:27:37,826 --> 02:27:43,740
- But how beautiful a myth it was.
- We reach, we fall.

1563
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:47,778
Oh, Hephaistion.

1564
02:27:53,188 --> 02:27:58,556
- I worry for you without me.
- I am nothing without you.

1565
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:03,006
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

1566
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:05,690
We will die together.

1567
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:09,602
It's our destiny.

1568
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:18,077
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1569
02:28:19,077 --> 02:28:22,558
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1570
02:28:23,238 --> 02:28:27,777
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1571
02:28:28,582 --> 02:28:32,892
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1572
02:28:33,063 --> 02:28:37,798
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1573
02:28:37,959 --> 02:28:42,083
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1574
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:45,501
And then explore the northern forests...

1575
02:28:45,671 --> 02:28:49,283
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1576
02:28:50,472 --> 02:28:54,531
And then one day,
not 10 years from now...

1577
02:28:55,112 --> 02:28:59,652
...Babylon, with its deep-water harbor,
will be the center of the world.

1578
02:28:59,816 --> 02:29:04,738
Alexandrias will grow,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1579
02:29:04,905 --> 02:29:07,490
Asia and Europe will come together.

1580
02:29:09,225 --> 02:29:12,968
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1581
02:29:13,642 --> 02:29:19,044
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1582
02:29:25,226 --> 02:29:27,528
Hephaistion?

1583
02:29:28,875 --> 02:29:31,144
Hephaistion?

1584
02:29:37,836 --> 02:29:42,277
- Where is this doctor?
- I can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1585
02:29:42,444 --> 02:29:46,667
- It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
- Execute him!

1586
02:29:47,468 --> 02:29:50,818
Take him out now and execute him.

1587
02:29:50,988 --> 02:29:55,015
- Come away, come away.
- Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1588
02:29:55,693 --> 02:29:59,173
Get out. Get out now!

1589
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:09,219
Be gone.

1590
02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:14,125
Be gone with you.
Harpies. Get out. Get out.

1591
02:30:14,286 --> 02:30:16,042
Are you drunk again?

1592
02:30:16,206 --> 02:30:17,701
- Get out.
- He's dead.

1593
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:20,521
- Who?
- Many hated him...

1594
02:30:20,687 --> 02:30:23,502
...but I don't think any other
would have dared.

1595
02:30:24,943 --> 02:30:26,918
Hephaistion is dead?

1596
02:30:30,703 --> 02:30:32,591
Are you mad?

1597
02:30:34,641 --> 02:30:36,102
You monster.

1598
02:30:37,265 --> 02:30:40,080
- Are you mad?
- You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

1599
02:30:40,241 --> 02:30:44,267
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1600
02:30:45,297 --> 02:30:49,771
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1601
02:30:51,218 --> 02:30:53,902
- Alexander, we have a son.
- No.

1602
02:30:55,474 --> 02:30:57,895
- The child.
- Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1603
02:30:58,066 --> 02:31:04,209
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1604
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:06,705
We have a son.

1605
02:31:07,186 --> 02:31:10,416
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1606
02:31:12,019 --> 02:31:13,612
Never touch me again.

1607
02:31:16,884 --> 02:31:18,826
No!

1608
02:31:24,213 --> 02:31:26,896
One last toast!

1609
02:31:30,069 --> 02:31:31,891
Before the dawn.

1610
02:31:38,645 --> 02:31:41,679
To my old friends.

1611
02:31:57,911 --> 02:32:01,621
- And to the myths.
- To the myths.

1612
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:11,796
Drink it down, Alexander.

1613
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,968
Drink it down.

1614
02:32:27,801 --> 02:32:31,031
Yes, come on. Finish it.

1615
02:32:49,947 --> 02:32:51,987
To the next dawn.

1616
02:33:06,748 --> 02:33:08,985
Yes, come.

1617
02:33:09,149 --> 02:33:15,379
Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.

1618
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:27,096
Wait. Wait.

1619
02:33:27,902 --> 02:33:30,041
Vultures. Wait.

1620
02:33:30,206 --> 02:33:32,759
Your son, Alexander.

1621
02:33:32,926 --> 02:33:35,414
Just three more months.

1622
02:33:35,583 --> 02:33:39,358
Please live. Alexander.

1623
02:33:39,519 --> 02:33:43,960
Alexander, we beg you. Tell us who.

1624
02:33:44,128 --> 02:33:46,943
Who will rule this great empire
if you leave us?

1625
02:33:47,136 --> 02:33:50,103
- Fear not. We're at the beginning.
- You're a great man.

1626
02:33:51,232 --> 02:33:53,239
The myth becomes real.

1627
02:33:58,369 --> 02:34:00,703
Beyond Herakles.

1628
02:34:05,409 --> 02:34:08,922
When it's over, all that matters is
what you've done. I'll remember.

1629
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:11,905
Zeus is your father.

1630
02:34:12,834 --> 02:34:15,038
Alexander, the army will divide.

1631
02:34:15,202 --> 02:34:17,952
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1632
02:34:18,114 --> 02:34:19,358
Who will it be?

1633
02:34:20,482 --> 02:34:22,904
Pray tell us, who?

1634
02:34:25,187 --> 02:34:27,740
- What did he say?
- "To the best."

1635
02:34:29,731 --> 02:34:32,000
- He said, "To the best."
- What?

1636
02:34:32,163 --> 02:34:34,400
- No, he said, "To Crateros."
- To Crateros?

1637
02:34:34,563 --> 02:34:36,156
Why would he say Crateros?

1638
02:35:35,145 --> 02:35:39,204
On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

1639
02:35:39,369 --> 02:35:43,624
...Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.

1640
02:35:43,785 --> 02:35:47,812
And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.

1641
02:35:51,017 --> 02:35:53,603
But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...

1642
02:35:53,770 --> 02:35:58,953
...the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.

1643
02:36:02,154 --> 02:36:04,675
His sacrifice was an early death...

1644
02:36:04,843 --> 02:36:07,080
...but in keeping
to his side of the bargain...

1645
02:36:07,243 --> 02:36:10,952
...I cannot help but feel
he conquered death as well.

1646
02:36:13,580 --> 02:36:16,362
Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...

1647
02:36:16,524 --> 02:36:19,175
...is, to my mind, a probability.

1648
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:21,828
His, a burden.

1649
02:36:22,668 --> 02:36:26,858
Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.

1650
02:36:27,021 --> 02:36:32,422
But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.

1651
02:36:35,117 --> 02:36:37,005
No!

1652
02:36:42,509 --> 02:36:44,681
- The body stays in Babylon.
- Within hours...

1653
02:36:44,846 --> 02:36:47,715
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

1654
02:36:47,886 --> 02:36:49,926
The wars of the world had begun.

1655
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:52,454
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

1656
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:57,261
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

1657
02:36:57,423 --> 02:37:01,613
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.

1658
02:37:01,775 --> 02:37:06,958
- Until we divided his empire in four parts.
- Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1659
02:37:07,119 --> 02:37:09,640
Cassander certainly proved
his will to power...

1660
02:37:09,808 --> 02:37:14,183
...when seven years later,
he had Olympias executed.

1661
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:17,513
And within 12 years, he achieved...

1662
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:20,495
...the complete destruction
of Alexander's bloodline...

1663
02:37:22,001 --> 02:37:23,823
...when he poisoned Roxane...

1664
02:37:23,985 --> 02:37:29,518
...and Alexander's 13-year-old son,
the true heir to the empire.

1665
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:35,723
But the truth is never simple...

1666
02:37:36,562 --> 02:37:38,537
...and yet it is.

1667
02:37:38,995 --> 02:37:41,897
The truth is, we did kill him.

1668
02:37:45,363 --> 02:37:48,625
By silence, we consented.

1669
02:37:49,043 --> 02:37:50,931
Because...

1670
02:37:51,091 --> 02:37:53,513
Because we couldn't go on.

1671
02:37:53,684 --> 02:37:58,801
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

1672
02:37:58,964 --> 02:38:03,983
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

1673
02:38:04,149 --> 02:38:07,215
Mixing the races, harmony?

1674
02:38:08,181 --> 02:38:10,832
Oh, he talked of these things...

1675
02:38:10,997 --> 02:38:16,529
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

1676
02:38:17,525 --> 02:38:20,340
I never believed in his dream.

1677
02:38:20,502 --> 02:38:22,542
None of us did.

1678
02:38:24,214 --> 02:38:26,386
That's the truth of his life.

1679
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:29,038
The dreamers exhaust us.

1680
02:38:29,750 --> 02:38:33,744
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

1681
02:38:35,063 --> 02:38:37,813
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

1682
02:38:37,975 --> 02:38:40,309
It's an old fool's rubbish.

1683
02:38:42,071 --> 02:38:47,254
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

1684
02:38:48,023 --> 02:38:49,780
Yes, great Pharaoh.

1685
02:38:49,944 --> 02:38:53,686
Oh, he could've stayed home in Macedonia,
married, raised a family.

1686
02:38:54,872 --> 02:38:57,807
He'd have died a celebrated man.

1687
02:39:00,089 --> 02:39:02,740
But this was not Alexander.

1688
02:39:03,065 --> 02:39:08,729
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

1689
02:39:08,890 --> 02:39:14,804
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

1690
02:39:16,154 --> 02:39:19,951
The freest man I've ever known.

1691
02:39:21,563 --> 02:39:26,353
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

1692
02:39:26,523 --> 02:39:30,102
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

1693
02:39:30,427 --> 02:39:33,013
And if his desire...

1694
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:37,882
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

1695
02:39:40,316 --> 02:39:43,317
What failure!

1696
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:49,494
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

1697
02:39:53,949 --> 02:39:55,640
I've lived...

1698
02:39:55,837 --> 02:39:58,106
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

1699
02:39:58,269 --> 02:40:00,538
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

1700
02:40:00,702 --> 02:40:05,437
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

1701
02:40:05,887 --> 02:40:10,906
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

1702
02:40:12,062 --> 02:40:15,805
...Megas Alexandros.

1703
02:40:17,183 --> 02:40:20,249
The greatest Alexander of them all.
