Wake up.

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,000
What should I do if you come outside without saying anything?

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you know how worried I was?

11
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,280
Didn't you hear what I said?

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,720
If you keep doing these kinds of things...

13
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,680
No. I am sorry.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Let's go inside. You will catch a cold, ok?

15

Who are you?

16
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,630
Eun Gi, why are you like this?

17
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,130
I asked you who you are.

18
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,150
Hey, Seo Eun Gi!

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,830
I am asking you who you are.

20

21

Step aside now.

22

Yes.

What?

72
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,560
I told her she can't come inside for now, so I told Choco to stall her outside...

73
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,370
What are you going to do... about Eun Gi?

74
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,820
Our Choco has really grown up.

In the past you were just a little baby.

Are you going to keep me standing here like this?

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
My brother told me not to ever let you inside our house, Jae Hee Unni.

78

I am not a bad person, Choco.

79
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,100
If you aren't a bad person, did all bad people die?

80
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,750
Traitor.

81

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,830
am I still a traitor?

83
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,290
You abandoned my Oppa, and married a chaebol Chairman. <br> You got all your wishes. You must be very happy, huh?

84
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,980
I guess, huh?

85
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,180
I thought if all my wishes came true, I would

86
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,550
be very happy, but....

87
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,590
Oppa!

88
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,370
I am not really happy as I thought.

89
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,340
Why? Now you even became a President. You should be happy.

90
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,650
I guess I feel this way because your Oppa is not next to me.

93

Oppa, this Unni isn't the Unni we knew. She is a totally strange ajumma.

94
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,820
Don't talk for a long time and come inside quickly.

95
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,740

I told you to get lost.

99
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,180
I am Eun Gi's mom. I have the right to see her.

100
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,040
Move away.

101
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,430
What on earth did you talk with Eun Gi about?

102
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,820
What on earth did you talk to her about that she became nervous like that and even collapsed?

103
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,800
I talked about you.

104
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,290
It isn't even something new.

105
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,590
I don't know what is so frightening and made her fall down.

106
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,230
It is I who wants to ask.

107
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,460
If you try to mess with her again even once,

108
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,230
you will see for once what Kang Maru is capable of doing...

109
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,920
and how far he can go.

110
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,230
Love is not about loyalty.

111
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,320
It isn't about sympathy either.

112
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,870
Just because you want to return everything back to normal,

113
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,310
doesn't mean you're in love. That is just your conscience.

114
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,680
Love is...

115
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,150
what you gave me.

116
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,880
That was love, right?

117
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,880
After I lost that, I realized how important it was.

118
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,810
The reason why, now, I'm here in regret...

119
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,010
Regardless of what happens, the determination to have it again...

120
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,720
that is love.

121
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,920

123
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,750
Truthfully, I...

124
00:12:59,540 --> 00:12:59,530
don't hate it.

125
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,640
don't hate it.

To tell you honestly,

127
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,210
I was happy because I saw you again.

128
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:17,830
The world without you is boring, not fun....

129
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,370
and really nothing special.

130
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,680

After following her down to the hospital, I was able to get it.

It looks like she is still receiving treatment from a neurologist in our country,  Professor Seo Min Hyuk.

Okay.

Stop it. I won't eat it.

That Unni is really too much. Is she the only one having hard time?

164
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,430
She thinks my brother isn't having a hard time?

I need to go tell her what I need to say.

167
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,820
What will you tell her?

168
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,900
You stay still. It isn't something for you to get involved.

169
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,680
Didn't you hear what I said?  I told you I won't eat it.

170
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,230
What will you do if you don't eat? You have to eat and live.

171
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,320
This is really too much.

172
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,240
Hey, let's go watch a movie together.

173
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay. Let's do it for once.

174
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,550
Milk is still left in the fridge. And there is another box of tomatoes.

175
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,160
In our neighborhood, there are 3 markets.

176
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,990
And I still have lots of energy. And because I backed off from work, I have a lot of time.

178
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,880
You, getting mad, breaking everything and being like this after collapsing....

179
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,610
It actually makes me happy.

180
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,630
In this situation, it is normal to get angry and furious.

181
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,260
Because Seo Eun Gi, you seemed always too bright and happy.

182
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,540
I was worried about that.

183
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:54,070
Because I thought, maybe, you were just hurting inside.

184
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,240
Maybe, if it's possible,

185
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,380
I want to see you scream and cry.

186
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,730
What conversation did you have with Han Jae Hee?

187
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,730
Are you having a hard time because of me?

188
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,540
Did I make you have a hard time like this?

189
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,660
If you are having a hard time because of memories about me,

190
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,240
because of those memories, because you want to hide those memories,

191
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,370
if you are being hurt like this,

192
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,370
don't hide and let it out.

193
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,000
Stop hurting (stabbing) yourself and

194
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,640
hurt me, Eun Gi.

195
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,990
Stop inflicting pain on yourself, and

196
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,030
hurt (stab) me like this.

197
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,040
You need to live properly in order for me to leave.

198
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,240
You need to get up properly...

199
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,170
so I can, without worries,

200
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,030
disppear from your side.

Did you sleep well?

204
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,500
Yes. Did you sleep well?

205

Yes.

206
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,030
Thanks to you, Maru, I slept for a very long time.

207
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,210
Thanks to you, Maru, I slept for a very long time.

208
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,910
And....

209
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,650
I dreamed a really long dream.

210
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,560
During that long dream, I dreamt about you, Maru.

211
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,880
But in my dream, you, Maru,....

212
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,320
is different from the Maru I know.

213
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,840
How?

214
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,140
Tricking me, hurting me, and overly-confident...a bad person.

215
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,400
When you get back all your memories later,

216
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,120
what will you do if I am really that kind of person?

217
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,300
Huh?

218
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:09,930
I asked you what will you do if I am the bad guy who came out in your dream.

219
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,460
I won't be able to forgive him.

220
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,930
He is the person I chose after abandoning even my father.

Why are you laughing?

222
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,010
Why are you laughing?!

223
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,880
Because I am relieved.

224
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,400
Huh?

225
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,630
You must do it like that, okay?

226
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,470
Don't forget, don't have a weak mind and never ever let him off.

227
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,300
You must do it like that, Seo Eun Gi.

228
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,080
What did you hear from the President that you collapsed like that?

229
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,540
I remember that Han Jae Hee came to find me and talk with me.

230
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,000
I remember I was having a really hard time.

231
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,740
But I don't remember our conversation very well.

232
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,090
They're like small broken pieces of glass.

233
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,140
I heard your memories came back.

234
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,450
Just a random small event.

235
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,080
What is that?

236
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,890
What is it?

237
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,980
Lawyer Park Joon Ha, you, told me

238
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,290
that Kang Maru approached me with the intent of getting revenge on someone.

239
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,830
<i>He and second Madame have been in a close relationship for a long time.

240
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,420
<i>You said that earlier.

241
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,530
<i>He is a person who still harbors deep feelings for second Madam, and he approached you with ulterior motives!

242
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,560
What did you mean by that?

243
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,530
You said clearly what that is and who that is.

244
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,260
I don't remember until then.

245
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,600
That person is in a close relationship with Kang Maru and

246
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,410
for that person, he approached me.

247
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,940
Lawyer Park Joon Ha said that to me.

248
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,490
I did?

249
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,000
Yes.

250
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,800
Who is that person?

251
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,370
Kang Ma Ru... what kind of person is he?

252
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,310
Of the side of Kang Maru I don't know...

253
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,180
by any chance, do you know?

254
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,690
I heard you called me.

255
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,090
Have a seat.

256
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,940
I will talk to you standing.

257
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,320
Then let's stand together and talk.

258
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,020
I was childish.

259
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,040
It was childish of me to frame you as a corporate spy earlier.

260
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm sorry.

261
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,690
Forget everything and let's get along well in the future.

262
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,530
What should I do if I don't want to accept that apology?

263
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,280
Shall I kneel down?

264
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,590
I can kneel down.

265
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,870
In front of you, I can kneel a thousand, or even ten thousand times.

266
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,140
Should I really kneel down?

267
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,570
It's disgusting.

268
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,940
I think I'm going to throw up.

269
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,820
Are you sure that's what I said?

270
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,480
Yes, you did.

271
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,920
That Kang Maru is trying to fool me.

272
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,790
Not someone else?

273
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,380
Yes.

274
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,550
You weren't dreaming, right?

275
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,440
Are you sure you didn't make up this memory?

276
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,100
I have never said anything like that to you.

277
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,290
It's the first time I've heard this.

278
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,680
Really?

279
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,610
Yes.

280
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,840
I heard that there are a lot of people in the world who trick themselves by making up their own memories.

281
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,120
That 30% of their stored memories,

282
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,280
are actually memories that they've forgotten then recreated themselves.

283
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,700
Then I guess I thought it wrong.

284
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,510
Do you have any other things to say to me?

285
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,300
I want to find my memories quickly.

286
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,710
Yes.

287
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm not going to hide anymore and be scared.

288
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,140
I am planning to do everything I can.

289
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:51,570
If it is something that will help me recover my memory, I'll do anything.

290
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,700
I've gathered all of the documents you need.

291
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,950
Now, all we need is a way to prove Seo Eun Gi's incompetence and inability to manage business,

292
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,860
and expose her true state as soon as possible.

293
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,190
Of course, it won't be easy.

294
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,500
Until she has full clarity and recovery, she will continue to hide behind Kang Maru.

295
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,600
Let's break them apart. Kang Maru and Seo Eun Gi.

296
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,130
And, let's keep Kang Maru.

297
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,550
The bastard's talent is too valuable to give to someone else.

298
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,510
I want him. I want all of him.

299
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes.

300
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,400
Hello.

301
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,140
I thought you were sick...

302
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,260
What makes you visit here without notice?

303
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,150
I came to formally pay my respects and check in.

304
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,160
Pay respects?

305
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,790
Today I have officially started reporting back to the company.

306
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,090
I feel like I've been too weighed down by

307
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,190
my minor health issues recently.

308
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,290
After all, it is my company, and my people here.

309
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,720
I might as well recover and learn through directly interacting with them.

310
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,750
As we'll be seeing each other more often, please wish me the best.

311
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,530
Are you seriously going to officially start going back to work?

312
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,910
This is where I belonged before.

313
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,060
This is where I want to begin

314
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,780
That way, I'll regain my memory sooner.

315
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,690
I hate to do this to someone who just came back to the office, but

316
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,000
there's something urgent I need your help with, Director Seo.

317
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,180
You remember the Tae Yang Cosmetics deal that you started last year but didn't get to finish?

318
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,420
We're in the midst of revisiting that deal again

319
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,830
and you know how your relationship with their CEO Min is strong.

320
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,430
So? What do you want?

321
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,380
We finally were able to squeeze in a meeting with him today

322
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,040
but something's come up with our lead contact.

323
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,520
It's tough to cancel the meeting, as we're already in competition with others that are eyeing this deal.

324
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,940
Why don't you go ahead and meet CEO Min today,

325
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:58,650
and set it up relationally so that the key members can meet again tomorrow?

326
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,800
I'll need you to hurry there, as I'm hearing that he's already waiting at the promised meeting location.

327
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,160
It's a Korean restaurant called Han Gang, room 11.

328
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,990
I'm counting on you, Director Seo.

329
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,170
Is something wrong?

330
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,920
You said it was CEO Min from Tae Yang Cosmetics, yes?

331
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,220
Anything you know about him?

332
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:41,370
Yes. He was very fond of Director Seo, and even wanted to have her as a daughter-in-law;<BR> they had a great relationship.

333
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,530
I don't remember.

334
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,130
At the time, Secretary Kim had assisted you on this deal.

335
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,650
Why don't I talk to Secretary Kim and find out more about him.

336
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,640
Yeah.

337
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:08,040
Don't over-exert yourself. Let's just tell them that something urgent has come up and you can't make it.

338
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,820
Let's do that.

339
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,280
No, I'll do it.

340
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,140
Eun Gi.

341
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,190
If I suddenly say I can't make it, they'll be suspicious.

342
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,040
It's certainly better than overexerting yourself.

343
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,190
I do not want to say I can't do it.

344
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,200
I don't want to say that anymore. I don't want to.

345
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,100
I am confident that I can memorize/ I'll just memorize everything.

346
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:39,810
The kind of person he is, who his family is, what his hobbies are... I can just memorize it all. Right?

347
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,540
<i>His son married last year.

348
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,010
<i>And you were also present at the wedding.

349
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,480
<i>Not too long ago, his grandson was born and he was very happy. So, point this out first, and slowly, and naturally,

350
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,850
<i>flow on with the conversation.

351
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,910
Should we go in together?

352
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,220
No. I can go alone.

353
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,250
Don't worry.

354
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,140
Have you been well all this time?

355
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,770
Last year I saw you and

356
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,990
this is the first time this year.

357
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,610
I attended your anniversary ceremony with my father

358
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,000
and this is the first time we've met since then.

359
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,310
Did it seem that way?

360
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,320
I think it was that way.

361
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,070
I am forgetful these days.

362
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,230
I heard the news about your son.

363
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,430
Then, is Director Seo now....

364
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,470
with President Nam, thinking that he is Representative Min?

365
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,840
With what thought did you do that?

366
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,170
What if this causes problems, and causes CEO Nam to pull out of the deal?

367
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,170
That's what I want.

368
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,470
The more Seo Eun Gi's mistakes are bigger,

369
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,760
the more the image of which the other Directors look at her...

370
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,300
will be more special and deeper.

371
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,160
It just seems like yesterday that I've heard about your son geting married,

372
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,510
and is living happily now.

373
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,000
And you even saw your grandson, right?

374
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,610
And you even saw your grandson, right?

375
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,660
Since I saw you at the wedding,

376
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,270
your daughter-in-law seems like a very wonderful person.

377
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,470
You are very blessed, Chairman.

378
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,430
Are you drunk?

379
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,250
How dare you come here drunk!

380
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,510
Why, a sprouting little wrench like you!

381
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,240
My son is what and what?!

382
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,620
He said that he's not Tae Han Cosmetic's Representative Min.

383
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,910
People have been switched.

384
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,270
This person is...

385
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,180
CEO Nam from Moh Sung Chemical corporation

386
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,620
His son died due to a car accident 5 months ago.

387
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,650
But to a person who just lost his son, I....

388
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,220
<i> Han Jae Hee

389
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,930
What are you?

390
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,650
Why did you come back to Tae San?

391
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,890
What is the reason why you're back?!

392
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,950
Tae San...did you come back to ruin it?

393
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,170
Because you couldn't believe that Han Jae Hee is the Chairman!

394
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,260
Ruining what is already done....

395
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,070
Starting a fire...

396
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,110
Is that why you came back?!

397
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,140
You can't possibly do this if that is not the case.

398
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,570
To the person who lost his only son not too long ago,

399
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,780
you said what?!

400
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,050
Isn't something wrong with your brain?

401
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,490
Chairman Nam who got hurt because of you ....

402
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,920
He pulled back from investing in Tae San resort.

403
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,030
How will you take responsibility?

404
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:46,280
How will you take the responsibility!?

405
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,260
You told me wrong.

406
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,280
You

407
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,270
told me to go meet Tae An Cosmetics Representative Min....

408
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,790
Why did you hang up?

409
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,260
I have something to say to her.

410
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,440
GIve it to me.

411
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,980
I think we fell into a trap, Eun Gi.

412
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,300
It seems as though news of the investment deal that Seo Eun Gi has ruined<BR> is spreading quickly throughout the organization.

413
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,700
Even the directors have started murmuring amongst themselves about it.

414
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,260
Why don't you reference this incident in next week's board of directors meeting

415
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,990
and I'll prepare the documents to remove her rights to the company.

416
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,820
This ended this more easily than I thought. <br>Concerning Seo Eun Gi.

417
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,080
Shall we celebrate?

418
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,860
Do you want to do that?

419
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,560
This is no fun.

420
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,520
It was fun when it wasn't this easy.

421
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,290
Since it is too easy,

422
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,470
it is no fun.

423
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,650
I am embarrassed. I am really embarrassed.

424
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,150
I should have listened to you, Maru, and

425
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,960
listened to you say not to go.

426
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,080
What did I think I could do like this?

427
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,610
Eun Gi.

428
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,930
Without another person's help,

429
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,720
I can't even stand up.

430
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,210
What did I think I could do? Seriously.

431
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,640
Don't pull yourself down. It'll be better next time.

432
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,040
If you wait, you'll find your memories again.

433
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,980
Why are you in such a hurry?

434
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,650
Because I want to remember you quickly.

435
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,830
Maru...

436
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,170
how much he knows me and loves me...

437
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,950
because I want to remember quickly.

438
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,810
But what is this?

439
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,600
What do I do?

440
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,880
What can I do now?

441
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,000
I shouldn't have come back.

442
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,600
Let's give up.

443
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,440
Let's just give up everything.

444
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,950
Wake up. There is a place you need to go.

445
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,010
Wake up.

446
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,260
You have to deal with the situation you started.

447
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,680
I told you let's drop it.

448
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,160
I told you I would give up Tae San.

449
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,080
Don't be ridiculous.

450
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,820
You don't even have a right to give up on Tae San.

451
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,150
Maru.

452
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,470
What have you done to give up?

453
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,890
Later on when your memories come back and

454
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,980
you reclaim the position you deserve,

455
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,760
if you don't want to have Tae San at that time...

456
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,060
if you feel that it doesn't matter to abandon it, then abandon it then.

457
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,940
I can't do it. How can I?

458
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,510
You saw everything yesterday. You saw how I became a laughingstock

459
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,400
and crumbled down like an idiot.

460
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,700
Didn't you already see all of that, Maru

461
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,880
You can do it.

462
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,080
I can't do it. I can't do anything.

463
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,000
You can do it.

464
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,100
I am the evidence of that.

465
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,050
Where are you going? I got off alone and where are you going?

466
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,610
Team Leader Kang's words were right.

467
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,860
Han Jae Hee's side...

468
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,350
seems to have gotten all the CT and MRI scan records.

469
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,190
They know every truth and

470
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,050
they tested Director Seo like that.

471
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,200
It seems that they only have one objective.

472
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,270
To take away Director Seo's rights to own the corporation.

473
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,510
What should we do now?

00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,220
Not Eun Gi Noona but another thing.

488
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,450
Then, ice cream and Eun Gi Noona.

489
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,060
Is there not anything else you want beside Eun Gi Noona?

490
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,330
This world has lots of luxurious and wonderful things,

491
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,900
but all you can think of is your sister Eun Gi?

492
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,210
Guns, cars, robots, clothes.

493
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:40,100
There's a lot of things in the world.

494
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,970
I said I'll buy you everything, that I'll do everything. But that's all you can think of?

495
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,920
Take Eun Seok upstairs.

496
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,900
Yes.

497
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:55,000
I hate you, Mom.

498
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,690
I hate you, Mom.

499
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,000
How long are you planning to be here?

500
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,030
This isn't going to change anything. Just go home.

501
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,980
President...

502
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,900
I had a reason.

503
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,510
I am dealing with amnesia.

504
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,980
Because I wanted to escape from danger,

505
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:00,580
I pretended to know you on our first meet.

506
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,400
Because I could only think of protecting Tae San,

507
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:16,320
I used you, tricked you, and by bringing up your son, I hurt you.

508
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:17,990
Scorn me as much as you want, till all your anger is gone.

509
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,540
Scorn me as much as you want, till all your anger is gone.

510
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:30,570
This happening...I really want to ask for forgiveness.

511
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,010
You lost your memories?

512
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,500
I just didn't lose my memories.

513
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,550
My brain was also damaged.

514
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,950
No matter what you say, I'm not reversing my decision to pull out of the investment.

515
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:02,130
Furthermore, why would I entrust and invest in someone who has brain damage?

516
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:05,280
I didn't come here to ask you to reverse your investment decision.

517
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,780
I wanted to do whatever I could to

518
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,980
take back the pain I may have caused you.

519
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,970
Why would you divulge such information about yourself that would leave you vulnerable as a businesswoman?

520
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,250
I believe I will recover.

521
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,880
And it will get better.

522
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,420
How do you trust me? What if I spread the news? Then what were you going to do?

523
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,540
I came here, risking everything.

524
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,270
Even if you spread the news, I can't do anything.

525
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,310
And...

526
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,840
I did wrong.

527
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:45,130
I've prepared the documents summarizing the failure to secure the investment deal with CEO Nam

528
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:49,890
We should hold a board of directors meeting and specifically address this issue.

529
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,920
CEO Nam Dae Young is on the line for you.

530
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,870
Put him through.

531
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,720
You are connected now.

532
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,890
Hello CEO Nam

533
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,500
I actually meant to reach out to you myself.

534
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,990
<i>Regarding Director Seo Eun Gi...

535
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,390
I really am at a loss for words on what happened with that deal

536
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,240
I am sorry.

537
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,730
Director Seo is still learning and very inexperienced with business, and I should not have sent her

538
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,490
<i>As soon as possible, I'd like to hold those talks again.

539
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,890
Excuse me?

540
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,840
Oh, and one more thing.

541
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,080
I'd like to make the counterpart for this new investment deal

542
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,790
Director Seo Eun Gi please.

543
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,870
Excuse me?

544
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:42,580
But... I heard that you had to endure an unpleasant encounter with her last time...

545
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,130
Unpleasant encounter? Hmmm...

546
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,250
I don't remember that.

547
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,190
What?

548
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,920
<i>The late Chairman Seo really raised his daughter well.

549
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,880
With Director Seo,  whom I feel I have a connection with,

550
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,410
I would like to start this deal again.

551
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,140
Please bring the Board of Directors together.

552
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:12,000
Let's disclose all of the documents

553
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,430
about Seo Eun Gi.

554
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:22,250
We will now adjourn the discussion about parameters for the new Jeju Premium project.

555
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,120
Please reference the attached documents for further detailed information.

556
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,230
So then we'll move forward on the Jeju Resort project as discussed.

557
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,010
Next,

558
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,560
I wanted to discuss with all of you directors an issue of critical importance

559
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,730
It is about the position of Director Seo Eun Gi.

560
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,470
<i>Let's talk about your previous plans to murder Seo Eun Gi. Right now.</i>

561
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,540
Chairman?

562
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,510
I'm sorry.

563
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:29,670
Let's take a break for a moment and then continue on.

564
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,090
We even lived in the same neighborhood, man. We are brothers, yeah, brothers!

565
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,230
Hey, Jae Hee!

566
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,560
Been a long time.

567
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,390
Wow, after not having seen you for so long, your face looks rather rough.

568
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:16,420
Why don't you go in for a facial massage?

569
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,150
I told Maru everything.

570
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:25,530
About how you asked me to make sure pretty little Seo Eun Gi

571
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:30,180
completely dissappeared forever so she couldn't come back.

572
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,230
Maru tells me

573
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,560
that as long as I go into that conference room

574
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,010
and explain everything you asked me to do

575
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,900
Maru said he'd set me up for the rest of my life.

576
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,420
You know, it's not like I love the guy to death or anything

577
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,610
but at the very least, that man keeps his promises.

578
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:54,050
He is cut from a totally different cloth than you.

579
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,280
He lacks a bit of style, sure, but

580
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,740
he follows through with everything he says he will do.

581
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,990
I mean, you know that better than me,

582
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,790
Right?

583
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,750
Maru paid the consequence for the murder

584
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:11,590
that you committed

585
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,500
and didn't say a peep since then.

586
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,400
By the way, this isn't something that I know because Maru told me

587
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,980
but because so many things are telling from just one thing

588
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,590
and this is exactly the kind of thing you would do.

589
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,830
Isn't that right?

590
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,200
Chairman Han?

591
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,200
What was it that you were about to say earlier?

592
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,340
I'm thinking about announcing a promotion...

593
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:11,360
to make Director Seo Eun Gi

594
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,790
Tae San group's public CEO.

595
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,110
Director Seo Eun Gi has built much business experience now

596
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,570
and I believe that her business philosophy and vision is

597
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,810
something that we need to provide an apt opportunity and space

598
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,930
so that it can grow and be cultivated.

599
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,620
Will you accept my offer, Director Seo Eun Gi?

600
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:22,950
<i>Thank you for watching with us<br>See you next week
