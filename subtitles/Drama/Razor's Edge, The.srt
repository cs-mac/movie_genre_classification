<font color="#ffff00" size=44>The Edge (1997)</font>

2
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,596
(Wind whistling)

3
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,443
(Jet engine)

4
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:03,047
Charles, isn't this great?

5
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,165
Yeah.

6
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,354
(Chuckles)

7
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:09,738
Good afternoon.

8
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:11,016
MECHANIC: Hi.

9
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:17,547
Man, what wouldn't I do
to get my hands on her?

10
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,620
Get your hands on who?

11
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,922
The Challenger...
$20million airplane.

12
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,363
What did you think I meant?

13
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,054
Come along, Charles.
Charles, you coming?

14
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,809
Yeah.
Mr.  Morse Your Assistant asked me to give you this.

15
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,910
OK.
Charles Morse the billionaire?

16
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,598
My God, is that who you are?

17
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,683
Yeah.

18
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,304
MAN: Stuff everything
into the back.

19
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,656
I've taken the liberty
of talking to the pilot.

20
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,351
I've checked the engine log.
The plane's in good shape.

21
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:47,656
Good avionics.
The fella's been around.

22
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,579
Try not to fly
under any low ceiling,

23
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,554
any possibility
of birdstrike, or ice.

24
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,418
What's birdstrike?
Flocks of migrating birds.

25
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,306
If we hit them, we're all dead.
Absolutely.

26
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,713
Especially this time of year.

27
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,563
Any questions, I'll have a
chopper here and fly you out.

28
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,675
We'll be fine.

29
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,755
l said you'd have a good time.
Yeah.

30
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,290
When will you require
your plane?

31
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,470
Bob?
They want the film in 34 hours.

32
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:07,816
I'd say 8:00 tomorrow night.

33
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,570
Eight o'clock tomorrow night.
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:11,813
Thank you.

35
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,601
(Man sneezes)
Oh, no!

36
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,358
You can't handle
this northern weather?

37
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,402
I'll be all right.
It's your own fault.

38
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,955
WOMAN: Hey, is that a new watch?

39
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:53,607
Yeah. Dual time zone.
Tells the time in two places.

40
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:55,136
What for?

41
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,545
If I want to know
the time in New York,

42
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,000
l don't have to add three.

43
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:43,973
CHARLES: Look there.

44
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,680
Right there.

45
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,274
So you built this place
with your own hands?

46
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:52,701
Yes, ma'am.
Been building it all my life.

47
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,456
OK, right this way, folks.

48
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:04,798
You don't have to worry about
keys 'cause we got no locks.

49
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:08,136
Kitchen is always open.
You can fix whatever you like.

50
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,819
The bedrooms and outhouses
are upstairs.

51
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:13,824
We want you to relax,
kick off your shoes,

52
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:17,148
and just get
downhome comfortable.

53
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,505
Hey, Stephen.
Yeah?

54
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:20,977
This is what I'm talking about.

55
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,436
See? That's what I want
for tomorrow:

56
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,883
An unsentimental photograph.

57
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,088
To get a truly
unselfconscious photograph,

58
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:30,939
you almost have to go
back to the 19th century.

59
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,183
How old is that?

60
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,864
Took it last fall. That's
Jack Hawk, a friend of mine.

61
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:38,842
You took the photo?

62
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:42,072
I took the photo.
He took the bear.

63
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:45,271
I'd be out hunting with him
right now if you weren't here...

64
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,512
And I had my rifle sighted in.

65
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:49,271
You interested in books?

66
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,402
Yeah. Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

67
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,753
What?

68
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,122
Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

69
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:57,911
Need to rig up a bench rest.

70
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,207
CHARLES: An ironing board
makes a good bench rest.

71
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:05,652
No disrespect...I'm surprised
you know what a bench rest is.

72
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,350
Charles knows
what everything is.

73
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,624
Got a question, ask him.
Charles knows everything.

74
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,875
Take a mighty accomplished man
to claim that.

75
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,672
I don't claim anything.

76
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,594
WOMAN: Ask him.
See if I'm wrong.

77
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:20,016
Bet you can't stump him.
Bet you I can.

78
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,248
Tell you what...

79
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:28,592
I will give you $5.00...

80
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,701
If you can tell me what's
on the other side of this blade.

81
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,683
It's a rabbit smoking a pipe.

82
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,901
Hmm.

83
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,207
(Man laughs)

84
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:44,145
A rabbit smoking a pipe.
Well, well, well.

85
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,665
Why in the world would that be?

86
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:50,456
Uh, it's a symbol
of the Cree Indians.

87
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,898
On one side there's the panther,

88
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,898
on the other, his prey,
the rabbit.

89
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,030
He sits unafraid.
He smokes his pipe.

90
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,103
It's a traditional motif.

91
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,960
Why is he unafraid?

92
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,351
Because he's smarter
than the panther.

93
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,281
Ha! Sir...you impress me.

94
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,713
Oh. Thank you.

95
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,689
Amazing accomplishment.

96
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,895
No, it's not an accomplishment.
It's a freak.

97
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,207
Ls that so?

98
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,020
Yeah.

99
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:26,900
I seem to retain
all these facts,

100
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,872
but putting them to any useful
purpose is another matter.

101
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,060
MAN: Hmm.

102
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,866
Oh, hey, listen up, folks.

103
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:37,688
We got a problem
with bears around here.

104
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:42,326
Never leave food uncovered,
even in the lodge.

105
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,376
Never.

106
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:48,371
You see a bear near you,
stand still.

107
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,240
Let him know that you know
that he sees you.

108
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,931
And back up, hmm? Real slow.

109
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:03,797
Anybody's in trouble,
get my attention.

110
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,484
I'll be on it
like a duck on a June bug.

111
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,977
Now, make yourselves
comfortable.

112
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,578
I think I'm going to bed.

113
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,618
Shut up!

114
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,279
(Motor running)

115
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,022
Lord, I'm bushed.

116
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,674
New book?

117
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,912
Yes. It's about surviving
in the wilderness.

118
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,505
You're always reading something.

119
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,359
Yeah. My secretary gave it
to me. Do you know why?

120
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,495
Huh?

121
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,438
You know why
she gave me the book?

122
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:55,703
That guy gave me the creeps with
all that talk about the bear.

123
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,475
Why she gave you the book?

124
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,171
Because you're
the salt of the earth.

125
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,096
Oh, is that so?

126
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,325
You're the most excellent man.
That's why I married you.

127
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,355
And you're the only woman
I've ever wanted.

128
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:14,261
Well, then...
see what a lucky guy you are?

129
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,442
Yes, I do.

130
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,512
CHARLES: This is
a special day for me.

131
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:32,243
I know it is. I'm really glad
you came away with us.

132
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,709
You should get away more often.

133
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,506
Charles.

134
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:40,657
Yeah?

135
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,729
Can you go downstairs
and get me a sandwich?

136
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,198
Yeah, OK. Of course.

137
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,118
Did I ever tell you
you're an angel?

138
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,851
No.

139
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,350
Everything but the wings.

140
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,677
A sandwich.

141
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:53,012
(Creaking)

142
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,380
(Roaring)

143
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,497
Aah!

144
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:14,145
Surprise!

145
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,008
Oh, my God.
Charles, are you all right?

146
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,278
Christ, Charles.
Are you all right?

147
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:25,574
Jesus, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

148
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,838
Are you all right?

149
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,629
I'm fine.
Are you all right?

150
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:32,355
Uhhuh.
You sure?

151
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:36,648
EVERYONE SINGING:
Happy birthday dear Charles

152
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,924
Happy birthday.

153
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,684
So you didn't forget.

154
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,411
I could never forget you.

155
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,311
I could never forget.
Come here, baby.

156
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:50,979
Yes, sir! Yes, sir.
A glass of champagne.

157
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:52,445
Champagne for Charles!

158
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,754
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,702
Blow out the candle, Charles.

160
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:58,205
(All cheering)

161
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:03,619
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

162
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,965
Can I get serious for a moment?

163
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,670
Charles, thank you
for your good nature,

164
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,573
your intelligence,
your generosity.

165
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:13,990
Yeah.

166
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,806
Uh, forgive us for this charade.

167
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,293
And in short, happy birthday.

168
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,880
ALL: Happy birthday, Charles.
CHARLES: Thank you.

169
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,702
To a good companion,
a good friend, and a good sport.

170
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,262
And a very brave man.

171
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,481
MAN: Hear, hear!

172
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,567
Here.

173
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,752
Thank you. Ah.

174
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,024
Right.

175
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,548
Oh, Mickey, that's beautiful.

176
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,925
There's an engraving inside.

177
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,311
What's it say, Charles?

178
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:50,370
It says, "To my beloved husband
on his birthday...

179
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,262
'from the luckiest woman
in the world."

180
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:53,342
ALL: Ohh...

181
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:55,358
This is a superb present.
Thank you.

182
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,538
MICKEY: May you wear it
in good health.

183
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:02,591
Here you go.
Here you go, you birthday boy.

184
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,464
Thank you.

185
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,417
MAN: Ooh...
SECOND MAN: What is it?

186
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,935
Oh, look at that!
Good knife.

187
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,055
CHARLES: it's beautiful.

188
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,876
Give him a coin. You got
to give the donor a coin.

189
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,766
Old superstition.

190
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,587
Ah, yes. Thank you.

191
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,280
STEPHEN: Give him a coin?

192
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,726
If someone gives you a knife,

193
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,995
you should give them
a coin in return...

194
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,339
Or it cuts the friendship.

195
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,480
Thank you, Bob.

196
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,696
Charles.

197
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:41,218
Getting late. Work day tomorrow.
Let's pack it in.

198
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,530
(Murmurs of agreement)

199
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,933
Happy birthday, Charles.
Happy birthday.

200
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,268
Thanks. Thank you. Good night.

201
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:48,731
STEPHEN: Come on.
WOMAN: Happy birthday.

202
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:49,920
Thank you.

203
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,257
Happy birthday to you.
Thank you.

204
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,590
Nice looking lady. Your wife?

205
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:03,364
Yes. Why do you ask?

206
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,345
Just like to know
who everybody is.

207
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,264
STEPHEN: Hold on.
It's flaring. Got it.

208
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,375
OK...and let's go.
Five, six.

209
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,429
All righty.

210
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:22,149
Beautiful.
Really beautiful. Great.

211
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,483
Yep.
Yeah, that's great.

212
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,105
Oops.
Could you lift that up?

213
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,246
Are we on here?
Give me the 180.

214
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,450
For me?
No, no, no.

215
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:35,012
ROBERT: One more. Let's go.

216
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,139
We'll do one more roll.
One more roll.

217
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:43,068
Officer...can I sunbathe
on this beach nude?

218
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:44,571
Sorry, lady,
it's against the rules.

219
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,042
But I have a divine right.

220
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:49,020
ROBERT: Your left ain't bad,
either, but rules is rules.

221
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:50,490
Let's go. Check it, please.

222
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:55,994
(Camera clicking)

223
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,892
ROBERT: Beautiful.
MAN: Huh. Kodiak bear.

224
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,656
Soon kill you as look at you.

225
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:09,179
And the one's killed a man,

226
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,587
manhunter for the rest
of his life.

227
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:14,720
Nothing he'd rather eat.
Got the taste of human flesh.

228
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,699
A mankilling machine.

229
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,807
ROBERT: I'm leaving today,
so let's get the shoes polished.

230
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,211
Do I need to walk you
through this whole thing?

231
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:25,245
No, the shoes... 
Scrap the shoes.

232
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:28,186
What the... for God's sakes,
this isn't brain surgery.

233
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,912
It's a fucking pair of shoes.
Get James down here.

234
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,061
Robert, he's sick.

235
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,870
He's sick,
the shoes look like shit,

236
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:37,402
and everything I ask you for...

237
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,583
This is lame.
This is really fucking lame.

238
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,792
The inside of a banana peel
will shine shoes.

239
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,968
Come with me.
A fount of information.

240
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:50,176
Shine shoes with a banana.
You should know that.

241
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,807
He's sick, Bob. James is sick.

242
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:58,560
Well, how sick is he?

243
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,352
He'd have to get better to die.

244
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:03,516
Ha!

245
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,285
That guy.

246
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,457
That guy. He's the guy
for my photograph.

247
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,267
Excuse me. Where is this guy?
He's your friend, right?

248
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,926
Where is this guy in the photo?

249
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:19,419
This is the guy we want,
not some fucking model.

250
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,402
Where... where is he?

251
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:24,826
Jack Hawk?
Cabin up north, 80 miles.

252
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,690
ROBERT: Does he have a phone?

253
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,952
MAN: No phone, no radio.
He'll likely be out hunting.

254
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:34,684
ROBERT: Well, then we'll just
go and find him. Let's go.

255
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,281
Seems you can make a compass
out of a needle.

256
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:44,632
My God. That's a new one on me.

257
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,917
You spend much time
in the woods?

258
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,803
No, I'm afraid most of
my knowledge is theoretical.

259
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,410
Such a...perfect spot.

260
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,193
Such privilege.

261
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,542
It's a shame...
everyone can't enjoy it.

262
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,942
Yeah.

263
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,381
It is remote, and...

264
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,578
That's true. Now, you think
this spot is so remote...

265
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:16,225
That only the few can enjoy it,
but I got a plan.

266
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,149
I got a scheme
to develop this lake,

267
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:20,800
and I think that
you could appreciate it.

268
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:23,740
Now, no need, really,
for you to look at these...

269
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:27,098
'cause you can envision this
better than they can draw,

270
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,662
but I want you to look
at these figures.

271
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,604
Now, here's
the interesting part.

272
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:36,607
For only 30 or
40 million dollars, you can...

273
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:37,628
Ah.

274
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,642
I beg your pardon?

275
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,213
I thought for a moment
you were just being courteous.

276
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,598
What do you mean?

277
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:50,947
Nothing.

278
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,292
Come on, let's go get him.
We'll lose the light.

279
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,373
We lose the light at4:18.

280
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,453
There's the guy we should've
been shooting all along.

281
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:01,500
He's got some character
in his face.

282
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:04,833
Charles.
Yeah?

283
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:07,108
What's the matter?
Huh?

284
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,508
Uh...no, it's nothing.

285
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,513
He's jaded. That's what it is.

286
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,753
That's it. I'm jaded.

287
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,953
We're going on an impromptu
adventure. You come, too.

288
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,679
MICKEY: Charles on an adventure?

289
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:21,626
That's right.
What do you say, Charles?

290
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,230
We'll be back in two hours.

291
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,789
Uh...
Get some air under your wings.

292
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:35,324
All right.

293
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,744
Yeah, OK.

294
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,751
Behold the mighty hunter.
Come on.

295
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,676
Hello!

296
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,925
(Echoing)

297
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,441
(Knocking)

298
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,218
Aw, that's just great.

299
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:17,373
Our model's gone bear hunting.
How butch of him.

300
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,785
Where's he going?

301
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,641
Big Bass Lake, partner!

302
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,293
It's about 20 miles northwest.

303
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:26,146
And we're left here taking
a picture of sweet Fanny Anne.

304
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,033
What do you say, Charles?
Huh?

305
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:31,613
ROBERT: We, uh...

306
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,099
Should we chance it?
Be careful.

307
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:36,480
ROBERT: Careful of what?

308
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:38,009
CHARLES: it's a deadfall.

309
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,701
What's a deadfall?
It's a pit to catch bears.

310
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:42,145
What are we being careful of?

311
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,455
It's a bear pit.

312
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:46,687
What do you say? Should we
press on? Should we be bold?

313
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,250
You really need to find him?

314
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,698
I need to get that film.

315
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,730
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

316
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,159
What do you say?
OK, let's be bold.

317
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:57,920
Hey, there's the spirit
that beat the Japanese.

318
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:19,485
Weather coming inform
the north. Snow, maybe.

319
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:30,749
Could I tell you something?
Hmm? Yeah, if you like.

320
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:35,258
I admire the way you took
that joke last night.

321
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,719
Handled it well.
Embarrassing moment.

322
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,672
l thought you handled it well.
Thank you.

323
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,905
Tough row to hoe,
you think about it.

324
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,279
What would that be?

325
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,734
Oh, all that money.

326
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:48,890
Ah.

327
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,489
A lot of responsibility.

328
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,115
Never knowing
who your friends are,

329
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:57,016
never knowing
what people value you for.

330
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:58,073
Yeah.

331
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:00,284
Must be tough.

332
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,664
Never feel sorry for
a man who owns a plane.

333
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,714
So...what do you
value me for, Bob?

334
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, I tell you what...
l like your style.

335
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:19,832
And I think your wife's
pretty cute, too.

336
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:20,888
Yes.

337
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:24,921
So...how are you planning
to kill me?

338
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,167
Oh, fuck! Hold on!
Oh, shit!

339
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,428
What's happening?!
Oh, no! Jesus!

340
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:38,805
Aah!

341
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,789
(Engine sputtering)

342
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,462
God damn it!
Look out!

343
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,601
Jesus!

344
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,375
(Screaming)

345
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:42,546
(Gurgling)

346
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:04,044
Aah! Aah...

347
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,170
(Gasps)

348
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,515
(Coughing)

349
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:21,902
Bob!

350
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:08,523
OK, get him up. Get him up.

351
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,298
I got him.

352
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,371
Steve. Steve!

353
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,707
(Steve coughing)

354
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,115
Anyone got any matches?

355
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:39,309
Got any matches?

356
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:40,428
Help me up.

357
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,313
We'll make afire right here.
Make afire.

358
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,458
That's better. Yeah.

359
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:24,978
Come on. Oh, God.

360
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:29,968
CHARLES: Come on.

361
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,587
Come on. Come on.

362
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,368
That's it. Come on. Oh, God.

363
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:38,475
Oh, shit.

364
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,550
STEPHEN: I'm cold.

365
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,003
Let's stop fucking about,
shall we, and get the guy warm.

366
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:48,175
Hey, come on. We need those.
We need them.

367
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,268
Come on, Stephen, come on.
Come here.

368
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,897
ROBERT: I let the fire burn out.

369
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:24,209
CHARLES: We've only got
a few flares left.

370
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:25,737
Shouldn't we keep them
for signaling?

371
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,444
What we need is...

372
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:34,543
What we want is wood... quite
a bit of it, for a signal fire.

373
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,913
When they come for us,
they'll see the smoke.

374
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:38,027
Huh?

375
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,454
Why would they come for us?
Hmm?

376
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,288
Well, they know
we went to the cabin.

377
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:47,186
When they go there,
they'll see the note.

378
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,119
Oh.

379
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:05,287
ROBERT: I'm afraid
we're in for a walk.

380
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:07,697
What's that mean,
'we're in for a walk"?

381
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,253
What the fuck does that mean?

382
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,536
I once read an interesting book.

383
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:23,052
It said that most people
lost in the wilds, they...

384
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,261
CHARLES: They die of shame.
STEPHEN: What?

385
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:28,042
Yeah.

386
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:32,235
"They die of shame.
'What did I do wrong?"

387
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:34,161
'How could I have gotten
myself into this?"

388
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:38,350
And so they sit there,
and they...die.

389
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,918
They didn't do the one thing
that would've saved their lives.

390
00:30:42,962 --> 00:30:44,369
And what is that, Charles?

391
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,019
Thinking.

392
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,353
Look. Steve, look.

393
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:55,211
All right, here's the lodge.

394
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:58,986
Here's the cabin where
we were supposed to have gone.

395
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,586
This is where we did go...

396
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,473
Through this pass,
mountains, river.

397
00:31:04,402 --> 00:31:07,402
They'll be looking for us
in the south, all right?

398
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:10,670
If we can get back south
of this pass by tonight,

399
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:11,883
we can use the flares.

400
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:13,809
How do we find it in the woods?

401
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:15,216
Head south.

402
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,381
Aha. We head south. How do
we know which way is south?

403
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:21,995
OK, uh...

404
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,488
Look.

405
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:27,725
Point the hour hand at the sun.

406
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,543
Halfway between the hour hand
and 12:00 is south.

407
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:33,163
This is broken.
Give me your watch.

408
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,912
Mine's busted, too.

409
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,588
Steve?
It's lost.

410
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:44,014
OK. All right, I'll tell you.

411
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:47,464
Uh...the birds will be flying
south. We'll follow them.

412
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,353
What if we can't see them?
Sorry I got us into this!

413
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,727
Stop that! Stop it!

414
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,499
Just stop it.

415
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:59,660
Where are you going?
Gonna make a compass.

416
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:03,848
Uh...

417
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:11,496
Right. You take a needle,
rub it on silk, magnetize it.

418
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:13,799
And, uh...

419
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:17,516
Here, place it on a leaf. Here.

420
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,511
You have a compass.

421
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:23,178
Who travels with a needle?

422
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,348
Ah.

423
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:30,376
Here.

424
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:49,864
Ha ha! Oh, shit.

425
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:55,917
You see? It works.

426
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,114
It works.

427
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:01,766
That peak is south.

428
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,973
What if it isn't?
Huh?

429
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,626
It is. Has no choice. It's drawn
by the Earth's magnetism.

430
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:09,452
I know how it works, Charles.

431
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,943
Good. Then you know.
That's south.

432
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:14,606
What do we do when we get there?

433
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,883
Take another sighting.

434
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,493
It doesn't feel south, Charles.

435
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:27,759
Just because you're lost doesn't
mean your compass is broken.

436
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,345
Come on.

437
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,411
The Vikings would steer
their ship with a rope.

438
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:04,269
A rope?
How'd they do that, Charles?

439
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,790
They'd have these two set points
on the land...

440
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,416
They'd left behind
or sailed away from,

441
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:12,586
and they'd line them up,
and that would be their bearing.

442
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:16,997
Then they'd trail this long rope
behind the ship,

443
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,229
pointing it at those two
points... the hill or whatever.

444
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,117
You might want to conserve
your breath.

445
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,750
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

446
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:39,589
Got to get through by nightfall.

447
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,112
Come on.

448
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:46,246
What are the odds
thatthey'll see us,

449
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,748
thatthey'll see the flares?

450
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,967
ROBERT: Damn fine.

451
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,164
You think so?

452
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,857
I don't know,
but I have to say so, don't I?

453
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,482
ROBERT: City boy.

454
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,614
Charles.
Yeah?

455
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:12,036
Is it my diseased imagination,
or did you say,

456
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:13,834
"'How are you planning
to kill me?"

457
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:17,325
Did you say that?
Yeah.

458
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:22,283
What did that mean? Why would
l want to kill you, Charles?

459
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:24,840
For my wife.

460
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:27,912
For Mickey?
Yeah.

461
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:30,978
That's a bizarre way
to meet girls.

462
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:33,323
I'd kill you to get
next to your wife?

463
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:34,818
I've seen you with her.

464
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,275
Charles, baby...

465
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,675
ROBERT: We work together.

466
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:46,243
CHARLES: No.
I've seen the way you are.

467
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:49,133
No offense, Charles,
but I can get my own girl,

468
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:51,271
if you've noticed
since we've known each other.

469
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:53,032
And P.S., you're a powerful guy.

470
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,883
Why would I want
to antagonize you, Charles?

471
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:58,758
For the money.

472
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:01,923
Oh.

473
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:04,133
The money.

474
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:08,259
Now it's the broad, now it's
the boodle. Nothing is safe.

475
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,280
Rich man. All anybody wants is
to take something from you,

476
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:17,014
and when they want it
bad enough, to kill you.

477
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:25,747
You know something, Charles?
The rich are different.

478
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:49,650
STEPHEN:
How far do you think it is?

479
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,628
Can't be more
than about 10 miles.

480
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:53,774
Aah!
What?

481
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:55,918
A stitch. A stitch in my side.

482
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,965
Find a round stone.
What?

483
00:36:58,005 --> 00:37:00,013
Find a round stone.
Spit under it.

484
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,329
Old Indian remedy?

485
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,609
Yeah, that's right.

486
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,876
You think I'm a fool.

487
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:09,747
No. Old Indian remedy.
Makes sense.

488
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:12,465
Make him slow down,
find a round stone,

489
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:15,152
take his mind off it,
make him stretch, bend over.

490
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,556
You think I'm a fool
because of what I said.

491
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:19,312
About what?
About my wife.

492
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,008
Ah, what you said about your wife.

493
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:27,122
What I think...l think that
you got too much money,

494
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:29,677
uh...latent homosexuality,
lots of other good stuff,

495
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:30,731
paranoia...

496
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:33,391
We'll all get together
when we get back,

497
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:36,462
you and me and your wife,
and we'll get into a hot tub...

498
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:40,908
And, um...bare our feelings,
and, um...

499
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:47,826
Look, even if I wanted to kill
you, I need you to get home,

500
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,354
you fucking idiot.

501
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,786
Needing people.
Isn't it a bitch?

502
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,024
Who are we talking about?
Fannie Farmer.

503
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:57,265
The mother of
level measurement here.

504
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,147
Good to know you have a hero.
Oh, cheering up, are we?

505
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,547
Regaining our impertinent,
feisty demeanor, eh?

506
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,987
It's good of you to notice.

507
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,092
Knows all, tells all.
(Animal roars)

508
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,212
Wait.

509
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,642
Listen, listen.

510
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,018
(Animal growling)

511
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:41,168
Come on.

512
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,144
(Growling)

513
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:16,872
(Bear growls)

514
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,207
(Twigs snapping)

515
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:21,836
(Bear roars)

516
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:23,916
Come on!

517
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:46,926
Charles, come on!

518
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:06,281
We'll never make it.
Now, then...

519
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:09,552
This tree. Come on! Hurry. Pull!

520
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,674
Steve, now! Pull! Help me!

521
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,056
(Grunting)

522
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,881
Come on.

523
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,832
One, two, three!

524
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:23,084
(Grunting)

525
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,218
(Bear roaring)

526
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:35,561
Up!

527
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:37,899
Up!

528
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,663
(Bear growls)

529
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:55,600
OK.

530
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,533
STEPHEN: Come on!

531
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:18,414
STEPHEN: Easy!

532
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:22,959
STEPHEN: Keep coming!

533
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,003
STEPHEN: Charles, go!

534
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,827
Yes!
Take it easy, Charles.

535
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:34,062
Look out! Look out. Come on.

536
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:36,880
Charles, it's OK.
You got it. Come on!

537
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:39,052
Just keep coming!
Come on, Charles!

538
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,096
STEPHEN:
Just keep coming, Charles.

539
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,735
STEPHEN: Keep coming!
CHARLES: Aah...

540
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,385
STEPHEN: Charles!

541
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,608
STEPHEN: Charles! Shit!
ROBERT: Hang on!

542
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:54,958
ROBERT: Oh... Jesus!

543
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,638
STEPHEN:
Charles, hang on! Hang on!

544
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:00,101
Charles! Char...

545
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:01,670
Hold on!

546
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,057
(Roars)

547
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,055
Aah...

548
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:16,998
ROBERT: Charles, hang on!
CHARLES: Aah!

549
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,451
You OK?
Yeah.

550
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,244
(Bear roaring)

551
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,140
Let's go.

552
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:07,148
CHARLES: Oh, God.

553
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,453
CHARLES: I lost the flares.

554
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,691
ROBERT: We'll get by.
CHARLES: How?

555
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:20,999
ROBERT: I've got, uh...
six matches left.

556
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,294
ROBERT: A signal fire.
CHARLES: No.

557
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,942
ROBERT: We'll make a signal
fire. The plane will see us.

558
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,429
Charles?
Snap out of it, Charles.

559
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:34,253
It's gonna be fine, Charles.
It's gonna be fine.

560
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:35,693
Which way is it, Charles?

561
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,155
It's up there.

562
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,311
Man, come on.

563
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,324
Oh, God. Aah.

564
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:41,610
You OK?
Yeah.

565
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:42,791
OK.

566
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,041
You saved me.

567
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,053
Get over it.
I need you to navigate.

568
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:48,100
You saved me.

569
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:49,866
I couldn't kill you
with Stephen around.

570
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:52,204
I'd have to kill him, too.

571
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,061
Come on. You saved my life.

572
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:55,982
Buy me something nice
when we get home.

573
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:57,770
How do you like your coffee?

574
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,042
I like my coffee
like I like my women.

575
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:01,125
Bitter and murky.

576
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:11,780
CHARLES:
I lost the bloody flares.

577
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:15,367
ROBERT: Hey, remember you told
me why people die in the woods?

578
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:16,900
CHARLES:
Yeah, they die of shame.

579
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:18,469
ROBERT: Take a lesson from it.

580
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,543
We want to get up... top of
that rise, high as possible...

581
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:23,011
Let the plane see the fire.

582
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:30,540
Why would they even
come looking for us?

583
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:33,388
Know what happens
when you misplace a billionaire?

584
00:44:34,445 --> 00:44:36,616
Gonna make some story
when we get back home.

585
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:41,126
Yes. Quite a change from, "That
cab driver was so rude to me."

586
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:42,409
(Laughing)

587
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:00,551
ROBERT: See anything?

588
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,079
No.

589
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:49,928
CHARLES: Let's go.

590
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,773
Oh, my God.

591
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,160
STEPHEN: Oh, shit.

592
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,129
CHARLES: OK, let's see.

593
00:46:57,323 --> 00:46:59,657
Hey, maybe the buckle
threw it off.

594
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,106
What are we gonna do?
Well...

595
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,335
What are we going to do, OK?
We're going to die out here!

596
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,712
Nobody knows where we are,

597
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,943
and we don't know
what the hell we're doing here!

598
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:18,400
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

599
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:21,225
Nobody knows where we are.
We got nothing to eat!

600
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,446
All right, Steve. Look.

601
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:29,354
Look here.
This is what we're gonna do.

602
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,459
(Snaps open knife)

603
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:34,946
You see this?
Gonna make a spear, all right?

604
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,912
You...you want me to make
a fucking spear?

605
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:42,696
Yeah. We need you
to make one for fishing.

606
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,454
Go on, take that. Take it.

607
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:48,644
Good. Fine. OK, you can do that.

608
00:47:49,386 --> 00:47:52,256
(Chuckles)
They'll never find us.

609
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:57,826
They will. And even if they
don't, we'll walk out of here.

610
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:59,110
Do as I say.

611
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,330
I'm gonna make afire.
Come on! Get on with it.

612
00:48:04,746 --> 00:48:05,990
It'll be OK.

613
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,400
What is he gonna do,
make a spear?

614
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:18,216
Is he gonna fish for our dinner?

615
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,901
I wanted to give him
something to do, that's all.

616
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:24,483
Are they gonna come for us?
You are an important guy, right?

617
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:25,536
Right?

618
00:48:26,634 --> 00:48:28,096
Look, I'm talking to you!

619
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:33,281
What would you like to do, huh?
Should we lay down and die?

620
00:48:35,658 --> 00:48:37,250
Should we lie down and die?!

621
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,817
(Echoes)

622
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,394
There's nobody here but us.

623
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,533
Have I missed something?

624
00:48:50,825 --> 00:48:53,378
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

625
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:55,361
OK.

626
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,379
STEPHEN: God!

627
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:00,416
Shit!

628
00:49:01,545 --> 00:49:03,106
Shit.

629
00:49:03,145 --> 00:49:05,382
CHARLES: Take your hands away.
STEPHEN: Aah...

630
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,994
STEPHEN: Oh! Oh, it's...
CHARLES: Take your hands away.

631
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:11,586
Shit! What have I done?
What have I done?

632
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,901
STEPHEN: Oh, shit...

633
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:15,919
Jesus.

634
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,197
It's deep.

635
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,957
I'm not gonna lose my leg!

636
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,270
It'll be all right.

637
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:21,734
STEPHEN: Oh...

638
00:49:21,777 --> 00:49:24,144
Press down, both hands.
OK.

639
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:25,639
Keep them there.
OK.

640
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:27,274
All right? OK.

641
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:28,873
OK.

642
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:31,247
CHARLES: I'm gonna
pull this tight, OK?

643
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:32,688
Wait! All right.

644
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:37,068
(Cinches bandage)
(Stephen screams)

645
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:39,274
CHARLES: OK.

646
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:42,701
Bury this.

647
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,899
CHARLES:
Start building the fire.

648
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:49,481
(Stephen moaning)
You'll be all right.

649
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,713
CHARLES: ls that all right?
Not too tight?

650
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:54,443
STEPHEN: No, it's great.
CHARLES: Good.

651
00:49:55,601 --> 00:50:00,173
CHARLES: Well, it's a clean cut.
Lt bled clean.

652
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:05,414
CHARLES: If we change
the bandages regularly,

653
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:07,148
it should knit up fine.

654
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,172
Guess I'm no lumberjack.

655
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,288
Ah...

656
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:17,871
You're doing fine, Steve. Fine.

657
00:50:17,904 --> 00:50:19,530
You know something?
What?

658
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,145
You're all right.

659
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:25,865
Am l?

660
00:50:26,832 --> 00:50:30,127
No, I mean it.
Very thoughtful man.

661
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,746
Thank you.
And I appreciate it.

662
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:35,562
It's my pleasure.

663
00:50:37,296 --> 00:50:38,986
STEPHEN:
Are we getting out of here?

664
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,734
CHARLES: Yes, we are.
STEPHEN: How are we getting out?

665
00:50:42,768 --> 00:50:43,880
CHARLES: Uh...

666
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:47,914
OK, you see this...

667
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,532
See that constellation?

668
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,990
Cassiopeia... the big W.

669
00:50:56,112 --> 00:51:00,105
OK...try the right edge
of the W.

670
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:05,195
Points to the North Star.
The North Star is north.

671
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:08,231
Tomorrow, we walk south
to the river.

672
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:09,897
The river will take us home.

673
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:12,747
Will it work better
than that compass?

674
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,517
Yeah.
(Chuckles)

675
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,664
l hope so.

676
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:22,155
Why do people die in the woods?

677
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:25,930
They die of shame.

678
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,647
Yeah.

679
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,960
Puts things in perspective,
doesn't it?

680
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,712
What's that?

681
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,900
Out here. A little different
from the fashion world.

682
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:02,858
Different from snorting coke
off the girls' hipbones.

683
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:05,799
In what way?

684
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:11,981
(Laughing)

685
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:23,022
Charles, you know,
you're starting to loosen up.

686
00:52:23,054 --> 00:52:24,264
You think so?

687
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,634
That's my report.

688
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:28,045
(Chuckles)

689
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,899
(Thunder)

690
00:52:43,982 --> 00:52:45,324
(Stephen groaning)

691
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,032
Huh?
So?

692
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,269
What?

693
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:26,444
He's not that badly hurt.

694
00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:30,631
Then what are our chances
when all is said and done?

695
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,808
We can walk out of here
and probably die,

696
00:53:32,845 --> 00:53:35,234
or we can stay here,
and he'll certainly die.

697
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:36,706
I think our chances are good.

698
00:53:37,677 --> 00:53:39,051
Seriously?
Yeah.

699
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,610
They're better than good.

700
00:53:41,645 --> 00:53:43,817
We know that that's north,
and that's...

701
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:52,685
Charles? Charles!

702
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:56,998
I told you we had to bury those.

703
00:53:57,037 --> 00:53:58,630
ROBERT: What's the difference?
STEPHEN: Hey!

704
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,971
CHARLES: We must get them down!
ROBERT: Why?

705
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,078
They put the smell of blood
in the air!

706
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:04,164
Hey!
(Growling)

707
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:07,139
ROBERT: I'm not climbing a tree
in the middle of a thunderstorm!

708
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,028
CHARLES: We have to get it down!
ROBERT: You climb the tree!

709
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,165
CHARLES: Give me a hand.
I'll get them down.

710
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:13,666
STEPHEN: Oh, shit!
CHARLES: What?

711
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,497
Oh, shit! Oh, sh...

712
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:17,158
(Screaming)

713
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:23,274
Aah! Whoa! Oh, shit! Oh!

714
00:54:23,308 --> 00:54:25,348
ROBERT: Charles, stay back!
CHARLES: Go away!

715
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,875
(Roaring)

716
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,558
Aah!

717
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,701
CHARLES: Hyah!
ROBERT: Charles!

718
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:35,082
Charles, stay back!

719
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:36,545
(Yelling)

720
00:54:36,588 --> 00:54:37,635
(Roaring)

721
00:54:46,444 --> 00:54:47,938
CHARLES: Bob!

722
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,507
ROBERT: For God's sake, Charles!

723
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,646
Come on, Charles!

724
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:54,310
(Screaming)

725
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:55,461
(Roaring)

726
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:01,089
STEPHEN: Stop!

727
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:02,180
Steve!

728
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,562
(Screaming)

729
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:10,564
Steve!

730
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,837
(Screaming stops)

731
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:16,901
Oh, God.

732
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:46,342
Come on! Come on!

733
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:36,010
We navigate by the stars.

734
00:56:37,323 --> 00:56:39,657
We travel by night
if there's a moon.

735
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,381
We can't live out
the winter here.

736
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,670
The river will take us out.

737
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:50,041
They won't look for us
this far north?

738
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:52,400
We have to walk out.

739
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:54,865
Ah.

740
00:56:56,825 --> 00:56:58,134
What do we eat?

741
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:01,014
I'm working on it.

742
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:11,916
(Chattering)

743
00:57:42,386 --> 00:57:44,775
Aah ha ha ha ha!

744
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:46,028
Whoo!

745
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:47,593
(Laughing)

746
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:51,440
CHARLES: How about that?

747
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:54,411
Yeah!

748
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,313
Hey, is...

749
00:57:59,282 --> 00:58:00,297
Hang on.

750
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:06,408
(Helicopter)

751
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:13,772
Come on!

752
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,948
Come on!

753
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,248
Wait!

754
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,680
Wait!

755
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,562
No!

756
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:53,066
No! Wait! Stop!

757
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:28,456
Oh, God.

758
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:43,369
Did you know that
you can make fire from ice?

759
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,259
You can make fire from ice.

760
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:51,304
Hello! I'm talking to you.

761
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,541
Do you know how that
could be done? Bob?

762
00:59:57,585 --> 00:59:58,894
Can you think?

763
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:05,766
You...moneyed folk, isn't it?

764
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:10,927
isn't it?
Fire from ice. You know how?

765
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,643
Sit up there, drinks and golf,
screwing the maid,

766
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,502
but get you in an emergency...

767
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:16,997
Try.
And you bloom.

768
01:00:18,192 --> 01:00:20,875
You make me sick, you know that?

769
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,024
I'm sure I do.

770
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:23,558
You fuckin' make me sick!

771
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,699
I mean, what puts you off?
Jews and taxes!

772
01:00:26,736 --> 01:00:28,558
Fire from ice.
Can you think how?

773
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:30,217
I don't want to know, Charles!

774
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:31,597
(Crying)

775
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:42,245
You have anything
you'd like to live for? Hmm?

776
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:48,615
You know something?
You know something?

777
01:00:48,656 --> 01:00:51,852
Maybe we were right
to have let people like you...

778
01:00:51,888 --> 01:00:53,349
Run this country
all these years.

779
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,333
You're the only ones
dense enough!

780
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,693
I'm not dense,
l just have no imagination.

781
01:01:00,944 --> 01:01:02,253
(Laughing)

782
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:11,371
Making a decision tree,
is that it?

783
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:12,684
That's it, Bob.

784
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,338
We can't think they'd come back?

785
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,003
No. You shouldn't think
they would come back.

786
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:34,249
(Crying)

787
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,644
They've scouted this area,
and they'll move on.

788
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:00,296
All right.

789
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:04,136
All right.

790
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:08,137
Fire from ice.

791
01:02:10,446 --> 01:02:11,690
Let's have it.

792
01:02:12,878 --> 01:02:16,227
Ice, if you take it
into your hands,

793
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,572
can be molded into a lens...

794
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,158
...which will concentrate
sunlight into fire.

795
01:02:23,182 --> 01:02:24,229
Hmm?

796
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:42,697
I doubt we'll be reduced to
that. We still have the matches.

797
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:45,068
I believe that's all we'll need.

798
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,794
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

799
01:03:55,917 --> 01:04:00,007
CHARLES: Well, there's, uh...
there's fish in there.

800
01:04:01,352 --> 01:04:04,003
What will we use for tackle?
How will we bait them?

801
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,076
Wouldn't you find that
attractive?

802
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:18,944
I don't know. L, uh...

803
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:22,212
It's gold.
The whole world longs for it.

804
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:26,844
I'm not in a very humorous mood.

805
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:28,796
Come on.
Don't go native on me, Bob.

806
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:33,795
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I'm...very tired.

807
01:04:33,831 --> 01:04:36,417
Why don't you rest...
and gather some wood?

808
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:41,091
(Growling)

809
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,935
(Roaring)

810
01:06:38,117 --> 01:06:43,103
Bob! He's a mankiller... been
following us the whole time.

811
01:06:43,141 --> 01:06:44,418
He's stalking us.

812
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:47,997
Come on!

813
01:07:14,436 --> 01:07:15,680
(Bear roars)

814
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,134
(Bear roars)

815
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,489
(Growling)

816
01:07:59,588 --> 01:08:01,050
(Growling)

817
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,889
He's toying with us.

818
01:08:14,468 --> 01:08:16,126
What are we going to do,
Charles?

819
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:17,210
Huh?

820
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,088
What, do I have a plan?

821
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:24,704
Am I supposed to have a plan?
You tell me.

822
01:08:27,907 --> 01:08:31,355
We can't move.
It won't let us eat.

823
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:35,745
Well...we're going
to starve up here.

824
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:51,874
(Bear growls)

825
01:08:53,507 --> 01:08:54,881
What are we gonna do?

826
01:09:00,163 --> 01:09:01,440
We're gonna kill him.

827
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:13,376
CHARLES: We get him to attack.
Spear, bait.

828
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:17,127
Induce a charge.
Bear charges and rears.

829
01:10:17,161 --> 01:10:19,617
As he falls,
he impales himself on the spear.

830
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:24,678
Same principle as the deadfall...
use his own weight to kill him.

831
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,541
What are we gonna use
to bait him?

832
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:31,040
We lure him.

833
01:10:31,082 --> 01:10:32,576
What?
We lure him!

834
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:39,496
You know...Masai boys in Africa,
11 years old,

835
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,253
they kill lions with spears.

836
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,348
How do we..."lure" him?

837
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:48,288
Elevenyearold boys
kill a lion.

838
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:51,296
Indian boys used to run up
to the bear and slap him...

839
01:10:51,337 --> 01:10:53,476
Count coup on him
as a test of manhood.

840
01:10:53,513 --> 01:10:57,703
No, no, Charles.
How are we going to lure him?

841
01:10:57,737 --> 01:10:58,784
Blood.

842
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:03,111
Blood!

843
01:11:04,265 --> 01:11:06,501
We'll have to distract him,
of course.

844
01:11:07,593 --> 01:11:11,935
We'll have to distract him and
trap him, but it can be done.

845
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:15,173
Do you believe it, Bob?
You believe it?

846
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,583
l don't know, Charles.
Huh?

847
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:18,559
l don't think it'll work.
It will work!

848
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:19,648
No.

849
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:22,558
It will work. What one man
can do, another can do.

850
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:24,389
You can't kill the bear,
Charles. He's...

851
01:11:26,888 --> 01:11:29,736
He's ahead of us all the time,
like he's reading our minds.

852
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,524
He's stalking us,
for God's sakes!

853
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,962
You want to die out here, huh?

854
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,306
Well, then die.
But I tell you what...

855
01:11:44,072 --> 01:11:47,367
I'm not gonna die. No, sirree.
I'm not gonna die.

856
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:50,815
No, I'm gonna kill the bear.

857
01:11:53,224 --> 01:11:54,686
Say, "I'm gonna kill the bear."

858
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,935
Say it. "I'm gonna kill the
bear. I'm gonna kill the bear!"

859
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:02,178
Say it!

860
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,925
I'm gonna kill the bear.
Say it again!

861
01:12:04,969 --> 01:12:07,008
I'm gonna kill the bear.
And again!

862
01:12:07,048 --> 01:12:08,455
I'm gonna kill the bear!

863
01:12:08,488 --> 01:12:10,757
Good. What one man can do,
another can do.

864
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,352
What one man can do,
another can do.

865
01:12:12,392 --> 01:12:13,320
Say it again!

866
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:14,759
What one man can do,
another can do!

867
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:16,734
And again!
What one man can do...

868
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:18,150
Another can do!

869
01:12:18,184 --> 01:12:20,867
Yeah! You're goddamn right.

870
01:12:23,623 --> 01:12:26,525
'Cause today...I'm agonna
kill the motherfucker.

871
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:14,309
(Twig snaps)

872
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:49,505
(Bird shrieks)

873
01:14:18,214 --> 01:14:19,523
(Growling)

874
01:14:31,526 --> 01:14:32,736
(Roaring)

875
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:02,558
(Roaring)

876
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,775
Come on.

877
01:15:20,837 --> 01:15:22,015
Come on.

878
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:26,179
(Roars)
Now.

879
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:39,070
(Bear roars)

880
01:15:39,108 --> 01:15:40,450
(Shrieks)

881
01:15:44,037 --> 01:15:45,019
Run!

882
01:15:45,061 --> 01:15:46,523
(Roaring)

883
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,155
Aah! Oof!

884
01:15:59,428 --> 01:16:00,735
Come on.

885
01:16:02,655 --> 01:16:03,965
Come on!
All right.

886
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:32,504
Aah!

887
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:35,323
Aah!

888
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:39,002
(Roaring)
Hey!

889
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:42,933
CHARLES: Come on,
you son of a bitch!

890
01:16:47,551 --> 01:16:48,664
CHARLES: Hey!

891
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:51,901
Get him in the neck, Charles!

892
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,483
Jesus. Jesus!

893
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:08,310
Over here! Come on! Come on!

894
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:09,463
Aah!

895
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:14,078
Come on, you son of a bitch!

896
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,445
Look out. Look out! Look out!

897
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:18,486
(Yelling indistinctly)

898
01:17:20,862 --> 01:17:22,618
Come on!

899
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:29,878
CHARLES: Hey!

900
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,564
Come on! Charles!
Aah!

901
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:35,453
Charles!

902
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,719
Aah! Ohh!

903
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:48,605
Aah!

904
01:17:48,638 --> 01:17:50,199
(Screaming)

905
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:52,693
Hyah!
(Bear shrieks)

906
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:56,439
Come and get me!
Get me! Come and get...

907
01:17:56,478 --> 01:17:57,493
Come on!

908
01:17:58,302 --> 01:17:59,414
(Groaning)

909
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:04,124
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

910
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:05,467
Aah!

911
01:18:05,502 --> 01:18:08,437
Come here, you motherfucker!
Come and get me!

912
01:18:10,014 --> 01:18:11,476
Charles!

913
01:18:11,518 --> 01:18:13,525
Come and get me!
Charles!

914
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:17,144
Come on! Come on, get me!
Come on, get me!

915
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:18,840
ROBERT: Look out!

916
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:20,765
Charles, look out! Charles!

917
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:24,760
Aah!

918
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:28,339
(Shrieking)
Unh!

919
01:18:28,381 --> 01:18:29,461
Char...

920
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:37,138
(Moaning in pain)

921
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:54,003
Charles?

922
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:06,198
Charles?

923
01:19:26,653 --> 01:19:27,962
(Straining)

924
01:20:19,931 --> 01:20:21,393
Wish we had some salt.

925
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:27,865
You know, you can...you can
season meat with gunpowder.

926
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,209
Did you know that?

927
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,728
Wish we had some gunpowder.

928
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,903
I don't suppose
you made one for me?

929
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:40,248
Yeah.

930
01:20:42,652 --> 01:20:44,375
(Laughs)

931
01:20:44,412 --> 01:20:45,688
Hey...ahem.

932
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:50,683
What do you think?
Oh, yeah.

933
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,144
(Robert hums)

934
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:58,999
What's the matter, Charles?

935
01:20:59,035 --> 01:21:00,115
Nothing.

936
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:02,869
No, really. What?

937
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,194
All my life, I wanted to do
something that was...

938
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:13,081
...that was unequivocal.

939
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,455
Well, Charlie, I certainly
think this qualifies.

940
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:20,657
It's something.

941
01:21:21,915 --> 01:21:24,850
See, Charles, that's why
they call it "personal growth."

942
01:21:24,891 --> 01:21:26,713
A month ago,
Smokey would've reared up,

943
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:28,438
you probably would've
called your lawyer.

944
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:32,538
Nah. I wouldn't do that
to an animal.

945
01:21:32,571 --> 01:21:33,913
(Laughing)

946
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:07,660
OK?

947
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:18,729
(Wind whistling)

948
01:22:33,108 --> 01:22:35,628
CHARLES: So I said, uh...

949
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:40,363
I said, "If this is my life,
then this is my life."

950
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:43,048
But you can change your life.

951
01:22:44,019 --> 01:22:45,481
That's what I'm telling you.

952
01:22:45,523 --> 01:22:47,792
Yeah. Is that true?

953
01:22:47,827 --> 01:22:49,899
Well, why wouldn't it be true?

954
01:22:51,379 --> 01:22:55,787
Because I never knew anybody who
did actually change their lives.

955
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:01,646
I tell you what...

956
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:05,006
I'm going to start my life over.

957
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:09,259
ROBERT: Yeah.

958
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,632
You'd be the first.

959
01:23:16,882 --> 01:23:17,897
Yeah.

960
01:24:20,562 --> 01:24:21,772
(Pounding)

961
01:24:54,065 --> 01:24:56,269
No one's been here
for quite a while.

962
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,285
What do you make of it?
If we're here...

963
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:33,549
That canoe's gonna take us
right out.

964
01:25:33,585 --> 01:25:37,163
You know what we gotta do?
Find out if that canoe floats.

965
01:25:38,225 --> 01:25:39,272
Yeah.

966
01:25:46,384 --> 01:25:48,173
(Laughs)

967
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,386
Hey, it floats!

968
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:50,439
Yeah.

969
01:25:54,128 --> 01:25:55,470
Cup of tea?

970
01:25:55,504 --> 01:25:56,519
Yeah.

971
01:26:22,672 --> 01:26:24,079
(Rattling matches)

972
01:27:21,551 --> 01:27:23,013
(Footsteps)

973
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,461
Ain't got that fire lit yet?
No.

974
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:51,108
Drinking the other fellow's
supplies?

975
01:27:55,246 --> 01:27:58,563
Get back...
I'll send him a check.

976
01:28:01,935 --> 01:28:03,658
ROBERT: Send him a check.
CHARLES: Yeah.

977
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:15,012
Hell of an adventure,
eh, Charles?

978
01:28:16,046 --> 01:28:17,807
Yeah, wasn't it?

979
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:23,848
You know...

980
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,549
ROBERT: I ought to tell you...

981
01:28:30,447 --> 01:28:33,131
ROBERT: If I'd had my camera,
l would've made my fortune.

982
01:28:36,016 --> 01:28:37,128
Made my fortune.

983
01:28:48,335 --> 01:28:50,637
That thing's busted to shit,
isn't it?

984
01:28:50,671 --> 01:28:53,770
It still has some...
sentimental value.

985
01:28:55,599 --> 01:28:56,875
I suppose it does.

986
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:10,570
Can I see your watch, Bob?

987
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:16,617
My watch?

988
01:29:17,999 --> 01:29:20,006
Don't work. I told you. Busted.

989
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:25,155
I know...l know it doesn't work,
but could I see it?

990
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:29,355
New when we left.

991
01:29:32,143 --> 01:29:33,736
Just a piece of junk now.

992
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:42,730
What's the matter, Bob?
Can't do it sober?

993
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:46,342
Yeah.

994
01:29:47,854 --> 01:29:49,993
I suppose you don't
need me anymore.

995
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:52,202
You can find your own way
out of here.

996
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,470
You had no business
with that broad, anyway.

997
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:56,746
You know you don't.

998
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:02,727
You know you don't, Charles.

999
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:06,509
Hey, hey, hey...

1000
01:30:06,542 --> 01:30:08,963
Look at her.
Why did she go with you?

1001
01:30:09,006 --> 01:30:11,209
Why in the hell
did she go with you?

1002
01:30:11,246 --> 01:30:14,345
Your money, for the love of God.
Everyone in the world knew that.

1003
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,194
Are you nuts?

1004
01:30:20,173 --> 01:30:22,661
You went through the airport
with her, everyone said,

1005
01:30:22,701 --> 01:30:24,327
"'There goes a guy with a plane."

1006
01:30:28,974 --> 01:30:30,664
'There goes a guy with a plane."

1007
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:36,490
I'd say you drew tough luck
this time, Charles.

1008
01:30:40,397 --> 01:30:41,445
Well...

1009
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:44,902
That's right.

1010
01:30:47,502 --> 01:30:48,582
Yeah.

1011
01:30:54,062 --> 01:30:55,469
"'For all the nights."

1012
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:58,500
How touching.

1013
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,297
Why torture yourself?

1014
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:04,327
It's over now.

1015
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:15,495
Let's go outside.

1016
01:31:29,773 --> 01:31:31,180
Just tell me one thing.

1017
01:31:32,749 --> 01:31:35,683
Was it from the first,
you and my wife?

1018
01:31:36,749 --> 01:31:38,178
Was it from the first, Bob?

1019
01:31:39,148 --> 01:31:40,806
Come on, Charles.

1020
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:43,627
Ah. Ls that
an indelicate question?

1021
01:31:45,453 --> 01:31:47,820
Come on, Charles. Done is done.

1022
01:31:50,028 --> 01:31:53,127
Well, I'm dying, so...
what difference does it make?

1023
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,000
Why is that so important to you?

1024
01:32:02,989 --> 01:32:04,265
I love her.

1025
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:08,356
I'm sorry. It's time.

1026
01:32:10,413 --> 01:32:12,551
Don't do it.
You live in a dream world.

1027
01:32:12,589 --> 01:32:13,832
You always have.

1028
01:32:15,276 --> 01:32:18,025
Now turn your back.
You don't have to do it.

1029
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,231
The hell I don't.
You know that I do.

1030
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,657
What the fuck are you thinking?
Now turn your back.

1031
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:25,066
I don't want to hear
any more of your nonsense.

1032
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,140
l don't want to hear it!
(Birds scatter)

1033
01:32:28,428 --> 01:32:31,494
How close we've become
and how this and how that...

1034
01:32:31,532 --> 01:32:34,216
You'd have died out here without
me, with all your wealth!

1035
01:32:36,235 --> 01:32:38,952
You understand me?
L said turn your goddamn back!

1036
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:43,393
Bob, listen to me.
Don't go any further, Charles.

1037
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:47,976
I said turn your back.

1038
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,420
No?

1039
01:32:56,715 --> 01:33:01,090
You know, life is a short thing,
Charles, full of betrayal.

1040
01:33:01,132 --> 01:33:03,019
In many ways,
you're well out of it.

1041
01:33:03,052 --> 01:33:05,954
Bob...
Charles, don't... aah!

1042
01:33:05,995 --> 01:33:07,271
(Screaming)

1043
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,085
Be careful of the deadfall.

1044
01:33:17,163 --> 01:33:18,407
(Robert moaning)

1045
01:33:20,619 --> 01:33:22,245
Aah...

1046
01:33:22,283 --> 01:33:25,130
Aah...oh, God, Charles. Oh, God!

1047
01:33:25,163 --> 01:33:27,432
Aah...oh, God,
l think I've broken my...

1048
01:33:29,323 --> 01:33:31,527
I think I've broken my leg,
Charles.

1049
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:35,808
Oh, God, Charles. Aah!

1050
01:33:35,851 --> 01:33:39,113
God. Oh, my God. Oh, God...

1051
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,553
(Groaning)

1052
01:33:59,499 --> 01:34:01,222
Oh, God, Charles, no. Please.

1053
01:34:10,442 --> 01:34:11,555
All right.

1054
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:15,203
Aah! Aah...

1055
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:17,993
Now, try and lie still.

1056
01:34:18,026 --> 01:34:19,455
(Groaning)

1057
01:34:19,498 --> 01:34:20,611
All right.

1058
01:34:22,154 --> 01:34:23,332
(Screaming)

1059
01:34:31,664 --> 01:34:33,005
(Moaning)

1060
01:34:36,911 --> 01:34:38,024
All right.

1061
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:40,326
OK.

1062
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:46,632
OK, Bob.

1063
01:34:50,703 --> 01:34:52,613
I'll take a look
and see what's wrong.

1064
01:34:53,839 --> 01:34:56,687
l don't feel very well.
Take a shot of this.

1065
01:35:00,431 --> 01:35:01,543
All right.

1066
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:06,375
I'm taking a...
just going to take a look here.

1067
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,147
Ow!

1068
01:35:11,182 --> 01:35:12,644
(Moaning)

1069
01:35:13,743 --> 01:35:14,855
Hold on.

1070
01:35:18,574 --> 01:35:21,193
I suppose I only have
so much of that in me.

1071
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:22,343
Yeah.
Charles?

1072
01:35:24,014 --> 01:35:26,469
Charles, what is it?
What is it, Charles?

1073
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,869
I...l don't feel very...

1074
01:35:32,014 --> 01:35:34,469
I can't say I feel
very well at all, Charles.

1075
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:42,347
Hell of a guy. Hell of a guy.
L never told you that.

1076
01:35:44,494 --> 01:35:47,145
Fucking shit hole of a world,
eh, Charles?

1077
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:48,709
Yeah.

1078
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,539
Shit hole of a world.

1079
01:35:50,574 --> 01:35:52,396
Yeah. OK.

1080
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:55,428
I need you to...
What?

1081
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:57,859
I need you
to put pressure on it.

1082
01:35:57,902 --> 01:36:00,236
Aah! No... aah!

1083
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,212
(Screaming)

1084
01:36:02,254 --> 01:36:03,815
Bob?

1085
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:04,901
Aah...

1086
01:36:12,078 --> 01:36:13,157
Bob?

1087
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:17,639
Yeah.

1088
01:36:21,869 --> 01:36:22,982
Jesus.

1089
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:53,410
(Bird shrieks)

1090
01:37:20,045 --> 01:37:21,867
Ah...

1091
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,046
CHARLES: Bob?

1092
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:27,810
Listen.

1093
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,563
We're going to get you
out of here, OK?

1094
01:38:24,684 --> 01:38:27,051
Hell of a way to end an outing,
eh, Charles?

1095
01:38:29,164 --> 01:38:30,374
You'll be fine.

1096
01:38:32,331 --> 01:38:33,760
It must be quite a thing...

1097
01:38:34,603 --> 01:38:36,513
Quite a thing...to have so much.

1098
01:38:36,556 --> 01:38:37,865
(Coughing)

1099
01:38:40,715 --> 01:38:44,098
Everybody...
wants something from you...

1100
01:38:45,196 --> 01:38:46,537
Everybody depending on you.

1101
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:48,997
Don't talk so much.

1102
01:38:51,947 --> 01:38:53,158
They're so pushy.

1103
01:38:53,899 --> 01:38:55,175
Save your energy.

1104
01:38:56,235 --> 01:39:00,130
I...I don't really feel
quite 100 percent, Charles.

1105
01:39:01,451 --> 01:39:03,273
I'm going to take us
into shore,

1106
01:39:03,307 --> 01:39:05,674
find us afire, keep you warm.

1107
01:39:19,115 --> 01:39:20,194
Hey.

1108
01:39:22,603 --> 01:39:24,991
Why would you save
a piece of shit like me?

1109
01:39:25,867 --> 01:39:27,241
Let's say it's a challenge.

1110
01:39:29,322 --> 01:39:31,395
The sporting aspect of it, eh?

1111
01:39:31,435 --> 01:39:34,370
Yeah.
No. I know what it is.

1112
01:39:35,946 --> 01:39:39,242
You never had a buddy.
That's the thing, isn't it?

1113
01:39:39,274 --> 01:39:40,485
That's right.

1114
01:39:40,523 --> 01:39:42,410
Now I'm your pet project.

1115
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:46,310
I'm your hobby farm,
eh, Charles?

1116
01:39:46,346 --> 01:39:47,972
(Coughs)

1117
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,384
Yeah. Whatever you say, Bob.

1118
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:53,600
The guy who tried to kill you.
That's terrific, Charles.

1119
01:39:53,642 --> 01:39:55,911
Nah, you wouldn't have done it.

1120
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:59,426
Yes, I would've,
you stupid son of a bitch.

1121
01:39:59,467 --> 01:40:01,190
(Coughing)

1122
01:40:01,226 --> 01:40:02,437
Yes, I would.

1123
01:40:11,868 --> 01:40:13,875
Well, then...you would.

1124
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:22,070
What'll you do
when you get back?

1125
01:40:22,107 --> 01:40:25,369
Huh? Ah, it's not important.

1126
01:40:27,323 --> 01:40:28,730
It is important to me.

1127
01:40:32,923 --> 01:40:34,581
I may not go back.

1128
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,049
(Coughing)

1129
01:40:38,267 --> 01:40:40,405
What do you mean?
Of course you'll go back.

1130
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:43,509
To what?

1131
01:40:45,563 --> 01:40:48,946
No, I don't feel sorry
for you, Charles.

1132
01:40:50,523 --> 01:40:53,043
Never feel sorry for a man
that owns a plane.

1133
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:55,025
(Coughing)

1134
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:58,329
Come on. Hold on. Hold on.

1135
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:01,008
I'll get us out of here.

1136
01:41:02,843 --> 01:41:03,890
Bullshit.

1137
01:41:06,043 --> 01:41:08,629
Hey...I'm dying.

1138
01:41:10,683 --> 01:41:12,952
I'm dying, and I never did
a goddamn thing.

1139
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,595
But wait.

1140
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:18,767
Charles, I gotta tell you.

1141
01:41:21,083 --> 01:41:22,359
Charles...
What?

1142
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,348
I'm sorry.

1143
01:41:30,299 --> 01:41:31,706
I'm sorry, what I did.

1144
01:41:33,627 --> 01:41:37,336
And your wife, Charles...
Listen to me, Charles.

1145
01:41:38,266 --> 01:41:41,332
She was never in on it,
this business...

1146
01:41:42,842 --> 01:41:44,751
(Coughs)

1147
01:41:44,794 --> 01:41:45,940
Doing you in.

1148
01:41:47,578 --> 01:41:49,237
I swear it on my life.

1149
01:41:52,538 --> 01:41:53,585
Charles...

1150
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:58,578
Thanks. Very kind of you
to say so, Bob.

1151
01:41:58,618 --> 01:41:59,730
(Laughs)

1152
01:42:01,754 --> 01:42:04,242
Never too late for
a kind gesture, eh, Charles?

1153
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:07,097
Don't die on me, Bob.

1154
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,199
Don't tell me what to do.

1155
01:42:15,577 --> 01:42:16,952
(Distant helicopter)

1156
01:42:19,673 --> 01:42:20,753
Hold on.

1157
01:42:20,793 --> 01:42:22,222
(Helicopter)

1158
01:42:23,225 --> 01:42:24,240
We're getting out.

1159
01:42:31,993 --> 01:42:33,138
Hey!

1160
01:42:34,297 --> 01:42:35,726
Over here!

1161
01:42:37,081 --> 01:42:38,325
Over here!

1162
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:40,623
Hey!

1163
01:42:59,832 --> 01:43:00,912
Hey!

1164
01:43:05,465 --> 01:43:08,334
Hey! Over here!

1165
01:43:09,336 --> 01:43:10,351
Hey!

1166
01:43:23,032 --> 01:43:24,014
Hey!

1167
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:27,381
(Charles laughs)

1168
01:43:27,417 --> 01:43:28,497
Hey!

1169
01:43:29,752 --> 01:43:31,094
(Laughing)

1170
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:39,991
Bob! Ha!

1171
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:42,609
(Sighs)

1172
01:45:51,062 --> 01:45:53,200
Why is the rabbit unafraid?

1173
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:57,776
'Cause he's smarter
than the panther.

1174
01:45:57,814 --> 01:45:58,829
Yeah.

1175
01:46:12,886 --> 01:46:15,701

MAN: Mr. Morse, Channel 9 News.
Can we get a statement, sir?

1177
01:46:18,614 --> 01:46:20,021
(All talking at once)

1178
01:46:29,814 --> 01:46:32,432

Give the man some space.

1179
01:46:40,662 --> 01:46:42,811

1183
01:47:09,178 --> 01:47:11,960
Mrs. Morse, how did you feel
during your husband's ordeal?

1184
01:47:16,219 --> 01:47:17,298
Uh...

1185
01:47:18,778 --> 01:47:20,207
We're all put to the test.

1186
01:47:21,275 --> 01:47:24,570
But it never comes in the form
or at the...

1187
01:47:26,555 --> 01:47:29,304
...point we would prefer,
does it?

the other men, your friends...

1189

01:47:41,307 --> 01:47:42,648
MAN: What happened to them Sir?

1191
01:47:46,459 --> 01:47:48,051
How did they die, sir?

1192
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:55,347
They died...

1193
01:47:56,442 --> 01:47:57,751
...saving my life.
