1
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,874
And, here they come.

2
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,374
Stepping out onto the field.

3
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:59,415
ln Europe and the world over,
this runner...

4
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,665
... is known as the lndian saint.

5
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,874
He is lndia's Milkha Singh.

6
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,332
Milkha Singh

7
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,207
lndia's Milkha Singh
still holds the world record.

8
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:15,249
Can he win gold for
lndia in the 400m race?

9
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,665
On your mark.

10
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,665
Set.

11
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,999
The historic race has begun.

12
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:38,207
Milkha Singh leads...

13
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,290
lt's time.

14
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,832
... will this be
lndia's first gold?

15
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:57,290
At 200mts the gold
is virtually in his pocket.

16
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,999
Run Milkha!

17
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:11,082
Run!

18
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:56,249
Why did he look back?

19
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,624
Hello?

20
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:38,207
Hello, Milkha?

21
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,499
What happened?

22
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,040
Ranvir, after the
Rome Olympics loss...

23
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,040
l understand Milkha's mental state.

24
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,457
But you see...

25
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,040
... our Prime Minister and Pakistan's
President General Ayub Khan...

26
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,915
... have great interest in
this contest. What do we tell them?

27
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,499
The announcements are made.

28
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:17,249
Milkha is our star. lf he refuses,
it'll send the wrong signal.

29
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,874
Wrong signal?

30
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,624
lt's about the upcoming
lndia-Pakistan Games

31
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,332
Oh yes, yes. Please sit.

32
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,124
These games aren't
just games but a means...

33
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,290
... to bring our countries closer.

34
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,874
All the arrangements have been made,
sir. Everything is on it track?

35
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,749
But?

36
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,040
Our star Milkha refuses
to go to Pakistan.

37
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,040
Convince him.

38
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:54,415
We're trying. But since
he lost the Rome Olympics...

39
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,499
You win some, you lose some.

40
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,707
Mr. Prime Minister,

41
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,457
Pardon me. My name is Ranvir Singh.

42
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,665
Milkha Singh's coach.

43
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,749
This isn't about losing in Rome.

44
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,790
He refuses to go to Pakistan...

45
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,790
... for personal reasons.

46
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,624
Mr. Wadhwa...

47
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,832
... take Ranvir Singh...

48
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,749
... and go and talk to Milkha.

49
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,165
Good morning, sir.

50
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,124
Oh good morning come.

51
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,040
Sir, this is Gurudev Singh.
l've told you about him.

52
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,165
Hello...

53
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,332
How are you, sir? - Very well.

54
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,874
Come in.

55
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:46,082
The Delhi to Chandigarh Amrapali Express
is about to leave from platform no. 1 .

56
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,415
Milkha Singh listens to him...

57
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,457
... so l requested him to come too.

58
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,332
Thanks for coming, Mr.
Gurudev Singh.

59
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,832
l hope you can
help persuade Milkha.

60
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,457
Read this?

61
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,540
"l will not go to Pakistan."

62
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,415
What is the reason?

63
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,749
lt's a long story, sir.

64
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,165
Ourjourney to
Chandigarh is long too.

65
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:32,415
l first met Milkha 6 years ago.
ln 1954...

66
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,790
... at the Secunderabad
Army Regiment Centre.

67
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,665

68
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,749

Cadet Sujit Chawla. - Sir.

72
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,749
Every year young
men enlist in the Army.

73
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,499
Milkha Singh was one of them.

74
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,415
Recruit Sahil. - Sir.

75
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,415
Recruit Suresh Kumar

76
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,165
Suresh Kumar?

77
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,790
Recruit Milkha Singh

78
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,790
Yes sir!

79
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,874
Yes, sir.

80
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,665
Two Milkha Singhs?

81
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,082
l'm Suresh Kumar, sir!

82
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,707
What took you so long?

83
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,999
Sorry, sir!

84
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,082
You have a shrill voice.
Why did you join the army?

85
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,665
To fight, sir!

86
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,415
To fight? Or sing lullabies?
Can you roar at the enemy?

87
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,874
l can, sir! - Let's hear you.

88
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,999

89
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,999
Silence!

90
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,457
No laughing!

91
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,665
He can roar. He has balls.

92
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,457
Enemy, l'm coming!

93
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,374
From now you're no
longer Suresh Kumar...

94
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,082
... but Miss Suresh

95
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,874
Damned if you do...

96
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,040
... damned if you don't.

97
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:09,749
Who spoke?

98
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,207
You?

99
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,040
l did sir.

100
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,624
So, you did!

101
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,415
Yes, sir.

102
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,165
You think l'm a clown?

103
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,624
No, sir.

104
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,790
That you are a hero?
- No, sir.

105
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,124
No butting in.

106
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,499
Got it?

107
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,332
Got what?

108
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,124
No butting in!

109
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,707
Collect your treasures!
Your trunk and plate.

110
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,915
No wives in sight.

111
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,540
He forgot mug.

112
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,540
You said something?

113
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,624
Sir, this mug.

114
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,749
Mug.

115
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:08,999
This is to drink, bathe and wash.

116
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,290
Got it?

117
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,374
Sir!

118
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,124
One--two-one.

119
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,540
One. - Squad two.

120

Jump.

128
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,999
Everyone.

129
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,415
Remember. Your field of action,
is your practice area.

130
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,124
And your duty is your penance.

131
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,040
He's always yelling.

132
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,915
Do this! Do that!

133
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,040
Will you eat? No? Then don't!

134
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,999
lmagine him talking to his wife...

135
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,374
Give me a kiss.

136
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,499
How about it!

137
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,999
Turn around. - Turn. No.

138

put your hand on your heart, and together"

169
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,790
"Tell me what are we going to do?"

170
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,707
"Contribute selflessly,
Contribute selflessly"

171
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,790
Attention!

172
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,290
There will be a race tomorrow.

173
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,165
The centre Coach Gurudev
Singh will explain.

174
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,749
At ease!

175
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,249
My name is Gurudev Singh.

176
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,582
The lndian Army is
ready at all times ...

177
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,207
... to serve and
protect the country.

178
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,582
Besides that...

179
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,332
... the lndian army
has also given lndia...

180
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,999
... its' finest sportsmen.

181
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,249
Tomorrow...

182
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,040
... you will run
a cross country race...

183
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,374
... six miles long.

184
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:48,332
The ten fastest...

185
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,790
... will be personally
trained by me.

186
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,915
To compete in the
coming brigade games...

187
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,207
... representing our unit.

188
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,915
Have any of you run before?

189
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,082
When?

190
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,832
A mad dog once chased me.
l ran all the way home.

191
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,749
Quiet!

192
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,040
And you?

193
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,457
Much the same story, sir.

194
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,415
You morons. That's not
the kind of running l mean.

195
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,374
This is a contest.

196
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,749
To get ahead of the others.

197
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,624
Any questions?

198
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,082
No, sir!

199
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,040
One more thing...

200
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:38,040
... no more fatigue duty
for the ten best runners.

201
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,915
A special diet too...

202
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,582
... a glass of milk
and two raw eggs.

203
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,665
Attention!

204
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,999
Disperse!

205
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,457
One--two-three-one..

206
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,624
Hail lndia!

207
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,999
l'll win for the unit's honour.

208
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,540
We have to win.

209
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,999
Hear that?
No fatigue duty for the top ten.

210
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:09,082
No cutting grass.
l'll run like life depends on it!

211
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,665
All l can think about is the milk.

212
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,540
Taran, put in all your strength...

213
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,082
... you have to get
your fatigue excused.

214
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,415
Come on!

215
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,249
Why are you sitting here?

216
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,999
Stomach cramps. Can't move.

217
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,124
Think of the milk.

218
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:09,624
Come on.

219
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:28,624
Milk! Milk!

220
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,457
Run to beat everyone.

221
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,374
Run to come first.

222
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,290
Young man!

223
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,999
You ran well.

224
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,707
What happened?

225
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,457
Stomach cramps, sir.

226
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,457
We'll work on that.

227
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,249
Yes, sir!

228
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,207
Come on.

229
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,915
Eggs and milk!

230
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,124
lt's back to fatigue duty for me...

231
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,749
lt's ok, Taran.

232
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,457
Here...

233
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,082
... you drink it.

234
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,499
Drink it.

235
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,207
you drink it.

236
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,582
You drinking or me,
it's the same thing.

237
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,832
What about you?
- You love milk.

238
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,165
You drinking or me, same thing.

239
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,665
Then l'll finish all of it.

240
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,915
Shameless boy!

241
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,332
Little devil!

242
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,874
Chawli, l'm ready to eat.

243
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:19,999
Your chair.
- Keep sitting...

244
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,249
Let's play...

245
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,207
... spot the middle finger, Milkhu.

246
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,207
Ready?

247
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,415
The middle finger.

248
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,040
Got it...

249
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,624
Sure.

250
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,290
Sure. - Yes.

251
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,999
You win!

252
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,749
Your turn.

253
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,415
Hold it.

254
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,207
Here you go.

255
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,499
No holding back when you eat.

256
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,499
lshri, don't you feed your husband?

257
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,332
He's become so thin.

258
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,082
Milkha.

259
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,999
l hear you're learning
English at school.

260
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,874
Yes, brother-in-law.

261
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,624
Say something.
We can learn some too.

262
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,457
Come on.

263
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,415
Come on son.

264
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:38,874
Go ahead!

265
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,249
King cat mouse "hatti" in the house

266
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:49,624
King means "Emperor".
- Everyone knows that!

267
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,040
ls "hatti" English?

268
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,124
Maybe.

269
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,624
Go on.

270
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,749
King cat mouse in the house.
C for cat in the fields.

271
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,915
Twinkle-Twinkle little star..

272
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,874
King cat mouse in the house.

273
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,415
My Milkhu speaks such good English.

274
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,374
A proper Englishman.

275
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,165
That's why l send him to school.

276
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,707
So he can be a somebody.

277
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,082
What will you be when you grow up?

278
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,499
A soldier, father.

279
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:32,707
My little soldier!
Milkha Singh, Salute!

280
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,749
You make us late everyday.

281
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,040
We'll be on time.

282
00:27:55,916 --> 00:28:01,790
The teacher will cane our backside.

283
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,040
And then?

284
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,290
Red Bums!

285
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:12,582
Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's
veil, red like Sampreet's bum.

286
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:20,082
Milkha's bum.
- No, Sampreet's bum

287
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,040
Milkha.. - Come on.

288
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:27,540
Red are tomatoes, red is the maiden's
veil, red like Sampreet's bum.

289
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,499

00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,457

295
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,665

Bum..

297
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,665
Milkha's red bum.

298
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,249
No, yours!

299
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,457
Sampreet's red bum.

300
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,999
Your bum will turn red too,
if you get caned.

301
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,999
Sampreet's red bum!

302
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,249
Your red bum.

303
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,415
Stop.

304
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,124
My feet are on fire.

305
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,040
Come in the shade.

306
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:29,124
l have to reach home.

307
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,207
Let's wait till it's cooler.

308
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,124
We'll run across the dunes.

309
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,040
You nuts? Your feet will roast.

310
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,749
l'm off!

311
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,290
Hey... hey...
Listen to me, Sardar.

312
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,040
Milkha...

313
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:43,832
... you will now have to run 400...

314
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,040
... 400 means 400 meters.

315
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,999
Moron! Run one
lap around the track.

316
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:55,665
Just one?

317
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,624
Guruji, l can easily do 20 laps.

318
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,040
Not 20!

319
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,874
Put the effort of 20 laps in one.

320
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,999
Yes sir.

321
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,749
Remember one thing.

322
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,665
These races are very important.

323
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:21,790
The first three will
compete in the Brigade games.

324
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,332
They'll represent the Army.

325
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,040
Guru sir where are you going?

326
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,332
How are you?

327
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,082
How about some tea, butter milk?

328
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,832
Sure.

329
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,540
Milkha, l'll see you in a bit.

330
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,749
Yes. - Come on.

331
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:21,082
How are you, Taimoor? - Rana, sir.

332
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,040
You will lose this time.

333
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,874
How are your preparations? - Good.

334
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,290
Taimoor, how are your preparations?

335
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,290
Very good.

336
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,540
Where did you get that blazer?

337
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,040
Why?

338
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,832
l can see people who

339
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,874
l want one too.

340
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,207
You do, do you?

341
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,124
Who are you?

342
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,374

And even excused from fatigue duty.

Come here "Mr. Fatigue Excused."

346

This is the lndian team blazer.

00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,290
lt is not for riff-raffs.

348

Only for champions like me.

349
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,332
Got it?

350
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:33,040
Now run along.

Get lost!

352
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,749
Come on.

353
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:55,499
What are you looking at?
Smart Sikh!

354
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,540

Champion Milkha Singh.

357
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,874
Bloody thief!

358
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:24,999
Stealing my blazer?

359
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,374
No, l was just trying it on.

360
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,540
Trying it on, were you?

361
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:31,874
Bloody thief!

362
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,165
Don't call me a thief.

363
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,415
What else are you?

364
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,249
He's been eyeing it all day.

365
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,665
He's a thief.

366
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,665
Report him.

367
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,457
Think it's your pop's?

368
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:45,999
Get him suspended.

369
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,374
He's a thief.

370
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,624
Acting smart eh?

371
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:51,915
Strip the bugger.

372
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,082
l was only trying it on.

373
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,249
Think it's your pop's?

374
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,749
l was only trying it on.

375
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,249
l'm not a thief!

376
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,999
Let me go.

377
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,832

378
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,415
Let him go!

379
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,332
We caught him stealing.
- Shut up!

380
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,290
l wasn't stealing.

381
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,915
You liar!

382
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,040
Calm down!

383
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,040
Why did you wear his blazer?

384
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,124
You want one?

385
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,415
An lndia team blazer?

386
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,374
Just like that, eh?

387
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,624
Hey, it's not that easy.

388
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,915
You must earn it.

389
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,999
Work bloody hard for it.
Be worthy of it.

390
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,749
You really want the blazer?

391
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,415
Then beat him.

392
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,540
Think you can?

393
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,165
Can you?

394
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,040
Yes l can.

395
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,415
You'll beat Sher Singh Rana?

396
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,082
Have you seen him run?

397
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:46,874
He's like a bullet.

398
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:53,415
Have you the guts?

399
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,249
Yes, l do.

400
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:06,999
You could try tomorrow.

401
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,082
You will beat a thousand
Sher Singh Ranas.

402
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,040
On your mark.

403
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,082
Set.

404
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,832
Come on, gallop!

405
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:03,874
Well done! Go! Go!

406
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,790
You ran well.

407
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,207
You'd be first if
it wasn't for the stone.

408
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,040
Gurudev, l choose him too.

409
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,499
Train him well.
- Yes sir

410
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,999
Well done!

411
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:50,040
Every time the stone won't
be so big that it comes in notice.

412
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,915
You must work hard...

413
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,040
... so nothing comes in your way.

414
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,665
Yes, sir.

415
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,707
Come on.

416
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,540
Milkha Singh was a natural.

417
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:11,832
A gifted athlete.

418
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,290
We merely honed the diamond.

419
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:20,165
All that is very
interesting, but...

420
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,874
... l still don't see
why he won't go to Pakistan.

421
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,332
Mr. Secretary, in 1947...

422
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,499
... millions were
celebrating lndia's freedom.

423
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:38,082
While others were mourning
lndia's bloody partition.

424
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,499
Millions became refugees.

425
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,040
Milkha was among them.

426
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,665
His new village fell on the other
side of the border, in Pakistan.

427
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:59,124
He was just a kid.
10-12 years or so...

428
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,582
He came to Delhi,
narrowly escaping with his life.

429
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,207
He was all alone.

430

But he said,

Gandhiji got us freedom
from the British.

676
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:34,665
So it's a national
holiday on his birthday.

677
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,624
National holiday?

678
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,082
We have national
holidays for important people.

679
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:51,707
One day there'll be a
holiday in Milkha's name.

680
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,165
ln your name?

681
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,499
l do important things, too.

682
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,332
Where are you going?

683
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:20,832
Get off!

684
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,332
Stand straight!

685
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,624
Whose is it?

686
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,499
lt's mine.

687
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,374
Not the cycle.

688
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,374
l'm talking about the butter tins.

689
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,415
Did you steal them?

690
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,332
What are you saying? No!

691
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,999
l worked hard for them.

692
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,499
Do you have a bill?

693
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,874
A bill for what? They're mine.

694
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,999
This is the Shahdara
police station.

695
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,082
Without a receipt you
can't take them past here.

696
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:50,749
Collect them when
you have the bill.

697
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:55,457
They go with me.

698
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:59,374
Do l have 'dumb ass'
printed on my forehead?

699
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:03,790
Sorry sir, l can't read.

700
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,290
lt's good stuff.

701
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,165
Ok. Leave one and take one.

702
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,790
No, l will take them both.

703
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,999
You sure?

704
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,499
Oh yes...very sure.

705
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:29,707
What do you think you are doing?

706
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,290
What are you doing?
You will fall sick.

707
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,582
Move back.

708
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:48,124
Have you lost it?
- Move back.

709
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:49,749
Move back.

710
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:57,040
Move.

711
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:07,290
Move back.

712
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:23,999
...9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16..

713
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:29,165
..17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22..

714
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:32,707
..23, 24, 25, 26..

715
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,415
..27, 28, 29, 30..

716
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,915
..31, 32, 33, 34..

717
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:45,082
Shut up..
- ..35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40..

718
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:49,249
..41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46..

719
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:52,457
..47, 48, 49, 50.

720
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:57,832
Shut up!

721
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:04,082
What are you doing, Milkha?

722
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,540
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56..

723
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,999
..57..

724
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:27,749
..91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96..

725
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:33,415
Have you lost it?
- ..97, 98, 99, 100!

726
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,374
Why one?
You can have them both now!

727
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,082
There is something about that boy.

728
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:30,082
These are the heroes of today...

729
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,540
... those who rob and steal...

730
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,499
... thieves and goons.

731
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,040
Biro!

732
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:58,290
l want to marry you.

733
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,582
Don't be shy.

734
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:07,665
We'll have dozens of Kids.
Mahinder, Parminder, Jaswinder

735
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,374
Dharmender, Rajinder.
- To be thieves like you?

736
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,082
l'll give up all that.

737
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:30,499
You trust me, don't you?

738
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,874
l'll make something of my
life and come back for you.

739
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,707
Will you wait for me?

740
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,582
Yes.

741
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,332
Love can conquer anything.

742
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,540
He didn't ask for much.

743
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:12,332
Just a small business...
to help live an honest life.

744
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,915
But to earn money,
you need money don't you?

745
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:23,207
A thousand? Too much...

746
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,207
Do something!

747
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,124
We will need a year.

748
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,290
l don't have a year!

749
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,457
One big last job then.

750
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:42,915
No, no more stealing...

751
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,874
l don't want to be a thief.

752
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,790
Ticket please...

753
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,749
Ticket.

754
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,415
Milkha, you've got them?

755
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:58,832
No.

756
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,582
Look again.

757
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:05,082
Hurry up!

758
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,582
There are other passengers too.

759
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,040
Stop.

760
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:11,874
Milkha, run!

761
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,374
Run!

762
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,999
Run! Milkha Run!

763
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:32,124
Why did you come here?
- Let's go.

764
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:42,749
Where are your gold earrings?

765
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:57,249
You sold them to post my bail,
didn't you?

766
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:05,915
l've always taken from you.

767
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,499
Don't talk nonsense!

768
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,999
Let's go home.

769
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,582
He struggled hard...

770
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,249
... knocked at many a doors.

771
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:23,082
Ultimately,
the Army gave him respectability.

772
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:27,415
Maybe fate was now on his side.

773
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:33,040
You moron! Loosen up. Grip hard!

774
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,874
Fool! Lift your legs.

775
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:39,540
These shoes are full of nails.

776
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,249
l can't run in them.

777
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,457
Give it a try.

778
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:47,665
No sir... l can't...

779
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:50,290
Gurudev Singh..

780
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,249
Ranvir Singh.

781
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:55,040
How are you?

782
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:57,415
ls this the "stone boy?"
- Yes.

783
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:02,249
Milkha, Ranvir Singh,
the lndian team coach.

784
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:05,915
Your blessings, sir.

785
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:07,665
God bless you.

786
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,374
How are you?

787
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,665
Fighting with these nails sir.

788
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:18,124
Now you are, but soon these spikes
will be your best friends.

789
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:24,124
Sir, can't we run
barefoot in the Olympics?

790
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,540
Don't be..

791
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:26,707
Come with me.

792
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:38,415
Run and show me.

793
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,540
Come back.

794
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,374
Easy... easy...

795
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:39,249
Why are you hiding their names?

796
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:42,040
Who were they?

797
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:46,082
Tell me their names
once and l will...

798
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,540
Looks like we'll need to admit him
in the hospital tomorrow.

799
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,999
All his efforts gone to waste.

800
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,040
Male no.1 Makhan Singh.

801
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,249
Male no.2 Albert D'Costa.

802

01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:11,540
Male no.4 Kartar Singh.

01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:18,124
Male no.5 Milkha Singh.

805
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,874
Yes, sir.
- Oh, God.

806
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:30,665
Have you gone mad?

807
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,457
Let it be.

808
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,082
Milkha.

809
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:42,124
Sit down.

810
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,707
Listen carefully...

811
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:50,790
... you'll get more chances.

812
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:54,749
lf you run now,
you could damage your legs forever.

813
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,540
Understood.

814
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,707
Gurudev, make him see sense.

815
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:10,290
Don't be stubborn...

816
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:11,582
... forget it.

817
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:15,207
What are you doing?

818
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,874
Your feet are swollen!

819
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:23,249
Give it a rest now.

820
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,749
Let me run.

821
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,040
You know what this means to me...

822
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:19,915
O Lord, keep my honour.

823
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,874
On your marks.

824
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:25,832
Set.

825
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:50,499
"The name of Nanak
is like a ship..."

826
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:58,749
"...which will save you
in troubled waters"

827
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:08,999
"The ones who have
Nanak's name in their hearts,"

828
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:32,915
"Nanak makes them
cross the ocean of life"

829
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:56,999
Well done!

830
01:31:57,916 --> 01:32:02,499
Are you all right?

831
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,707
Well done.

832
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,749
Are you all right?

833
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:16,040
Milkha, you broke
the national record.

834
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:26,874
You crazy fellow...

835
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:33,124
... you've broken
the national record.

836
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,207
Guruji.

837
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:47,707
Milkha has become lndia!

838
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:57,415
Milk and turmeric
powder heals wounds fast.

839
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:00,040
Who is Milkha Singh?

840
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:01,665
l am.

841
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,915
l need your measurements
for the blazer.

842
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:12,874
Come in.

843
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:23,165
Length, 28 inches.

844
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:33,332
Chest, 38 inches.

845
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:39,665
During the measurement
Milkha looked as shy...

846
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:43,665
... as a new bride getting
her wedding gown stitched.

847
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:45,624
Shoulder, 18 inches.

848
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,207

Wrist, 10 inches.

851
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:08,874
Jassi.

852
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:28,624
Yes?

853
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:40,874
Milkha.

854
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,832
Milkha!

855
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:12,499
l am your Milkhu.

856
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,665
l am not a ghost.

857
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,749
No!

858
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:27,999
Why wear a coat in this heat?

859
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:31,249
This isn't any coat, it's a blazer.

860
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,540
The lndian team blazer. Look!

861
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:37,790
Your brother has
worked very hard for it.

862
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:41,124
Here, you wear it.

863
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,374
l'll look silly in a coat.

864
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:45,040
Not me.

865
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:46,124
Try it!

866
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:49,124
Put it on.

867
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,290
All this fuss for a coat.

868
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,207
lt looks so good on you.

869
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,082
Now put your hands in the pockets.

870
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:04,624
Like this.

871
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:33,249
Sister, stop crying.

872
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,499
Do you want to flood
the Chenab river?

873
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:14,540
"O dyer of my soul"

874
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:23,332
"O dyer of my soul in
the river of your colour"

875
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:30,832
"O dyer of my soul in the
river of your colour"

876
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:35,874
"l want to be immersed"

877
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:44,249
"l don't want a
separate identity from yours"

878
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:53,540
"A single breath l will
not take separate from you"

879
01:37:53,750 --> 01:38:01,290
"A single breath l will not
take separate from you"

880
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:06,582
"Let my soul be torn from my body"

881
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:15,040
"l don't want a
separate identity from yours"

882
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:19,457
"Dye me in your colour"

883
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:23,290
"Gently let the colour seep in"

884
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:27,124
"Let rain soaked colour drench me"

885
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:33,332
"Make me your own,
make me your own"

886
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:08,540
"Crafted like an ornament"

887
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,874
"l want to wear you my love"

888
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:16,207
"Come to my lips let me sing you"

889
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:18,165
"Be my only song"

890
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:23,040
"Grind away my anguish"

891
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:28,040
"Dissolve into me"

892
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:31,915
"Melt into me"

893
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:34,207
"Make me your own"

894
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:39,415
"Dye me in your colour"

895
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:43,290
"Gently let the colour seep in"

896
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:47,124
"Let rain soaked colour drench me"

897
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:52,665
"Make me your own,
make me your own"

898
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:58,540
"Dye me in your colour"

899
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:02,249
"Gently let the colour seep in"

900
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:06,124
"Let rain soaked colour drench me"

901
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:11,540
"Make me your own,
make me your own"

902
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:39,124
Who has come to take me away?

903
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,665
Who is my Romeo?

904
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:48,832
Who are you?

905
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,374
l knew l'd find you here.

906
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,665
Give me a hug!

907
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:10,165
How are you?

908
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,832
See for yourself.

909
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:16,540
Meeru, someone else live here now.

910
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,832
Where is she?

911
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:22,040
You look Smart.

912
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:23,540
The others will be thrilled.

913
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:26,165
l am asking about Biro
and you are rambling on.

914
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:29,749
Come let's meet the gang.

915
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:32,582
Hey, stop it.

916
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:34,665
What has happened to her?

917
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:37,457
They don't live here anymore.

918
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:38,874
Where do they?

919
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:40,707
Don't know.

920
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:44,915
Come out with it now.

921
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,790
What happened?

922
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,999
She was married off.

923
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:06,665
All this was happening
and you didn't tell me?

924
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,874
What could l tell you?

925
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:09,415
And what if l had told you?

926
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:14,582
Would you have dropped everything
and come? lt was too late.

927
01:42:15,291 --> 01:42:17,082
She said she'd wait for me.

928
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:19,915
Didn't Biro protest?

929
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:23,624
She did and was thrashed for it.

930
01:42:25,083 --> 01:42:26,874
Who cares what women want?

931
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,915
l have to meet her.
Who did she marry?

932
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,124
What difference does it make?

933
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,457
lt does damn it!

934
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:44,457
"A single breath l will not
take separate from you"

935
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:51,874
"Let my soul be torn from my body"

936
01:43:55,458 --> 01:44:03,040
"l don't want a
separate identity from yours"

937
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:09,165
l can't do it without you.

938
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:12,665
Crazy fellow! Of course you can!

939
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:15,290
Everything will be fine.

940
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,915
Ranvir Singh is a great coach.

941
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:29,582
l'm losing everyone.

942
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:33,165
Foolish boy!

943
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:38,082
Birds that fly high up
don't get attached to small trees.

944
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:42,415
The sky is the limit.

945
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:50,082
You're off to Australia,
a foreign country.

946
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:52,915
Come on! Give me a hug.

947
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,040
Hey Milkha.

948
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:14,457
Our seats are together.

949
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,249
Mahinder,
how does one tie this belt?

950
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,790
Tie it the way you tie pajamas.

951
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:26,082
Like this. - Hello.

952
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,040
Hello.

953
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,332
Let me help you.

954
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:41,665
There you are.

955
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:43,915
When do we undo it?

956
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,040
When the plane is in the air.

957
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:56,832
Who is she?

958
01:45:58,083 --> 01:46:01,290
What sort of a champion are you?
You don't know Perizad?

959
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:04,665
She's a swimming champion.
A mermaid.

960
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:07,832
lsn't she sweet?

961
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:11,374
l've heard she's tough with guys.
Doesn't stand fools.

962
01:46:11,916 --> 01:46:13,124
We aren't fools...

963
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:14,457
... dumb either.

964
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,040
Then become so.

965
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:23,040
Hey, it's going to take off!

966
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,040
The way you speed up
before a long jump, same thing.

967
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:29,540
We're about to fly! Look!

968
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:31,707
Shut up!

969
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:36,207
O Lord, have mercy.

970
01:46:40,875 --> 01:46:42,124
Something is wrong...

971
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,124
... l can't see anything.

972
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:47,665
This isn't right...

973
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:49,624
... he's come too high up.

974
01:46:49,916 --> 01:46:51,832
Milkha, what's wrong?

975
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:55,207
Look clouds below us...

976
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,290
... we're above the clouds.
- Yes.

977
01:46:58,666 --> 01:47:00,082
l can't see a thing!

978
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:07,249
We'll crash!
Let's get out, come on!

979
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:08,332
Sit down.

980
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,582
Milkha, sit down.

981
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:11,915
Sir, he's too high!

982
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:13,332
We'll crash, sir!

983
01:47:13,875 --> 01:47:15,040
Sir, l can't see anything.

984
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:16,999
Excuse me. All fine?

985
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:19,124
What happened?
Please take the seat.

986
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:20,207
What happened?

987
01:47:20,291 --> 01:47:23,999
Look. We're too high up!
He'll crash the plane.

988
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:28,832
Don't worry. The plane flies
over the clouds. Please calm down.

989
01:47:28,916 --> 01:47:30,124
Please take care of the boys.

990
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:31,415
Who are you?

991
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:35,915
The captain. l fly the plane.

992
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,249
And you left the controls?

993
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:41,207
Don't worry, two of us fly a plane.

994
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:43,249
Please take care of them.
- Yes.

995
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:44,540
Everything okay?

996
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:51,457
Remember, Mahinder

997
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:55,165
Nothing can harm
those whom God protects.

998
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:00,124
Look at those guys.

999
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:07,665
They're walking to us.

1000
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:08,749
Talk to them.

1001
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:09,915
Hi.

1002
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:11,374
Hello.

1003
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,082
You guys from lndia?

1004
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:16,165
Yes, lndia.

1005
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,665
l like the way you do your hair.

1006
01:49:21,833 --> 01:49:24,124
Boys, come here. - Yes, sir.

1007

"You are fire Milkha"

1168
02:15:04,833 --> 02:15:08,082
"O rod of steel"

1169
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:16,624
"O boat"

1170
02:15:20,833 --> 02:15:22,665
"The field is your cradle"

1171
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:24,415
"Cover it with your splendour"

1172
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:26,332
"The mountains are at your head"

1173
02:15:26,416 --> 02:15:30,040
"Drape the entire sky"

1174
02:15:30,125 --> 02:15:34,457
"Tie the turban of resolve Milkha"

1175
02:15:36,041 --> 02:15:40,207
"Now you must run Milkha"

1176
02:15:41,541 --> 02:15:47,915
"Now you must rise Milkha"

1177
02:15:48,666 --> 02:15:53,874
"You are fire Milkha"

1178
02:17:41,291 --> 02:17:45,290
Sorry, please forgive me.

1179
02:17:46,666 --> 02:17:47,915
l am not insulting you...

1180
02:17:49,583 --> 02:17:51,082
... this is a fight with myself.

1181
02:18:28,208 --> 02:18:33,415
O Lord! May l die on my feet,
not on my knees.

1182
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:30,540
Abdul Khaliq was Pakistan's pride.

1183
02:19:31,416 --> 02:19:33,082
The fastest runner in Asia.

1184
02:19:35,625 --> 02:19:38,415
Milkha couldn't
wait to see him run.

1185
02:19:38,833 --> 02:19:42,582
The next day he was
to run against him.

1186
02:20:27,875 --> 02:20:32,624
l'm grateful to
my countrymen and to Coach Javed.

1187
02:20:33,541 --> 02:20:35,332
Salaam!
- Thanks.

1188
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:38,249
Javed sir.

1189
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:40,999
Your boy ran well.

1190
02:20:41,666 --> 02:20:43,374
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1191
02:20:43,916 --> 02:20:45,457
Bravo! You ruled the field.

1192
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:46,999
Thank you, sir.

1193
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:48,415
This is Milkha Singh.

1194
02:20:48,791 --> 02:20:51,207
lndia's 400m champion athlete.

1195
02:20:52,333 --> 02:20:53,374
Hello, sir.

1196
02:20:53,875 --> 02:20:57,040
You're competing in the 200m race.

1197
02:20:58,833 --> 02:20:59,915
All the best.

1198
02:21:00,208 --> 02:21:01,207
To you too.

1199
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:03,082
Watch out.

1200
02:21:04,041 --> 02:21:05,749
Watch out, Khaliq.

1201
02:21:07,083 --> 02:21:09,415
l hear you ran
away from Pakistan...

1202
02:21:12,416 --> 02:21:14,290
... have been running
ever since, huh?

1203
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:19,457
Now you need to show
your magic in 200m as well.

1204
02:21:20,875 --> 02:21:21,874
Come.

1205
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:24,040
We've seen dozens like Milkha.

1206
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,374
We have two choices...

1207
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:32,707
... leave our village
and go to the new lndia.

1208
02:21:34,208 --> 02:21:37,540
Or change our religion as they ask.

1209
02:21:37,625 --> 02:21:39,040
We shall not eat cow's meat!

1210
02:21:39,291 --> 02:21:42,749
They can behead us, but we
will never change our religion!

1211
02:21:45,041 --> 02:21:48,457
Prepare to fight then.

1212
02:21:49,708 --> 02:21:54,665
When Guru Govind Singh
left Anantpur Sahib...

1213
02:21:55,333 --> 02:21:57,374
... and reached Garhwal fort...

1214
02:21:57,875 --> 02:22:00,207
... he had only 40 Sikhs with him.

1215
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:03,707
While the enemy were a million!

1216
02:22:05,208 --> 02:22:09,040
Guruji dressed
his sons in armour...

1217
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:10,874
...and sent them to battle.

1218
02:22:11,833 --> 02:22:13,915
His forty men fought hard.

1219
02:22:15,458 --> 02:22:18,374
They fought a mighty army.

1220
02:22:18,833 --> 02:22:21,207
How will we fight?

1221
02:22:22,875 --> 02:22:25,999
They have weapons, horses...

1222
02:22:27,458 --> 02:22:28,457
And us?

1223
02:22:29,833 --> 02:22:31,165
What do we have?

1224
02:22:34,041 --> 02:22:35,540
Enough of bravado!

1225
02:22:36,458 --> 02:22:37,999
Thousands are leaving for lndia...

1226
02:22:38,375 --> 02:22:40,374
... we should go too.

1227
02:22:47,916 --> 02:22:55,790
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1228
02:22:57,083 --> 02:22:59,082
A lamb will fight a lion,

1229
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:03,207
One man will fight a million.

1230
02:23:04,041 --> 02:23:07,540
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1231
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,374
A sparrow will challenge an eagle,

1232
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:14,749
A lamb will fight a lion,

1233
02:23:15,041 --> 02:23:17,082
One man will fight a million.

1234
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:19,374
Guru Govind Singh, bless us!

1235
02:24:13,875 --> 02:24:15,124
Come on.

1236
02:24:31,083 --> 02:24:33,165
Milkha. Are you alright, son?

1237
02:27:34,208 --> 02:27:35,207
Jai Hind sir.

1238
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,749
Today, you won't
salute us, we salute you.

1239
02:27:38,708 --> 02:27:40,207
The whole unit salutes you.

1240
02:27:41,125 --> 02:27:42,249
lndia salutes you.

1241
02:27:43,625 --> 02:27:44,624
Proud.

1242
02:27:49,875 --> 02:27:55,124
Milkha, you are an officer now.

1243
02:28:01,625 --> 02:28:02,624
No.

1244
02:28:14,916 --> 02:28:19,040
All because of the pat on my back
and a kick on my butt from you sir.

1245
02:28:24,333 --> 02:28:25,499
Stay well, my son.

1246
02:28:26,583 --> 02:28:28,540
l wish you a thousand joys.

1247
02:28:35,458 --> 02:28:36,707
You have made me happy.

1248
02:28:39,041 --> 02:28:42,249
Congratulations to his friends!

1249
02:28:46,833 --> 02:28:50,915
Many many congratulation
for Milkhas winning.

1250
02:28:51,125 --> 02:28:54,249
Let's celebrate!

1251
02:30:01,333 --> 02:30:06,832
"Bite through the electric fire"

1252
02:30:07,583 --> 02:30:13,207
"Chew the metal's
vibrating current"

1253
02:30:13,458 --> 02:30:17,999
"Set aflame your every pore"

1254
02:30:18,166 --> 02:30:23,332
"Without burning yourself
there's no glow"

1255
02:30:56,333 --> 02:30:59,999
"The flames are burning Milkha"

1256
02:31:00,208 --> 02:31:08,040
"Run Milkha"

1257
02:31:39,166 --> 02:31:41,124
Excuse me.
Can l have a photograph please?

1258
02:31:41,291 --> 02:31:42,290
Of course.

1259
02:31:44,083 --> 02:31:45,082
Thank you.

1260
02:31:47,125 --> 02:31:51,415
Son, you have made us proud.

1261
02:31:52,333 --> 02:31:54,790
Now make lndia's flag
flutter high at the Rome Olympics.

1262
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:58,290
The hopes of all lndia ride on you.

1263
02:31:59,291 --> 02:32:02,665
l will run like
my life depends on it.

1264
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:05,332
Wonderful.

1265
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:09,457
Son, what can we do for you?

1266
02:32:12,583 --> 02:32:17,790
Panditji, if l win, can you
declare a national holiday?

1267
02:32:19,208 --> 02:32:20,499
Of course.

1268
02:32:23,916 --> 02:32:25,790
A call from Pakistan.

1269
02:32:26,791 --> 02:32:28,915
Gentlemen. Excuse me, please.
- Yes.

1270
02:32:35,041 --> 02:32:36,332
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1271
02:32:36,875 --> 02:32:39,124
An important announcement...

1272
02:32:39,666 --> 02:32:43,582
... what a coincidence that
while you are all here and...

1273
02:32:44,625 --> 02:32:50,040
... Pakistan's President,
Field Marshal Ayub Khan has called.

1274
02:32:51,166 --> 02:32:58,707
He has accepted my proposal
of the lndo-Pak friendship games.

1275
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:03,540
lt's an important step
toward friendship...

1276
02:33:04,666 --> 02:33:06,457
... between our two nations.

1277
02:33:07,666 --> 02:33:08,665
l would like...

1278
02:33:09,458 --> 02:33:13,749
... Milkha Singh to
lead our contingent...

1279
02:33:14,125 --> 02:33:15,415
... to Pakistan.

1280
02:33:34,416 --> 02:33:35,915
All eyes were on Milkha.

1281
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:40,874
But there was a storm
brewing in Milkha's head.

1282
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:27,415
Milkha, run!

1283
02:35:28,875 --> 02:35:30,290
Run!

1284
02:35:31,583 --> 02:35:33,499
Why are you standing here?

1285
02:35:39,416 --> 02:35:41,207
Son. Son.

1286
02:35:41,791 --> 02:35:44,165
Listen to me...

1287
02:35:48,708 --> 02:35:50,665
... don't be scared.

1288
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:53,665
No harm will come to you.

1289
02:35:54,541 --> 02:35:57,499
... don't be scared.

1290
02:35:58,041 --> 02:35:59,874
Son, be brave.

1291
02:36:00,916 --> 02:36:02,290
You'll be fine.

1292
02:36:04,583 --> 02:36:07,374
Run, Milkha! Run!

1293
02:36:07,583 --> 02:36:08,915
Get out of here.

1294
02:36:11,625 --> 02:36:21,040
Run, Milkha! Run!

1295
02:36:22,708 --> 02:36:24,874
Don't turn back to look!

1296
02:37:02,333 --> 02:37:07,915
So, Pakistan is a
terrible memory for Milkha...

1297
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:12,707
... and we have come to
revive those memories.

1298
02:37:21,541 --> 02:37:27,082
We have reached Chandigarh.

1299
02:37:29,416 --> 02:37:30,874
We've reached.

1300
02:37:31,458 --> 02:37:33,332
But what shall we say to Milkha?

1301
02:37:37,708 --> 02:37:39,540
You have a nice garden.

1302
02:37:40,375 --> 02:37:43,874
lt seems gardening interests you.

1303
02:37:44,875 --> 02:37:45,874
Seems so.

1304
02:37:52,791 --> 02:37:59,540
lt has suddenly turned cold
in Chandigarh hasn't it?

1305
02:38:00,125 --> 02:38:01,290
You're right.

1306
02:38:09,708 --> 02:38:10,707
Thank you.

1307
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,082
Sir, sugar?
- One spoon.

1308
02:38:30,791 --> 02:38:31,790
Thank you.

1309
02:38:40,208 --> 02:38:44,540
So much sugar, Milkha?

1310
02:38:46,208 --> 02:38:47,332
lt's not good for you.

1311
02:38:48,583 --> 02:38:50,582
Oh! That's mine...

1312
02:38:53,333 --> 02:38:56,999
You aren't here to discuss
the weather and sugar.

1313
02:39:00,666 --> 02:39:05,457
Milkha, Nehruji wants to meet you.

1314
02:39:13,541 --> 02:39:14,749
l can't do it sir.

1315
02:39:16,916 --> 02:39:18,624
My feet won't move.

1316
02:39:21,125 --> 02:39:24,040
My family's blood is in that air,
l won't be able to breathe.

1317
02:39:28,291 --> 02:39:29,290
Son...

1318
02:39:32,375 --> 02:39:36,999
You're a soldier.
Your country needs you now.

1319
02:39:38,250 --> 02:39:40,499
lf you must wage war
with your own self for it...

1320
02:39:42,708 --> 02:39:44,040
... then you should.

1321
02:41:47,208 --> 02:41:49,374
Right now, it's important..

1322
02:41:50,083 --> 02:41:53,040
Peace and harmony must
prevail between our countries.

1323
02:41:53,458 --> 02:41:58,040
Sports are an important
means to that goal.

1324
02:41:58,041 --> 02:41:59,499
That's all very well, sir...

1325
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:02,332
... but why won't Milkha
Singh meet the press?

1326
02:42:04,333 --> 02:42:06,582
What's the problem?

1327
02:42:06,708 --> 02:42:09,165
Did he rebuff Khaliq's challenge?

1328
02:42:11,291 --> 02:42:12,999
Why the empty chair?

1329
02:42:13,625 --> 02:42:18,415
He knows coming to Pakistan...

1330
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:21,207
... is a mistake.

1331
02:42:22,458 --> 02:42:26,290
Mr. Khaliq, can you defeat him?

1332
02:42:26,708 --> 02:42:27,707
God willing

1333
02:42:31,166 --> 02:42:34,499
But where is Milkha Singh?

1334
02:42:36,041 --> 02:42:40,540
Everyone, please sit down!

1335
02:44:26,458 --> 02:47:11,332
Mother!

1336
02:47:50,291 --> 02:47:51,707
Why are you crying?

1337
02:47:52,791 --> 02:47:54,915
Crying is no good.

1338
02:47:55,125 --> 02:47:56,290
Don't cry.

1339
02:48:01,291 --> 02:48:03,707
Your photo...

1340
02:48:20,041 --> 02:48:21,165
ls this you?

1341
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:25,499
Red is the maiden's veil...

1342
02:48:32,791 --> 02:48:34,749
Red are tomatoes...

1343
02:48:41,708 --> 02:48:43,582
Red like Sampreet's butt!

1344
02:48:46,041 --> 02:48:47,499
... Milkha's butt.

1345
02:48:49,083 --> 02:48:50,082
Sampreet!

1346
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:53,124
Milkha.

1347
02:48:59,041 --> 02:49:00,832
l thought you were...

1348
02:49:01,083 --> 02:49:04,582
l Survived...

1349
02:49:10,375 --> 02:49:13,290
People aren't bad, Milkha. But
circumstances can make them bad.

1350
02:49:14,125 --> 02:49:17,499
Partition was a bad time.
Remember our Muslim teacher...

1351
02:49:17,875 --> 02:49:21,082
... he raised me
and got me married.

1352
02:49:22,875 --> 02:49:23,874
Some milk?

1353
02:49:25,583 --> 02:49:28,540
You love it l'm told.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

1354
02:49:33,083 --> 02:49:36,624
Aren't you the Milkha
Singh who runs?

1355
02:49:42,625 --> 02:49:46,790
l am...

1356
02:49:50,666 --> 02:49:51,832
... the one who runs.

1357
02:50:01,458 --> 02:50:03,582
The connections are done,
start the radio.

1358
02:50:08,541 --> 02:50:09,749
Hey, change the station.

1359
02:50:10,458 --> 02:50:11,499
Just a minute.

1360
02:50:14,083 --> 02:50:19,290
Just by looking at
the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore...

1361
02:50:19,583 --> 02:50:24,832
... it seems as though
entire Pakistan has turned up...

1362
02:50:25,291 --> 02:50:30,915
... in lndia everyone's
heart is beating faster.

1363
02:50:34,625 --> 02:50:38,624
We can see the planes
throwing colour in the skies...

1364
02:50:38,708 --> 02:50:42,582
... and General Ayub
Khan of Pakistan...

1365
02:50:42,666 --> 02:50:46,624
... is entering the stadium
in his magnificent cavalcade.

1366
02:51:01,666 --> 02:51:04,582
Your Excellency, good morning.
- Welcome to Pakistan.

1367
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:06,040
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

1368
02:51:06,583 --> 02:51:08,582
Same to you, sir.
- Sir.

1369
02:51:12,041 --> 02:51:13,874
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1370
02:51:15,083 --> 02:51:16,540
Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1371
02:51:17,708 --> 02:51:19,249
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1372
02:51:25,875 --> 02:51:29,082
All the best, Milkha Singh.
- Thank you, sir.

1373
02:51:30,791 --> 02:51:36,249
Khaliq.

1374
02:51:36,625 --> 02:51:39,207
Pakistan's hopes are riding on you.

1375
02:51:39,583 --> 02:51:42,040
l will do my best.

1376
02:51:43,083 --> 02:51:44,499
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1377
02:51:51,166 --> 02:51:53,165
And the tension is building.

1378
02:51:54,041 --> 02:51:58,207
lt's as if everyone
is breathing together,

1379
02:51:59,041 --> 02:52:01,665
... or rather everyone
has stopped breathing.

1380
02:52:10,291 --> 02:52:12,290
Leave them far behind you.

1381
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:15,082
No one can defeat you.

1382
02:52:16,041 --> 02:52:17,624
No, Milkha.

1383
02:52:18,333 --> 02:52:21,665
You're the best. You're the champ.

1384
02:52:21,875 --> 02:52:23,665
Squad..

1385
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,582
Go, my lion! Run!

1386
02:52:33,625 --> 02:52:34,624
Go, son.

1387
02:52:35,125 --> 02:52:36,124
Do it.

1388
02:52:37,166 --> 02:52:38,165
Yes.

1389
02:52:41,333 --> 02:52:42,499
Milkha Singh.

1390
02:52:44,291 --> 02:52:47,124
This could be the last
race of your life.

1391
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:49,832
That's how l'll run it.

1392
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:56,082
On your mark.

1393
02:53:19,916 --> 02:53:21,415
There is absolute silence...

1394
02:53:22,041 --> 02:53:24,499
... everyone's eyes
are on the race track.

1395
02:53:25,125 --> 02:53:26,290
Who will win?

1396
02:53:27,125 --> 02:53:29,790
lndia's hope Milkha Singh...

1397
02:53:31,166 --> 02:53:38,582
... or Pakistan's star athlete,
Asia's tornado, Abdul Khaliq.

1398
02:54:01,458 --> 02:54:03,082
Squad...

1399
02:54:08,041 --> 02:54:10,082
The gun is fired
and the race has begun.

1400
02:54:10,166 --> 02:54:13,540
Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq
is leading the pack...

1401
02:54:13,791 --> 02:54:16,082
... looks as though he has decided
to come and win today.

1402
02:54:16,166 --> 02:54:19,790
He seems to be reaching
his goal effortlessly.

1403
02:54:20,041 --> 02:54:25,790
Without a care, without a worry,
he is running towards the finish line.

1404
02:54:26,041 --> 02:54:29,499
Looks like his feet
are about to kiss victory.

1405
02:54:29,666 --> 02:54:31,999
Come on.
- Come on, son.

1406
02:54:38,625 --> 02:54:41,332
But wait a minute!
Something else is happening here...

1407
02:54:41,416 --> 02:54:44,707
... Milkha Singh is
suddenly catching up...

1408
02:54:44,833 --> 02:54:47,415
... and one by one
he is leaving everyone behind!

1409
02:54:47,625 --> 02:54:52,832
And with such ease he has now
overtaken Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq!

1410
02:54:53,041 --> 02:54:58,124
This can only be called a miracle which
we may not ever get to witness again.

1411
02:55:09,291 --> 02:55:12,165
lt seems as though
Milkha Singh has grown wings...

1412
02:55:12,250 --> 02:55:14,790
... the wind is
carrying him forward...

1413
02:55:14,875 --> 02:55:16,874
... or he is running
above the clouds.

1414
02:55:18,083 --> 02:55:19,040
Come on, Milkha.

1415
02:55:35,375 --> 02:55:41,499
"Throw off all your
cares and troubles"

1416
02:55:41,708 --> 02:55:48,040
"The skeletons of the past"

1417
02:55:48,291 --> 02:55:54,040
"The soles of your
feet are like horse shoes"

1418
02:55:54,333 --> 02:56:00,707
"You've got to do it come what may"

1419
02:56:10,208 --> 02:56:15,499
"You are fire Milkha"

1420
02:56:42,791 --> 02:56:45,374
Hail Mother lndia!

1421
02:56:54,666 --> 02:56:58,832
To celebrate Milkha Singh's
glorious victory in Pakistan...

1422
02:56:59,583 --> 02:57:03,665
... l propose a public
holiday in this honour.

1423
02:57:04,333 --> 02:57:07,415
Milkha has planted the lndian flag!

1424
02:57:08,625 --> 02:57:12,124
He's done it!

1425
02:59:47,166 --> 02:59:53,040
No one has ever run
like you did today.

1426
02:59:54,125 --> 02:59:57,332
You didn't run my son, you flew.

1427
02:59:59,375 --> 03:00:01,832
From now on the world
will know you as...

1428
03:00:02,708 --> 03:00:05,374
... 'The Flying Sikh.'

1429
03:00:06,416 --> 03:00:09,165
Pakistan bestows
this title upon you...

1430
03:00:09,791 --> 03:00:11,207
... with pride and honour.

1431
03:00:13,083 --> 03:00:15,665
Well done, my boy. Well done.

1432
03:00:51,208 --> 03:00:55,124
"The world is lashing out at you.
Welcome the battle cry."

1433
03:00:55,250 --> 03:00:59,415
"Your arms are like oars.
Feet that raise an uproar "

1434
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:04,040
"Your every vein is iron ore.
You are fire Milkha."

1435
03:01:05,833 --> 03:01:09,790
"Now you run Milkha"

1436
03:01:11,250 --> 03:01:17,207
"Now you run Milkha, run Milkha,
run run run run run Milkha"

1437
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,999
"O rod of steel"

1438
03:01:28,666 --> 03:01:34,082
"O boat"

1439
03:01:35,583 --> 03:01:39,207
"O rod of steel.
Turn around the tides of fire "

1440
03:01:39,291 --> 03:01:44,915
"O boat,
Your glory lies in sinking "

1441
03:01:52,041 --> 03:01:58,082
"Now you run Milkha"

1442
03:01:59,625 --> 03:02:05,332
"Now you must rise Milkha"

1443
03:02:06,791 --> 03:02:13,332
"You are fire Milkha"

1444
03:02:14,333 --> 03:02:20,082
"Now awaken Milkha"

1445
03:02:21,500 --> 03:02:27,332
"You are fire Milkha"

1446
03:02:32,708 --> 03:02:38,790
"Now you must run Milkha"

1447
03:02:39,833 --> 03:02:43,499
"The field is your cradle.
Cover it with your splendour "

1448
03:02:43,583 --> 03:02:45,290
"The mountains are at your head"

1449
03:02:45,458 --> 03:02:49,082
"Drape the entire sky"

1450
03:02:49,166 --> 03:02:52,624
"Tie the turban of resolve Milkha"

1451
03:02:55,041 --> 03:02:59,207
"You are fire Milkha."

1452
03:03:02,583 --> 03:03:06,165
Tear open the wheels of that chariot.
Turn it into the divine disc."

1453
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:10,540
"Bind well the laces of war. The
lion has emerged from his lair "

1454
03:03:11,166 --> 03:03:14,332
"Fire the bullet Milkha"

1455
03:03:19,041 --> 03:03:27,665
"Now you must run Milkha"

1456
03:03:30,041 --> 03:03:51,040
"Now awaken Milkha"

1457
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:58,415
"You are fire Milkha"

1458
03:04:00,125 --> 03:04:04,790
"Bite through the electric fire"

1459
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:09,040
"Chew the metal's
vibrating current"

1460
03:04:09,375 --> 03:04:12,790
"Set aflame your every pore"

1461
03:04:13,083 --> 03:04:16,999
"Without burning
yourself there's no glow"

1462
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:22,915
"The flames are burning Milkha"

1463
03:04:47,625 --> 03:04:52,999
"Now awaken Milkha"

1464
03:04:54,666 --> 03:05:01,332
"You are fire Milkha"
