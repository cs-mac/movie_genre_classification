1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,335
With the support of
the Argentine National Film Board

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,439
This is a fictional film
based on real events.

3
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,350
World Cup Final Game
Buenos Aires, 1978

4
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:44,567
Captive

5
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,761
Their Excellencies...

6
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:34,731
the commanders
of the Armed Forces...

7
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:39,327
members of the Military Junta.

8
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:45,042
Your Excellency, Mr. President,
is giving the cup to...

9
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,048
the team Captain, Daniel Passarella.

10
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:55,318
The 11th Soccer Cup of the
International Federation of Soccer, 1978.

11
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:19,944
The Outskirts of Buenos Aires, 1994

12
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:52,750
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday Cristina...

13
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,354
Happy birthday to you!

14
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,725
Excuse me.

15
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,157
Excuse me. Miss?

16
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,927
I have an appointment for a blood test.

17
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,900
Your name?

18
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,562
Cristina Quadri... my daughter

19
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,708
Yes. Please take a seat.
They'll call you in a minute.

20
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,776
Was there a problem with the tests?

21
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,470
I don't know. Who's her doctor?

22
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,013
- Doctor Levito
- Then you'll have to ask him.

23
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,416
- Is he in?
- I'll check. Please take a seat.

24
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,326
Mrs. Quadri, who called you
about this appointment?

25
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:03,565
A nurse... Julia.

26
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,075
I'll tell her.

27
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,735
Dr. Levito is out on an emergency,
but Julia left a message saying...

28
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,815
this is just a follow-up
of her appendectomy.

29
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,454
Mom, you scared me!

30
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,951
I knocked. Didn't you hear me?

31
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:54,493
I was thinking... about the Virgin Mary.

32
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,303
About the Miracle, of Jesus.

33
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,402
That he was conceived by
the Divine Will of the Holy Spirit.

34
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,169
Do you believe it?

35
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,710
- Of course.
- Why?

36
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,810
It's a matter of faith.

37
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,913
The rest of us... that's a different story.

38
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,554
Again, fooling with that scar...

39
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,461
How was I born? By caesarian?

40
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,332
No.

41
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,268
How did it feel carrying me?

42
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,212
Why are you asking me this now?

43
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:36,976
It must be hard carrying
a baby inside of you.

44
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:41,485
It's much harder when that baby
grows up and runs around on her own.

45
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,660
It doesn't hurt that much.

46
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,796
I'm glad.

47
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,703
- Good night.
- Good night.

48
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:04,503
...therefore it is up to the President
to sign or veto a bill.

49
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,913
This gives him almost
unrestricted power to control...

50
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:16,753
what's going to become law
or be returned to Congress for review.

51
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:21,931
Now, what happens if
the President vetoes a bill?

52
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,668
Yes.

53
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,168
The Constitution says that
the veto of a bill by a President...

54
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:35,075
may be overridden by a
two-thirds vote of the Congress.

55
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,683
What happens then?

56
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,979
The bill becomes a law.

57
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,284
The bill becomes a law.
DIMWITTED DEVIL

58
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,584
But there are exceptions.

59
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:48,289
See if you remember them.

60
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:54,062
The President may sign a bill
into law for special circumstances...

61
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:57,037
without any participation from Congress.

62
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,302
For instance...

63
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,072
The Amnesty.

64
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,920
The Presidential Pardon is one...

65
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,190
The Amnesty is in reality
a Presidential Pardon of sorts.

66
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,398
You said that yourself.
Unrestricted power, right?

67
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,432
Then why does the Congress exist?

68
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:25,738
We are talking about
exceptions to the rule.

69
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,543
In reality, the Presidential Pardon is...

70
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,842
indicated in the Constitution itself.

71
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:37,352
- Then, I'd like...
- So, if he wants can throw away...

72
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:41,117
all the evidence collected
for years against those assassins.

73
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:46,328
Yes, he can do tha
for anybody he wants...

74
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:49,592
whether we like it or not.

75
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,127
You know well enough...

76
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,636
Those dictators suspended the
Constitution
and now, they are protected by it.

77
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:59,337
It's got nothing to do
with protecting or not protecting.

78
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:02,241
I'm trying to explain to you
the powers given to the President...

79
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:04,350
by the Constitution.

80
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:07,148
To the President... or to a tyrant?

81
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,881
The truth is that those people
were found guilty in a court of law. Guilty.

82
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,186
And the President doesn't
have the right to ignore it.

83
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,293
Why don't you organize a lobby...

84
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,195
go to Congress...

85
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:23,066
and get an Amendment to nullify
the Presidential Amnesty.

86
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,876
Who are you kidding?

87
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,741
The President and all those
bastard politicians are a bunch...

88
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:32,439
of sold out assholes.

89
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:38,617
Miss Arguedas, is that language
proper for my class?

90
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:42,091
Leave immediately.
I'll see you in the principal's office.

91
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,975
- Please turn to page...
- Hypocrite.

92
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,402
...page 159.

93
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,494
Come in.

94
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,809
You wrote that...

95
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,915
I recognize the handwriting.

96
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:36,520
I heard Angelica's looking for her
panties!

97
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:39,286
- Do you think she was expelled?
- No doubt.

98
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,562
That little bitch got
what was coming to her.

99
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,857
She always tried to get
everyone's attention.

100
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:47,202
Why do you think she always
contradicted the teachers?

101
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,997
To me, that's just her.

102
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,109
To me, that's just her.

103
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,610
You know her parents are leftist radicals.

104
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,477
Angelica's parents?

105
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,082
Didn't her father die in the Malvinas
War?

106
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,850
What Malvinas War?

107
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,188
They used to kill people
with bombs. Even priests.

108
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,494
Who told you that?

109
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:14,828
It's true. Everyone knows it.

110
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,897
Why would they want to kill priests?

111
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,205
What do you mean, "why?"

112
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,308
Because they're communists.

113
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,678
So they're disappeared.

114
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,913
What do you mean disappeared?
Those are all lies.

115
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,648
They ran away. They left the country.

116
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,486
But that was a long
time ago, during the war.

117
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,861
You mean the Malvinas?

118
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,996
Again with the Malvinas, dope.

119
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,362
The war against the communists.

120
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,168
Your parents never told you anything?

121
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,747
This coup d'état brought on by
the Government resulted in...

122
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,443
the insurrection that broke out
among the Parisian population
July 27th...

123
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,332
- Mom?
- What are you doing up this late?

124
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,931
- I can't study
- Cristina! Still up!

125
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,070
- You should be sleeping by now.
- Come, come hug your godfather.

126
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:27,639
- I was studying.
- She was studying.

127
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,719
Studying at this hour?

128
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:33,255
- We aren't making too much
noise are we?
- You should be in bed...

129
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:35,690
- Tomorrow we have an exam, mom.
- Tomorrow?

130
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,853
Susana didn't tell us anything.

131
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:41,057
She's going to slide by
like she always does.

132
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:46,470
The one who deserves the best grades...
is you.

133
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,006
Go back to your studies.

134
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,573
My goodness...

135
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,978
It seems like only yesterday
I could lift her up like a puppet.

136
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,518
Now she's the one who could lift me up.

137
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,416
Am I wrong?

138
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,286
Don't worry. We'll be very quiet.

139
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,627
Go to bed now.

140
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,479
Sister Teresa.

141
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,319
Miss Quadri, Mother Superior
would like to see you.

142
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,859
- Me?
- Yes.

143
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:38,361
- Now?
- Immediately.

144
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,268
- All right, Sister Teresa.
- Please bring all your belongings.

145
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,474
Wait here, please.

146
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,444
Yes?

147
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:56,215
Mother Superior, Miss Quadri is here.

148
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,087
- Let her in, Sister.
- All right. Please, come in.

149
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,565
- Good morning, Miss Quadri.
- Good morning, Mother.

150
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,671
Please, sit down.

151
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,582
Dr. Gomez is an Assistant District
Attorney...

152
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:24,016
and Ms. Bernstein, a psychologist.

153
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:29,391
They were sent by a judge, Dr.
Barrenechea.

154
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,457
They brought a judicial order.

155
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,593
Please.

156
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,705
Why does a judge want to see me?

157
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:49,750
You will have to ask him yourself.

158
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:53,646
- Mother, did you talk to my parents?
- No, my dear.

159
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,951
Mother, I'm not allowed to
leave school without their permission.

160
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:01,621
I understand perfectly, but I have
spoken personally with Dr.
Barrenechea...

161
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,895
and I trust it is prudent
to follow this course of action.

162
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,368
- But, why? Did I do something wrong?
- No nothing, child.

163
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:09,501
Absolutely nothing.

164
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:12,838
Dr. Barrenechea will explain everything.

165
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,514
- I want to talk to my parents first.
- You will be allowed to talk to the...

166
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,616
but you must see Dr. Barrenechea first.

167
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,319
If I may...

168
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,622
I completely understand your confusion.

169
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:29,424
You don't even know us.
He's Horacio, I'm Liliana.

170
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,692
The judge, Miguel Barrenechea, asked
us
to go with you to his office...

171
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,801
because he has something
very important to tell you.

172
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:36,904
What does he want to tell me?

173
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,801
Look, the best thing is that
we go to his office, he'll tell you...

174
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,978
and you can ask him
all the questions you want.

175
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,911
So, I'll go with these people and...

176
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,678
They'll bring me back to school?

177
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:54,216
They will take you to see Dr.
Barrenechea
and he'll explain everything to you.

178
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,919
Sister Elsa will accompany you.

179
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,575
We'll be right with you.

180
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:19,948
MIGU EL BARRENECH EA - FEDERAL
JU DGE

181
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,602
Cristina, please. Wait here, Sister.

182
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,852
Hello. I'm Miguel Barrenechea...

183
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,621
a federal judge.

184
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,125
Please, sit down.

185
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,844
Do you want something to drink?

186
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,650
Do you have your I.D. With you?

187
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,984
May I see it please?

188
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:26,934
- Do my parents know I'm here?
- No.

189
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,270
- Why not?
- I'll explain to you in a minute. I promise.

190
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:18,124
You are young...

191
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,086
but not a child anymore.

192
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm confident it's time you learned the
truth.

193
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,395
Several studies were done...

194
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:31,468
and the results...

195
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,436
show conclusively...

196
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,909
that your real identity and age...

197
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,347
are different than the ones indicated on
this document.

198
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:45,885
Your real name is not
the one you have always used.

199
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:51,186
Your parents are two persons...

200
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:55,098
whose names you surely won't
recognize...

201
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:59,762
Leticia Dominich and Agustíun Lombardi.

202
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,609
What are you talking about?

203
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:08,183
Your blood matches the Lombardis' and
the Dominichs'.

204
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,118
I don't understand.

205
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,017
My parents never told me about any
tests.

206
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,320
Several tests were done.

207
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,996
One here in Argentina

208
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,721
another in the United States...

209
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,664
and another in France.

210
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,231
The three of them have shown the same
results.

211
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,510
Your parents...

212
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:41,348
were two architects kidnapped by
security forces during...

213
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:44,857
the military dictatorship in 1978.

214
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:51,054
Their families have been searching for
them ever since without success...

215
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,530
but they've found you.

216
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,497
You are mistaken.

217
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,239
Believe me, I've been in this courthouse
for many years...

218
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:05,041
and this isn't the first time I've
encountered this.

219
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:08,554
There are many youngsters like you...

220
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,552
who are just now learning the truth.

221
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:14,455
- Have you told my parents this?
- No.

222
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,953
That's exactly the point.

223
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:20,266
They are not your real parents.

224
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,904
Your case is called appropriation...

225
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:27,563
because the transfer of your custody
was executed without...

226
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,835
your natural parents' permission.

227
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:35,073
That's why you are justly claimed...

228
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,081
by their relatives.

229
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:39,279
I want to see my parents.

230
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:41,414
You will speak to the Quadris soon.

231
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,321
Believe me.

232
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:48,056
I would not have called you if I wasn't
completely certain of what I'm telling you.

233
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,831
I want you to meet someone.

234
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,166
I am your grandmother...

235
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:31,606
...the mother of your mother.

236
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,597
Cristina, stop! Calm down!

237
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,194
Stop, Cristina!

238
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:02,417
Mom! Shit!

239
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:08,953
One ticket, please. Thank you.

240
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:40,797
OUT OF ORDER

241
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,348
- Hello.
- Mom!

242
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,050
Cris...

243
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,584
- Where are you calling from?
- The train station.

244
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:00,222
- Which train station?
- Our train station.

245
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,418
Come pick me up. You'll never
believe what happened.

246
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:05,461
- Why aren't you at school?
- They took me out of school, Mom.

247
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,690
- Who?
- Ajudge.

248
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,359
Ajudge! Ajudge... what judge?

249
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,268
Banechea... something like that
and other people I've never met.

250
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:16,673
They took me to a courthouse.
Mother Superior didn't even let me call
you.

251
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:18,869
Mom?

252
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:23,508
Yeah... I... uh... I don't understand.

253
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:29,013
- Where are they now?
- I don't know, Mom.

254
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,286
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

255
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:35,292
I'm going to pick you up. Just wait for
me.

256
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,593
If you see anything wrong, get in there...

257
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:40,602
...hide... in the ladies waiting room.

258
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,298
Ok, mom. But please, hurry.

259
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,806
I'll be right there.

260
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,150
Dad!

261
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,588
- How are you... is everything ok?

262
00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:03,258
What happened?

263
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,901
I want to go home. And where's Mom?

264
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:09,030
Let's go home.

265
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,171
She's waiting for us at home.

266
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,042
Mr. Pablo Quadri?

267
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:21,711
- Who are you?
- Officer Diaz. Federal Police.

268
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,122
- Do I know you, Officer?
- Are you Mr. Pablo Quadri, sir?

269
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,360
- Yes.
- What do you want?

270
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,264
I'm following orders from the court.

271
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,858
The Federal Judge, Dr. Barrenechea,
is submitting this order for your detention.

272
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,166
What do you mean, "detention"?
What is this?

273
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:41,366
You can ask the judge,
I'm just following his orders.

274
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,770
Cristina Quadri?

275
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:45,472
Yes, she's my daughter.

276
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:48,276
You and the young lady will have to
come with me to his office.

277
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,147
You are speaking with a retired captain
of the Federal Police.

278
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:52,949
I know, sir.

279
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:56,058
Dad, please.

280
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:02,358
Who is your superior?

281
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:05,301
Sir, this an order from a Federal Judge.

282
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:16,081
What the hell does this guy want?

283
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:22,250
...declares that on March 20th 1979 in
Lanus Central Hospital a girl was born...

284
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:27,952
whose existence was verified by
Dr. Fernando Canaro, Obstetrician...

285
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,361
according to the certificate filed
under this article number...

286
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:33,798
whose given name is Maria Cristina
Quadri...

287
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:40,342
her father being Pablo Quadri
and her mother Adela L. Barboza de
Quadri...

288
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,741
her grandparents... the witnesses...

289
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:50,187
Dr. Raimondi, I already have a
copy of this certificate in my files.

290
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:53,222
It has been carefully examined.

291
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:56,383
It appears to be an authentic document.

292
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:59,930
Everything written here matches
the information in the archives.

293
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,261
However...

294
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,565
...the hospital where the young lady
was supposedly born doesn't have...

295
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:07,173
a record of her birth.

296
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:11,071
All the names of the witnesses are false.

297
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:17,982
Dr. Fernando Canaro has fled the
country
and is a fugitive from justice.

298
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,954
The blood tests have proven
with 99.98º/o certainty that...

299
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:28,725
the young lady is the daughter
of a disappeared couple whose family...

300
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:31,529
has pleaded for justice.

301
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:35,105
This birth certificate is invalid.

302
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,937
She was 15 years old.

303
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:42,013
Here she is with Agustín...

304
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,544
your dad.

305
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,450
They had just started going out.

306
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:55,518
We wanted to introduce him
to the family, so we had a BBQ at home.

307
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,459
Your grandfather, my husband Beto...

308
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,900
didn't like him at first.

309
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,736
He said that he didn't
talk enough, that he was too shy.

310
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:12,545
I told him he was right, but that he
reminded me of someone I knew very
well...

311
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:16,988
because your grandfather
was a shy as Agustín...

312
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:19,783
when he was introduced to me.

313
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:26,926
They had already chosen
the names for the baby.

314
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,730
If it was going to be a boy, Agustín...

315
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:35,302
and if it was to be a girl... Sofía.

316
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:45,051
What happened to them?

317
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:54,456
One day suddenly, they disappeared.

318
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,066
We didn't know anything else about
them.

319
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,503
It can't be.

320
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,337
I want to see my parents...

321
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:10,443
I want to see my parents... this can't be!

322
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:18,148
Please leave me alone.

323
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,246
And how did you do that?

324
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,548
With witnesses that guaranteed
that it was her blood.

325
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:48,649
It was matched with blood taken
from the parents of this missing couple...

326
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:49,920
and results were conclusive.

327
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,224
I can't believe that you acted
behind the back of Cristina's...

328
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:54,264
legitimate parents.

329
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,236
Dr. Raimondi, the legal medical tests
have shown that the Quadris are not...

330
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:02,002
the legitimate parents of the girl.

331
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:05,873
What are you saying? We are Cristina's
parents.

332
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,581
I had to proceed this way due to
the numerous cases of people who
have...

333
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,212
ignored judicial orders and fled
the country taking those persons...

334
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,221
claimed by other families.

335
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:21,591
It's happened to me twice, so I didn't
want to take any chances this time.

336
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:25,758
There's no reason for my clients
to flee from justice.

337
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:29,135
Dr. Raimondi, I'm not inside
your clients' heads...

338
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:31,242
I don't know what they would do.

339
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:35,813
I had to make a determination
based exclusively on the evidence.

340
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:40,386
I'm sorry, Your Honor but this is a circus.

341
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,590
That blood could have
been taken from anybody.

342
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,852
Also, the tests were made without
the knowledge of her parents...

343
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,088
nor the control of their own witnesses.

344
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,221
I've been on this case for
a long time and I've had to proceed...

345
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,697
with a great deal of discretion.

346
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:57,602
With discretion? You've proceeded
illegally.

347
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:03,612
Doctor, present evidence that
your clients are the girl's natural parents.

348
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:07,047
Until then, she will remain a ward of the
State.

349
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:10,449
Don't even think we're going to leave
Cristina here alone.

350
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:12,452
She won't be left alone, Mrs. Quadri.

351
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:15,092
She'll be under my care.

352
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,627
The State has makes me responsible for
her protection...

353
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:22,667
if I have evidence that a felony has been
committed...

354
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:26,829
Kidnapping and Appropriation of a Minor.

355
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,952
Where are my parents?

356
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,784
We don't know...

357
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,658
but we're here to help you.

358
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:51,101
I don't need any help.

359
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:54,696
I just want to see my parents.

360
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:57,374
You're going to see Pablo and Adela
soon.

361
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:05,750
Look, we think seeing them
would confuse you even more.

362
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,263
Believe me, you'll see them, but not now.

363
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,738
- Why not?
- Because It's not the right time.

364
00:37:56,344 --> 00:38:00,404
- Did you send them to jail?
- No. They're free.

365
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:05,575
Then, I'm going to escape again.

366
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:10,948
You escape, I'll look for you.

367
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:14,529
If you escape again...
I'll look for you again.

368
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:16,427
This is not a child's game.

369
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:24,205
I know how you feel, but it's important
to understand what's going on here.

370
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:28,936
The tests are conclusive...
I know you'll understand later.

371
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:48,092
Elisa, your grandmother's been looking
for you since the day you were born.

372
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:49,636
She loves you.

373
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,398
She'll take care of you.

374
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,970
You'll get to know each other.

375
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,143
Please...

376
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,615
...do not give your new address to
anyone.

377
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:05,613
This is my phone number.

378
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:13,196
At this point in my life,
I don't remember who's older:

379
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:15,923
My Citroen or me.

380
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:22,096
Your grandfather taught your mother
how to drive this car.

381
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,673
Would you like to learn?

382
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,514
There's the church. Can you see it?

383
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,714
And there is the plaza...

384
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,524
...the market...

385
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:42,152
Your mom, when she got her license...

386
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,663
would always borrow the car...

387
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:48,260
and I would take advantage of that
and send her to get groceries.

388
00:39:49,073 --> 00:39:51,974
Here we are...

389
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:04,283
Look, this was going to be your
bedroom.

390
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:07,949
Your mother was already pregnant
when they designed it.

391
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,628
They were going to share it
with three families...

392
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:14,300
...the same living room, the same
kitchen...

393
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:17,166
...see these windows?

394
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:22,605
She loved the light, all natural light.

395
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:25,736
She didn't want curtains, nothing...

396
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,781
As you can see, nothing like me.

397
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:31,921
I'm very old-fashioned.

398
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:38,059
Do you want me to show you the house?

399
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:52,913
I know how you feel.

400
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:57,346
I also know that for you, now, I'm
nobody.

401
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:01,222
But I want you to know is that
this family has been waiting...

402
00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:04,451
many years for this moment.

403
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,226
I want to make a phone call.

404
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:12,095
All right.

405
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,366
The phone is over here.

406
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,685
You've reached the Quadri family.

407
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:39,526
If you want to leave a message for
Pablo,
Adela and Cristina, do so after the beep.

408
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,465
Mom...

409
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:44,103
Mom, It's me...

410
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:48,003
Dad...

411
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:50,908
Hello?

412
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:54,848
Hello?

413
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,336
My bedroom.

414
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:18,643
Your grandfather died 5 years ago...

415
00:42:27,354 --> 00:42:29,151
This is your bedroom.

416
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:32,226
It belonged to Ana, my younger
daughter.

417
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:36,259
There, in front... was your mother's.

418
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,200
Let's see...

419
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:45,139
your clothes...

420
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,578
What do you think?

421
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:54,048
You can change it, if you want...
you can change everything here...

422
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:57,222
...if you want, whichever way you want.

423
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,283
What's your name?

424
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:03,622
Elisa, but in my family
they call me "Nana."

425
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:07,028
And in my family, they
call me "Cristina."

426
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,434
You know...

427
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,371
You are the exact image of your mom.

428
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:18,238
You have the same voice... identical.

429
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:23,580
Believe me, I didn't need a blood test
to know that you were my granddaughter.

430
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,756
Sofía.

431
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:50,279
Mom?

432
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:55,220
Grandma?

433
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:24,490
Wait here a second. I'll be right back.

434
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:43,081
Everything's fine.

435
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,014
We'll be waiting for you right here.

436
00:47:45,187 --> 00:47:47,555
If you don't come out in two hours,
we'll come get you.

437
00:47:58,302 --> 00:48:01,033
Get anything you need.

438
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:32,872
They're making me crazy.

439
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:52,060
Cristina... Sweetie...

440
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:58,899
I can't believe what's happening.

441
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,107
How are those jerks treating you?

442
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,438
Do you want something to drink?

443
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,774
What can I get you?

444
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:10,476
You haven't eaten breakfast...

445
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:12,813
Did you sleep all right?

446
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:15,252
Don't you want to take a bath?

447
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:23,794
Is the place dirty? Your hair is dirty.

448
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:25,936
Did they put a microphone on you?

449
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,737
Did that jerk of a judge
conceal a microphone on you?

450
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:31,835
No.

451
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,341
Those kind of people will
do anything to bring you down.

452
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:37,949
But I don't give a damn.
All I care about is you, you and you.

453
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:40,346
Where are you staying?

454
00:49:40,486 --> 00:49:43,320
- I can't...
- Why?

455
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:46,557
- What do you mean you can't?
- I can't tell you...

456
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,292
He says if I tell you,
we'll have more problems.

457
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:51,625
He's the one who created this mess.

458
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:54,228
He says if you know where I am,
you'll look for me and he'll end up...

459
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:58,030
...sending you to jail.
- Is that what he told you?

460
00:49:58,206 --> 00:49:59,673
That piece of garbage doesn't
know who he's dealing with.

461
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,310
I don't give a damn
if they send me to jail.

462
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:04,879
Dad, it matters to me if you go to jail.

463
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,278
That wind bag wouldn't
dare send me to jail.

464
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:09,612
Let him rot in hell!

465
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:13,947
Talk to me about that old woman.

466
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:27,939
Her name is Elisa.

467
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,643
They say that according
to the blood test, she's my grandmother...

468
00:50:37,585 --> 00:50:40,282
...that my parents
are some other people...

469
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:44,455
...that my name is Sofía Lombardi.

470
00:50:44,994 --> 00:50:47,827
They even changed your name,
those sons of bitches.

471
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:50,727
We're appealing with our lawyer
to get you back with us...

472
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:53,359
but we don't know how long
it's going to take.

473
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:55,836
Why don't you get a blood test?

474
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:57,965
Why do we have to get a blood test?

475
00:50:58,109 --> 00:51:00,475
What do we have to prove? That we love
you?

476
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:02,169
Haven't we been your parents
for your entire life?

477
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:04,781
Yes, but wkhy don't you do the test?

478
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:24,695
Not a word about this to anyone.

479
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:29,040
Do you remember this picture?

480
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,044
Yes.

481
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:33,378
When mom was pregnant with me.

482
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:38,581
What we're going to tell you,
we were going to tell you...

483
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:41,692
but we were waiting for the right time...

484
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:45,292
when you became an adult.

485
00:51:45,496 --> 00:51:50,491
When Mom and I got married,
we wanted to have children...

486
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:53,936
but Adela had many problems.

487
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:56,507
Eventually, she got pregnant...

488
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:01,479
but not with you...

489
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:06,385
with another girl.

490
00:52:06,488 --> 00:52:08,979
She was born dead.

491
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:14,087
A few months later an officer called
because they'd found a baby girl...

492
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:16,823
who had just been born
and nobody had claimed her...

493
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,963
Since he knew about our grief...

494
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,661
...we told him we wanted to adopt her.

495
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:26,936
It was you.

496
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,571
So, he brought you to our house.

497
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:35,851
We raised you... as our child.

498
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,755
The child we couldn't have.

499
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:45,396
We wanted you to grow up knowing
you had a place in this world.

500
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,568
So, it's true.

501
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:52,003
I'm not your daughter.

502
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,310
Of course you are. We raised you
since the day you were born.

503
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:58,743
Real daughter.

504
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:01,417
Your original parents abandoned you.

505
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:05,880
We're your real parents and
we're very proud that we are.

506
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:11,221
But why I...

507
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:16,494
Do you know why they abandoned me?

508
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,432
Perhaps, they couldn't or they didn't
know how to raise you.

509
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,705
We don't know.

510
00:53:23,343 --> 00:53:25,139
So, who are my parents?

511
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:27,472
We are.

512
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:30,707
My real parents.

513
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:34,718
We don't know. We never met them.

514
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:40,922
I don't understand why you
didn't tell me this before?

515
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,623
Wasn't I old enough?

516
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,132
What did you want...

517
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:50,034
...to grow up thinking that you
were different from your friends?

518
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,301
When did you find me?

519
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,413
March 20, 1979.

520
00:53:57,581 --> 00:53:59,380
My birthday.

521
00:53:59,518 --> 00:54:06,254
We never knew exactly when you were
born,
so we chose that day as your birthday...

522
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:09,557
How big was I when they found me?

523
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:13,599
You were just a few days old.

524
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,634
Where did they find me?

525
00:54:15,736 --> 00:54:17,795
We don't know for sure.

526
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:21,774
They told us at a train station...
in an abandoned train.

527
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,402
In an abandoned train?

528
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:27,573
We were told... we don't know.

529
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:29,684
Which station?

530
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:32,281
We never wanted to find out.

531
00:54:32,923 --> 00:54:34,390
After all we had gone through...

532
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:38,125
we didn't want to know.

533
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:40,754
So, it's true that they existed.

534
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:43,059
You don't know anything about them?

535
00:54:43,134 --> 00:54:47,003
Cristy, we didn't have the slightest idea
who these people were.

536
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,504
Perhaps, the Lombardis left me.

537
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:51,336
How would we know?

538
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:53,742
How would you know they're NOT
the ones if you never saw them?

539
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:55,648
I don't know. They could have
made up a story.

540
00:54:55,648 --> 00:54:57,411
What for?

541
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,009
I don't know. People say anything
because they want to have a child.

542
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:02,519
And the blood test?

543
00:55:02,691 --> 00:55:06,286
We don't know where that blood came
from.
Why do we have to believe them?

544
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:18,807
I feel used.

545
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:21,811
Who is using you?

546
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:25,145
- Everybody.
- Everybody?

547
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:33,556
They take me from one place to another.
They tell me all these things.

548
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:36,363
Who should I believe?

549
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:38,955
Who do you believe?

550
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,435
I don't know. The blood, for example...

551
00:56:43,907 --> 00:56:45,704
how do I know it's mine?

552
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:47,467
You don't believe the judge?

553
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,043
I don't know. Sometimes I do.

554
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:53,841
When I see the picture I do...

555
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,181
but he lied to me.

556
00:56:58,523 --> 00:57:02,220
Supposedly, they were testing
my blood because of the appendicitis.

557
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,660
But do you understand why he did it?

558
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,730
Yes, but still he could have
asked my parents.

559
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:13,763
Do you understand that he didn't
have any guarantee that they'd
cooperate?

560
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:24,309
Do you work for him?

561
00:57:24,452 --> 00:57:27,785
I work for you, not him.

562
00:57:29,258 --> 00:57:32,695
...but if you feel like it, can you
tell him everything I say to you?

563
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:36,424
I don't tell him or anyone anything
about what I discuss with my patients.

564
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:40,904
He hired me, but we work independently.

565
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,541
Hang in there.

566
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:50,005
Your life could change for the better.

567
00:58:03,098 --> 00:58:06,193
I hope they finish it someday.
It's been like that for 20 years.

568
00:58:06,335 --> 00:58:09,305
- Honey, are the sausages ready?
- Yes, they're ready.

569
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,001
Who wants some of the lettuce
that I planted with my own hands?

570
00:58:14,944 --> 00:58:17,742
- Which soccer team do you root for?
- Boca.

571
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:20,250
Dad, she roots for Boca.

572
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:23,912
Excuse me, sausages for the children.

573
00:58:24,656 --> 00:58:28,854
- You got whipped by River, huh?
- But what about the other two times.

574
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,155
Well, we played with substitutes then.

575
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:35,894
Maxi, talking about soccer again.
I told you that it's a game, not a war.

576
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:39,631
Please, you aren't going to
talk about soccer all afternoon. Right?

577
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:44,108
- Yeah, but last time we won.
- Don't worry, I root for Boca too.

578
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:48,080
- Nana, you don't count.
- See the way they treat me?

579
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:53,120
Well, before anything,
I want to propose a toast.

580
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:58,659
I want to say what a pleasure it is
to finally have our cousin home.

581
00:58:58,796 --> 00:59:04,290
I want you to know that you were
always in this house with us...

582
00:59:04,467 --> 00:59:09,873
but It's a great joy to
have you really here with us.

583
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:14,776
Welcome. Cheers.

584
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:16,846
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

585
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:19,076
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

586
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:22,120
- Happiness.
- Cheers.

587
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:25,226
- Cheers.
- Cheers to everyone.

588
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:31,193
Let's eat.

589
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:33,766
How do you like Nana's house?

590
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:36,303
Dark.

591
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:39,171
We all agree.

592
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,641
One time I saw a ghost there.

593
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,213
Luis is our ghost specialist.

594
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,546
Yes, It's true. I saw it in
a room that's always closed.

595
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:50,553
It was white with many things on it.

596
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:53,555
It was big like the moon.

597
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,179
If at any time, for any reason,
you want to come here...

598
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:20,220
this is your bedroom.

599
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:23,654
I can't believe you're here.

600
01:00:25,328 --> 01:00:27,194
Do you like the Beatles?

601
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:29,595
I haven't listened to them much.

602
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:33,762
Your mom was a fanatic, she loved
them.

603
01:00:33,937 --> 01:00:36,303
She had all the records.
There's the collection...

604
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,933
so if you want it, it's yours.

605
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,743
Want to play on the rocking horse?

606
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:55,559
Look, here you are at six months
inside your mom's belly.

607
01:00:58,065 --> 01:01:00,397
Two months later she was taken.

608
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,035
She wrote the date here-

609
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:05,470
- It can't be.
- Why?

610
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:09,669
March 1978... it was a year
before I was born.

611
01:01:10,912 --> 01:01:14,279
You must have been born
in June or July of '78.

612
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:18,717
We don't know the exact date,
but maybe someday we'll find out.

613
01:01:20,324 --> 01:01:22,520
I was born in March of '79.

614
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,425
It's written on my I.D.

615
01:01:25,497 --> 01:01:31,232
Well, the Quadris may have and paid
an officer to sign the certificate.

616
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:35,139
Different name... different date...

617
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,176
Luckily, your blood couldn't be changed.

618
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:45,618
- Catalan, Mirta
- Here.

619
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:48,585
- Colomblo, Gustavo.
- Here.

620
01:01:48,756 --> 01:01:50,782
- Da Silva, Verónica.
- Here.

621
01:01:50,959 --> 01:01:52,688
- De Lucci, Paula.
- Here.

622
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:55,024
- Domínguez, Gustavo.
- Here.

623
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:57,532
Enciso, Verónica.

624
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:00,637
- Estévez, Jimena.
- Here.

625
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,170
- Gonzales, Nicanor.
- Here.

626
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:05,537
- Gutierrez, Marcos.
- Here.

627
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:07,736
Juarez, Jimena.

628
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:10,712
Lombardi, Sofía.

629
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:16,950
Lombardi, Sofía.

630
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:18,854
She's calling you.

631
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:23,226
- Martinez, Estela.
- Here.

632
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:04,209
Elisa?

633
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:21,961
Ode to the Present, by Neruda.

634
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:25,672
- Don't fall asleep.
- Move it!

635
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,939
- Don't fall asleep.
- Move it!

636
01:05:28,077 --> 01:05:29,510
Move!

637
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,944
- Move it!
- Pass it!

638
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:35,346
Let's go, girls-

639
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:40,850
- Pass it over... Good!

640
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:51,299
Good! Good!

641
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,284
So you're going to Moreno High now?

642
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,622
And you're at Belgrano?

643
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:11,557
I've got to talk to you.

644
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:14,121
About what?

645
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:18,260
My parents are also disappeared.

646
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:37,320
I don't know why my mother
sent me to that shitty school.

647
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:40,188
She says my granny is to blame...

648
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,786
She's very Catholic and...
she forced her to.

649
01:07:42,963 --> 01:07:46,422
I don't know... give me a break.
Just tell her no and that's it.

650
01:07:47,636 --> 01:07:51,733
So, I wasn't heartbroken when
I had to change schools.

651
01:07:56,145 --> 01:07:58,115
I still can't believe what you told me.

652
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:02,744
I knew that Susana's dad was a cop,
but not the guy who raised you.

653
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:08,121
My dad was a union delegate
in a metallurgy factory.

654
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:11,354
My mom also worked there.

655
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:18,928
A week before the World Cup, in '78,
the military went into...

656
01:08:19,072 --> 01:08:20,972
my parents' house and took them.

657
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,302
They were in Orletti...

658
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:28,548
a clandestine prison.

659
01:08:28,717 --> 01:08:31,209
They put them through hell...

660
01:08:31,386 --> 01:08:33,753
...tortured with electric shocks...

661
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:36,859
...shot at with blanks.

662
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:44,359
What did your parents do?

663
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:51,572
They spoke out against the dictatorship.
That was it.

664
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:57,581
Officially, Orletti was the name
of an automotive shop.

665
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,915
But, in reality, it was a concentration
camp right in downtown Buenos Aires.

666
01:09:02,088 --> 01:09:05,252
A concentration camp
in downtown Buenos Aires?

667
01:09:05,426 --> 01:09:07,690
How do you remember this?

668
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:10,696
How would I remember?
I was a one and a half.

669
01:09:10,832 --> 01:09:14,599
My mom told me, I always knew it.

670
01:09:17,373 --> 01:09:19,603
I was really very lucky...

671
01:09:21,845 --> 01:09:24,871
The night before, they had left
me at my grandmother's.

672
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:30,081
When my mom was released,
the two of us went to Spain.

673
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:32,312
And your dad?

674
01:09:33,525 --> 01:09:36,689
We never heard from him again.

675
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:45,330
What do you know about your parents?

676
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:48,071
There are two versions...

677
01:09:50,245 --> 01:09:53,078
My parents... the ones who raised me...

678
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:56,274
told me they don't
know anything about them.

679
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:01,582
The other family says they were
kidnapped when my mother...

680
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:03,987
was 8 months pregnant...

681
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:06,528
And, well...

682
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:10,128
And where were you born?

683
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:18,203
Which prison were they taken to?

684
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:21,403
I don't know if they were in a prison.

685
01:10:21,915 --> 01:10:24,439
Oh yes...

686
01:10:25,385 --> 01:10:28,184
What's your real name?

687
01:10:34,596 --> 01:10:36,586
They say It's Sofía Lombardi.

688
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:39,258
It seems my father's name was
Agustín Lombardi, and my mother's...

689
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,935
Leticia Dominich.

690
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:47,442
I'll ask my mother. Maybe she knew
them.

691
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,014
What do I call you? Sofía?

692
01:10:57,488 --> 01:10:59,251
No.

693
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,858
Call me Cristina.

694
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:13,771
TO THE DISAPPEARED...
WE'LL N EVER FORGET YOU!

695
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:27,616
...and about my father's family,
what do you know?

696
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:30,920
Your father's parents died a few years
ago.

697
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:33,722
You know, when your grandpa
got sick, he asked us to get...

698
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:38,824
his blood analyzed
so we could have proof.

699
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,636
And how did you find me?

700
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,266
Somebody told the Grandmothers
of Plaza de Mayo.

701
01:11:44,976 --> 01:11:46,739
Who?

702
01:11:50,048 --> 01:11:52,210
We don't really know...

703
01:11:52,318 --> 01:11:55,550
because we have to protect them...
so we don't know.

704
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:58,248
Do you know where I was born?

705
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,327
In a clandestine prison?

706
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:02,325
In Orletti?

707
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:05,763
Actually, I think in another one.

708
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,138
Were they tortured?

709
01:12:16,346 --> 01:12:19,145
You'll have to forgive me but...

710
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:24,916
...maybe later on I'll be able
to talk about this.

711
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:18,278
Cristina.

712
01:15:18,421 --> 01:15:20,719
- Angelica, what are you doing here?
- Hi.

713
01:15:20,823 --> 01:15:23,419
I went to your classroom.
They told me you were here.

714
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,256
- I found something.
- What?

715
01:15:25,428 --> 01:15:27,021
Leave that.

716
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:39,243
That's my father.

717
01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:49,249
See?

718
01:15:49,858 --> 01:15:52,851
First they were taken to
the Morín Police Department...

719
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:55,162
...and later the The Cave.

720
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,752
The Cave?

721
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:18,584
That's where your parents were.

722
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:22,388
It was a clandestine prison
next to the Olmos Penitentiary.

723
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,199
They were both in the same places.

724
01:16:31,006 --> 01:16:33,770
There's something else
in common. See these numbers?

725
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:37,305
Witnesses.

726
01:16:38,113 --> 01:16:41,550
There were people who saw
your parents, mine, everyone there.

727
01:16:42,952 --> 01:16:46,251
Your parents were seen by
the same people in the same places.

728
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:48,222
Who are they?

729
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:53,459
3520 and 8154... that's all I know.

730
01:16:54,599 --> 01:16:58,296
Angelica, if the numbers are here,
then the names should be somewhere.

731
01:16:58,403 --> 01:17:00,064
Yes.

732
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:03,704
- And they have this information.
- Who has it?

733
01:17:03,844 --> 01:17:06,038
The judge, your grandmother, your aunt.

734
01:17:06,178 --> 01:17:08,512
This is public information.

735
01:17:08,615 --> 01:17:10,378
What's not public is the names of the
witnesses...

736
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:13,008
and I don't know what they know about
that.

737
01:17:13,286 --> 01:17:16,984
Let's play dumb and do our own
investigation.

738
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:22,194
Don't tell anybody.

739
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,067
You'll have to be strong.

740
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:31,301
Sometimes we don't have any other
choice.

741
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,336
Bye.

01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,885
Cristina!

752
01:18:50,232 --> 01:18:53,066
- What are you doing here?
- I came to play a game.

753
01:18:53,235 --> 01:18:55,294
Which school are you attending?

754
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,405
I can't tell you that.

755
01:18:57,507 --> 01:18:59,409
Aren't we friends?

756
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,738
It's not that...

757
01:19:00,879 --> 01:19:03,642
They made me promise not to
talk about it with anyone.

758
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,113
Someday, when I tell you,
you'll understand what I mean.

759
01:19:07,252 --> 01:19:11,519
That's ok, don't worry.
I won't be waiting for your call.

760
01:19:12,424 --> 01:19:14,016
Susana.

761
01:19:16,762 --> 01:19:18,696
Did you know?

762
01:19:19,565 --> 01:19:21,157
What?

763
01:19:21,301 --> 01:19:22,859
About me.

764
01:19:26,173 --> 01:19:28,232
How long have you known?

765
01:19:32,179 --> 01:19:34,614
Your parents told you...

766
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:39,611
I don't know how I knew.

767
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,218
One day I realized you
didn't seem like them...

768
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:50,161
I asked my parents and they told me,
but they made me promise never to tell
you.

769
01:19:50,435 --> 01:19:53,131
They didn't tell you how they adopted
me?

770
01:19:53,338 --> 01:19:57,138
No, I didn't ask. It never crossed my
mind.

771
01:20:02,415 --> 01:20:05,145
That's weird... sometimes I also felt
that...

772
01:20:07,186 --> 01:20:09,747
I didn't belong to them.

773
01:20:14,796 --> 01:20:16,958
Bye, Susana.

774
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:20,293
Bye.

775
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:35,248
Did you see the skirt she was wearing?

776
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,669
I found the names of the witnesses.

777
01:20:52,072 --> 01:20:55,530
One... left the country.
The other is a woman.

778
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,704
You don't know what I
went through to find her.

779
01:20:58,846 --> 01:21:01,406
Anyway, she's afraid... Jerk!

780
01:21:02,016 --> 01:21:03,849
So...

781
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:08,682
Well, she said that she knows you...
that she remembers you.

782
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:10,659
How would she know me? From where?

783
01:21:10,793 --> 01:21:12,784
I don't know. She wouldn't say.

784
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:16,496
- She wants to see you.
- I want to see her too.

785
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:20,095
Yeah? Well, what do you think
about meeting after Gym?

786
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,470
I get out Thursdays at 5 PM.

787
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:27,202
- Ok, in the basement.
- What basement?

788
01:21:28,414 --> 01:21:30,747
That's where I meet with other kids.

789
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,783
- You can't tell anybody.
- No, that's fine.

790
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:35,115
It's 20 minutes away from
the gym on the subway.

791
01:21:36,156 --> 01:21:37,714
- Is that ok?
- Yes.

792
01:21:38,558 --> 01:21:40,492
I'll call you tonight.

793
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:42,425
Ok.

794
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,065
Bye.

795
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:26,804
You're here...

796
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:30,675
- Are sure you weren't followed?
- No, I checked. I wasn't.

797
01:22:35,357 --> 01:22:38,884
Of course, you wouldn't remember me.

798
01:22:39,962 --> 01:22:42,761
Do you know when I met you?

799
01:22:44,269 --> 01:22:46,702
Sixteen years ago.

800
01:22:48,038 --> 01:22:52,372
I warned Angelica that as much as I want
to meet with you, it's going to be...

801
01:22:53,545 --> 01:23:01,180
as hard for me to tell you this
as it will be for you to hear it.

802
01:23:02,021 --> 01:23:03,989
Where do you know me from?

803
01:23:04,123 --> 01:23:06,614
What I'm going to tell you
stays between us.

804
01:23:09,798 --> 01:23:12,461
I don't trust anyone anymore...

805
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:15,660
but you khave to know this.

806
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,105
My name is...

807
01:23:21,244 --> 01:23:23,109
Martha.

808
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:25,078
I'm a nurse.

809
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:31,453
I used to work at a hospital
in Olmos... the penitentiary.

810
01:23:31,955 --> 01:23:34,619
I remember this vividly
because it happened...

811
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:41,226
...at the same time Argentina
won the World Cup... in 1978.

812
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:46,266
I was working in the delivery room.

813
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:52,278
It was late at night. Outside,
everyone was celebrating.

814
01:23:56,482 --> 01:23:59,715
It was common then that some patients...

815
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:05,351
were brought in with no clinical history.

816
01:24:05,494 --> 01:24:09,361
No paperwork. They were called N.N.

817
01:24:10,299 --> 01:24:15,068
That's how your mother
was brought in on a gurney.

818
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:04,357
At that moment...

819
01:25:05,697 --> 01:25:07,688
...I didn't know who she was.

820
01:26:03,563 --> 01:26:06,362
We were not allowed to talk to them.

821
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:24,046
Is it a boy or a girl?

822
01:26:45,812 --> 01:26:52,012
I never learned who the woman who
appeared
in the delivery room of the N.N. Was.

823
01:26:57,793 --> 01:27:00,227
It's a girl.

824
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:06,324
She was so desperate.
That's why I told her it was a girl.

825
01:27:08,672 --> 01:27:10,401
Nobody suspected anything.

826
01:27:14,978 --> 01:27:17,846
We all knew that that room...

827
01:27:18,015 --> 01:27:20,952
...was for the...

828
01:27:21,053 --> 01:27:22,816
...detainees...

829
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:26,048
...or the ones in bad shape.

830
01:27:34,068 --> 01:27:37,265
...live from the 1978 World Cup Final,
where Argentina is the new champion...

831
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:43,539
Arriving at the podium, Their
Excellencies,
the commanders of the Armed Forces...

832
01:27:44,413 --> 01:27:48,908
I will never forget
what she whispered to me.

833
01:27:51,221 --> 01:27:54,850
Her name is Sofía... Sofía Lombardi.

834
01:27:55,557 --> 01:27:57,493
Bring her to me.

835
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:11,300
My shift ended.

836
01:28:12,346 --> 01:28:15,076
The next day, when I went back...

837
01:28:16,115 --> 01:28:20,075
they ordered me
to do something I wasn't expecting.

838
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:12,178
An order from the top for your mother
to nurse you because we...

839
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:16,078
had to keep you healthy.

840
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:26,592
The next day when I
returned to the hospital.

841
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:32,526
I knew it was crazy,
that I was risking my life.

842
01:30:01,838 --> 01:30:06,707
"Agustín Lombardi, Sofía was born."

843
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:11,172
"I love you... Leticia."

844
01:30:13,517 --> 01:30:16,384
That's how I knew who your parents
were.

845
01:30:17,322 --> 01:30:19,381
Your mother was taken away...

846
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:22,188
I never saw her again...

847
01:30:23,195 --> 01:30:28,895
...and then, on my next shift
two days later, you were gone.

848
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:36,605
And my father?

849
01:30:37,345 --> 01:30:42,045
I found out he was in a different place
where they both had been held.

850
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:44,850
- In a clandestine prison?
- Yes.

851
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:48,687
In The Cave?

852
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,154
Yes.

853
01:30:53,164 --> 01:30:57,396
- Did he ever find out I had been born?
- There was no way to reach him.

854
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:01,661
But, I think it's possible that he found
out...

855
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:04,708
that someone told him...

856
01:31:04,843 --> 01:31:07,835
...although it seems impossible,
some messages got through.

857
01:31:10,717 --> 01:31:12,309
- Who took me away?
- I don't know.

858
01:31:14,454 --> 01:31:16,617
I never saw you again.

859
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:24,528
Do you know them?

860
01:31:25,767 --> 01:31:27,668
They're my adoptive parents.

861
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:30,429
I don't remember them.

862
01:31:33,777 --> 01:31:37,008
- This one, I think I remember him.
- Which one?

863
01:31:37,148 --> 01:31:40,639
- This one.
- Jorge Macias, my godfather.

864
01:31:40,784 --> 01:31:43,549
A very close friend of my father's,
all his life. Co-workers...

865
01:31:44,756 --> 01:31:47,157
They were colleagues
in the police department.

866
01:31:47,893 --> 01:31:50,657
I don't remember his name, really.

867
01:31:51,063 --> 01:31:55,467
There were those who were good,
and those who were bad.

868
01:31:57,103 --> 01:31:59,504
He was one of the main thugs.

869
01:32:00,374 --> 01:32:02,432
Everybody was afraid of him.

870
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:03,967
Yes.

871
01:32:04,845 --> 01:32:10,716
He used to come in late
to check on the detainees.

872
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:14,518
Jorge must have returned to the hospital.

873
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:19,553
He must have taken me
to the police station.

874
01:32:20,697 --> 01:32:22,630
And he must have called them from
there.

875
01:32:22,732 --> 01:32:24,861
Glow-Worm...

876
01:32:25,903 --> 01:32:27,598
...they called him.

877
01:32:28,106 --> 01:32:30,370
Glow-Worm?

878
01:34:13,327 --> 01:34:15,226
Cristina!

879
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,398
You're wet!

880
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:26,070
Where are my parents?

881
01:34:29,712 --> 01:34:32,944
Where are my parents? Now I know they
existed.

882
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:36,010
You don't know how I was born?

883
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,744
Or where?

884
01:34:41,459 --> 01:34:46,487
The 25th of June, 1978, the day
Argentina
won the Cup. That's my birthday.

885
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:50,401
A woman saw my birth.

886
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,501
She says the person who
gave birth was blindfolded.

887
01:34:58,713 --> 01:35:01,274
They didn't abandon me like you said...

888
01:35:04,118 --> 01:35:06,087
Who told you that?

889
01:35:06,221 --> 01:35:10,180
This was a year before
you said I was found.

890
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:15,388
- This means I'm sixteen years old.
- But who told you that?

891
01:35:16,265 --> 01:35:17,630
I can't tell you that.

892
01:35:17,767 --> 01:35:22,001
Why not? Whoever told you
that garbage is lying.

893
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:25,802
She won't talk to anyone. She's afraid
something could happen to her.

894
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:30,141
How could she be afraid?
You believe her?

895
01:35:30,281 --> 01:35:32,146
They're all actors...

896
01:35:32,283 --> 01:35:33,979
It's all part of the circus
that shitty judge is inventing...

897
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:36,053
to take you away from our home.

898
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:39,288
And the blood test?

899
01:35:41,662 --> 01:35:43,630
And the match?

900
01:35:45,265 --> 01:35:46,961
This woman saw me being born.
She knows the name...

901
01:35:47,169 --> 01:35:49,466
they were going to give me.

902
01:35:49,871 --> 01:35:52,705
It could have been another baby...
you don't know for sure.

903
01:35:52,775 --> 01:35:55,243
Who'd you say saw your birth?

904
01:35:57,212 --> 01:35:59,841
Glow-Worm was the one
who brought me here, right?

905
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:04,781
What Glow-Worm?

906
01:36:04,922 --> 01:36:07,254
What, you don't know?

907
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:10,723
Who's Glow-Worm?

908
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,610
My godfather...

909
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:30,411
He's Glow-Worm.

910
01:36:30,652 --> 01:36:32,676
He knew who my parents were.

911
01:36:33,722 --> 01:36:35,746
Didn't you?

912
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:39,627
Who do you think you are
to investigate us?

913
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:42,723
How would we know if
they were involved?

914
01:36:42,866 --> 01:36:45,163
That was a war. In war,
you either win or lose, damn it!

915
01:36:45,367 --> 01:36:48,860
What war are you talking about?
My mother was pregnant...

916
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:50,837
...she and my father were kidnapped...

917
01:36:51,008 --> 01:36:55,241
the military waited for me to be born,
and then they disappeared them.

918
01:36:55,781 --> 01:36:58,841
If you think they were all
little angels, you're very mistaken.

919
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:02,978
How did I end up here?
By chance? Abandoned in a train?

920
01:37:03,088 --> 01:37:05,353
We didn't know who they were.

921
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,695
Did you disappear them?

922
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:12,562
Did you shock them with cattle prods?

923
01:37:12,967 --> 01:37:16,233
Who the hell do you think
you are, stupid little girl?

924
01:37:17,839 --> 01:37:20,364
Have you forgotten you're
talking to your father?

925
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:22,771
Have you forgotten that I just barely
escaped being blown up...

926
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,175
when the subversives bombed
the police headquarters? What did you
want?

927
01:37:26,348 --> 01:37:29,841
That I end up dead like the others?
Like my friends? Like my colleagues?

928
01:37:34,959 --> 01:37:36,926
But you know what?

929
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:40,154
I don't have the slightest idea
who your birth parents were...

930
01:37:40,331 --> 01:37:42,993
or if they were involved,
nor do I want to know.

931
01:37:44,437 --> 01:37:46,802
But aren't you happy now...

932
01:37:46,972 --> 01:37:49,406
that we found a place
for you in this home?

933
01:37:49,608 --> 01:37:52,908
Or would you rather have ended up
in an orphanage or in the streets?

934
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:57,182
What do you think they'd have done
with all those babies?

935
01:38:00,254 --> 01:38:02,484
So you didn't know them?

936
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:05,493
You didn't do anything to them?

937
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:12,097
I didn't know them.
I didn't do anything to them.

938
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:23,046
Cristina, we never knew.

939
01:38:23,949 --> 01:38:25,576
We thought that...

940
01:38:26,117 --> 01:38:27,982
...it was possible they were...

941
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,880
...among those people.

942
01:38:31,257 --> 01:38:33,247
You didn't want to know.

943
01:38:36,295 --> 01:38:38,890
Why would I want to know?

944
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:49,205
Ana may be able to go up and down
those stairs, but I'm too old...

945
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:51,911
and tired to do that anymore.

946
01:39:57,055 --> 01:39:59,081
Do you want to stay here?

947
01:40:00,993 --> 01:40:02,018
I don't know.

948
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,664
It's obvious that even if
I want to, I can't be your mother.

949
01:40:09,035 --> 01:40:13,097
Here you'll have a family,
you'll have cousins...

950
01:40:14,276 --> 01:40:16,938
you'll grow up with them.

951
01:40:19,948 --> 01:40:22,212
I'm sure that...

952
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:26,049
...that you're parents are happy.

953
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:50,811
Nana, about their disappearance...

954
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:56,449
...is it forever?

955
01:43:10,077 --> 01:43:13,479
Although the precise number
may never be known, it is believed that
around 30,000 people disappeared

956
01:43:13,615 --> 01:43:15,310
during Argentina's last
military dictatorship.

957
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:24,219
Until July 2003, those responsible,
except for a few cases of house arrest,
were free, protected by laws...

958
01:43:24,294 --> 01:43:29,198
created for their benefit
by subsequent democratic governments.

959
01:43:32,336 --> 01:43:35,306
74 children of the disappeared
have been found.

960
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,399
The whereabouts of
many more is still unknown.

961
01:43:39,544 --> 01:43:45,177
The task of finding them continues...

962
01:43:59,735 --> 01:44:03,262
in memory of our dear Susana Campos.

963
01:44:04,007 --> 01:44:07,710
For the thousands of missing people
who have accompanied us...

964
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:11,671
and who's stories
have inspired this movie.

965
01:44:13,184 --> 01:44:16,483
For Tammis, with "captive" from the
start...

966
01:44:17,421 --> 01:44:23,121
and for Amancai and Matias,
my children, with hope in the future.
