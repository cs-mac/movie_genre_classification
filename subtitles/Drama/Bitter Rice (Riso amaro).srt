1
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,396
Rice has been grown in
northern Italy for centuries

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,635
like in China and India.

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,195
It grows in a vast plain
spanning the provinces

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,390
of Pavia, Novara and Vercelli.

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,477
An indelible mark has been
left in this land

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,398
by millions of women

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,036
whose hands have tended it
for 500 years.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,709
Hard work
that never changes...

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,832
knee-deep in water, bent
double under the hot sun.

10
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,633
But only women can do it...

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,672
It needs quick, light hands.
The same hands...

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,951
that patiently thread
needles and nurse babies.

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,429
This is Radio Turin

14
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,393
bringing you a very special
show today. We're standing

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,519
near the trains that take the
workers to the rice plantation.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,030
They leave for the plain
every year, in early May.

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,473
They come from all over
northern Italy.

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,513
It's a regular mobilization of
women of all ages and trades.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,710
Farm hands, factory workers,
dressmakers, typists...

20
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,072
The planting and weeding
season lasts 40 gruelling days.

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,553
Let's hear one of the workers.
What's your name?

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,558
Severina Cerri
from Monselice.

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,679
Severina is now going to tell
us about the impressions

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,029
the needs and the ideals
of these workers.

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,954
Hope we don't miss him
in the crowd.

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,596
Boy, get a load of that!

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,074
Who's watching the entrance?

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,315
Donadio and Bonfiglio.

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,397
- That's 14, Father.
- Yes, correct.

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,115
- Come on, girls!
- I'm relying on you, Amelia.

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,470
Take care and stay together.
Be careful, with this crowd.

32
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,557
Don't worry, Father.

33
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,511
Police, let's see your I.D.

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,109
Platform 6!

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,789
Attention please!
Now leaving from platform 6

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,709
the first train to Vercelli
reserved for the rice-workers.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,069
Candy and cookies,
not bad for the rice-workers!

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,999
There wasn't enough
se we passed the hat around

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,918
but we only have food
for them this year.

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,919
Who are you seeing off?
Are you taking a gift too?

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,999
I'm taking good luck wishes,
kisses... and cash.

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,836
I've got a gun.
Put your hands up!

43
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,994
You're coming with me.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,434
Stop thief!

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,597
After him!

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,391
- What happened?
- A thief!

47
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,398
- Did they arrest him?
- No, he got away!

48
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,476
He was wearing
a light trench coat!

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,273
They'll soon get him then!

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,955
Walter! Where have you been?
I was just calling the hotel.

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,473
- Hold me!
- What's going on?

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,598
- What's wrong?
- Come on, it's not for long.

53
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,315
I'm not going to America!
Hold me, I said.

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,913
And don't look, you fool! They're
on to me, don't you understand?

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,673
The second rice-workers' train

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,948
is leaving from platform 4.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,993
That's another one gone.
I got the tickets while I waited.

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,396
- What do we do?
- The train's no good.

59
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,671
They'll corner us. Come on!

60
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,272
There's two of them coming.
What do we do?

61
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,596
If anything happens,
go with the rice-workers.

62
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,077
Keep the thing on you,
it's worth millions.

63
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,839
Stop or I'll shoot!

64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,519
- Out of the way, stupid woman!
- Go with the rice-workers!

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,876
What's going on, Father?

66
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,674
It's none of your concern!
Take care!

67
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,713
Big jewellery robbery
at the Grand Hotel!

68
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,753
Read all about it!
Jewellery worth 5 million!

69
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,675
- Wait a minute.
- What do you want?

70
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,714
I know about your friend.

71
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,114
- What friend?
- The guy that got away.

72
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,517
You can come clean with me,
I'm not the law.

73
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,032
- I saw what happened.
- So? I saw you too.

74
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,114
Yeah, but he put his arms
around you.

75
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,391
Put his arms around me?
He nearly got me killed.

76
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,799
He used me like
he danced with you.

77
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,598
I guess women are convenient
to him now and then.

78
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,597
Well, what do you know?
A guy like that...

79
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,429
Good dancer too.

80
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,832
You were better.

81
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,393
We dance every night
back home.

82
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,711
When anything new comes in,
I just have to see it once...

83
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,231
Hands off my phonograph!
Lisa, don't let them touch it.

84
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,874
Okay, Silvana.

85
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,553
So you decided to come
with us after that?

86
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,078
- After what?
- After he beat it.

87
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,112
You got that story
out of your magazine?

88
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,637
I need a job... I've been
out of work for six months.

89
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,189
You wouldn't believe
the things that happen.

90
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,471
It's all true what they
say in these magazines.

91
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,797
- You got a contract?
- No.

92
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,509
Don't worry, they take
everybody. We came through

93
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,189
the employment office, but
the bosses always hire more

94
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,836
even on the train.
Illegals, they call them.

95
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,437
Come on, I know a steward
who can fix you up.

96
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,548
Hi, how's business?

97
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,914
Find a seat, I'll take care of it.

98
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,153
There was a horse in here
before us. It left a memento.

99
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,989
Does your cousin know
we take a cut on her pay?

100
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,548
Everybody knows
you play dirty.

101
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,637
Listen, kid,
we do this for them.

102
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,558
They'd be at home and
out of work without us.

103
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,388
No, we got 40 down already
and that's more than we need.

104
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,668
But as a favour to you...

105
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,473
Hands off!

106
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,592
Okay, we'll put her down.

107
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,996
Hey, what... We put her down.

108
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,070
See how I fixed it?
You don't have to worry now.

109
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,836
Thanks, but don't stay.
What about your luggage?

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,709
The girls are minding it.
I like to move around.

111
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,229
Here...

112
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,551
Irene! How are you?

113
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,717
- Look at all the soldiers!
- They're at camp here.

114
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,399
The boss gave them the
farmstead for a few months

115
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,159
but they have to move out
now we're here.

116
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,159
- How do you know all that?
- A guy from back home is here.

117
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,393
- I'm seeing him tonight.
- You sure move fast!

118
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,716
I do what I can...
40 days is a long time!

119
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,276
We're in barracks too. You'll
see how the dorms smell!

120
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,392
Lucky I always liked soldiers!
How about you?

121
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,228
I've seen more soldiers
than a retired general.

122
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,589
I can tell the regiment
just by the smell.

123
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,200
- What's your name?
- Emilia Zarfaneti

124
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
but they call me Argentina.

125
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,119
I don't see your boyfriend.

126
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,390
I guess he couldn't make it.

127
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,398
He works at the farm
where I was last year.

128
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,069
We're going to be married
and I'll see him every day!

129
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,553
I'm scared I won't make it.

130
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,513
I'll work for both of us.
We need that rice back home.

131
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,672
We've got to make it!

132
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,271
Let's pick a bunk or
there won't be any left.

133
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,189
- This straw's damp!
- Never mind that.

134
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,913
- What are they doing?
- Stuffing their mattresses.

135
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,554
You can do yours later
no hurry.

136
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,672
I have my wool mattress,
I like to be comfortable.

137
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,390
Hi, baby! What are you
around the chest?

138
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,075
"I'm leaving a slow death
in the barracks"

139
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,396
"not in time of war...
in time of life"

140
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,110
It's better here,
a bit like a sleeping car.

141
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,913
- Top bunk or bottom bunk?
- Top.

142
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,952
I don't advise that.

143
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,552
My, what a hard head!

144
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,988
You want to move in here?

145
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,509
Yes, if you don't mind.
You take that one, Francesca.

146
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,514
The slats are missing here.

147
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,317
It's scented! What's in here?
Sugared almonds?

148
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,269
It's mine.

149
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,397
You take them with you to
remind you of your boyfriend?

150
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,236
Keep them, sugared almonds
don't go whith the army life.

151
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,552
A soldier's crazy to think
about getting married.

152
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,878
The pay won't feed two.
Come on, give me a hand.

153
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,991
It'll be all yours in a minute

154
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,032
including a couple
of hundred bedbugs.

155
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,556
- What?
- Bedbugs!

156
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,831
Bedbugs? Thanks a million.

157
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,474
Scared?

158
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,318
I like my sleep, don't you?

159
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,476
You get used to it.

160
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,038
I sure have, after 10 years
of barracks and the front!

161
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,073
You can forget sleep! But
it's the thinking that gets me.

162
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,278
I'm waiting for my discharge.
That keeps me awake nights.

163
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,594
- Are you from these parts?
- No.

164
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,237
- From Lombardy, and you?
- Ferrara.

165
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,275
- What's your name?
- Silvana.

166
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,438
- Why, you'll write me?
- "Lots of kisses from Marco"!

167
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,677
See you.

168
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,638
Don't read the trash
on the wall.

169
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,148
I already did.

170
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,874
"Love" can stay though.

171
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,429
Funny way to make up to me!

172
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,994
How do you know he was?

173
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,750
- Men always do.
- Hurry up with those pallets!

174
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,314
Do yours now.

175
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,952
Those without a regular
contract, come see me later!

176
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,468
- What's happening?
- Don't they want them?

177
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,795
It wouldn't be the first time.

178
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,673
It's their fault
for going under the counter.

179
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,191
That was Silvana's cot but
she changed over with me.

180
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
She likes to be
nearer the door.

181
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,830
What are you looking for?

182
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,393
It was here, I know it was.

183
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,159
What? Let me help you find it.

184
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,988
Do you mind me taking this cot?
It's to have the baby near me.

185
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,518
I'm Andreina. There was no one
I could leave him with, so...

186
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,791
What's going on?

187
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,753
Seems they want to send home
those without a union contract.

188
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,550
I always say it's not worth
coming if you're not regular.

189
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,316
No...

190
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,070
- they can't send us away now!
- It's not fair!

191
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,913
We're here to work, not steal!

192
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,750
Listen to me, will you?
If it was me, I'd hire you all,

193
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,433
but the boss gave orders.
You can't really blame him.

194
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,519
The union might send
an inspector.

195
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,552
We want to stay! We won't
let you send us away!

196
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,390
I'm only passing on orders:
No contract, no job.

197
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,311
We'll give you the money for
the trip home and a day's pay.

198
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,511
- A day's pay for each of you!
- We don't want your charity!

199
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,633
We want to stay here and work!

200
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,672
That's enough! Pack up!

201
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,319
Don't let me find you here
tomorrow!

202
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,393
What are you doing here?

203
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,558
Get into your heads...
you can't work here!

204
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,479
Where are you going? It's no
good trying the other fields.

205
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,558
It's too late to find work now.

206
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,552
Hold it! If we can mix in
with the regulars

207
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,875
we're home!

208
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,435
Let's see if you can get us in.

209
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,472
- You make it sound easy!
- Quiet you!

210
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,116
Do you think I want
to lose our cut?

211
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,551
Come on then!
What are we waiting for?

212
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,435
Yeah, let's go!

213
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,919
What are you staring at?

214
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,713
Look, the illegals came anyway.

215
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,957
They like working for free!

216
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,717
It's up to you now. You'll
have to brake your backs

217
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,196
and work twice as hard.
When they see what you can do

218
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,789
they won't think
of sending you away.

219
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,430
Off you go now!

220
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,951
Are you crazy? They have
to go, the boss said so!

221
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,117
Don't worry. Just wait,
you'll thank me later.

222
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,470
Our girls work a lot
harder and faster.

223
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,475
That's a good thing for you...
your girls will have to keep up.

224
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,557
You'll look good,
you'll save time and money.

225
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,873
Come on, back there!

226
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,754
Don't waste time!

227
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,472
Need a hand?
You'll work faster then.

228
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,032
Look where the illegals
are already!

229
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,393
I can't keep this pace up
much longer.

230
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,194
You've got to hold out or
you can forget the contract!

231
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,114
Look how far back they are,
they can't catch up with us now.

232
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,632
Hey, Silvana!
Going for a ride?

233
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,918
They don't let us talk. If you
have anything to say, sing it.

234
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,517
The illegals start off in a hurry

235
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,718
which is just what traitors do.

236
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,269
Better hurry when it's cool,
later on the sun beats down.

237
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,637
Poor illegal who is working
harder and harder.

238
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,798
In the cool or in the sun,
this is no way to work.

239
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,517
Wake up! Faster!
See where the others are?

240
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,876
Steward, you shout too much,
we know our job.

241
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,959
You look out for the blacklegs!

242
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,109
- Take no notice! Faster!
- Quiet!

243
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,116
Work faster!

244
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,598
Andreina is too old, she
can't take the rice-swamp!

245
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,397
- Get back to work!
- Blacklegs!

246
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,432
Traitors!

247
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,873
What are you after?

248
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,110
Cut it out! Stop that!

249
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,196
It's all her fault!
She's the blackleg!

250
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,030
She's the ringleader! She told
them to work faster than us!

251
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,399
What do you mean?

252
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,393
Nothing to say for yourself?
Got a guilty conscience?

253
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,637
Why did you set them all
against her?

254
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,712
Are you crazy? Do you
want to kill each other?

255
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,830
Get lost! She's a blackleg!

256
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,871
You can't lynch her!

257
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,388
It's her fault we nearly
had to work twice as hard.

258
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,556
Don't believe that idiot!

259
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,398
She was right! She started it!

260
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,120
Yelling won't help you
clear things up.

261
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,554
Nobody does something
for no reason.

262
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,794
Maybe she needs to work
more than you do.

263
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,832
Yes, they want
to send them away.

264
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,509
So they stood up
for themselves.

265
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,393
But they didn't think about
how that would hurt us.

266
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,238
Well, did you try to help us?

267
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,748
You know how we're fixed!

268
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,473
There, see, it's no good
fighting among yourselves.

269
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,432
Why not try to come
to an agreement?

270
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,635
Get it? It's up to us
to come to an agreement!

271
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,792
It's not fair
to treat them like that!

272
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,396
Let's go see the boss, all of us.
Everybody works or nobody does!

273
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,431
Go on then!

274
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,471
I'm with you! Let's go!

275
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,034
If you help us,
we won't let you down!

276
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,679
Go ahead, you guys,
I'll be right with you.

277
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,713
Where you mixed up
in that too?

278
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,518
Why did you blame me?
What have I done to you?

279
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,792
- Go away!
- What have I done to you?

280
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,308
Get out of here!

281
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,269
You've got to tell me.
Why do you want me to go?

282
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,518
You're a thief! A thief!

283
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,110
I didn't steal anything
from you.

284
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,876
- You're the thief!
- What's this then?

285
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,718
You stole it with
your boyfriend. Thief!

286
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,998
I saw you hide it. I knew what
you were right from the start!

287
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,873
We don't want thieves
here with us!

288
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,474
What's going on?

289
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,516
Turn her in! She stole this!

290
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,269
Why get so uptight?

291
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,194
Well? Are you going to turn
me in to the police?

292
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,153
I don't do things like that,
it's not for me to judge.

293
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,669
And you stay out of it.

294
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,793
Give her necklace back.

295
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,790
How much could it be worth?

296
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,389
I don't know. I never saw
stuff like that close to.

297
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,798
- It's not for us.
- What do you want me to do?

298
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,193
- I'm in your hands.
- I'm not a snitch.

299
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,674
It's up to you to decide.

300
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,790
Shouldn't she go to jail?

301
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,593
Jail was invented by someone
who never went there.

302
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,510
That's not the only answer

303
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,589
and jail doesn't save you.

304
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,231
You see, if Francesca
had a different face

305
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,674
maybe I'd turn her in
to the police.

306
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,197
Didn't you know
it's all in the face?

307
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,434
I've seen thousands of faces
in my life, in the army...

308
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,109
Here too... There's all kinds.

309
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,835
Each one has its own fate
and they can't help it.

310
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,197
Sergeant! You're wanted
at the camp!

311
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,152
After that I was a maid
for some very rich people.

312
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,993
The mistress was young,
beautiful...

313
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,077
- Was she very elegant?
- She had everything she wanted.

314
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,237
I used to dress her, undress
her, put her shoes on...

315
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,109
Why, couldn't she
bend down?

316
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,594
Why are they shouting
like that in the yard?

317
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,995
They're seeing the boss
about the illegals.

318
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,395
Let's hope for the best.

319
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,271
Go on.

320
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,550
Why do you want
to know about me?

321
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,239
What did you do
after that house?

322
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,992
They fired me because
I was expecting a baby.

323
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,155
I'd met him...
He was a real gentleman.

324
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,029
I fell for him like an idiot.
He gave me so many presents.

325
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,628
I knew he wasn't just anybody.

326
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,039
He said in a nice outfit
I was a real lady.

327
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,869
When he won at poker, he'd hire
a car and we'd take a vacation.

328
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,469
Did you go where they gambled?

329
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,159
No, it's dangerous.

330
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,434
They arrested him once.

331
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,118
Well, Francesca, how about
giving me my shot?

332
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,475
This is all they had...

333
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,511
I guess they're used
to horses here.

334
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,790
Still, the more the better.

335
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,070
- You made it up, you two?
- Mind your own business!

336
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,834
Keep your hair on!

337
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,992
Like him? He's a sailor.

338
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,270
He's been all over the world
even Shanghai!

339
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,311
- But I get around too.
- You split up?

340
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,160
I ditched him.

341
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,555
He's out of work now

342
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,670
and I got tired
of supporting him.

343
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,753
Where did we get to?
Oh yes, the baby!

344
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,988
He never got to be born.

345
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,750
I wanted him but he didn't.

346
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,391
- You know what men are like.
- Here, have a smoke.

347
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,354
He said kids tied you down,
they're just a headache.

348
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
After that, I did
everything he wanted.

349
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,677
He was wretching my life,
but he was all I had.

350
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,993
How I envy you, Silvana!
I wish I were you.

351
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,398
At least you've lived,
you weren't stuck...

352
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,633
in this squalor. You've
seen some nice things.

353
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,830
- Feel a bit better now?
- It's nothing.

354
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,871
Maybe it's that rice
they give us.

355
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,629
A lot of things
can make you sick...

356
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,154
Like these long faces!

357
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,795
How did you get
the necklace?

358
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,469
He came to see me one day.
I was working in a hotel then.

359
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,832
He said he had to pay off
a debt or go to jail.

360
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,990
He'd got it all planned...
the timing, where the key was.

361
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,393
He begged me on his knees...

362
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,589
- He was almost in tears.
- You hid it under the mattress?

363
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,552
Don't worry, I won't touch it.

364
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,398
I wish I'd never
touched it either.

365
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,869
You heard what
that Sergeant said?

366
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,234
I want to talk to him again...
I've thought a lot about that.

367
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,999
Will your boyfriend come?

368
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,317
- Who knows?
- He'll come

369
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,993
You'd have been in trouble
without the necklace.

370
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,759
Does he beat you?

371
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,398
- Don't you love him anymore?
- I don't know.

372
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,194
The boss said yes!
He'll hire them!

373
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,628
I guess you're not too keen
to let the cops see you.

374
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,593
- You sure trust me!
- Come on, mister!

375
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,791
I've only known you two
hours. Who are you anyway?

376
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,071
I talk and talk, I tell you
all about myself, and you?

377
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,549
You know the Arab proverb?

378
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,512
"Why talk if you can
be silent?"

379
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,989
Did you ask around?

380
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,669
Yeah, they're not there either.
Not your woman, nor mine.

381
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,756
But I'll find her, you bet I will!

382
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,396
And when I do...

383
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,830
We'll try that place later.
Maybe we'll be in luck.

384
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,108
"I've been thinking about you
for 12 months. Augusto."

385
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,549
Anybody here know
an Augusto?

386
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,512
"We danced together
last year. Antonio."

387
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,835
Who knows Antonio?

388
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,430
- Load up!
- Right, Sergeant!

389
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,517
Hold it! This is going to be
the best shot of the season!

390
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,588
Hey, Sarge,
you're spoiling the picture!

391
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,631
- That better?
- It was better before.

392
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,399
Army doesn't go with art!

393
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,035
Ready? Hold it right there...
Watch the birdie... Done!

394
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,311
- Two copies.
- They'll be ready in an hour.

395
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,756
Step right up, girls!
Come to Mascheroni!

396
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,555
I've got everything you need.
Nylons... how about this bra?

397
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,797
Why do you do that?
You spoil it all, I told you.

398
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,354
I have to want it. When
the time comes, I'll tell you.

399
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,995
- I can't work you out.
- You can talk!

400
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,193
You don't look all serious
like the other day

401
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,073
when you said those
things to Francesca.

402
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,793
Keep your hands to yourself.

403
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,310
Okay, but I don't feel like
being serious today.

404
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,118
That was some necklace!
I wonder what it's worth?

405
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,633
Like that, nothing. She can't
wear it or they'll arrest her.

406
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,992
- She got rich though.
- By stealing?

407
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,876
- But you let her off.
- I didn't let anybody off.

408
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,074
I see. You talked like that
just to look good with me.

409
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,078
It's easy... that girl's
future is marked.

410
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,353
I wonder what mine will be?
Read it in my palm.

411
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,390
Who can tell?

412
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,519
All I know is mine
won't be the army.

413
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,996
- I'll go abroad!
- Why do you want to go?

414
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,672
I'd stay in Italy if I had
a home and a job.

415
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,996
I waited 10 years to get out
of this uniform

416
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,792
and now I have to be afraid
of civilian life.

417
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,352
That's why it took me so long
to make up my mind.

418
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,152
I've spent so much time
in the trenches...

419
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,595
...I can hear the bullets
even when I go dancing.

420
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,678
I can do a lot of things,
I can handle all kinds of guns

421
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,030
but I don't have a trade. I can
do everything and nothing.

422
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,991
So if I have to start over,
somewhere far away is best.

423
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,637
- It might be easier.
- Where do you want to go?

424
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,359
South America maybe.

425
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,916
They say there's work there,
it's virgin territory.

426
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,991
Could be, but you never hear
about it. North America now...

427
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,674
- everything's electric there.
- Yeah, even the chair.

428
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,593
Want to come with me? It's hard
to go all that way on your own.

429
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,874
Soon as I get my discharge,
we'll go.

430
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,990
Who says that's my future?

431
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,077
I do. Try it and see.

432
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,518
No, don't start that again.

433
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,312
It's late.

434
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,397
The men are through
loading up.

435
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,877
- See you tonight?
- I don't know.

436
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,275
- Sergeant!
- Oh, it's you.

437
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,594
We didn't finish our talk...

438
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,996
It's a long story.
I'd like to explain.

439
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,031
Explain what?

440
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,352
- I feel I can trust you.
- Me? Why is that?

441
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,555
I don't know what it is,
but every time I meet you...

442
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,310
- it's like I was seeing a friend.
- I'm glad about that.

443
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,556
Don't worry, Francesca
I have to go now. Good luck.

444
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,995
I found a nice spot under the
trees, with grass this high.

445
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,191
Dad wants to sell the cow to
give me a dowry. What's best,

446
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,993
- the cow or the money?
- The cow!

447
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,392
I don't know why she's got
it on, but nobody else knows.

448
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,756
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

449
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,911
Stay where you are!

450
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,113
Sorry, I had to square
something with the girl.

451
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,872
Good for you, Sarge!
That showd him!

452
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,275
Are you crazy?

453
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,754
You've come out into
the open enough already!

454
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,791
Who is that?

455
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,559
Her boyfriend, I guess.

456
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,153
- Look, I've got the necklace.
- It's fake, you idiot!

457
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,196
Don't you read the papers!

458
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,673
Nice work you did!

459
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,792
- A fake?
- Yes, a fake! Stupid fool!

460
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,351
Okay, that's fine. Now Nanni
goes out first, then you.

461
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,080
We'll meet up
at the usual place.

462
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,112
We got about 15 kg, huh?

463
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,630
Yeah, maybe more.

464
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,874
Hand it over!

465
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,396
Take it easy!

466
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,552
You're not men, you're ants.

467
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,469
You're carrying away
one grain of rice at a time.

468
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,671
Who are you anyway?

469
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,040
A guy who's watched you
for threee days.

470
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,033
What are you doing here?

471
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,874
I live upstairs.

472
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,675
With the housing shortage,
they got no rooms for rent in jail.

473
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,789
There sure is some rice
in here...

474
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,995
How much would you say
counting the other barns?

475
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,792
- How much is there?
- I guess...

476
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,832
20 or 30 tons.

477
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,992
Go on like this and you'll
be through in 100 years!

478
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,272
You'd take it all in one go?

479
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,711
Why? You reckon
that's a bad idea?

480
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,473
We'd need all the trucks
on the farm.

481
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,909
You said it!

482
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,677
And what's it worth,
the rice in here?

483
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,199
Wholesale, around 7 million.

484
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,754
We just have to find
a buyer then.

485
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,792
No, we just have to get it out!

486
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,636
Right.
We could do the job together.

487
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,509
You can find me here.
Forget those bags now.

488
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,074
You could blow the whole
thing and wind up in jail.

489
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,915
Soggy rice again! Don't they
give you anything else here?

490
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,950
What were you talking about?

491
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,390
Business.

492
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,599
Let's get out of here,
what are we waiting for?

493
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,632
Where do we go without a cent?
Into the arms of the law?

494
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,394
We're both okay here. You
work and make a bit of money.

495
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,235
As for me, who's going
to look for me here?

496
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,232
Besides... maybe I've found
a way to make a pile of dough.

497
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,756
But that girl know everything!
She's hotheaded.

498
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,475
You can never tell
what she's thinking.

499
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,035
She's involved too now.
You didn't tell her it's a fake?

500
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,391
Don't worry then.

501
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,433
She'll feel guilty and
keep quiet about it.

502
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,789
I've got a good nose,
you know that.

503
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,071
She could be dangerous,
she's just a child.

504
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,993
I know a lot who'd like to play
with a child like that!

505
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,520
And what about her legs?

506
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,911
Yeah, okay, you've got
nice legs too.

507
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,595
Cut it out! I don't like
the things you get up to.

508
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,714
We're getting innocent
people involved.

509
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,836
They won't be innocent
much longer. I give the orders.

510
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,957
That's all you ever say...
Nobody else exists except you.

511
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,078
At the station you needed help,

512
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,635
and I was standing there
already... at your orders

513
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,634
ready to die even.

514
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,796
Give me a kiss...
Don't you like me anymore?

515
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,832
Stop it! I'm going...

516
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,188
The girls are all
in the dorm already.

517
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,073
Scared to get wet or something?
Aren't you going to jump in?

518
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,317
- What, in that dirty water?

519
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,033
Aren't you getting undressed?

520
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,517
- No, I'm going back to the farm.
- He's waiting for you?

521
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,078
- Who?
- Walter, your boyfriend.

522
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,553
He's not here any more.
I told you he'd gone.

523
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,832
- Don't you believe me?
- Lf you say so.

524
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,634
- Will he be back?
- Who knows?

525
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,916
He's unpredictable.

526
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,599
If he does come back,
that shows he's in love.

527
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,553
Yeah, right.
If he comes back...

528
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,634
I guess he likes someone.

529
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,077
Here come the rain!

530
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,396
Standing guard now
while I undress?

531
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,670
You talk like
it's all my fault!

532
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,075
Hands off! Turn around.

533
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,155
Who was that guy?

534
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,270
Search me!

535
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,788
But he sure can do
the boogie-woogie.

536
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,913
Boogie-woogie, corny
magazines! Is that all you see?

537
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,228
What else, when I'm knee-deep
in water from morning to night?

538
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,638
- What do you know about it?
- There's nothing to know.

539
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,832
Wearing that necklace
after what I told you!

540
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,077
What a fuss you're making
about a whim!

541
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,750
There wasn't any danger,
nobody noticed.

542
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,719
I guess they thought
it was junk.

543
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,072
Don't you understand? You
shouldn't have touched it.

544
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,956
It's stolen property!

545
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,275
Why didn't you report
Francesca then?

546
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,198
All you can do is preach.
Turn her in!

547
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,791
You know you're an accomplice
now in the eye of the law?

548
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,199
Who, me? What did I do?

549
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,515
Enough to wind you up in jail!

550
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,229
Why didn't you listen to me?

551
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,392
Your future is like
I said... with me.

552
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,749
I haven't changed my mind.

553
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,792
Go away! I don't want
to see you again!

554
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,112
Are you nuts or something?

555
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,878
What are you after?
I never came looking for you.

556
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,270
You're right...

557
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,159
How miserable
we'd be together!

558
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,394
I'm starting to think that too.

559
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,515
That's just how it would be.

560
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,758
It's lucky we realized in time.

561
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,073
I realized a while ago,
you know.

562
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,589
I'm not the right girl for you.

563
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,158
You'd better not come
to the farm any more.

564
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,518
Sure... I won't feel like
coming now anyway.

565
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,079
- It's better this way.
- Come on, it's cold!

566
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,760
They've nearly
finished it for me.

567
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,792
How do I look?

568
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,276
Make a nice mosquito net
if he ditches you.

569
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,309
Miss Rice and her Orchestra!
Come on!

570
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,477
Don't be so silly!

571
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,316
My, aren't we edgy!
You really like this wake?

572
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,791
You'll see when they say,
"Here's your pay and rice"

573
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,469
"but the rice is 5 kg less
because it rained"

574
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,637
and you sat on your hands
for five days."

575
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,070
Remember in 1942?

576
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,476
A week of rain
and 7 kg less rice.

577
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,909
Dresses! Perfumes!
Cigarettes!

578
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,549
Love letters written!

579
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,230
Come on, girls!
Summer rain is good!

580
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,033
Write a love letter
to your boyfriend back home.

581
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,072
Out of sight, out of mind,
you know.

582
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,874
Careful, you'll lose him!
Go on, send him a love letter.

583
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,798
A Mascheroni letter...
no spelling mistakes.

584
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,435
Well-written, original...
heartfelt... passionate...

585
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,112
Maybe you were hoping
for someone better?

586
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,150
- I thought you'd gone.
- Yeah, but I came back.

587
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,999
- What for?
- To dance with you.

588
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,790
I swore I wouldn't dance
again after what happened.

589
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,509
We could talk a little then.

590
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,154
- Yes, but not here.
- Why not?

591
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,951
It's raining outside

592
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,398
and it's better
if I'm not seen around.

593
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,911
Scared?

594
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,753
Come on!

595
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,394
We never talked much

596
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,989
but it's like I've known
you a long time.

597
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,873
- I feel the same.
- Aren't you sick...

598
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,115
of being with these people
all the time?

599
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,038
Who else is there?
It's only two more weeks.

600
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,430
You need a more refined
kind of occupation.

601
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,151
These are the hands of a lady.
If you take care of them...

602
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,994
You're the one
who's scared now.

603
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,392
Every time we meet,
something bad happens.

604
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,712
- At the station...
- Were you scared then?

605
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,035
No, but I was in trouble
the other night.

606
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,473
That's why it feels like I've
known you for a long time.

607
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,117
Without knowing it, we've done
a lot together already.

608
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,034
We're nearly on intimate terms.
Are you happy you met me?

609
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,397
- Who are you anyway?
- Don't give yourself airs.

610
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,155
It's not every girl gets
to go with a guy like me.

611
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,192
You think you're so special?

612
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,513
Well, I don't know... If you
prefer guys like that sergeant

613
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,391
who just rot in a barracks
all day long...

614
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:43,391
He's really gone on me, that
one. I can't stand leeches.

615
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,955
Good girl! It shows you're
the indipendent kind.

616
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,833
Punks like that don't deserve
a pretty girl like you anyway.

617
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,953
Leave it open, at least
we can breathe a bit.

618
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,315
Look at them!

619
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,829
You know what? That's
made me think straight.

620
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,112
We stand in water all day and
we're scared of a bit of rain?

621
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,632
This makes six days...
and 6 kg of rice we lose!

622
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,436
We'll be late getting back if
we don't make up for lost time

623
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,751
and a lot of us will lose the
harvest contracts back home.

624
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,596
If you agree,
we'll show the rain!

625
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,793
We'll go out and work anyway.

626
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,468
I'm with you.

627
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,398
It's not for us.

628
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,797
- They're all going.
- Come on then!

629
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,156
Let them be. What do we care
if they don't want to come!

630
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,472
Let them go. For us, the
longer we stay, the better.

631
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,310
They won't pay us, but at
least they'll have to feed us.

632
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,073
But they helped us when the
boss wanted to send us away.

633
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,030
- You'd better not come.
- Don't worry, I'm all right.

634
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,752
To work, girls! Every day
is one kilo of rice more!

635
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,270
What's a bit of rain? The damp
in here is killing us anyway!

636
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:05,837
- We'll get soaked!
- Rain makes your hair curl!

637
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,994
- Stay here, listen to me!
- No, I want to come too!

638
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,474
I'm going with them.

639
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,632
Come away from there,
they'll see you.

640
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,830
Can't you see
you're getting drenched?

641
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,272
- Let me go now.
- Don't I get a kiss?

642
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,198
Yes, but don't come
any closer.

643
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,399
Let me go!

644
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,156
- I don't see Silvana.
- We called her no end of times.

645
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,839
I guess she's busy.

646
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,151
You're supposed to pull up
the weeds, not the rice!

647
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,317
Can't you see?

648
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,592
The rice doesn't have
any white on the leaf.

649
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,757
Are you sick?

650
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,273
I said you shouldn't
have come!

651
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,278
Don't worry...

652
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,679
It's dangerous
in her condition.

653
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,030
We'd better do something.

654
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,719
Let's get her to the bank!

655
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,551
Sing!

656
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:31,513
Seems the authorities
are coming to the party too.

657
01:15:31,555 --> 01:15:34,630
Lucky I brought
all the songs.

658
01:15:34,838 --> 01:15:37,151
Come on, down there!

659
01:15:37,202 --> 01:15:40,323
- Why the authorities?
- They'll say how good we were.

660
01:15:40,366 --> 01:15:43,681
- What do they know about it?
- Those people know everything.

661
01:15:43,731 --> 01:15:47,045
The band's good, they do
all the latest songs.

662
01:15:47,095 --> 01:15:49,374
The accordionist is nice.

663
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,731
There's nothing like dancing!

664
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:55,860
- While you're young!
- I'll dance even when I'm old!

665
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:01,953
Tonight I want to dance so
much I'll be laid up for a week!

666
01:16:02,036 --> 01:16:05,717
This is the first time our party
starts with a wedding.

667
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:08,683
Fancy getting married
on the last day!

668
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:13,040
- Come on, get that line up!
- Untangle the lantern first.

669
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:17,328
- Does it work on electricity?
- What do you think, matches?

670
01:16:17,376 --> 01:16:20,339
I know who I'll dance with.

671
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:23,104
I'm taking my girl.

672
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,522
Mon and dad?
That's just great!

673
01:16:37,565 --> 01:16:42,441
The best picture this season!

674
01:16:42,492 --> 01:16:47,253
Hold it right there...
Watch the birdie...

675
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:54,787
Stand in line, I'm going to
hand out the sacks for the rice.

676
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:04,521
- These won't hold 40 kg of rice.
- They did the other years!

677
01:17:04,562 --> 01:17:07,399
When do they give us the rice?

678
01:17:07,446 --> 01:17:09,918
Tomorrow, before we go.

679
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,852
These trucks won't get all
the girls to the station.

680
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:17,656
- We'll do 3 or 4 trips.
- You guys got here early.

681
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:20,377
You wanted all the fun?

682
01:17:20,504 --> 01:17:23,581
What about the trucks
if you go to the party?

683
01:17:23,629 --> 01:17:25,987
Who's going to touch them?

684
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:29,585
Leave it, he'll do it.

685
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,353
Say, what can you do
with this baby...

686
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:37,685
on a full tank?

687
01:17:38,328 --> 01:17:42,087
- 200 km?
- Are you nuts? 500 km...

688
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:45,687
- not counting the reserve.
- Say...

689
01:17:46,059 --> 01:17:48,736
how about a drink tonight,
all of us together?

690
01:17:48,783 --> 01:17:53,260
Sure. We might even get a steak
with all the meat around here.

691
01:17:53,309 --> 01:17:56,863
Yeah, there's plenty
for everyone.

692
01:17:56,914 --> 01:17:59,795
They lay on an end of season
feast for the rice-workers.

693
01:18:01,201 --> 01:18:04,196
I don't need a sack,
I've got my rice already.

694
01:18:11,735 --> 01:18:13,728
What about ours?

695
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:16,534
Take this to Gabriella from me.

696
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:18,974
Something to remember me by.

697
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:22,021
- But what about you?
- I'll get by

698
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:26,229
They'll be very happy back
home... Gabriella too.

699
01:18:30,681 --> 01:18:33,676
- Why did she give hers away?
- I don't know.

700
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:36,283
She's screwy,
but she's not unkind.

701
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:49,460
We're home! The trucks
are going to be a walkover!

702
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:52,025
And we've got a heap
of rice all ready!

703
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:55,465
But how do we get past
the guy at the entrance?

704
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:58,352
Everybody'll be at the party.

705
01:18:58,398 --> 01:19:01,075
If anybody catches on,
we've had it!

706
01:19:03,846 --> 01:19:06,284
It's too bad you're
not mutes like him!

707
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:10,652
He says it's crawling
with cops...

708
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:12,690
the Police Chief came along!

709
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:14,971
What if we get
trapped in here?

710
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:26,547
Get those trucks ready to
leave as soon as it's dark.

711
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:30,519
That's enough talk! I'll take
care of everything now.

712
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:33,601
They'll wave goodbye
to us even.

713
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,850
Where have you been?
I missed you.

714
01:19:40,897 --> 01:19:43,735
Everything's ready,
it's up to you now.

715
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,862
You want to help me, don't you?

716
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:50,630
- I'll do anything you say.
- You don't sound very keen.

717
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:55,546
I know, I don't like it either,
but it means everything to us.

718
01:19:58,121 --> 01:20:00,195
What's beating you?

719
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:04,523
The girls were supposed
to get this rice tomorrow.

720
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,528
It's not a lot either.

721
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:12,049
I don't see why
you have to steal it

722
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:15,901
when you have a necklace
that's worth so much more.

723
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:28,352
The necklace...
you like it, huh?

724
01:20:30,085 --> 01:20:32,648
I'm going to give it you.

725
01:20:34,131 --> 01:20:36,728
It's my engagement present.

726
01:20:38,657 --> 01:20:41,015
It's yours. You can do
what you like with it.

727
01:20:42,823 --> 01:20:46,376
We'll be rich anyway,
won't we?

728
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:52,229
As soon as we sell the rice,
we'll move into a plush hotel.

729
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,757
Tell me the truth... I've been
wanting to ask you this...

730
01:21:00,687 --> 01:21:03,329
Do you ever wear a mask?

731
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:07,330
- What?
- A black mask.

732
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,457
The other one's here...
Francesca!

733
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:27,360
Be right back.

734
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:31,878
Long time no see.

735
01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:35,448
I have something
important to say.

736
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:41,131
We're not with rich people
that you can steal from here.

737
01:21:42,104 --> 01:21:45,145
The girls broke their backs
for weeks on end.

738
01:21:45,428 --> 01:21:49,474
You'll get medals for it
and citations.

739
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:52,307
No, we won't get anything

740
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:55,362
except what we earned:

741
01:21:55,723 --> 01:21:59,037
The rice you want to steal.

742
01:21:59,528 --> 01:22:01,522
I know what you're planning.

743
01:22:02,411 --> 01:22:06,457
Congratulations! You used
to be slower on the uptake.

744
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:11,380
I can't put you back in the team.
Your place has been taken.

745
01:22:11,784 --> 01:22:15,465
I don't care.
I'll never go back to you.

746
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:18,833
Now get out of here!

747
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:21,997
This is the only clean
place. I've ever known.

748
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:24,510
I guess I'll have
to disappoint you.

749
01:22:25,164 --> 01:22:28,204
Go away... before
I turn you in.

750
01:22:29,129 --> 01:22:31,168
Listen...

751
01:22:31,492 --> 01:22:34,648
this is the biggest job
I ever tried to pull off.

752
01:22:35,377 --> 01:22:38,533
Don't get in my way.
You're still tied to me.

753
01:22:38,822 --> 01:22:42,297
Remember that...
all the way to jail.

754
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:47,025
And jail isn't the worst thing
that could happen to you.

755
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:51,629
Are you through?

756
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:55,925
Just clearing things up.

757
01:22:56,486 --> 01:22:59,130
Yeah, everything's clear now.

758
01:23:00,011 --> 01:23:02,244
Okay, that's enought then.

759
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:05,854
Yes, but you're coming
with me.

760
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,937
He'll wretch your life

761
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:14,422
- like he did with me.
- No, he'll marry me.

762
01:23:14,631 --> 01:23:17,308
I'm sick of this squalor,
I told you.

763
01:23:17,635 --> 01:23:20,027
But look at me...

764
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:22,643
It's different, he loves me.

765
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:26,365
- And you believe that?
- We just got engaged,

766
01:23:26,528 --> 01:23:28,807
he gave me a present too.
Look what...

767
01:23:28,852 --> 01:23:31,243
We've had enough of you,
beat it!

768
01:23:31,976 --> 01:23:34,208
And remember what I said.

769
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:52,558
It feels so good to be in love.
Now show me you love me.

770
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:56,008
I need your help
to pull this off.

771
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:59,729
You won't attract attention
in the fields.

772
01:23:59,814 --> 01:24:02,571
We need something
to distract them

773
01:24:03,019 --> 01:24:06,254
if this is going to work.
Now listen carefully.

774
01:24:06,663 --> 01:24:08,896
This is what you do...

775
01:24:27,252 --> 01:24:30,089
- You came to say goodbye?
- You're going then?

776
01:24:30,136 --> 01:24:32,333
Yes, I got my discharge.

777
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,696
I know you'd rather avoid me,
but please listen.

778
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:38,745
Something terrible
is happening.

779
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:41,258
I can't go to anybody else.

780
01:24:41,552 --> 01:24:43,545
What's it all about?

781
01:24:44,275 --> 01:24:46,746
I'll marry the winner!

782
01:25:15,799 --> 01:25:19,512
She had to end up that
way... with a no-good!

783
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:22,446
We can't abandon her.
You can still save her!

784
01:25:22,487 --> 01:25:26,850
I'm out of the army now.
I can go where I like.

785
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:30,246
There's plenty of people
at the farm, tell them.

786
01:25:30,338 --> 01:25:34,782
It's hard for me. The girls
treat me like one of them.

787
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:38,820
I'd have to explain it all to
them, tell them what I did.

788
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,673
It's hard, but you have to
learn to get by on your own.

789
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:52,521
You're right, I'll do that.

790
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:56,487
There's plenty of people
at the farm...

791
01:25:57,655 --> 01:26:00,379
the police too.

792
01:26:16,843 --> 01:26:21,126
She's not here!
We can't find her!

793
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:03,378
- Where's Silvana?
- God knows what's keeping her.

794
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:11,672
Here she comes, the prettiest
of them all! She wins the prize.

795
01:27:29,742 --> 01:27:32,784
The fields are flooded!

796
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:36,267
Quick! Hurry!

797
01:27:50,491 --> 01:27:53,488
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

798
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:03,021
I'll go take a look,
maybe they got Silvana.

799
01:28:59,787 --> 01:29:03,148
All our work!
The diskes gave way!

800
01:29:03,192 --> 01:29:06,267
We'll have to break the banks
to let the water out!

801
01:29:06,316 --> 01:29:09,755
If we don't hurry, the rice
will get washed away!

802
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,841
Give me a shovel!

803
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,707
Come on, give us a hand!

804
01:29:58,988 --> 01:30:01,186
Is this what
you were afraid of?

805
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:04,227
- They did it!
- Maybe it's too late.

806
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:08,234
- What can we do?
- Come with me!

807
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:11,358
We can't do anything here.

808
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,446
They did this to get
everybody out of the way.

809
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:18,292
Let's go to the farm, maybe
we can still stop them.

810
01:30:50,899 --> 01:30:53,657
Francesca and the Sergeant
followed me!

811
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:29,469
- Hey, that was a shot!
- Lf he goofs, we scram.

812
01:32:29,515 --> 01:32:32,398
Let's scram now,
before they catch us!

813
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,801
Yeah, let's go. It's his fault
for bringing a woman into it.

814
01:32:35,844 --> 01:32:38,487
You'll drive that one,
I'll take this.

815
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:42,046
Don't worry about me,
watch out for him!

816
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:48,732
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

817
01:32:49,343 --> 01:32:51,940
I'll see this through now.

818
01:32:52,387 --> 01:32:55,428
We're trapped, we can't
get out of here.

819
01:32:56,032 --> 01:32:59,473
You doublecrossed me!
I'll make you pay for this!

820
01:33:03,242 --> 01:33:05,601
Where are you going?
Can't you see I'm hurt?

821
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:08,208
There's a first-aid box...

822
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:10,641
They'll shoot you, idiot!

823
01:33:11,373 --> 01:33:16,329
Do something!
My wrist... my shoulder...

824
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:20,305
I can't defend myself now.

825
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:30,435
Get back!

826
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:43,009
Relax, I won't fire
if you keep still.

827
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:45,854
You have to lose
your poisonous blood.

828
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,418
This is where you have
to end your career.

829
01:33:59,879 --> 01:34:03,719
Give my gun...
here, in my pocket.

830
01:34:10,093 --> 01:34:14,936
You try... No, don't shake.
That's it, good girl.

831
01:34:16,382 --> 01:34:18,456
Take the safety catch off.

832
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:23,910
Right, it's ready now.
Squeeze the trigger gently.

833
01:34:24,794 --> 01:34:28,712
There's only 5 shots.
Don't waste them.

834
01:34:32,565 --> 01:34:34,638
Aim carefully.

835
01:34:35,249 --> 01:34:38,883
No, straighten your arm!

836
01:34:39,494 --> 01:34:43,493
- Don't move!
- Shoot!

837
01:34:47,705 --> 01:34:50,017
No, don't, you might
hit the wrong one.

838
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:55,191
Idiot! You wasted 3 shots.

839
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:58,275
There's only two left now.

840
01:34:59,962 --> 01:35:02,560
It's all my fault
for dragging you into this.

841
01:35:02,966 --> 01:35:05,963
I brought you bad luck
from the first day we met

842
01:35:06,732 --> 01:35:09,648
but I so wanted it
to be different with you.

843
01:35:11,297 --> 01:35:14,453
It's silly of me
to say that now.

844
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:17,897
It's not your fault.
I'd have met Silvana anyway.

845
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:23,631
I didn't realize... I guess I was
not meant to have a woman

846
01:35:23,675 --> 01:35:26,990
after ten years in the army.
Or maybe...

847
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:33,167
that woman shouldn't
have been Silvana.

848
01:35:58,202 --> 01:36:01,005
- Give me that!
- Don't shoot!

849
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,610
I can't make it.

850
01:36:05,733 --> 01:36:10,734
You scared? I kew
you'd be scared!

851
01:36:14,465 --> 01:36:20,024
- I can't do it!
- Do something, Silvana.

852
01:36:20,633 --> 01:36:23,630
Say what you want to do,
we'll help you.

853
01:36:23,758 --> 01:36:26,229
We can still save you.

854
01:36:26,842 --> 01:36:31,923
Your courage has all gone.
They flooded the fields,

855
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:38,090
the harvest might be lost.
Why don't you say something?

856
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:42,380
I'm your friend, I know
you're not a bad girl.

857
01:36:43,104 --> 01:36:46,384
Save your breath, idiot!

858
01:36:46,749 --> 01:36:48,504
You really think a woman...

859
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,106
could fall in love
for a bum like you?

860
01:36:52,157 --> 01:36:56,075
It's me she loves!
And she'll do only what I say.

861
01:36:56,883 --> 01:37:01,645
For a poor slob like you
Francesca's more than enough!

862
01:37:02,051 --> 01:37:04,933
You can have her
for all I care, she's yours!

863
01:37:21,477 --> 01:37:25,476
Kill her!
Quick, kill her!

864
01:37:28,326 --> 01:37:30,605
Don't come any closer!

865
01:37:33,453 --> 01:37:36,814
Here's the necklace!
Take it!

866
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:40,459
Francesca, it's all we have.

867
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:43,901
Let us go!

868
01:37:47,073 --> 01:37:49,351
The necklace...

869
01:37:50,236 --> 01:37:52,515
is a fake.

870
01:37:53,842 --> 01:37:58,363
It's worth nothing,
and he knows that.

871
01:37:58,648 --> 01:38:02,248
That's why he gave it to you.
He used it to charm you.

872
01:38:03,134 --> 01:38:05,891
It's phoney... like him!

873
01:38:05,939 --> 01:38:08,376
You bastard!

874
01:38:44,111 --> 01:38:46,834
Silvana!
Where are you going?

875
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:52,033
What's she going to do?

876
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,422
What are you doing?

877
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:17,719
Come down!

878
01:40:27,253 --> 01:40:31,331
Where are you going?

879
01:42:08,353 --> 01:42:12,829
Come on, it's time to go.
The trucks are waiting.

880
01:42:12,879 --> 01:42:17,082
There's nothing more to see.

881
01:43:19,169 --> 01:43:22,165
And so another season is over.
The time has come to go home.

882
01:43:23,294 --> 01:43:28,171
Some will return
to their sewing machines.

883
01:43:28,823 --> 01:43:32,217
Others to the fields
to cut the corn.

884
01:43:32,508 --> 01:43:35,504
Others still to the factories.

885
01:43:35,672 --> 01:43:40,753
Then, next year in May they'll
come to the rice plain again.

886
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:44,316
They may be the same ones
we met here

887
01:43:44,845 --> 01:43:48,320
from Arceto, from Schio,
from Nonantola,

888
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:52,444
from Rio Saliceto,
from Casmara, from Cento,

889
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:55,852
from Emilia, from Veneto,
from Lombardy

890
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,543
from every village in the north.
