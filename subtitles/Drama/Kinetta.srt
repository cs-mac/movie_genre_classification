1
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,910
Have I got
something in my eye?

2
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,235
Seems a bit red.

3
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
I saved you some jello.

4
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,959
He returns her slap
with his right hand.

5
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,675
He approaches her, she raises
her arms and pushes him.

6
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,391
He steps back.

7
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,559
He moves toward her. As he's
getting ready to grab her...

8
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,117
she raises her arms
and takes hold of him.

9
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,319
Their bodies begin to move
irregularly in space.

10
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
She finds the opportunity
to lift her right leg...

11
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,759
and kicks him
in the stomach.

12
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,038
The guy doubles over.

13
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,720
She turns and
starts running...

14
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,679
escaping in the
opposite direction.

15
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,756
He gets up and
starts to pursue her.

16
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,029
He catches up with her.

17
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,440
He grabs her right arm...

18
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,240
twists it behind her back...

19
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,280
forces her palm against
her left shoulder blade...

20
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,159
and with his left hand,
he grips her throat.

21
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,637
He starts dragging
her backwards.

22
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,590
With her left hand, she
tries to hit him in the head.

23
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,000
She is unsuccessful...

24
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,549
so she decides
to jab him with her elbow.

25
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,952
The guy doubles over
once again.

26
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,119
She seizes the
opportunity to escape.

27
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,314
She is in flight.

28
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,475
The guy stands up again,
runs after her...

29
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,120
immobilizes her,
grabs her hair...

30
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,634
and throws her
on the ground.

31
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,799
After she falls down,
he bends over her...

32
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,829
and tries to thrust her
back against the dirt.

33
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,751
She manages to punch him
with her right fist.

34
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,116
She punches him again,
now with her left fist.

35
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,960
As the guy retreats...

36
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,800
she gets the chance...

37
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,837
to kick him
with her right foot.

38
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,992
The guy falls back.

39
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,800
She turns on
her hands and knees...

40
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,759
and attempts to break away.

41
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,199
The guy rises and,
with a swift movement...

42
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,437
in a sure plunge...

43
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,479
he grabs her leg...

44
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,710
pulls her towards him...

45
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,916
rolls her over...

46
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,789
and with slow movements,
crawling...

47
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,073
he slides on top of her.

48
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,479
- Should I make the room?
- Yes.

49
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,679
- Is it gonna take long?
- No, I'll make it fast.

50
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,759
- How fast?
- 10 or 15 minutes...

51
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,196
Good.

52
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,877
Go and wait
for me in the car.

53
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,590
Which one?

54
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,150
The grey one.

55
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,516
Slippers?

56
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,116
Spinach pie?

57
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,120
<i>Pir</i>o<i>ski</i> is the word
for spinach pie?

58
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,712
Yes.

59
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,273
Car?

60
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,113
Ice cube?

61
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,033
Road?

62
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,233
Bread?

63
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,473
Home?

64
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,633
Beach?

65
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,873
I don't know.

66
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,593
Magazine?

67
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,672
Can I offer you
another jello?

68
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,000
Got another one
in the freezer?

69
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,719
No, but I could stick one in.

70
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,999
Nah... Don't bother.

71
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,239
Hurry up! We won't make it.
Hurry up! We won't make it.

72
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,558
When can I have
the videotape?

73
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,556
- As soon as I make the dub.
- When is that?

74
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,520
- When I get a chance.
- Wednesday?

75
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,876
- Which Wednesday?
- This Wednesday.

76
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,880
How about next Wednesday?

77
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,518
Alright.

78
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,638
How long was she
crawling on the grass?

79
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,679
Does it matter?

80
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,153
She looks a bit stiff.

81
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,233
You're cozy
when you're crawling?

82
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,358
Her neck position
shows that she was stiff.

83
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,240
It's probably her collar
that confuses you.

84
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,800
Her mouth is open.

85
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,672
Just enough
so she could breathe.

86
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,076
Did she sweat?

87
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,320
A little.

88
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,197
Did she ask for
a drink of water?

89
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,558
I don't remember.

90
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,836
That hole behind her...
what is it?

91
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,673
The pool.

92
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,391
That's what
the pool looks like?

93
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,594
I thought you wanted the photo
to check her clothing...

94
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,359
The shoes are on the
wooden thing with the slots.

95
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,514
As she is running...

96
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,034
the heels of her shoes...

97
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,194
the high heels of her shoes...

98
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,394
sink into the sand.

99
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,711
She loses her balance,
and falls down.

100
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,911
The guy swiftly
moves behind her.

101
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,949
Pulls her back vigorously,
dragging her to the car.

102
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,155
She resists, but he...

103
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,672
with increasing force...

104
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,080
he keeps pulling her.

105
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,917
He yanks her to the car.

106
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,480
He rolls her over, abruptly...

107
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,237
and thrusts her
against the hood.

108
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,080
She finds an
opportunity to escape.

109
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,720
She flees toward the beach.

110
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,880
She runs.

111
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,590
The guy spots her and
starts running after her.

112
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,400
He catches up with her.

113
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,000
With his left hand,
he grips her hair...

114
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,197
and throws her down
with great power.

115
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,079
After she's on the ground,
she stares at him...

116
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,195
she lifts her legs
to repel him...

117
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,960
to keep him away...

118
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,960
by kicking
her legs in the air...

119
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,430
and swinging her body...

120
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,875
in all directions.

121
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,834
He tries to find a way in.

122
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,510
He circles around her...
he keeps circling and circling.

123
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,394
Suddenly, he finds a way in...

124
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,389
and mounts her.

125
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,320
He blocks her.

126
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,677
His hands grab her
throat and squeeze it.

127
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,269
He chokes her,
until she loses consciousness.

128
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,151
Come in.

129
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,396
It itches.

130
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,396
It's bleeding.

131
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,394
Do you want
something to drink?

132
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,914
What have you got?

133
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,399
- Only water.
- Water.

134
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,230
- What?
- Water.

135
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,515
- Tap water.
- Yes.

136
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,318
Thank you.

137
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,635
Do you want to listen
to some music?

138
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,189
Yes.

139
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,837
Where is your shoe?

140
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,589
Outside.

141
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,196
How much?

142
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,955
It's the same car.

143
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,151
How much?

144
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,880
The price can only
go up, not down.

145
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,552
How much?

146
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,040
- BMW.
- How much?

147
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,400
The owner...he passed away.

148
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,870
He drove it for six months....
It's brand new.

149
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,352
How much?

150
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,190
- 30,000 euros.
- 30,000...

151
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,639
Five years' guarantee...
brand new... power.

152
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,080
- Can't afford it.
- Think about it.

153
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,594
It'll change your life.

154
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,232
Ok?

155
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,633
Ok.

156
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,191
You grab your little shirt,
you lift it to your face...

157
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,352
till it reaches your eyes.

158
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,872
Until it reaches your eyes.

159
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,395
You stop there.

160
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,360
As you lift your shirt...

161
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,760
you raise your head...

162
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,435
revealing your eyes
that look straight at me.

163
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,200
You now remove
your shirt entirely...

164
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,112
and drop it
on top of the jacket.

165
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,637
You turn toward the painting.

166
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,110
You admire the poppies.

167
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,759
You stare at the sky
in the painting.

168
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,159
You suddenly raise your head
and stare at the ceiling.

169
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,156
With your index finger
and thumb...

170
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,799
you hold the waist
of your blue jeans...

171
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,475
and slowly lower them.

172
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,118
With your thumb
and index finger...

173
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,520
you hold the blue jeans...

174
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,637
and slowly you lower them.

175
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,868
You lower them.
Lower them.

176
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,396
You lower them.

177
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,596
Hold it right there.

178
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,710
You tilt your back
slightly forward.

179
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,960
Your back leans
like this...for a bit.

180
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,920
Once again,
two, three times...

181
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,071
left, right,
your head, your hair.

182
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,919
Now, as you are,
you turn...

183
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,800
you look at me...

184
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,156
you drop your hands...

185
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,879
and reach around to the clasp.

186
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,319
You undo the clasp.

187
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,199
Yes, like that. With both
hands, you undo the clasp.

188
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,791
And with your right hand...

189
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,951
you lower the left
strap of your bra.

190
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,640
And with your left hand,
you lower the right strap.

191
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,397
You turn once again
and look at the painting.

192
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,600
You sway your body...

193
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,910
sometimes to the left,
sometimes to the right.

194
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,999
You drop your bra
onto the sofa.

195
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,280
You drop your hands.

196
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,431
Simultaneously,
the bra falls on the sofa.

197
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,151
You make a leisurely turn...

198
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,152
and look at me.

199
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,072
You raise your hands, slowly...

200
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,989
and fix your hair.

201
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,313
Your right foot on the gas...

202
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,395
your left foot on the brake.

203
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,350
Right...gas.

204
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,190
Left... brake.

205
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,309
Are you hungry?

206
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,836
A little.

207
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,993
Do you want me
to make you a sandwich?

208
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,676
If you've got anything...

209
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,233
Should I put
mayonnaise on it?

210
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,676
Just a bit.

211
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,589
The bathroom?

212
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,069
Door on the left.
