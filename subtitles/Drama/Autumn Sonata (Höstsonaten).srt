
0:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,310
AUTUMN SONATA

2
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,431
Sometimes I watch my wife,

3
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,394
without her being aware of
my presence.

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,752
The first time she entered that room,
she said,

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,952
"It's good. I want to be here."

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,074
We'd met only a few days before,
at a bishops' council in Trondheim.

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,909
She was the correspondent
of a church magazine.

8
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,318
We met at lunch, and I told her about
the vicarage here.

9
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,276
I ventured to suggest we come here
after the conference.

10
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,073
On the way here, I asked her
if she would marry me.

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,509
She didn't reply.

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,918
But when we entered this room,
she turned to me and said,

13
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,474
"It's good. I want to be here."

14
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,160
Ever since then we've lived a good
and quiet life here at the vicarage.

15
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,431
Eva has told me about her life.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,755
After school, she went to university.

17
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,794
She was engaged to a doctor,
and lived with him for several years.

18
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,430
She wrote two little books,

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,599
contracted tuberculosis,
broke off the engagement

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,999
and moved from Oslo to a small town
in the south of Norway,

21
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,795
where she started working
as a journalist.

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,710
This is the first of her books -
I'm very fond of it.

23
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,149
She writes,

24
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,474
"One has to learn to live;
I practise every day.

25
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,718
"The greatest obstacle
is that I don't know who I am.

26
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,195
"I fumble in the dark.

27
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,118
"Were someone to love me
for who I am,

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,676
"I might at last be able
to study myself.

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,435
"The possibility of this
is rather remote."

30
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,838
If I could only tell her one time
that she <i>is</i> loved,

31
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,679
unreservedly.

32
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,396
But I can't say it in such a way
that she will believe me.

33
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,478
I lack the proper words.

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,837
Can I read you my letter to Mother,
or am I disturbing you?

35
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,111
No, come in. Let me
switch off the radio.

36
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,549
I can come back later.

37
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,911
I would very much like
to hear your letter.

38
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,158
"Dearest Mother,
yesterday I ran into Agnes,

39
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,239
"who was visiting her parents
with her family.

40
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,158
"She told me Leonardo had died.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,638
"Dearest little Mummy, I can imagine
how terrible you must feel.

42
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,594
"Would you like to visit us
for a few days, or weeks?

43
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,314
"Whichever suits you best.

44
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,398
"In case you get frightened
and say no directly,

45
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,432
"I must tell you the vicarage
is very spacious.

46
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,394
"You'll have your own room,
secluded and with all mod cons.

47
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,354
"We have a grand piano
for you to practise on.

48
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,029
"Wouldn't it be nice
not to have to stay at a hotel?

49
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,628
"Please say you'll come!

50
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,435
"We'll take good care of you
and spoil you.

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,714
"It's such a long time since we met.
In October it will be seven years.

52
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,593
"With love from Viktor
and your daughter Eva."

53
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,792
- That sounds very good.
- Do you think so?

54
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,276
- Mummy dearest! Welcome!
- Eva dear, here I am.

55
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,951
I'm so happy you're here.
Let me help you.

56
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,753
- What a long journey.
- Yes, I know.

57
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,190
The last bit is the worst.
But isn't it beautiful here.

58
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,517
- Will you stay for a while?
- I certainly will.

59
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,156
- How nice that you're here!
- And I want to see everything.

60
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,716
What heavy bags! Have you brought
all your music?

61
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,469
- Of course. I intend to move in.
- That would be lovely.

62
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,990
- You must give me some lessons.
- Of course.

63
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,554
- Where's Viktor?
- He's not here.

64
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,990
We didn't expect you so early.
He'll be back for lunch.

65
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,669
- This is your room.
- It's charming.

66
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,633
What a wonderful view.

67
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,035
Here's the bathroom.

68
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,228
Very attractive and modern.

69
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,478
- The closet, I hope it's big enough.
- I'm sure it is.

70
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,636
I'm really very tired.

71
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,958
My back aches. I sat with Leonardo
during his last 24 hours.

72
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,278
He was in terrible pain,
despite injections every two hours.

73
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,709
At times he cried.

74
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,833
It wasn't for fear of dying,
but out of pain.

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,034
There was building work going on
outside, drilling and hammering.

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,393
The sun was so hot, and there were
neither blinds nor awnings.

77
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,514
We tried to get another room, but
several wards were closed for repairs.

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,714
Towards the evening the noise
subsided and I opened the window.

79
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,355
The heat was like a wall outside -
it was windless.

80
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,795
The professor came at night,
an old friend of Leonardo's.

81
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,309
He said he didn't have long left.

82
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,956
Leonardo would have injections
once an hour,

83
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,516
so that he could fall asleep
without pain.

84
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,996
The professor left
and the nurse came in.

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,958
She thought I should eat,
but I wasn't hungry.

86
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,237
The smell made me nauseous.

87
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,630
Leonardo slept for a few minutes.

88
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,311
When he woke up, he asked me
to leave the room.

89
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,071
He called the nurse, who immediately
gave him an injection.

90
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,878
A few minutes later she came out.
She said that...

91
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,714
Leonardo was dead.

92
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,520
I stayed with him all night.

93
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,793
I thought about us having been friends
for 18 years, living together for 13.

94
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,196
Never a harsh or angry word
between us.

95
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,148
For the last two years
he knew he was hopelessly ill.

96
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,351
I went to see him in his villa
outside Naples as often as I could.

97
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,550
He was kind and considerate,
pleased by my success.

98
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,792
We would chat and joke,
play some chamber music.

99
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,796
He never mentioned his illness,
and I didn't ask.

100
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,070
He wouldn't have liked that.

101
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,789
One day he looked at me
for a long time.

102
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,632
Then he laughed and said,

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,874
"By this time next year,
I'll be gone,

104
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,233
"but I'll always be with you,
I'll always think of you."

105
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,794
It was nice of Leonardo to say that,
but then again he was a bit theatrical.

106
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,912
I can't really say I mourn him.

107
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,555
It feels empty, but one mustn't
bury oneself.

108
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,592
Have I changed much
since we last met?

109
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,759
- You're exactly the same.
- I dye my hair, of course.

110
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,474
Leonardo didn't want to see
my grey hairs.

111
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,991
I bought this trouser suit in Zürich,
for the car journey.

112
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,908
I spotted it in a window.
I went in and tried it on - perfect fit.

113
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,874
- Astonishingly cheap. Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

114
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,994
Let's unpack. Give me a hand
with this suitcase, my back hurts so.

115
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,829
Can we find a board to put
under the mattress, for my back?

116
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,919
It's already there.
I put it there yesterday.

117
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,032
What's the matter, dear?
Are you crying?

118
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,392
- Have I said something wrong?
- It's because I'm so happy to see you.

119
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,199
Let's hug tightly,
as we did when you were little.

120
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,788
I only talk about myself.

121
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,754
Now you must tell, Eva dearest.
Let's sit down.

122
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,350
- How are you, little Eva?
- I'm very happy.

123
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,790
That's good. But isn't life here
very isolated?

124
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,710
- Viktor and I have our parish work.
- Yes, of course you do.

125
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,675
I often play in the church. Last month
I gave an evening recital.

126
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,920
I played, and then I talked about
the music. It was a great success.

127
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,919
- You will have to play for me.
- I'd love to.

128
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,669
I gave five school recitals
in Los Angeles.

129
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,429
Imagine, playing and talking
to three thousand children!

130
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,677
What a success - but awfully tiring.

131
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,634
There's something I have to tell you.
Helena is here.

132
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,838
You should have written and told me.

133
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,475
If I'd told you about Helena
you wouldn't have come.

134
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,469
- I'm sure I'd have come all the same.
- I'm sure you wouldn't.

135
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,913
Leonardo's death wasn't enough.
You had to drag poor Lena here, too?

136
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,669
Mother, Helena's lived here
for two years.

137
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,397
I wrote to tell you we were going
to ask her to come and live here.

138
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,876
- I wrote to you.
- I never received that letter.

139
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,117
Or you didn't bother to read it.

140
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,949
- Isn't that an unfair accusation?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

141
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,953
I can't bear to see her,
at least not today.

142
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,356
Mother, Helena is a wonderful person.

143
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,358
She's so looking forward
to seeing you.

144
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,916
She was so comfortable
in the nursing home.

145
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,235
I wanted to have her here.

146
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,636
- Are you sure she's better off here?
- Yes, she is.

147
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,718
And I have someone to care for.

148
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,308
Has she... I mean, has she...

149
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,550
Is she... worse?

150
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,798
Yes, of course she's worse.
It's part of the illness.

151
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,834
Then let's go and see her.

152
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,875
- Are you sure you want to?
- Do I have a choice?

153
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,039
I've never had a taste for people
who are unaware of their motives.

154
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,789
- Do you mean me?
- Take it the way you like. Come on.

155
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,708
My dearest Lena.

156
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,678
I've thought of you so often,
every day.

157
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,150
She's got a cold. She's afraid
she'll give it to you.

158
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,831
I'm not afraid - I haven't had a cold
for twenty years!

159
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,960
What a lovely room you have. And the
view is the same as from my room.

160
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,356
Helena wants you to hold her head
and look at her.

161
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,234
- Like this? Is this good?
- Yes.

162
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,430
I'm so glad Eva's taking care of you.
I thought you were still at the home.

163
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,112
I <i>was</i> going to come and see you
before I left. But this is much better.

164
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,232
- We can be together every day.
- Yes.

165
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,514
Are you in pain?

166
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,432
No.

167
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,873
Your hair looks lovely.

168
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,639
It's in your honour, Mummy.

169
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,799
If you want, I could read to you.
Would you like that?

170
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,755
And we could go out in the car.
I've never been to these parts.

171
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,272
- What is she saying?
- You must be tired.

172
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,517
You needn't exert yourself
further today.

173
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,589
Mummy's been very good.

174
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,759
- Doesn't Lena have a clock?
- Yes, on the bedside table.

175
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,632
Have my watch.

176
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,197
I was given it by an admirer
who thought I was always late.

177
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,269
- Will Lena eat dinner with us?
- No, lunch is her main meal.

178
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,599
Anyway, Lena is on a diet.
She ate too much at the home.

179
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,238
Why do I feel feverish?

180
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,828
Why do I want to cry?

181
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,273
How stupid! There I stand - shamed.
And that's the idea.

182
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,552
And the guilty conscience,
always the guilty conscience!

183
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,479
I was in such a hurry to come here.
What did I expect?

184
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,388
What was it I longed for,
that I didn't dare admit to myself?

185
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,076
This inconceivably peculiar mother!

186
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,991
You should have seen her
when I told her that Helena lived here.

187
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,319
She even managed a smile,
despite her surprise and dismay.

188
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,389
And then, outside Lena's door,
the actress before her entrance.

189
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,909
Awfully frightened - but composed.

190
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,157
An outstanding performance.

191
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,714
Why did she come?

192
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,595
What did she expect from a reunion
after seven years?

193
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,792
- Who knows?
- What did I expect?

194
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,711
Do we never give up hope?
Never stop being mother and daughter?

195
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,715
No point in crying.

196
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,354
Damn!

197
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,792
There she was, looking at me
with her big eyes.

198
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,749
I held her face in my hands
and I could feel

199
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,350
the illness tugging at
her neck muscles.

200
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,077
Damn!

201
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,396
Why can't I hold her and comfort her,
like I did when she was little?

202
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,517
That ravaged, soft body,

203
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,595
that's my Lena.

204
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,751
Don't cry, damn it!

205
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,592
A writer - I forget the name - said,

206
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,192
"It's like a heavy ghost that falls over
you when you open the nursery door,

207
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,836
"because you've long ago forgotten
it's the nursery door."

208
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,599
Do you think I'm adult?

209
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,874
To be an adult is to be able to deal
with one's dreams and expectations.

210
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,232
- One has stopped yearning.
- Do you think so?

211
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,035
Perhaps one ceases to be surprised.

212
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,994
You look so sensible, sitting there
with your old pipe.

213
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,989
- You're altogether adult.
- Hardly. I'm surprised every day.

214
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,953
- At what?
- At you, for example.

215
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,870
Besides, I nurture some unreasonable
dreams and expectations,

216
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,151
as well as a kind of yearning.

217
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,272
- Yearning?
- I yearn for you.

218
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,119
Those are pretty words, aren't they?

219
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,118
Words that don't mean anything real.

220
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,754
I was brought up on pretty words.

221
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,271
Mother is never mad,
or disappointed or unhappy.

222
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,709
She "feels pain".

223
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,400
You use words like that, too.

224
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,830
I suppose it comes with the job.

225
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,829
When you say you yearn for me
when I'm right here, I get wary.

226
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,157
- You know very well what I mean.
- No.

227
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,035
If I knew that, you wouldn't
think of saying you yearn for me.

228
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,311
I have to check on the roast.

229
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,035
Mother thinks I'm a poor cook.
She's a real glutton.

230
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,755
- I think you're...
- .. a wonderful cook. Thank you.

231
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,831
I mustn't forget she wants
decaffeinated coffee.

232
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,752
I'll shorten my stay.
Four days - I could make that.

233
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,678
Then I'll go to Africa, as I planned.

234
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,068
This hurts, Charlotte.

235
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
Hurts.

236
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,154
Viktor, I've often wondered why she
suffers from insomnia. I think I know.

237
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,670
If she slept normally, her vitality
would crush those around her.

238
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,396
Insomnia is nature's way
of making her bearable.

239
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,918
I'll wear my red dress.
And I'm doing it out of sheer spite.

240
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,477
Eva will think I should wear something
more seemly after Leonardo's death.

241
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,355
Viktor, she will have dressed up
for dinner, you'll see.

242
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,314
Note the perfect clothes
which discreetly will remind us

243
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,750
that she's in mourning, after all.

244
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,710
All this anger.

245
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,833
All they've done is show
how happy they are to have me.

246
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,318
Viktor's a kind soul. Lucky for Eva,
the crybaby, to have such a good man.

247
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,954
I bet the shower's not working.

248
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,118
It is.

249
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,029
- What a beautiful dress!
- Does it suit me?

250
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,119
I met my old 'girlfriend',
Samuel Parkenhurst, and he said,

251
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,314
"I've just come from a fashion show,
there's a red dress that's so you."

252
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,116
Let's have a toast. Welcome to
the vicarage, dear Charlotte.

253
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,273
Eva, are my glasses on the table
by the window?

254
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,351
Thank you, darling.

255
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,870
My agent - he's so sweet.
He's my only friend these days.

256
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,028
Do you remember Paul, Eva?
We've worked together for 30 years.

257
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,273
What a lovely old instrument!
Such a beautiful timbre!

258
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,279
And it's newly tuned.
Now I'm happy!

259
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,588
- I worried unnecessarily.
- What do you mean?

260
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,840
I was anxious about seeing you
after all this time. I nearly cancelled.

261
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,190
No sugar, thanks.

262
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,871
This coffee isn't much fun,
but what to do when one can't sleep?

263
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,798
I see you're playing
the Chopin Preludes.

264
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,957
- Won't you play for me?
- Not now, Mother.

265
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,915
Don't be childish. It would give me
great pleasure to hear you play.

266
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,989
You told me you were hoping
your mother would listen to you.

267
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,192
I just dabble at it, I lack all technique.

268
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,189
I haven't even learnt the fingering
of this prelude. I couldn't...

269
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,153
Enough excuses, darling. Get to it!

270
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,313
My dearest little Eva.

271
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,592
- Is that all you have to say?
- No, no, I was just so moved.

272
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,871
- Did you like it?
- I liked <i>you</i>.

273
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,754
- I don't understand.
- Play something else, it's lovely.

274
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,395
- I want to know about my mistakes.
- There weren't any.

275
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,637
You didn't like the way
I played the piece.

276
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,309
- We all have our own opinion.
- Right.

277
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,591
- I want to hear yours.
- You're already cross.

278
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,952
I'm sad that you don't find it
worthwhile to give me your opinion.

279
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,435
If you insist.

280
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,915
We'll disregard your technique,
which wasn't so bad,

281
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,919
though you could have paid more
attention to Cortot's fingering,

282
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,353
as it helps the interpretation. But we're
only talking about the conception.

283
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,792
Chopin was emotional, Eva,
not sentimental.

284
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,878
There is a chasm between emotion
and sentimentality.

285
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,916
The prelude you played speaks of
suppressed emotion, not reveries.

286
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,669
You have to be calm,
clear and austere.

287
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,678
Take the first few bars...

288
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,870
It hurts, but he's not showing it.

289
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,554
Then - brief relief.

290
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,317
But almost instantly it fades away
and the pain remains the same,

291
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,352
not greater, not lesser.

292
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,154
A constant and complete restraint.

293
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,917
Chopin was proud, sarcastic,
impetuous, tormented

294
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,316
and very manly.
He was no sentimental old woman.

295
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,228
This prelude must be played
in an almost ugly manner.

296
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,716
It mustn't be seductive,
it should sound wrong.

297
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,957
Laboured, or successfully negotiated.

298
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,680
Like this, I'll show you.

299
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,549
I see.

300
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,554
- Don't be upset, Eva.
- I'm not upset. On the contrary.

301
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,514
I've worked on these preludes
for forty-five years.

302
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,872
Many secrets still remain,
things I do not understand.

303
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,357
As a child I admired you terribly.

304
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,871
Then I was fed up with you
and your pianos for many years.

305
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,788
Now I'm beginning to admire you
again, in a different way.

306
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,151
- Then there's hope.
- I suppose so.

307
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,029
- Eva, where are you?
<i>- I'm upstairs, Mother!</i>

308
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,836
There you are. I've changed
so that we can go for a walk.

309
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,191
- Isn't this the nursery?
- Yes, it's Erik's room.

310
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,153
You've just left it like this?

311
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,717
Viktor and I often talk of redecorating,
but we don't get round to it.

312
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,436
Sometimes I come here
to sit and think.

313
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,869
- Let's go out now.
- Wait.

314
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,958
Do you feel how peaceful it is here?

315
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,471
Erik died the day before his fourth
birthday... but you know that.

316
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,479
Viktor couldn't handle it - Erik and he
had a special bond.

317
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,512
Outwardly, I grieved for him a lot,

318
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,553
but deep down inside
I feel he is still alive,

319
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,513
that we are still close to each other.

320
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,758
I only have to concentrate a little
and he's right there.

321
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,398
Sometimes, when I'm going to sleep,
I can feel his breath on my face.

322
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,910
Then he touches me with his hand.

323
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,874
He's in his world, but we can
reach each other any time.

324
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,118
There is no boundary,
no insurmountable wall.

325
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,189
At times I wonder what the reality is like
where my boy lives and breathes.

326
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,790
At the same time
I know it can't be described,

327
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,878
as it's a world of liberated emotions.

328
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,195
Do you know what I mean?

329
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,630
To me, man is
an unparalleled creation,

330
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,832
like an unfathomable thought.

331
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,953
Everything exists in man,
from the highest to the lowest.

332
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,915
Man is created in God's own image,
and everything exists in God.

333
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,112
And so man is created,

334
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,232
but also the demons and the saints,

335
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,353
the prophets and the artists,
and all those who destroy.

336
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,756
Everything coexists, grows together.

337
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,431
Enormous patterns that constantly
change. Do you see what I mean?

338
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,395
In the same way, a limitless number
of realities must exist,

339
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,718
not only the reality we can grasp
with our blunt senses,

340
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,517
but a tumult of realities that arch
over and around, inside and outside.

341
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,072
Only fear and sententiousness
confine us.

342
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,509
There are no boundaries.

343
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,676
Not for our thoughts.

344
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,837
Not for our emotions.

345
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,750
It's anxiety that sets boundaries,
don't you think?

346
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,077
During the slow movement of
Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' sonata,

347
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,955
you must feel you're living in a world
without boundaries,

348
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,790
in a movement you could never
explore or penetrate.

349
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,516
Let's go for a walk
before it gets too dark.

350
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,828
I thought I heard Helena call.
Forgive me.

351
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,069
Viktor, I think Eva is terribly unhappy.

352
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,669
I'm dismayed by the way she talks.
She's so highly strung.

353
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,633
Just a moment, my dear Charlotte,

354
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,231
and I will try to explain
how I view my wife.

355
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,193
When I asked her to marry me, she
immediately said she didn't love me.

356
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,916
- What are you saying?
- I asked, did she love someone else?

357
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,192
She replied that she had
never loved another person,

358
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,630
that she was incapable of loving.

359
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,917
Eva and I lived here for several years.

360
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,314
Then Erik was born.

361
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,716
We'd given up hope of having a child

362
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,718
and were talking about adopting.

363
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,752
You see, during her pregnancy,

364
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,395
Eva underwent
a complete transformation.

365
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,435
She became happy,
soft and gregarious.

366
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,157
She grew lazy,

367
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,592
ignoring the parish work
and her piano playing.

368
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,272
She'd sit and watch the light travel
across the mountains and the fjord.

369
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,038
We were suddenly very happy.

370
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,516
I'm quite a lot older than Eva,

371
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,873
and I had begun to feel that a grey film
was enveloping my existence.

372
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,151
I felt as though I could look back
and say,

373
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,273
"Oh, so this is life, this is what
it's going to be like."

374
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,356
But then,

375
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,438
everything was different.

376
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,156
You'll have to forgive me, Charlotte.
I still find it hard to...

377
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,959
A few very rich years went by.

378
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,150
Erik.

379
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,954
You should have seen Eva.
Really seen her.

380
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,117
I remember the time
around Erik's birth.

381
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,279
I was recording all the Mozart sonatas
and concertos. I was so busy.

382
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,190
Right. We repeatedly invited you,
but sadly you could never make it.

383
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,992
No.

384
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,636
When Erik drowned,
the film became even greyer.

385
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,514
But for Eva it was different.

386
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,519
- Different? In what way?
- Her feeling is alive.

387
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,551
Unspoilt.

388
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,911
At least that's how it seems.

389
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,600
And Charlotte,

390
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,236
if she feels that her son lives near her,

391
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,358
then perhaps that's how it is.

392
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,713
She seldom talks about it,
for fear it will hurt me,

393
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,752
and I suppose it does.

394
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,351
But what she says sounds true.
I believe her.

395
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,319
Of course, you're a man of God.

396
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,955
The little faith I have
exists on her terms.

397
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,039
- Forgive me if I hurt you.
- That's all right, dear.

398
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,870
Unlike you and Eva, I'm vague
and insecure. It's my own fault.

399
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,553
I think I'll feast on
a couple of proper sleeping pills.

400
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,114
It's so peaceful here,
just the rain on the roof.

401
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,232
- Do you have everything?
- Everything is perfect.

402
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,957
The right biscuits, mineral water,
a tape recorder, <i>two</i> detective novels,

403
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,200
my mask and earplugs, my little
extra pillow and my travelling rug.

404
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,031
Have some Swiss chocolate,
fresh from Zürich. Take two.

405
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,596
- Thanks, but I don't like chocolate.
- How strange.

406
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,792
You were crazy about sweets
as a child.

407
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,869
- Helena liked sweets, not me.
- All the better then, it's all for me.

408
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,639
- Good night, Mummy.
- Good night, dear child.

409
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,228
Viktor really is charming.

410
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,193
- You must take good care of him.
- I do.

411
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,871
Tell me, my dear,
are you happy together?

412
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,390
- Are you all right?
- Viktor is my best friend.

413
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,035
I don't know what life would be like
without him.

414
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,119
- He said you didn't love him.
- He told you that?

415
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,518
- Yes. Why?
- It's a bit surprising, that's all.

416
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,359
- Was it a secret?
- No.

417
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,319
- You don't like him saying it?
- Viktor seldom confides in people.

418
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,829
We were talking about you.

419
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,192
Ask me directly. I will answer
as honestly as I can.

420
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,390
Don't blow this up.

421
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,513
Is it so strange if a mother
is curious about her daughter?

422
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,952
We talked about you
with the utmost affection.

423
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,311
Why can't you leave people alone?

424
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,150
- I've left you alone far too long!
- That's true.

425
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,829
Give me a hug and promise me
you're not cross.

426
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,349
- I'm not cross.
- It's because I love you.

427
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,516
I love you, too.

428
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,950
It's not that much fun
being alone all the time.

429
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,912
I'm envious of you and Viktor.

430
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,352
And now, with Leonardo dead,
I'm so terribly lonely.

431
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,749
- You must see that.
- I do.

432
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,714
No, no, I'll soon start crying
out of self-pity.

433
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,638
This detective novel is not bad.

434
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,389
It's a new writer, Adam Kretzinsky.
Heard of him?

435
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,876
I met him in Madrid. He's quite mad.

436
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,913
I couldn't defend myself.
That is, I didn't defend myself at all.

437
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,430
- Should I turn this light out?
- Yes, please do.

438
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,677
- Tell me when you want breakfast.
- Don't bother.

439
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,157
- But I want to spoil you.
- Well, if you insist.

440
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,115
Strong coffee with hot milk, two slices
of rye bread with Jarlsberg cheese,

441
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,915
and one slice of toast with honey.
Right?

442
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,191
- And orange juice.
- I nearly forgot.

443
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,949
- You'll get your juice.
- Bye, little darling. Good night.

444
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,117
Good night, dear Mother.

445
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,869
Maybe I should have a look at
my accounts.

446
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,438
I mustn't forget to have Brammer
invest the money from Leonardo.

447
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,279
The house is worth quite a lot.

448
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,790
Yes, Leonardo, you didn't bother with
assets and liabilities.

449
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,071
You were beyond worldly worries.

450
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,237
You left all your problems
to your Charlotte.

451
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,436
Three million, seven hundred
and thirty-five thousand,

452
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,711
eight hundred and sixty-six francs.

453
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,754
To think you had all that money,
Leonardo. Who would have guessed?

454
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,118
And you left everything
to your old Charlotte.

455
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,633
I also have a penny or two.

456
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,075
That makes nearly five million in all.

457
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,839
What do I want with all that money?

458
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,589
That's it - I'll buy a nice car
for Viktor and Eva!

459
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,759
They can't keep their old banger -
it looks lethal.

460
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,316
We'll go into town on Monday
and look for a new car.

461
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,069
That will cheer them up,
and me, too.

462
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,155
"She gave him the red flower of her
innocence with quiet dignity.

463
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,431
"He received it without enthusiasm."

464
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,916
What trash!

465
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,028
He really was quite an idiot,
that Adam.

466
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,755
Even if he nearly killed himself
for my sake.

467
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,991
What if I buy myself a new car, and
give the Mercedes to Viktor and Eva?

468
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,591
Then I could fly to Paris
and buy a new car there.

469
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,628
Then I won't have to drive
all the way there.

470
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,116
Tomorrow I must
set about Ravel properly.

471
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,198
Christ, I've been lazy lately.

472
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,517
It's inexcusable, really.

473
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,917
Mother, dear, what's happened?

474
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,669
I heard your cry, but then I couldn't
find you in your room.

475
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,352
I'm sorry if I woke you up, but I had
a nightmare. I dreamt that...

476
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,630
No, I don't remember.

477
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,116
- I'll stay if you want to talk.
- No, thank you, dear.

478
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,313
- I'll just sit here for a while. Go to bed.
- If you say so.

479
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,118
- Eva!
- Yes, Mother?

480
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,949
- You do like me, don't you?
- You're my mother.

481
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,274
What an answer.

482
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,193
- Do you like me?
- But I love you!

483
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,311
That's not true.

484
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,956
I took a break in my career
to stay at home with you and Father.

485
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,154
Your back injury made it impossible
for you to practise six hours a day,

486
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,308
so your playing deteriorated
and your reviews got poorer.

487
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,556
Really, Eva!

488
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,958
I don't know what was worse - you
playing at being a wife and a mother,

489
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,310
or you being on tour.

490
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,115
You made life hell
for both Father and me.

491
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,232
It's not true. Your father and l
were very happy.

492
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,477
Josef loved me, and I'd have done
anything for him.

493
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,592
Of course - you cheated on him.

494
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,359
I did not cheat on him!

495
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,552
I was totally honest with your father.

496
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,992
I fell in love with Martin and
went away with him for eight months.

497
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,475
Do you think it was so easy?

498
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:59,072
It was I who sat with Father in the
evenings, I who had to comfort him.

499
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,478
I had to tell him
that you still loved him,

500
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,717
and that you would surely come back.

501
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,034
I had to read your letters aloud.

502
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,630
Your long, affectionate, funny letters,

503
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,072
in which you told of
your interesting journeys.

504
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,840
We sat there, like two idiots,

505
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,157
reading your letters twice, three times.

506
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,353
We thought you were
the most wonderful woman alive.

507
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,517
Eva, you hate me.

508
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,236
I don't know.

509
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,596
Suddenly you're coming here,
and I'm so happy.

510
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,951
I don't know what I was imagining.

511
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,356
Maybe that you were sad and lonely.

512
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,552
I don't know, I'm so confused!

513
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,878
I thought I was adult, that I had
a clear picture of you and me,

514
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,151
of Helena's illness and our childhood.

515
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,635
Now I realise it's utterly chaotic.

516
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,796
It's Helena.

517
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,633
There, there. Wake up a little.

518
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,228
Wake up.

519
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,517
I'll sit here while you go back to sleep.

520
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,833
To you I was a doll to play with
when you had the time.

521
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,071
If I was ill or difficult, you'd
hand me over to the nanny.

522
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:03,318
You'd shut yourself up in your work,
no one was allowed to disturb you.

523
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,591
I would stand outside and listen.

524
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,999
I'd sneak in during your coffee break
to make sure you existed.

525
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,908
You were always kind...
but completely preoccupied.

526
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,590
If I asked you something,
I'd barely get a reply.

527
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,034
Mummy would like to be alone.
Why don't you go out and play?

528
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,549
Because you were so elegant,
I wanted to be elegant, too.

529
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,433
I became fussy about my clothes.

530
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,757
I worried that you wouldn't like
my appearance.

531
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,871
I was ugly.

532
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,516
Skinny and angular,
with big, round eyes and fat lips.

533
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,835
No eyebrows.

534
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,114
My arms were too thin and my feet
too big. I thought I looked disgusting.

535
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,512
Once you said,
"You should have been a boy."

536
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,509
Then you laughed, so I wouldn't
be upset. But I was, of course.

537
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,314
One day, your suitcases
stood at the foot of the stairs.

538
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,116
You were talking on the phone,
in a foreign language.

539
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,473
I prayed to God something would
happen to stop you going away.

540
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,319
But you always went.

541
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,035
You came up to me,
hugged and kissed me.

542
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,439
Embraced me and kissed me again.
You looked at me and smiled.

543
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:11,271
You smelt so good, so strange.
But you <i>were</i> a stranger to me.

544
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,518
You were already on your way,
you didn't see me.

545
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,200
And so you were gone.

546
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,758
I thought, "Now my heart will stop.
I'm going to die from the pain.

547
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,474
"I'll never be happy again.

548
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,593
"How could I endure
this pain for two months?"

549
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,839
I would cry on Father's lap.

550
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,750
He would sit motionless,
his soft little hand on my head.

551
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,273
He'd sit there for hours, smoking his
old pipe, enveloping us with smoke.

552
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,595
Sometimes he'd speak.

553
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,598
"Shall we go to the cinema tonight?"

554
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,349
Or, "Let's have ice cream
for dinner today."

555
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,314
I didn't care about either,
because I was dying.

556
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,313
The days and weeks went by.

557
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,871
We negotiated the loneliness.
We didn't have much to talk about.

558
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,276
It was easy with Father -
he was never disturbed.

559
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,873
At times he'd look worried. I didn't
know that he had financial difficulties.

560
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,959
But he always lit up
when I came clumping in.

561
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,154
We'd have a little chat, or he'd just
pat me with his pale little hand.

562
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,156
Or Uncle Otto would sit on the sofa,
drinking cognac.

563
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,038
They would mutter quietly.

564
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,436
I wonder if they actually heard
each other.

565
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,519
Or Uncle Harry would be there,
playing chess.

566
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,592
It would be extra quiet then.

567
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,233
You could hear three different clocks
ticking in the house.

568
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,350
Several days before your return,
I'd be feverish with excitement.

569
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,359
At the same time,
I feared falling ill for real,

570
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,439
as I knew you were afraid of
sick people.

571
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,394
When you came, my joy
was more than I could stand.

572
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,514
I couldn't speak. Sometimes you
would become impatient and say,

573
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,350
"Eva doesn't seem very happy
to have her mother back home."

574
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,711
Then I'd turn crimson,

575
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,035
and all sweaty.

576
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,628
I couldn't speak.

577
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,672
I didn't have any words.

578
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,475
You'd taken care of all the words
in our house.

579
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,669
- You exaggerate, Eva.
- Let me finish.

580
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,954
I know I'm a little drunk. But if I wasn't,
I wouldn't be saying this.

581
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,712
When I daren't say more, or fall silent
from shame, then you can explain.

582
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,960
I shall listen and understand, the way
I've always listened and understood.

583
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,113
I loved you, Mummy.

584
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,836
It was a matter of life or death,
but I didn't trust your words.

585
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,635
They didn't agree with
the look in your eyes.

586
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,232
Your voice is beautiful. I could feel it
in my whole body when you spoke,

587
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,990
but I knew instinctively that you
hardly ever meant what you said.

588
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,358
I didn't understand your words.

589
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,518
The worst part was that you smiled
when you were angry.

590
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,792
When you hated Father,
you called him "my dearest friend".

591
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,636
When you were fed up with me,
I was "my darling girl".

592
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,510
You're very quiet.

593
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,633
What do you want me to say?

594
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,433
You could defend yourself.

595
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,190
- Is it worth it?
- How would I know that?

596
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,599
You reproach me for going away,
you reproach me for staying at home.

597
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,350
You've probably never realised
that those years were hell for me.

598
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,875
My back hurt, I couldn't practise and
my recitals suffered.

599
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,279
lmportant contracts were cancelled.
My life felt meaningless.

600
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,349
But I always had a guilty conscience
for not being at home.

601
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,230
You smile ironically!
I'm trying to be honest.

602
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,319
I'll tell you how I reasoned -
and I don't care what you think.

603
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,069
Let's have it out this once,
and never again.

604
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,234
I'm trying to understand.

605
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,154
It was in Hamburg. I played
Beethoven's first,

606
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,910
which isn't so difficult,
and everything went well.

607
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,397
After the concert, I went out with
old Schmiess, the conductor,

608
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,149
for a bite to eat - we always did.

609
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,874
When we'd lingered over dinner,

610
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,391
I was very happy,
I could hardly feel my backache.

611
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,954
Then old Schmiess said,

612
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,275
"Why don't you stay at home
with your family

613
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,392
"and live a respectable life,

614
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,274
"rather than suffer
constant humiliation?"

615
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,956
I stared at him,
then I gave a laugh and said,

616
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,315
"Was I <i>that</i> bad?"

617
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,877
"No, not that bad," he said.

618
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,357
"But I can't help thinking of
August 18, 1934.

619
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,873
"We did Beethoven's first together,
in Linz.

620
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,629
"You were twenty,
and the hall was packed.

621
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,958
"We played like gods,
the orchestra was on fire.

622
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,675
"Afterwards, people were screaming
and stamping their feet.

623
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,519
"The musicians showed
their appreciation.

624
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,433
"You were wearing
a simple red summer dress,

625
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,994
"with your hair down to your waist."

626
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,154
"How can you remember all this?"
I asked.

627
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,750
"I have it written down in my score,"
he said.

628
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,429
"I note down all my greatest
experiences."

629
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,753
That night I couldn't fall asleep.

630
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,513
At 3am I called your father and told
him that I'd decided to stop touring.

631
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,033
I was going to stay at home,
we would be a real family.

632
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,637
Josef was so terribly happy.

633
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,399
We both cried with emotion.

634
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,028
We spoke for two hours.

635
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,391
That's that. And that summer
we were...

636
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,398
We were happy then, weren't we?

637
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,914
No.

638
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,235
- You weren't happy?
- No.

639
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,511
You said you'd never been happier.

640
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,270
Yes. I didn't want to hurt you.

641
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,798
Oh, so that's how it was?

642
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,070
- What did I do wrong?
- I was fourteen.

643
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,154
For want of anything better, you
turned all your pent-up energy on me.

644
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,790
You felt you had neglected me,
and were going to make up for it.

645
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,879
I tried to defend myself,
but I didn't stand a chance.

646
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,676
There you were, with your tender care
and concern in your voice.

647
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:35,352
Not a single detail escaped
your loving attention.

648
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,597
I had a stoop,
so you set me exercises.

649
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,952
You exercised with me,
pleading your back as an excuse.

650
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:48,074
You thought I had too much bother
with my long hair, and cut it short.

651
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,191
It was horrible.

652
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,598
You decided my teeth were crooked,
so I had to wear braces.

653
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,631
I looked grotesque!

654
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,435
You said I was too old
for my trousers and skirts,

655
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,270
and had dresses made for me,
without asking my opinion!

656
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,359
And I didn't dare say anything,
for fear of hurting you.

657
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,712
You gave me books to read
that I didn't understand.

658
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:20,198
I read and I read, and then you and l
were to discuss what I had read.

659
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,517
You talked and talked,
but I didn't understand a thing!

660
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,953
I only worried about having my
ignorance exposed. I was paralysed.

661
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,469
One thing I learnt, though.

662
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,232
Not one molecule of the real me
could be loved, or even accepted.

663
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,956
You were obsessed, and I became
more and more scared and crushed.

664
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,358
I said what you wanted to hear,
made your gestures.

665
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,552
I wasn't even myself
when I was on my own,

666
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,231
as I abhorred everything
that was my own!

667
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,472
It was horrendous, Mother!

668
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,673
I still shake all over
when I think of those years.

669
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,110
It was horrible!

670
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,914
I didn't understand that I hated you -
I was convinced we loved each other.

671
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,908
I couldn't hate you, so my hatred
turned into a terrible anxiety.

672
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,909
I had nightmares, I bit my nails,
I pulled out chunks of my hair.

673
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,474
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't -
I couldn't utter a single sound.

674
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,957
I tried to scream, but only
stifled grunts came out,

675
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:42,313
which scared me even more,
as I thought I was going insane!

676
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,559
- Then I met Stefan.
- You couldn't have had a child!

677
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,196
I was eighteen, Stefan was grown-up!
We'd have coped.

678
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,437
- You wouldn't have coped!
- We would have!

679
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,711
We wanted the child, but you ruined
our relationship.

680
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:13,197
It's not true! I even said to Josef
that we had to show consideration.

681
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,551
You didn't see that Stefan was an idiot!

682
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,151
Do you know everything?
Did you hear me and Stefan talk?

683
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,673
Did you lie under our bed? Do you
know what you're talking about at all?

684
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,839
Have you ever cared about
anybody else but yourself?

685
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,752
I couldn't have forced
an abortion on you.

686
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,839
How could I stand up to you?
I was scared and insecure.

687
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,918
- I needed support.
- I tried to help you.

688
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,830
I was convinced an abortion was the
only solution. I have been until now.

689
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,238
All these years of hatred.
Why didn't you say something?

690
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,399
Because you never listen.
Because you run away from things.

691
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,637
Because you're emotionally crippled.

692
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,991
Because you actually loathe me
and Helena.

693
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:07,956
You're helplessly locked up inside
yourself, holding yourself back.

694
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,231
Because I loved you.

695
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,593
Because you thought I was a failure,
disgusting and untalented.

696
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,238
You damaged me for life,
just as you yourself are damaged.

697
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,670
You went for everything
sensitive and fragile.

698
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,759
You tried to stifle
every living thing you could get at.

699
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,154
You speak of <i>my</i> hatred.

700
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,953
Your hatred wasn't any less strong.

701
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,638
Your hatred <i>isn't</i> any less strong.

702
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:03,474
I was small and malleable
and loving.

703
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,149
You tied me down
because you needed my love,

704
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,035
just as you want everyone
to love you.

705
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,118
I was exposed and defenceless.

706
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,395
And it all took place
in the name of love.

707
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,196
You kept on saying you loved me,
and Father and Helena.

708
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,472
And you knew the intonation
and gestures of love.

709
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,512
People like you are lethal -

710
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,429
you should be locked up
and made harmless.

711
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,878
A mother and her daughter.

712
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,952
What a terrible combination...

713
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,869
of emotions and confusion...
and destruction.

714
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,914
Everything's possible and will be done
in the name of love and caring.

715
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:29,111
The daughter shall inherit
the mother's injuries.

716
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,429
The daughter shall suffer for
the mother's failures.

717
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,757
The unhappiness of the mother
shall be the daughter's unhappiness.

718
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:46,398
It's as if the umbilical cord
had never been cut.

719
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,236
Mummy...

720
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,669
is that how it is?

721
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,995
Is the daughter's unhappiness
the mother's triumph?

722
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,150
Mummy...

723
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,030
is my grief...

724
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,874
your secret pleasure?

725
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,758
Christ, my back hurts.

726
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,277
Do you mind if I lie on the floor?

727
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,350
It's the only thing that helps.

728
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,190
I remember very little
from my childhood.

729
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,438
I can't recall either of my parents
ever touching me,

730
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,472
either to caress or punish.

731
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,392
I was completely ignorant of anything
to do with love,

732
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,275
affection, touching, intimacy, warmth.

733
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:48,708
Only through music did I get a chance
to reveal my emotions.

734
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,872
Sometimes when I lie awake at night,

735
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,276
I wonder whether I've lived at all.

736
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,475
And I wonder whether it's the same
for all people,

737
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,628
or if some people have a greater
talent for living than others.

738
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,389
Or if some people never live,

739
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,515
but simply exist.

740
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,473
Then I'm seized with...

741
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,677
I'm seized with anxiety.

742
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,509
I see an ugly picture of myself...

743
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,393
I've never grown up.

744
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,318
My face and my body have aged.

745
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,389
I'm accumulating memories
and experiences.

746
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,991
But inside all of this,
I haven't even been born.

747
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,318
I don't remember any faces,

748
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,675
not even my own.

749
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,919
Sometimes I try to remember
Mother's face,

750
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,516
but I can't see her.

751
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,872
I can remember that she was big
and dark, with blue eyes,

752
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,595
a large nose and a full mouth.

753
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,953
But I can't seem to get
the different pieces to agree.

754
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,511
I can't see her.

755
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,555
In the same way, I can't see your
face, or Helena's or Leonardo's.

756
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,958
I remember having given birth
to you and your sister,

757
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,154
but all I remember of the deliveries
themselves is that they were painful.

758
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,391
But the pain, what did it taste like?

759
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,440
I don't remember.

760
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,669
Leonardo once said...

761
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,711
No, I can't remember...

762
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,631
Yes. "Having a sense of reality
is a matter of talent," he said.

763
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,237
"Most people lack this talent,

764
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,840
"and maybe just as well."

765
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,437
- Do you understand what he meant?
- Yes, I do.

766
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,110
- But it's really too peculiar.
- Peculiar?

767
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,958
- I've always been afraid of you.
- I don't see why.

768
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,709
I think I wanted you
to take care of me,

769
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,157
take me in your arms and comfort me.

770
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,955
I was a child.

771
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,117
- Does that matter?
- No.

772
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,516
I could see that you loved me.

773
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,359
And I wanted to love you,

774
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,553
but I couldn't. I was afraid of
your demands.

775
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,433
- I had no demands.
- But I thought you did.

776
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,950
I didn't want to be your mother.

777
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,710
I wanted you to know
that I was as helpless as you.

778
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,398
Is it true?

779
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,996
- What are you thinking about?
- About Leonardo and Helena.

780
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,680
I don't understand.

781
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,473
They hardly knew one another.

782
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,833
- We spent Easter together once.
- You left after three days.

783
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,758
I was playing Bartók with Ansermet
in Geneva.

784
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:59,716
I wanted to go through the concerto
with the old man in peace

785
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,913
It's possible I left a bit early,
the weather was awful.

786
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,350
Leonardo was in low spirits,
and so were you.

787
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,915
Why remind me
of that horrible Easter?

788
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,191
I'll tell you why.

789
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,836
Leonardo and you arrived on the
Thursday and we had a nice evening.

790
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:26,795
We drank wine, we sang and laughed,
and played some old game.

791
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,992
Helena wasn't so ill at that point.

792
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,192
She was jolly and happy
the whole evening.

793
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,835
Leonardo enjoyed her happiness.

794
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,430
He was joking and talking to her.

795
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,711
Helena immediately fell in love.

796
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,515
The two of them sat up
late into the night.

797
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,189
The following morning,
Helena told me

798
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,949
that Leonardo had kissed her.

799
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,117
That night we had guests.

800
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:10,234
Leonardo got drunk and played
all of Bach's Cello Suites.

801
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,673
He didn't seem like himself.

802
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,997
He was heavy and mild,
somehow enlarged.

803
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,510
He played badly but beautifully.

804
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,878
Helena sat shining in the twilight.
I had never seen anything like it.

805
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:27,872
You and I went for a walk. You talked
incessantly, but I wasn't listening.

806
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,436
All I could think of
was those two people.

807
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,310
When we returned they sat as before,
one in each end of the room.

808
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,399
You went upstairs to sleep.

809
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,273
I had to help Leo up the stairs.

810
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,394
He stopped outside
the door of your bedroom,

811
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,478
turned to face me, and said,

812
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,635
"Would you believe it?

813
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,151
"There's a butterfly
that's bouncing against the window."

814
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,594
When I went downstairs,
Helena sat erect on her chair.

815
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:11,190
Completely calm, completely relaxed.

816
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,957
There wasn't even the faintest trace
of her illness.

817
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,118
I won't forget her face, Mother.

818
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,560
I won't forget her face.

819
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,150
The following morning,
you left for Geneva.

820
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,353
Four days earlier
than we had agreed on.

821
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,313
On leaving, you said in passing,

822
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:50,468
"I've asked Leonardo to stay on a bit,
as I can see it's doing Helena good."

823
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,114
And then you smiled.

824
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,717
Leonardo suddenly became
restless and unhappy.

825
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,312
On Easter Day, he took a long walk
in the rain.

826
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,594
When he came back, he went up to
Helena and said he had to go,

827
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,393
but that they'd meet again.

828
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,469
Then he called you in Geneva
and spoke to you for half an hour.

829
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,114
He left on the last evening flight.

830
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,870
That night I was woken
by Helena screaming.

831
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:49,276
She complained of pain
in her hip and right leg.

832
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,790
She didn't think she could endure it
through the night.

833
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,509
At five o'clock I had to call for
an ambulance.

834
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,517
- So it's my fault that Lena fell ill?
- Yes, I believe so.

835
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,518
You don't mean that Lena's illness...?

836
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,312
Yes.

837
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,189
Not really...

838
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,471
You abandoned Helena
when she was one.

839
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,712
You continually abandoned
her and me.

840
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,556
When Helena became seriously ill,
you sent her to a home.

841
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,309
- It can't be true...
- What can't be true?

842
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,235
If you've got proof to the contrary,
please tell me.

843
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,237
Look at me, Mother.

844
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,954
Look at Helena.

845
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,477
There are no excuses.

846
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,512
There is only one truth,

847
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,518
and one lie.

848
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,475
- There is no forgiveness.
- You can't put all the blame on me.

849
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,594
You always wanted there to be
special exceptions for you.

850
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,753
You've established a kind of
discount system in life.

851
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:22,519
But at some point you must see
that your agreement is one-sided.

852
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,914
You must realise that you
carry a guilt - like everyone else.

853
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,600
What guilt?

854
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,555
Dearest Eva,

855
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,236
could you forgive me
for everything I've done wrong?

856
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,920
I will try to change.

857
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,715
You will teach me, we will talk.

858
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,392
But help me - I can't stand it
any longer.

859
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,432
Your hatred is so dreadful.

860
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,553
I haven't understood. I've been selfish

861
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,477
and childish.

862
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,514
Please hold me.

863
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,194
At least touch me.

864
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,551
Help me!

865
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,910
Mummy!

866
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,514
Come here!

867
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,036
Help me.

868
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,151
<i>Poor little Mother,</i>
rushing off like that.

869
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:35,236
<i>She looked so scared,</i>
and suddenly so old and tired.

870
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:41,399
<i>Her face looked so small,</i>
and her nose was red from crying.

871
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,268
<i>I'll never see her again.</i>

872
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,075
<i>It'll soon be dark, and it's getting cold.</i>

873
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:10,519
<i>I have to go home and cook dinner</i>
for Viktor and Helena.

874
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,114
<i>I can't die now.</i>

875
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,192
<i>I'm scared of committing suicide.</i>

876
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,035
<i>One day God may want to use me,</i>

877
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,594
<i>and release me from my prison.</i>

878
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,353
I feel so left out of everything.
I'm always homesick.

879
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,313
But when I do come home,

880
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,477
I realise it must be something else
that I want.

881
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,239
<i>Erik!</i>

882
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,874
<i>Are you touching my cheek?</i>

883
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,515
<i>Are you whispering in my ear?</i>

884
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,359
<i>Are you with me now?</i>

885
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,353
<i>We'll never abandon each other.</i>

886
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,475
<i>The light is on in Helena's room.</i>

887
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,797
<i>Viktor is talking to her.</i>

888
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,310
<i>That's good - he's kind.</i>

889
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,948
<i>He's telling her Mother is gone.</i>

890
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,635
Your mother sent her love.

891
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,992
She was upset and anxious,
and she'd been crying.

892
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,949
Eva has gone for a walk.

893
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,868
She was so excited about
seeing your mother.

894
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,673
She set her hopes too high.

895
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,997
I didn't have the heart to warn her.

896
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,959
I don't understand.

897
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,229
What do you want?

898
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,669
Try to speak slowly,

899
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,315
dearest Helena - I can't understand.

900
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,832
Eva, come here!

901
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,869
Sometimes I watch my wife,

902
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,118
without her being aware of
my presence.

903
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,674
She's tormented.

904
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:41,318
Ever since Charlotte rushed off
she's been so horribly tormented.

905
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,640
She hasn't been able to sleep.

906
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,153
She says she drove her mother away,
and she can never forgive herself.

907
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,273
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I'm going to the post office.

908
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,599
- Do you think you could post this?
- With pleasure.

909
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,792
- It's for Charlotte?
- You can read it if you want.

910
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,593
I'm going up to Helena.

911
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:16,075
"Dear Mother, I realise now
