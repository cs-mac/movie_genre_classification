1
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,491
When shall we three meet again?

2
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:20,376
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

3
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,040
When the hurly-burly's done.

4
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,258
VVhen the battle's lost and won.

5
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,131
Where the place?

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,804
Upon the battlefield,
there to meet with Macbeth.

7
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:34,929
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

8
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:38,181
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

9
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,099
Doubtful it stood,

10
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,941
as two spent swimmers
that do cling together

11
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,400
and choke their art.

12
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,194
'The merciless Macdonwald
from the Western Isles

13
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,158
'of kerns and gallowglasses
is supplied.'

14
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:32,866
And fortune,
on his damned quarrel smiling,

15
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,990
showed like a rebel's whore.

16
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:39,284
But all's too weak,
for brave Macbeth -

17
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,789
well he deserves that name -

18
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:45,966
disdaining fortune,
with his brandished steel

19
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:49,841
which smoked with bloody execution,

20
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,385
like valour's minion

21
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,591
carved out his passage
till he faced the slave

22
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:57,472
which ne'er shook hands

23
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,770
nor bade farewell to him

24
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,691
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops

25
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:06,863
and Hxed his head
upon our battlements.

26
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,697
And, to conclude,

27
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,042
victory fell on us.

28
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,666
Valiant Macbeth.

29
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,921
Worthy gentleman.

30
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,669
Great happiness.

31
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,349
Whence cam'st thou, noble Prince?

32
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,233
From Fife, great King,

33
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:47,736
where Norwegian banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold,

34
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:51,490
assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

35
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,489
the Thane of Cawdor_

36
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,709
God save the King!

37
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:18,850
No more that Thane of Cawdor
shall deceive our bosom interest.

38
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:23,738
Go pronounce his present death

39
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:27,446
and with his former title
greet Macbeth.

40
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,574
I'll see it done.

41
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:36,165
What he hath lost,
noble Macbeth hath won.

42
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,909
So foul and fair a day
I have not seen.

43
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,281
What are these?

44
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,711
Live you or are you aught
that man may question?

45
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,927
Speak, if you can.
What are you?

46
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:33,070
Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

47
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,041
Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

48
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,835
All hail, Macbeth,
that shalt be king hereafter.

49
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,550
Good sir,

50
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,760
why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair?

51
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,968
My noble partner
you greet with present grace

52
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,176
and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope

53
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,851
that he seems rapt withal.

54
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,393
To me you speak not.

55
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,193
Hail, lesser than Macbeth
and greater.

56
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:07,157
Not so happy yet much happier.

57
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:11,033
Thou shalt get kings
though thou be none.

58
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,291
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

59
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,790
'Banquo and Macbeth,

60
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,253
'all hail.'

61
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:40,644
Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.

62
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:44,102
Say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence

63
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,902
and why, upon this blasted heath,

64
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,526
you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting.

65
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,160
Speak, I charge you.

66
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,382
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
and these are of them.

67
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,344
Whither are they vanished?

68
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:10,594
Into the air,

69
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,720
and what seemed corporal
melted as breath into the wind.

70
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,265
Would they had stayed.

71
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,355
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

72
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:25,478
Or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner?

73
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,826
Your children shall be kings.

74
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,365
You shall be king.

75
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,036
And Thane of Cawdor too.
Went it not so?

76
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,212
To the selfsame tune and words.

77
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,104
The King hath happily received,
Macbeth,

78
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,277
the news of thy success.

79
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,533
As thick as hail
came post from post

80
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,867
and every one did bear thy praises,
in his kingdom's great defence,

81
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,494
and poured them down before him.

82
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:23,379
And we are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks.

83
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,134
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,

84
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:31,464
he bade me from him
call thee Thane of Cawdor.

85
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,147
The Thane of Cawdor lives.

86
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,516
Why do you dress me
in borrowed robes?

87
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,646
Treasons capital, confessed and proved,
have overthrown him.

88
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,220
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings

89
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:11,634
when those that gave
the Thane of Cawdor to me

90
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,635
promised no less to them?

91
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,982
That trusted home might yet
enkindle you unto the crown

92
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,101
besides the Thane of Cawdor_

93
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,613
But 'tis strange,

94
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,192
and oftentimes,
to win us to our harm,

95
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:33,787
the instruments of darkness
tell us truths,

96
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:35,908
win us with honest trifles

97
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:38,583
to betray's in deepest consequence.

98
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:51,215
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill,

99
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,639
cannot be good.

100
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:59,976
If ill, why hath it given me
earnest of success,

101
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,067
commencing in a truth?

102
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,360
I am Thane of Cawdor_

103
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,783
If good, why do I yield
to that suggestion

104
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,034
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair

105
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:18,126
and make my seated heart
knock at my ribs

106
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,870
against the use of nature?

107
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,545
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

108
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,970
If chance will have me king,

109
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:34,019
why, chance may crown me
without my stir.

110
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,148
Hail, Macbeth.

111
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,276
O worthiest cousin.

112
00:17:29,232 --> 00:17:32,661
More is thy due
than more than all can pay.

113
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,584
The service and the loyalty I owe
in doing it pays itself.

114
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,251
From hence to Inverness,
and bind us further to you.

115
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,466
I'll be myself the harbinger

116
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,558
and make joyful the hearing of my wife
with your approach,

117
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,723
so humbly take my leave.

118
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,020
My worthy Cawdor.

119
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,334
"They met me in the day of success

120
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:59,752
"and I have learned
by the perfect'st report

121
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:03,081
"they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

122
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,588
"When I burned in desire
to question them further,

123
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:12,424
"they made themselves air
into which they vanished.

124
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,812
"Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it
came missives from the King

125
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:21,485
"who all-hailed me

126
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,569
"Thane of Cawdor,

127
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,824
"by which title before
these Weird Sisters saluted me

128
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,072
"and referred me
to the coming on of time with,

129
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,746
"'Hail, king that shalt be."'

130
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,875
Come,

131
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,211
you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,

132
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,595
unsex me here

133
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:57,393
and ill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.

134
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:03,106
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

135
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:05,151
you murthering ministers,

136
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:10,201
wherever, in your sightless substances,
you wait on nature's mischief.

137
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,292
Come, thick night,

138
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:20,039
and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell,

139
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,623
that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes,

140
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:26,173
nor heaven peep
through the blanket of the dark

141
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,139
to cry, "Hold, hold!"

142
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:36,012
Hie thee hither
that I may pour my spirits in thine ear

143
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,891
and chastise
with the valour of my tongue

144
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:43,102
all that impedes thee
from the golden round.

145
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:48,177
Thy letters have transported me
beyond this ignorant present

146
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:52,849
and I feel now
the future in the instant.

147
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,017
My dearest love,

148
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,574
Duncan comes here tonight.

149
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,361
And when goes hence?

150
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:14,783
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

151
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,457
O never shall sun that morrow see!

152
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:34,342
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor,

153
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,732
and shalt be what thou art promised.

154
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,739
Yet I do fear thy nature.

155
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,870
It is too full o' the milk
of human kindness

156
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,580
to catch the nearest way.

157
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,253
Thou wouldst be great.

158
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:03,833
Art not without ambition
but without the illness should attend it.

159
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,921
To beguile the time,
look like the time.

160
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:16,392
Bear welcome in your eye,
your hand, your tongue.

161
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:20,724
Look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under't.

162
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:29,201
He that's coming must be provided for

163
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,869
and you shall put this night's
great business into my dispatch

164
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:39,495
which shall,
to all our nights and days to come,

165
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:44,082
give solely sovereign
sway and masterdom.

166
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,972
We will speak further.

167
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:19,164
All our service, in every point
twice done and then done double.

168
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:24,250
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.

169
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:27,676
We love him highly and shall continue
our graces towards him.

170
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,932
By your leave, hostess.

171
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:30,068
My plenteous...

172
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,612
up!

173
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:34,622
Up!

174
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,381
My plenteous joys,

175
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:44,251
wanton in fulness,

176
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:47,380
seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow.

177
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,305
Sons,

178
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,551
kinsmen,

179
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,646
thanes,

180
00:25:57,595 --> 00:26:01,399
and you whose places
are the nearest,

181
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:07,484
know that we will establish our estate
upon our eldest, Malcolm,

182
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:15,830
whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland.

183
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,793
'The Prince of Cumberland.

184
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,592
'That is a step on which I must fall down,
or else o'erleap,

185
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,718
'for in my way it lies.'

186
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,851
If it were done when 'tis done,

187
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,192
then 'twere well
it were done quickly.

188
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,612
If the assassination
could trammel up the consequence

189
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,661
and catch with his surcease success,

190
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,753
that but this blow might be
the be-all and end-all here.

191
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,874
But here upon this bank
and shoal of time

192
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,626
we'd jump the life to come.

193
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,595
Does anybody know
what this is?

194
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,762
But in these cases
we still have judgement here.

195
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,061
That we but teach bloody instructions
which return to plague the inventor.

196
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,055
This even-handed justice commends

197
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,230
the ingredience of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips.

198
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,483
He's here in double trust.

199
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,318
First, as I am
his kinsman and his subject,

200
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,570
strong both against the deed.

201
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,200
Then, as his host, who should
against his murderer shut the door,

202
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,246
not bear the knife myself.

203
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:44,258
Besides, this Duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek,

204
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:47,004
hath been so clear in his great office,

205
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:49,678
that his virtues
would plead like angels,

206
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:53,805
trumpet-tongued against
the deep damnation of his taking-off.

207
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:57,689
I have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent

208
00:27:57,804 --> 00:28:00,276
but only vaulting ambition

209
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,476
which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other.

210
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:39,983
We will proceed no further
in this business.

211
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,397
Was the hope drunk
wherein you dressed yourself?

212
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,578
Hath it slept since?

213
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:53,198
And wakes it now
to look so green and pale

214
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,165
at what it did so freely?

215
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,049
From this time

216
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,215
such I account thy love.

217
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:12,431
Art thou afeard to be the same
in thine own act and valour

218
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:14,223
as thou art in desire?

219
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:19,230
Wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem'st the ornament of life

220
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:21,226
and live a coward in thy own esteem,

221
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:23,980
letting "l dare not" wait upon "I would"?

222
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:26,106
Prithee, peace.

223
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:30,491
I dare do all that may become a man.

224
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,658
VVho dares do more is none.

225
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:39,628
What beast was't, then,

226
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,420
that made you break
this enterprise to me?

227
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:46,216
When you durst do it,
then you were a man.

228
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:50,515
And to be more than what you were,

229
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,010
you would be so much more the man.

230
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:59,479
I have given suck

231
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:04,441
and know how tender 'tis
to love the babe that milks me.

232
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:09,236
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

233
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:12,285
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

234
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:13,747
and dashed the brains out

235
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:17,450
had I so sworn,
as you have done, to this.

236
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,332
If we Should fail?

237
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,599
We fail.

238
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:38,181
But screw your courage
to the sticking place

239
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:41,152
and We'll not fail.

240
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,638
When Duncan is asleep

241
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:14,185
his two chamberlains will I
with wine and wassail so convince

242
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,731
that memory, the warder of the brain,
shall be a-fume

243
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:21,444
and the receipt of reason
a Iimbeck only.

244
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:26,948
When in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death

245
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:30,948
what cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

246
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,825
What not put upon his spongy officers

247
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:37,703
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

248
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:58,766
I am settled

249
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,067
and bend up each corporal agent
to this terrible feat.

250
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:23,041
Take my sword.

251
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,891
Take thee that too.

252
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:53,406
A heavy summons lies
like lead upon me

253
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,793
and yet I would not sleep.

254
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:01,585
Merciful powers,

255
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:06,965
restrain in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

256
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:59,025
Is this a dagger
which I see before me?

257
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,244
The handle toward my hand.

258
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,033
Come,

259
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,374
let me clutch thee.

260
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:30,675
Art thou not, fatal vision,

261
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:33,052
sensible to feeling as to sight?

262
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:40,268
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind?

263
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:46,655
A false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain.

264
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,745
Thou marshall'st me
the way that I was going

265
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,080
and such an instrument I was to use.

266
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,217
Mine eyes are made the fools
o' the other senses.

267
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:11,263
Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still.

268
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,644
There's no such thing.

269
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:24,195
It is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes.

270
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,530
Now, o'er the one half-world,

271
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,619
nature seems dead

272
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:34,664
and wicked dreams abuse
the curtained sleep.

273
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:36,706
Witchcraft celebrates

274
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,831
and withered murder
moves like a ghost.

275
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,975
I see thee yet,

276
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:59,564
in form as palpable
as this which now I draw.

277
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,109
Whiles I threat, he lives.

278
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,324
Words to the heat of deeds
too cold breath gives.

279
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,988
The spring,

280
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,740
the head,

281
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:12,199
the fountain of your blood is stopped.

282
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,290
The very source of it is stopped.

283
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:19,170
Here lies Duncan,

284
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:23,294
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood.

285
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:26,341
There the murderers,

286
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,011
steeped in the colours of their trade.

287
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:38,603
Had I but died
an hour before this chance,

288
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:42,232
I had lived a blessed time.

289
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,365
But from this instant

290
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,327
there's nothing serious in mortality.

291
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:51,787
All is but toys.

292
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,749
Renown and grace is dead.

293
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:01,832
The wine Of life is drawn

294
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:05,417
and the mere Iees is left
this vault to brag of.

295
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,190
Live you?

296
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,772
Or are you aught
that man may question?

297
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,039
I have done the deed.

298
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,718
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

299
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:36,188
They must lie there.

300
00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:13,769
VVhat hands are here?

301
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,656
'They pluck out mine eyes.'

302
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:39,210
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

303
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:42,753
No,

304
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:48,807
this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

305
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,472
making the green one red.

306
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,442
My hands are of your colour,

307
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,781
but I shame to wear a heart so white.

308
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:13,703
A little water clears us of this deed.

309
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,621
How easy is it then.

310
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,173
To know my deed

311
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:24,385
'tvvere best not know myself.

312
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,861
Good Macduff_

313
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,400
Good morrow, noble sir.

314
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,195
Good morrow, both.

315
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:28,694
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?

316
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,281
- The King, is he stirring?
- Not yet.

317
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,034
He did command me
to call timely on him.

318
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,911
I have almost slipped the hour.

319
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:40,830
I'll bring you to him.

320
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:58,979
I'll make So bold to Call.

321
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:11,528
- Goes the King hence today?
- He does; he did appoint so.

322
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,959
The night has been unruly.

323
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:22,675
Where we lay,
our temples were blown down

324
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,212
and, as they say,

325
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:30,048
Iamentings heard in the air,

326
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:33,099
strange screams of death.

327
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:36,642
'Twas a rough night.

328
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:57,753
Confusion now
hath made his masterpiece.

329
00:44:57,868 --> 00:45:00,875
Most sacrilegious murder
hath broke open

330
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,499
the Lord's anointed temple

331
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:06,005
and stole thence
the life of the building.

332
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:08,596
The life?

333
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:10,341
Mean you His Majesty?

334
00:45:10,464 --> 00:45:13,266
Bid me not speak. You see.

335
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:16,396
Speak yourselves.

336
00:45:33,738 --> 00:45:37,451
Awake!

337
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:40,252
Ring the alarum bells!

338
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,668
Malcolm!

339
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,042
Malcolm!

340
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,920
Banquo!

341
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,633
Ring the alarum bells.

342
00:45:49,755 --> 00:45:51,053
Banquo!

343
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,688
Shake off your downy sleep, man.

344
00:45:54,802 --> 00:45:57,809
Death's counterfeit.
You come and look on death itself.

345
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,309
Huh?

346
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:02,233
Murder!

347
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:03,569
Treason!

348
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:24,384
What's the business?

349
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:28,508
Our royal master, he's murdered.

350
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:31,801
Murdered?
Murdered!

351
00:46:31,924 --> 00:46:34,145
Those of his chamber,

352
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:37,061
their hands were all badged with blood.

353
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,411
Wherefore did you so?

354
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:00,129
Hm?

355
00:47:00,245 --> 00:47:03,674
Who could refrain
that had a heart to love

356
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:08,220
and in that heart
courage to make love known?

357
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:40,668
How it does grieve Macbeth.

358
00:47:44,374 --> 00:47:46,675
Did he not straight, in pious rage,

359
00:47:46,794 --> 00:47:49,470
the two delinquents tear

360
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:52,519
that were the slaves of drink?

361
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:55,138
Was this not nobly done?

362
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,855
AY-

363
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,817
'Twould have angered any heart alive
to hear the men deny it.

364
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:02,985
I say he has borne all things well.

365
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,324
Ls't known who did
this more than bloody deed?

366
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:11,363
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

367
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:15,414
Alas, the day.
What good could they pretend?

368
00:48:15,532 --> 00:48:20,167
Malcolm, the King's son,
is stolen away and fled,

369
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:23,339
which puts upon him
suspicion of the deed.

370
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:26,088
'Tis most like
the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

371
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,672
He is already named.

372
00:48:48,274 --> 00:48:50,779
'Thou hast it now.

373
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:53,157
'King, Cawdor,

374
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:55,875
Gmm&

375
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:59,043
'all as the weird women promised.

376
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,623
'And I fear
thou playedst most foully for't.

377
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:06,085
'Yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity.'

378
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:11,174
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

379
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:14,180
If there come truth from them,

380
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:18,606
why, by the verities on thee made good,
may they not be my oracles as well

381
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,310
and set me up in hope?

382
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:28,284
But hush.

383
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,823
No more.

384
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:36,418
Hail, Macbeth.

385
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:39,289
Hail, Macbeth. Hail, Macbeth.

386
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:50,468
Hail, Macbeth.

387
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:48,985
'To be thus...is nothing,

388
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:51,079
'but to be safely thus!

389
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:57,743
'Our fears in Banquo stick deep.'

390
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:03,334
And in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be feared.

391
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,340
'Tis much he dares

392
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,139
and to that dauntless temper
of his mind...

393
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:18,191
...he hath a wisdom
that doth guide his valour.

394
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:32,829
How now, my Lord?
Why do you keep alone?

395
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:36,543
We have scorched the snake,
not killed it.

396
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:42,294
She'll close and be herself

397
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:45,672
whilst our poor malice remains
in danger of her former tooth.

398
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:52,928
Things without all remedy
should be without regard.

399
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:57,518
VVhat's done is done.

400
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:04,945
Come, gentle my Lord.

401
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,366
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

402
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:14,039
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

403
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:28,631
Thou know'st that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives?

404
00:52:31,173 --> 00:52:32,973
You must leave this.

405
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:47,617
He chid the sisters

406
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,819
when tirst they put
the name of king upon me

407
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,572
and bade them speak to him.

408
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:59,793
Then, prophet-like,
they hailed him father to a line of kings.

409
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,922
Upon my head

410
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,009
they placed a fruitless crown

411
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,677
and put a barren sceptre in my grip,

412
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:10,926
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand,

413
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:15,642
no son of mine succeeding.

414
00:53:18,347 --> 00:53:19,851
If it be SO,

415
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:25,730
for Banquo's issue
have I Tiled my mind.

416
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,450
For them

417
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:33,165
the gracious Duncan
have I murdered,

418
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,833
put rancours
in the vessel of my peace

419
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,954
only for them.

420
00:53:40,537 --> 00:53:42,166
To make them kings,

421
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:49,674
the seed of Banquo kings!

422
00:53:52,716 --> 00:53:54,561
VVhat's to be done?

423
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:58,893
Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck,

424
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:01,566
till thou applaud the deed.

425
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:08,076
Full, full of scorpions, is my mind.

426
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,921
Thou marvell'st at my words.

427
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:25,045
Hold thee Still.

428
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:30,429
Things bad begun
make themselves strong by ill.

429
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:37,808
Come, seeling night.

430
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,811
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day

431
00:54:42,935 --> 00:54:47,491
and, with thy bloody and invisible hand,

432
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,829
cancel...

433
00:54:49,943 --> 00:54:53,702
And tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale.

434
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,197
Get up!

435
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:57,099
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,

436
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:01,146
and I'll request your presence.

437
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:04,274
Let Your Highness command upon me
to the which my duties are,

438
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:07,653
with a most indissoluble tie,
forever knit.

439
00:56:16,283 --> 00:56:17,786
Ride you this afternoon?

440
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,210
Ay, my good Lord.

441
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:27,340
We should have else desired
your good advice in this day's council,

442
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:30,508
but we'll take tomorrow.

443
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:35,388
Is't far you ride?

444
00:56:37,054 --> 00:56:40,267
As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper,

445
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,271
go not my horse the better.

446
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:47,952
Fail not our feast.

447
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,285
My Lord, I will not.

448
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:06,298
We hear our bloody cousin
is bestowed in England,

449
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:08,843
not confessing his cruel parricide,

450
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,845
filling his hearers with strange invention.

451
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:20,772
But of that tomorrow.

452
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,443
Hie you to horse.

453
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:27,445
Adieu, till you return at night.

454
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:31,825
Goes Fleance with you?

455
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:45,799
Ay, my good Lord.
Our time does call upon's.

456
00:57:48,504 --> 00:57:50,052
Farewell.

457
00:58:16,783 --> 00:58:18,207
Within this hour, at most,

458
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:21,049
I will advise you
where to plant yourselves,

459
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:26,882
acquaint you with the perfect spy
o' the time the moment on't,

460
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:30,840
for it must be done tonight,
and something from the palace.

461
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,721
Always thought
that I require a clearness.

462
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:39,267
And with him,

463
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,982
to leave no rubs
nor botches in the work,

464
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,650
Fleance, his son
that keeps him company,

465
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:53,410
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father's,

466
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,617
must embrace the fate
of that dark hour.

467
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,691
Fly!

468
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,503
Fly, Fleance! Fly!

469
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:31,928
Hail, Macbeth! Hail, Macbeth!

470
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,099
Hail, Macbeth!

471
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:48,152
You know your own degrees.

472
01:00:48,274 --> 01:00:51,737
Sit down. At first and last,
the hearty welcome.

473
01:01:02,456 --> 01:01:04,005
Our hostess keeps her state

474
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,182
but in best time
we will require her welcome.

475
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:13,886
Pronounce it for me, sir,
to all our friends,

476
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,017
for my heart speaks
they are welcome.

477
01:01:17,138 --> 01:01:18,311
Your Majesty.

478
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:20,772
Be large in mirth, anon,

479
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,564
we'll drink a measure
the table round.

480
01:01:30,903 --> 01:01:32,748
There's blood upon thy face.

481
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:36,577
'Tis Banquo's then.

482
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,129
Is he dispatched?

483
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:41,169
My Lord, his throat is cut.

484
01:01:41,288 --> 01:01:43,167
He's good that did the like for Fleance.

485
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:45,261
If thou didst it,
thou art the nonpareil.

486
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:48,132
Most royal sir,
Fleance is soaped.

487
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,515
Then comes my tit again.

488
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:02,692
I had else been perfect,

489
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,449
whole as the marble,
founded as the rock,

490
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:09,866
as broad and general as the casing air.

491
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,990
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined,

492
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:15,915
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

493
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:18,538
My royal Lord,
you do not give the cheer.

494
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,708
Thanks for that.

495
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:28,590
Sweet FSYTISYTIDFHHCSF!

496
01:02:28,713 --> 01:02:33,097
Now, good digestion wait on appetite

497
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:35,439
and health on both.

498
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:39,516
Here had we now
our country's honour roofed,

499
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,692
were the graced person
of our Banquo present,

500
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:47,530
who may I rather challenge
for unkindness

501
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:49,528
than pity for mischance.

502
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:53,455
His absence, sir,
lays blame upon his promise.

503
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,459
What is't that moves Your Highness?

504
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:13,430
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my good Lord?

505
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:18,729
Thou canst not say that I did it.

506
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,110
His Highness is not well.

507
01:03:24,229 --> 01:03:26,575
Sit, worthy friends.

508
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:31,122
Pray you, keep seat.

509
01:03:31,236 --> 01:03:32,329
The tit is momentary.

510
01:03:32,445 --> 01:03:34,576
Upon a thought he will again be well.

511
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:36,953
If much you note him,
you shall offend him

512
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:39,627
and extend his passion.

513
01:03:39,745 --> 01:03:43,583
Feed and regard him not.

514
01:03:45,834 --> 01:03:47,429
Are you a man?

515
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:54,142
Ay, and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil.

516
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,481
O proper stuff!

517
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:59,351
Prithee, see there.

518
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:03,195
Behold.

519
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:04,940
Look, Io! How say you?

520
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:08,536
This is the very painting of your fear.

521
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:12,113
This is the air-drawn dagger
which you said led you to Duncan.

522
01:04:13,322 --> 01:04:16,249
Why do you make such faces?

523
01:04:19,494 --> 01:04:21,966
If I stand here, I saw him.

524
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:27,717
My worthy Lord,
your noble friends do lack you.

525
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:31,266
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

526
01:04:31,382 --> 01:04:33,637
The time has been that,
when the brains were out,

527
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:35,809
the man would die

528
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:37,557
and there an end.

529
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,109
But now they rise again
and push us from our stools.

530
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:45,362
This is more strange
than such a murder is.

531
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,539
I do forget.

532
01:04:58,619 --> 01:04:59,998
Come.

533
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:02,925
Love and health to all.

534
01:05:06,252 --> 01:05:09,965
Our duties and the pledge.

535
01:05:16,263 --> 01:05:20,852
Avaunt and quit my sight.

536
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:25,150
Let the earth hide thee.

537
01:05:25,272 --> 01:05:28,358
Thy bones are marrowless,
thy blood is cold.

538
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:33,369
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
which thou dost glare with.

539
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,255
Think of this,
good peers...

540
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:43,671
...but as a thing of custom.

541
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:45,636
'Tis no other.

542
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,840
I pray you, sit still.

543
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,907
You make me strange,

544
01:06:09,901 --> 01:06:12,123
even to the disposition that I owe

545
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:17,162
when now I think
you can behold such sights

546
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:23,295
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanched with fear.

547
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:28,137
- What sights, my Lord?
- I pray you, speak not.

548
01:06:28,254 --> 01:06:33,186
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.

549
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:36,558
Stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once.

550
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:39,892
Good night,
and better health attend His Majesty.

551
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:42,066
A kind good-night to all.

552
01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:51,996
It will have blood.

553
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:57,042
They say blood will have blood.

554
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:08,263
What is the night?

555
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:15,386
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

556
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,026
How say'st thou
that Macduff denies his person

557
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:25,320
at our great bidding?

558
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,154
You lack the season of all natures.

559
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:32,618
Sleep.

560
01:07:36,283 --> 01:07:38,584
'I will to the Weird Sisters.

561
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:42,083
'More shall they speak.

562
01:07:42,206 --> 01:07:45,759
'For now I am bent to know
by the worst means the worst.

563
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:51,424
'For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

564
01:07:56,345 --> 01:08:01,026
'I am in blood stepped in so far that,
should I wade no more,

565
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:04,573
'returning were as tedious as go o'er.

566
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:09,655
'Strange things I have in head
that will to hand,

567
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:13,914
'which must be acted
ere they may be scanned.'

568
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:36,181
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
howe'er you come to know it,

569
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,276
SFISWGI' ITIS.

570
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:47,362
Speak, I charge you.

571
01:09:13,926 --> 01:09:16,478
Be lion-mettled, proud,

572
01:09:16,596 --> 01:09:21,232
and take no care who chafes,
who frets, or where conspirers are.

573
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:23,982
Macbeth shall never vanquished be.

574
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,658
Until Great Birnam Wood
to high Dunsinane Hill

575
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:29,403
shall come against him.

576
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:09,119
Beware Macduff.

577
01:10:09,234 --> 01:10:10,909
Beware the Thane of Fife.

578
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:12,702
Dismiss me, enough.

579
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:15,498
- Beware Macduff.
- Beware Macduff.

580
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:18,371
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

581
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:20,042
Beware the Thane of Fife.

582
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:23,670
- Beware the Thane of Fife.
- Beware Macduff.

583
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,966
Beware the Thane of Fife.

584
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:30,678
Be bloody,

585
01:10:32,175 --> 01:10:35,979
bold, and resolute.

586
01:10:39,557 --> 01:10:41,277
Laugh to scorn the power of man,

587
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:47,947
for none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

588
01:11:06,418 --> 01:11:09,392
Then live, Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

589
01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:18,102
But yet I'll make assurance double sure

590
01:11:18,223 --> 01:11:21,070
thou shalt not live.

591
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,438
Saw you the Weird Sisters?

592
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:57,515
No, my Lord.

593
01:11:57,639 --> 01:11:59,518
Came they not by you?

594
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,614
No, indeed, my Lord.

595
01:12:05,981 --> 01:12:08,954
Infected be the air whereon they ride

596
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,198
and damned all those that trust them!

597
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:28,432
'Who was't came by?'

598
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:34,305
'Tis two or three, my Lord,
that bring you word.

599
01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:37,228
Macduff has fled to England.

600
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:46,820
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good Lord.

601
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:51,745
The flighty purpose never is overtook
unless the deed go with it.

602
01:12:54,949 --> 01:12:58,286
The very firstlings of my heart
shall be the Hrstlings of my hand.

603
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,755
Be it thought and done.

604
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:10,634
Hell is murky.

605
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:14,142
VVhat's done cannot be undone.

606
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:22,734
Skirr the country round.

607
01:13:22,853 --> 01:13:25,985
Hang those that talk of fear.

608
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:30,786
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
seize upon Fife,

609
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:33,158
give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes,

610
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:36,288
and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

611
01:13:38,077 --> 01:13:39,830
No boasting like a fool.

612
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,924
This deed I'll do
before this purpose cool.

613
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,314
Murder!

614
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:02,521
Murder!

615
01:14:03,895 --> 01:14:05,274
Murder!

616
01:14:07,858 --> 01:14:12,038
I have done no harm!

617
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:15,247
Murder!

618
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:21,629
Murder!

619
01:14:21,747 --> 01:14:23,045
No!

620
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:26,673
No, please, my babies!

621
01:14:27,837 --> 01:14:29,591
No!

622
01:14:29,714 --> 01:14:32,436
Bring me no more reports.

623
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,475
Let them fly all.

624
01:14:35,428 --> 01:14:39,141
Till Birnam Wood
remove to Dunsinane

625
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:41,441
I cannot taint with fear.

626
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,441
What's the boy Malcolm?

627
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,568
Vvas he not born of woman?

628
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:52,204
The spirits that know
all mortal consequence

629
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,916
have pronounced me thus:

630
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,919
"Fear not, Macbeth.

631
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,795
"No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

632
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,387
Then fly, false thanes,

633
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:12,592
and mingle with the English epicures.

634
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,692
Why are you silent?

635
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:25,025
This tyrant,

636
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:30,367
whose sole name blisters our tongues,

637
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,579
was once thought honest.

638
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:16,482
Now is the time of help.

639
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,363
Your eye in Scotland

640
01:17:21,476 --> 01:17:23,948
would create soldiers,

641
01:17:24,062 --> 01:17:28,743
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses.

642
01:17:30,986 --> 01:17:33,367
Be it their comfort
we are coming thither.

643
01:17:35,408 --> 01:17:37,583
I have words

644
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,708
that would be howled in the desert air

645
01:17:41,915 --> 01:17:44,545
where hearing should not latch them.

646
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:50,806
My ever gentle cousin.

647
01:17:50,924 --> 01:17:53,179
Stands Scotland where it did?

648
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:55,398
Alas, poor country,

649
01:17:55,512 --> 01:17:57,562
it's almost afraid to know itself.

650
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,404
It cannot be called our mother
but our graves.

651
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,662
What's our newest grief?

652
01:18:12,863 --> 01:18:16,542
Let not your ears despise my tongue
which shall possess them

653
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:19,541
with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard.

654
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,931
How does my wife?

655
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:31,681
Your castle is surprised,

656
01:18:34,385 --> 01:18:38,440
your wife and babes
savagely slaughtered.

657
01:18:47,733 --> 01:18:49,578
What man, hm?

658
01:18:52,613 --> 01:18:53,832
V\/hat man?

659
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,465
My children too?

660
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:09,636
Wife, children, servants,

661
01:19:09,756 --> 01:19:11,385
all that Could be found.

662
01:19:23,145 --> 01:19:25,867
He has no children!

663
01:19:31,779 --> 01:19:34,992
All my pretty chickens

664
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:36,916
and their dam,

665
01:19:39,996 --> 01:19:41,966
in one fell swoop?

666
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:51,305
Dispute it like a man.

667
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,262
Oh...

668
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:59,310
Oh, I will do so.

669
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:04,858
But I will also feel it as a man.

670
01:20:09,735 --> 01:20:11,739
Sinful Macduff!

671
01:20:13,823 --> 01:20:16,625
They were all struck for thee.

672
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:20,792
Be this the whetstone of your sword.

673
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:23,715
Let grief convert to anger.

674
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,464
Blunt not the heart, enrage it.

675
01:20:28,129 --> 01:20:32,343
Gracious England hath lent us
ten thousand men.

676
01:20:32,467 --> 01:20:34,518
Our power is ready.

677
01:20:34,636 --> 01:20:37,016
Our lack is nothing but our leave.

678
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:43,199
Front to front

679
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:47,241
you bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself,

680
01:20:47,358 --> 01:20:50,946
and within my sword's length
you set him.

681
01:20:58,536 --> 01:21:01,007
If he scape,

682
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:02,967
heaven forgive him too.

683
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:22,857
'Great Dunsinane
he strongly fortifies.

684
01:21:24,772 --> 01:21:26,025
'Some say he's mad.

685
01:21:28,066 --> 01:21:29,911
'Others, lesser, that hate him

686
01:21:30,027 --> 01:21:32,283
'do call it valiant fury.'

687
01:21:34,615 --> 01:21:37,292
But, for certain,

688
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:41,294
he cannot buckle his distempered cause
within the belt of rule.

689
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,181
Those he commands

690
01:21:47,295 --> 01:21:49,551
move only in command.

691
01:21:51,591 --> 01:21:53,391
'Nothing in love.

692
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:56,439
'Now does he feel

693
01:21:57,431 --> 01:22:00,688
'his secret murders
sticking on his hands]

694
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:42,859
Yet here's a spot.

695
01:22:45,982 --> 01:22:48,203
Out, damned spot!

696
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,285
Out, I say!

697
01:22:54,782 --> 01:22:56,627
Hell is murky.

698
01:23:00,747 --> 01:23:02,376
Fie, my Lord!

699
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:04,669
Fie!

700
01:23:06,211 --> 01:23:08,557
A soldier and afearcl?

701
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:13,935
What need we fear
who knows it

702
01:23:14,052 --> 01:23:16,854
when none can
call our power to account?

703
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:23,318
Yet who would have thought

704
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:26,944
the old man to have had
so much blood in him?

705
01:23:33,948 --> 01:23:36,955
The Thane Of Fife had a wife.

706
01:23:39,746 --> 01:23:41,591
Where is she now?

707
01:23:47,003 --> 01:23:48,005
What?

708
01:23:50,257 --> 01:23:52,933
VVill these hands ne'er be clean?

709
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,311
No more o' that, my Lord.

710
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,229
No more o' that.

711
01:24:03,646 --> 01:24:05,776
You mar all with this starting.

712
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:17,621
Here's the smell of the blood still.

713
01:24:20,663 --> 01:24:25,094
All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.

714
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,445
Wash your hands.

715
01:24:42,394 --> 01:24:44,649
Put on your nightgown.

716
01:24:46,023 --> 01:24:48,027
Look not so pale.

717
01:24:49,944 --> 01:24:51,037
To bed.

718
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:53,908
To bed.

719
01:24:57,952 --> 01:25:00,333
There's knocking at the gate.

720
01:25:05,168 --> 01:25:06,170
Come.

721
01:25:07,921 --> 01:25:10,017
Come.

722
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:13,105
Come, come,
give me your hand.

723
01:25:16,263 --> 01:25:19,145
VVhat's done cannot be undone.

724
01:25:19,725 --> 01:25:21,570
To bed.

725
01:25:23,186 --> 01:25:24,610
To bed.

726
01:25:30,569 --> 01:25:32,198
To bed.

727
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:12,705
To bed.

728
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,544
To bed.

729
01:26:19,495 --> 01:26:21,124
To bed.

730
01:26:46,983 --> 01:26:50,571
The devil damn thee black,
thou cream-faced Icon.

731
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:53,417
Where got'st thou that goose look?

732
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:54,749
There's ten thousand.

733
01:26:55,867 --> 01:26:57,496
Geese, villain?

734
01:26:57,619 --> 01:26:59,794
Soldiers, sir.

735
01:27:01,414 --> 01:27:03,966
Go, prick thy face
and over-red thy fear,

736
01:27:04,084 --> 01:27:05,758
thou lily-Iivered boy.

737
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:09,550
What soldiers, patch?

738
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:13,385
The English force, so please you.

739
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:19,517
Hang out our banners
on the outward walls.

740
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:24,782
The cry is still, "They come!"

741
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:32,952
Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

742
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:38,670
Here let them lie

743
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:41,669
till famine and the ague eat them up.

744
01:27:56,513 --> 01:27:58,267
Doctor.

745
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:02,818
The thanes fly from me.

746
01:28:06,148 --> 01:28:09,361
What rhubarb, cyme
or what purgative drug

747
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,535
would scour these English hence?

748
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:13,033
Hear'st thou of them?

749
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:15,912
Ay, my good Lord.

750
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:19,371
Your royal preparation
makes us hear something.

751
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:22,628
If thou couldst, Doctor,

752
01:28:22,749 --> 01:28:25,470
cast the water of my land,
find her disease

753
01:28:25,586 --> 01:28:28,057
and purge it
to a sound and pristine health.

754
01:28:30,341 --> 01:28:33,348
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again.

755
01:28:37,098 --> 01:28:41,107
The Queen, my Lord, is dead.

756
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:10,768
She should have died hereafter.

757
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:15,857
There would have been a time
for such a word.

758
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:26,609
Tomorrow,

759
01:29:32,196 --> 01:29:34,292
and tomorrow,

760
01:29:37,952 --> 01:29:40,378
and tomorrow

761
01:29:42,999 --> 01:29:47,089
creeps in this petty pace
from day to day

762
01:29:49,714 --> 01:29:52,596
to the last syllable of recorded time.

763
01:29:56,430 --> 01:30:00,736
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

764
01:30:08,151 --> 01:30:09,495
Out.

765
01:30:10,945 --> 01:30:13,827
Out, brief candle.

766
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:19,003
Life's but a walking shadow,

767
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,965
a poor player

768
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:25,215
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

769
01:30:25,335 --> 01:30:27,135
and then is heard no more.

770
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:32,603
It is a tale told by an idiot,

771
01:30:33,969 --> 01:30:35,894
full of sound and fury,

772
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,068
signifying nothing.

773
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:46,446
VVhat is that noise?

774
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:49,321
It is the cry of women, my good Lord.

775
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:57,037
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

776
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,960
The time has been

777
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:06,010
my senses would have cooled
to hear a night-shriek

778
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,885
and my fell of hair

779
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:13,720
would, at a dismal treatise,
rouse and stir

780
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:15,598
as life were in't.

781
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:25,904
I have supped full with horrors.

782
01:31:26,024 --> 01:31:28,404
Direness, familiar
to my slaughterous thoughts,

783
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:30,496
Cal'\l'1Ot OnCe Start me.

784
01:31:41,998 --> 01:31:44,095
Thy story, quickly.

785
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,214
Gracious my Lord,

786
01:31:49,214 --> 01:31:51,766
I should report that which I say I saw,

787
01:31:55,304 --> 01:31:57,149
but know not how to do it.

788
01:32:06,607 --> 01:32:07,609
Seyton!

789
01:32:08,818 --> 01:32:11,165
I am sick at heart when I behold.

790
01:32:12,072 --> 01:32:14,076
Seyton, I say!

791
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:26,715
This push will chair me ever

792
01:32:28,171 --> 01:32:30,142
or dis-seat me now.

793
01:32:42,228 --> 01:32:44,107
I have lived long enough.

794
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:49,405
My way of life is fallen into the sere,

795
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:55,076
the yellow leaf.

796
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:59,624
And that which should
accompany old age as...

797
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:04,629
_uhonoun

798
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:06,175
love,

799
01:33:07,588 --> 01:33:08,886
obedience,

800
01:33:09,006 --> 01:33:10,635
troops of friends,

801
01:33:14,387 --> 01:33:16,312
I must not look to have,

802
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:20,819
but, in their stead,

803
01:33:23,271 --> 01:33:24,774
curses,

804
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:30,492
not loud,

805
01:33:30,612 --> 01:33:34,415
but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

806
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:41,290
which the poor heart would fain deny
and dare not.

807
01:33:46,128 --> 01:33:47,130
Seyton.

808
01:33:48,297 --> 01:33:50,722
All is confirmed, my Lord,
which was reported.

809
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:56,014
I'll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked.

810
01:33:56,138 --> 01:33:59,145
- Give me my armour.
- 'Tis not needed yet.

811
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:00,861
I'll put it on!

812
01:34:51,363 --> 01:34:54,415
And now a wood
comes toward Dunsinane.

813
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:02,174
Ring the alarum bell.

814
01:35:04,126 --> 01:35:09,092
Arm, arm, and out!

815
01:35:14,428 --> 01:35:18,983
Tyrant, show thy face!

816
01:35:26,775 --> 01:35:29,782
There is nor Hying hence
nor tarrying here.

817
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:33,249
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun

818
01:35:33,364 --> 01:35:35,916
and wish the estate o' the world
were now undone.

819
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:38,330
Blow, wind.

820
01:35:38,453 --> 01:35:41,209
Come, wrack.

821
01:35:42,207 --> 01:35:44,883
At least we'll die
with harness on our back.

822
01:35:49,006 --> 01:35:51,352
'They have tied me to a stake.

823
01:35:51,466 --> 01:35:54,018
'I cannot fly.

824
01:35:54,136 --> 01:35:57,143
'But, bear-like,
I must Tight the course.

825
01:35:59,266 --> 01:36:02,113
'VVhat's he that was not born of woman?

826
01:36:02,895 --> 01:36:05,868
'Such a one am I to fear, or none.

827
01:36:05,981 --> 01:36:10,196
'Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword?'

828
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:14,751
Whiles I see lives,
the gashes do better upon them.

829
01:36:15,701 --> 01:36:17,626
Turn, hellhound.

830
01:36:17,744 --> 01:36:19,042
Turn.

831
01:36:25,085 --> 01:36:28,298
Of all men else
I have avoided thee.

832
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:30,017
But get thee back.

833
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:33,646
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

834
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:36,481
I have no words.

835
01:36:38,307 --> 01:36:40,186
My voice is in my sword.

836
01:37:01,373 --> 01:37:03,002
Thou Iosest Iabou r.

837
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:07,636
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress

838
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:09,976
SS make me bleed.

839
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:34,645
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.

840
01:38:35,471 --> 01:38:38,444
I bear a charmed life

841
01:38:38,558 --> 01:38:41,815
which must not yield
to one of woman born.

842
01:38:41,936 --> 01:38:44,533
Despair thy charm

843
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:50,201
and let the angel
whom thou still hast served tell thee

844
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:55,580
Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

845
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,226
Accursed be the tongue
that tells me so,

846
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:25,906
for it hath cowed
my better part of man.

847
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:33,496
I'll not Tight with thee.

848
01:40:20,121 --> 01:40:22,172
Then yield thee, coward,

849
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,338
and live to be
the show and gaze of the time.

850
01:40:31,217 --> 01:40:35,648
I will have thee,
as our rarer monsters are,

851
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:42,234
painted upon a pole,

852
01:40:44,689 --> 01:40:46,318
and Ul'ldl\Nfitl

853
01:40:48,235 --> 01:40:51,037
"Here may you see the tyrant,

854
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:54,873
"Macbeth ."

855
01:41:11,884 --> 01:41:13,388
I will not yield

856
01:41:14,262 --> 01:41:17,724
to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet

857
01:41:19,851 --> 01:41:22,903
and to be baited
with the rabble's curse.

858
01:41:28,568 --> 01:41:31,370
Though Birnam Wood
be come to Dunsinane

859
01:41:32,572 --> 01:41:34,747
and thou opposed,

860
01:41:34,866 --> 01:41:37,122
being of no woman born,

861
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:45,013
yet I will try the last.

862
01:41:51,676 --> 01:41:55,435
Before my body
I throw my warlike shield.

863
01:42:02,103 --> 01:42:03,822
Lay on, Macduff.

864
01:42:07,525 --> 01:42:12,240
And damned be him
that first cries,

865
01:42:12,363 --> 01:42:17,044
"Hold, enough!"

866
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:54,604
He's worth more sorrow,
and that I'll spend for him.

867
01:43:56,347 --> 01:43:58,067
He's worth no more.

868
01:44:00,018 --> 01:44:01,020
Hail,

869
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:10,364
King of Scotland!

870
01:44:12,948 --> 01:44:16,627
Hail, King of Scotland!

871
01:44:16,743 --> 01:44:19,716
Hail, King of Scotland!
