1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,840
-What's the matter?
-There's too many of them.

2
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
-What happened?
-I don't know.

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
So, you got it?

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Where do we meet the others?

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,840
We're the only ones Ieft.

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,840
We're the only ones left.

7
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Take this and get out of here
as fast as you can.

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll stop them.
I'll make sure to stop them.

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Run.

10
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Why do we always forget
what it's like to feel something?

11
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Isn't that strange?

12
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,840
That we never learn about feelings.

13
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Where is it?

14
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
The box. Where is it?

15
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Where is it?

16
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,840
The storm hit Gotland with
enormous force three hours ago-

17
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
-and is said to be growing. Major
damage has ben inflicted on Visby.

18
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Many people are reported dead
and hundreds missing.

19
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,840
The numbers are hard to confirm,
due to lack of communication.

20
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,840
The storm now seems to be
moving towards Stockholm.

21
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Damn, they're really going at it.

22
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Slow down, so Janne doesn't
come too soon - he usually does.

23
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Careful!

24
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Way to go, Janne. Enjoy it now,
that excitement will fade soon.

25
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Don't get me wrong. l like
the idea of love and closeness.

26
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Sad movies actually make me cry.
Just as an example.

27
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Vut what deos love really mean?

28
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Shared independence,
shared economy, shared custody.

29
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,840
''A real man takes care of himself'',
like Dad used to say.

30
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
And how do you accomplish that?

31
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Instead of lots of drinks
and an embarassing morning-

32
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
-I commit
this kind of girl to memory.

33
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,840
So you keep partying, and
retrieve her when you get home-

34
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
-and want to have a good time.

35
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,840
''Ich komme gleich!!''

36
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Look, farmers.

37
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Here's a confession.:
I'm from the countryside.

38
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
From Vänersborg.
Also known as ''Little Paris''.

39
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
WELCOME TO VÄNERSBORG
''LITTLE PARIS''

40
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,840
In a Swedish Small Town,
you have time for the good things-

41
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
-and you care about each other.

42
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,840
But what's under the surface
will cut you.

43
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,840
The ultimate punishment would be
moving back there - to Envytown.

44
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
-Hey there, Knugen.
-Hey, man.

45
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Que pasa? Hold on.
- Hi, Malin.

46
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
-Where's that article?
-Tomorrow.

47
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Malin is my boss
at the free listings monthly.

48
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
She's got silicone tits and does
a furniture salesman on the side.

49
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,840
A brute who told me
she loves it up the ass.

50
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Every time I see her,
it's the only thing I can think of.

51
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
-By tomorrow!
-Sure. Can I get an advance?

52
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Call me. Take this, you'll need it.

53
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,840
-I'm back.
-You coming to Oblivion tonight?

54
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Oh, you bet.

55
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,840
-Marlboro Lits, there you go.
-They're called ''Lights''.

56
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,840
-I have a poem for you.
-Great. Culture!!

57
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,840
-''You will always remember me...''
-Listen, girl. Shut up.

58
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,840
I've got to get going.
Time is money. - See ya!

59
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
One strong mojito.

60
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
This guy thinks I'm a food writer.

61
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
So he treats me to everything.
Fine by me.

62
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I read your thing about the
death of clubs. Really good.

63
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
It was touching, important somehow.

64
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
-What an idiot.
-So, what else are you doing?

65
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,840
-What are you writing about?
-Celebrity movie premieres.

66
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Like this one. Free movie, Estonian
liquor, hot babes. Great gig.

67
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,840
The next thing isn't nearly as great.
I'm writing about computer gamers.

68
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Seriously. Pixellated characters
searching for some Grail.

69
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,840
-How any adult can...
-Damn it! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

70
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,840
It's alright. I didn't feel a thing.

71
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I haven't felt skin sensations
since I was a kid. It's fine.

72
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
-You really don't feel a thing?
-Nope.

73
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,840
I didn't feel it. I haven't felt skin
sensations since I was a kid.

74
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,840
-This one's on me.
-What do I want from life?

75
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Except for the obvious.:
opening a rum bar in Cuba.

76
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Yeah, well...
What do you want from life?

77
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
There you go.
It's not really all that easy.

78
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,840
All of Visby!
Can you grasp that? I can't.

79
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Bombay, ChiIe or San Francisco
makes sense. My sister lives there.

80
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,840
What if the storm hits here?
Stay inside.

81
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,840
No electricity.
No TV, stereo, nothing.

82
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,840
I guess you play
the recorder instead.

83
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,840
-Play the recorder!
-Right. My kids play that.

84
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,840
A summer psalm on the recorder.
Damn, that's touching.

85
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,840
-Here's the news. Quiet now.
-And now an extra bulletin.

86
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
The powerful storm that
recently struck Gotland has ended.

87
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Storm winds ran as high
as 1 10 miles per hour.

88
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Upon reaching Stockholm,
it dissipated and died out.

89
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Reports from Gotland...

90
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Drive! Drive!

91
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Drive!

92
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,840
A storm comes and then
just disappears, or does it?

93
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Can something just appear out of
nowhere, and then just disappear?

94
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,840
As we know,
energy can only be transformed.

95
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Hi, Knugen. Not a probIem.

96
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Something weird just happened
to me, so I wanted to go home.

97
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,840
No, I really don't feel like it.
I can't be bothered, Knugen.

98
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I'll just stay home,
jack off and drink too much.

99
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Yeah, we'll see. Alright. Bye.

100
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
-Hello.
-Hello...

101
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Can I come in?

102
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Sure, come on in.
Sit down.

103
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
-Has anyone else been here?
-If anyone's been here?

104
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Tonight, Donny.
Did you get something?

105
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,840
How the hell do you know my name?

106
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Because I
know everything about you.

107
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,840
-Promise.
-What?

108
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,840
-That's my name.
-Wow. Cool.

109
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I have to tell you something.
What happened in the car earlier...

110
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,840
-The crazies. What was that about?
-They think I've stolen something.

111
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
-They think so?
-Yes, they do.

112
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,840
-And...?
-And I have.

113
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Yeah? So, what have you stolen?

114
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,840
It's the...the Holy Grail!

115
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Or maybe it's the Mona Lisa?
Some Nazi artifact?

116
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,840
-You haven't received anything?
-No, I haven't.

117
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
And nobody's been here?
Then this is what we'll do.

118
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,840
-If I don't come back...
-Yes?

119
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,840
...I want you to take this.

120
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Make your way here.

121
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
-Do it.
-Okay...

122
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Do it.

123
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Bye now.

124
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Hi, you've reached DD.
Leave a mess...age.

125
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
It's not here.

126
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,840
-Hi, Donny.
-Hi.

127
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,840
-Did you have a party?
-No.

128
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,840
-What do you want?
-I wanted to check...

129
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,840
-...if you'll be coming along.
-Where to?

130
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
-To the graveyard.
-Now?

131
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Yes.

132
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Do you think it's too late?
It is too late. Much too late.

133
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Or is it?

134
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,840
-It's too late.
-Okay.

135
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,840
-I'm sorry. Good bye.
-Good bye.

136
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,840
-It's dark in the hallway.
-The red button turns the lights on.

137
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,840
-Will it last? Because creepers...
-AII the way to the front door.

138
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Nothing to worry about, bro.

139
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Jesus...

140
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Excuse me.
This game here, what is that?

141
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Storm.

142
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,840
-Can you meet her?
-Meet who?

143
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,840
-Her, right there.
-Yeah, right.

144
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Oh, great. Another one.

145
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Why don't you
tell your friend... Hey!

146
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Tell Promise that I don't want to
be part of your game any more.

147
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
-Take this.
-I'm about to go to the cops.

148
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,840
-Take it.
-What is it?

149
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,840
It's... If you lose it,
that's the end of it all.

150
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,840
-What is it?
-The key.

151
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,840
-The key?
-Yes.

152
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,840
To everything.

153
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm sure that's great if you're
a pimply teenager, but...

154
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,840
What the hell?

155
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Hey, Donny. Do you have an invite?

156
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Rum. A double shot.

157
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,840
-Drinking to forget?
-What?

158
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,840
This looks like the beginning of one
hell of a night. What do you say?

159
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Sure.

160
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
What a pig.

161
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,840
DD! Hey there. Here's your boss.

162
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,840
-He's here!
-How are you?

163
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,840
-I'm good. Real good.
-Great. Are you joining us?

164
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
-Yeah, what a great idea.
-What are you, stupid?

165
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Yeah, sure. Of course.

166
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Hey, it ain't free. Settle down.

167
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,840
-You know I'm marrying Thomas?
-Yeah, you and Stefan.

168
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Cut it out, we're having a Christmas
wedding. You're just jealous.

169
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
-That'll be lovely.
-Maybe in the archipelago?

170
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,840
-Something weird just happened.
-Damn, that sucks.

171
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I mean it. Seriously.
It was really...

172
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,840
This is serious.
Look at that face, those lines.

173
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It was really fucking scary.

174
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,840
-This is taking too long.
-You have a point there.

175
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Wait! Don't touch it.

176
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,840
If you're in bad mood, and you've
had scary things happen, then...

177
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Back me up on this, he should start.

178
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
-He's starting.
-DD starts the party.

179
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,840
Of course.
But, hey...Thomas and I feel...

180
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,840
God damn,
you were really aching for it.

181
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Will you come to the wedding?
Will you be there?

182
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Drop the wedding talk.
Save that for Stefan.

183
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,840
-You too.
-I love it.

184
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Hello? Excuse me? Hello.

185
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,840
I would like to file a complaint.

186
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
-And what is your name?
-Donny. Davidsson.

187
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Alright, Donny.
And what is your ID number?

188
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
ID number?

189
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Here's a picture
that was in the printer.

190
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,840
It fell out, so I picked it up.

191
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,840
What was the complaint
you wanted to file?

192
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
AIright, kid. What was
the complaint you wanted to fiIe?

193
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
ID number?

194
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,840
-And your name?
-Donny!

195
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,840
ID number!

196
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,840
ID number?

197
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,840
-I just need to go to the bathroom.
-Hey, kid. Hey!

198
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Stop!

199
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Police! Stop!

200
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Alright, kid. What was
the complaint you wanted to file?

201
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,840
-I'm just going to the bathroom.
-Go ahead.

202
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Hey!

203
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Oh, right. Thanks.

204
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Fuck!

205
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Vasse. Vasse!

206
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Pick it up for DD.
Pick up the goddamned phone.

207
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
-John, John, John...
-John here.

208
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Hey, DD here. I'm running low
on batteries, and I need your help.

209
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Hello? God fucking damn it!

210
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
-Hi!
-Hello.

211
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,840
-How are you?
-Funhouse, Akira, Phantasm 2.

212
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
-What?
-Funhouse, Akira, Phantasm 2.

213
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,840
I lent them to you seven months ago.
You're here to return them, right?

214
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,840
-Well, no...but...
-You're not here to return them?

215
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,840
-Jeppon!
-So what the hell do you want?

216
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,840
I wanted to say hello.
Drink some tea, play some games...

217
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
I don't have any goddamned tea!

218
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Oh, come on, Jeppon!

219
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,840
-So they didn't know it was you?
-Hey, it wasn't me!

220
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,840
-I mean, I didn't do it.
-But in the picture the cops had...

221
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Yeah, but I didn't kill her.
I'lll borrow this one.

222
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,840
-Now what do you want to do?
-What?

223
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,840
What do you want?
You didn't come here to drink tea.

224
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,840
-Can I stay here overnight?
-Sure.

225
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Thank you.

226
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
As soon as you return Funhouse,
Akira and Phantasm 2.

227
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,840
-Are you joking?
-Am I?

228
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Come.

229
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Run.

230
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Did you get it?
Do this, or it won't stop bleeding.

231
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,840
-Did you get it? The box.
-Yes. Hold on. Here it is.

232
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,840
-Good. They want you, Donny.
-What?

233
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,840
The people chasing me on the street.
They want you.

234
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
-Why?
-I can't explain now.

235
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,840
AII the answers are in here,
in the box. Wait...

236
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,840
-You got some blood on you...
-How did that feel?

237
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,840
-You have to tell me how it felt.
-Why?

238
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Because I have to know.
Did you feel anything?

239
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Ever since I was a kid,
I've felt no skin sensations, so...

240
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:27,840
-So you didn't feel anything?
-No, I...what the...

241
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Could you please explain to me
what all this is about?

242
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
It's about you.

243
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Listen to me. It's time, Donny.
Go back to where it happened.

244
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Look for the source. If you find it,
you will be able to open the box.

245
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
-Do you understand me?
-No. What was I supposed to do?

246
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Go back to where everything began.

247
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Okay. I'm going back there. Okay...

248
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,840
-So, how do I get there?
-Like this.

249
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Hello?

250
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Hello?

251
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Hello! Can anybody hear me?

252
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,840
The liquor store. There's got to
be someone at the liquor store.

253
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
There has to be someone there.

254
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Hello?

255
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Is there anybody here?

256
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,840
HOME OF THE
DAVIDSSON FAMILY

257
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Hello?

258
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Mom?

259
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Dad?

260
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Little brother?

261
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,840
YOU WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER ME
FEEL ME

262
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Okay...

263
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
So, what do you want?

264
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
THERE'S
TOO MANY OF THEM!

265
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,840
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-I DON'T KNOW.

266
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,840
WHERE DO WE
MEET THE OTHERS?

267
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,840
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT...

268
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,840
SEEK THE SOURCE,
AND I'LL GRAB THE BOX!

269
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Okay... Hopscotch.

270
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:34,840
Hello. Is either one of you
interested in some sleeping pills?

271
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Huh?

272
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,840
Sleep tight, little boys.

273
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Have a taste of this.

274
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,840
-He can't open the box without me.
-Which is why you must die.

275
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,840
-You don't know what it contains.
-That is correct.

276
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,840
That doesn't bother me.

277
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Unlike me, you seem to have
a burning desire to solve this.

278
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,840
But just to amuse me...
Tell me what the box contains.

279
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,840
-A memory.
-A memory...

280
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,840
A memory is
the true content of the box.

281
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,840
What do you know?

282
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,840
It's time for me to retire.

283
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,840
This will be our Iast farewell.

284
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,840
Farewell.

285
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:37,840
But if he finds the memory,
you can kiss everything goodbye.

286
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,840
TO BE CONTINUED...

287
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Helena?

288
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,840
DD?

289
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Hey, se´norita. I got some water.
Do you have a lighter?

290
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Over there in the silver-colored box.

291
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
-Here?
-Yeah, there.

292
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,840
-You want some?
-I prefer it rolled.

293
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,840
-So, you've smoked a lot?
-Some.

294
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,840
-What kind is it?
-Fag's Brother.

295
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,840
-Fag's Brother?
-Yeah.

296
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,840
You know the fag
who cuts people's hair on TV?

297
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,840
-Timo...something.
-Timo Rajala.

298
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,840
-So, he grows pot?
-No, his brother does.

299
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
-Hence the name, Helena.
-Fag's Brother.

300
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:36,840
A gold star for you. Have some.
Hold your thumb over the hole.

301
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,840
I wrote something for you.

302
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Really? That's nice.

303
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,840
I was just thinking...
Could we try something?

304
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,840
-Sure.
-If you couId get on all fours.

305
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,840
-Now?
-Yeah, now.

306
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Don't you
want to hear what I wrote first?

307
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,840
Of course I do, but I just...

308
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,840
How about you get on all fours first?

309
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,840
-Okay.
-Nice.

310
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,840
-Like this?
-Perfect. Don't look at me.

311
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,840
Look at the wall. Or the pink poodle.

312
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Now, slowly pull
your skirt up over your ass.

313
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,840
Don't turn around.
Look at the pink poodle.

314
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Slowly pull your skirt up,
over your ass.

315
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,840
-Helena.
-Yes.

316
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Pull it up.

317
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,840
-Can you pull your panties down?
-Yes.

318
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,840
You look so nice, Helena.

319
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Does that feel good? Good.

320
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,840
-Have you been thinking about me?
-Yes.

321
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:56,840
I've been thinking about you too.
You look so nice.

322
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Ow! Stop.

323
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,840
No!

324
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,840
No... DD!

325
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,840
DD! It hurts, stop it.

326
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,840
It hurts. Ow! Ow!

327
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,840
Stop it. Stop it!

328
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,840
DD.

329
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
DD.

330
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Hello...

331
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,840
How...how are you doing?

332
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,840
-Do you recognize me?
-Of course I do.

333
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,840
-Of course. You're Helena...Helena.
-No.

334
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,840
No, I mean: do you recognize me?

335
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Don't you remember me?

336
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Right. That's me.

337
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,840
A lot of people would say
that you raped me.

338
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,840
What's the matter?

339
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Can't move?

340
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:28,840
Is it almost as if...you're frozen?

341
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,840
You look so nice.

342
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,840
You're nervous...

343
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,840
You know what?

344
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,840
What you sow...grows.

345
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:11,840
My name is Helena Jacobsson,
and I am 14 years old.

346
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,840
And I Iove you.

347
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,840
But now I am going to
hurt you a whole lot.

348
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,840
You've started remembering.

349
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,840
Started remembering?

350
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
Go deeper.

351
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Ronny!
Where are you going with that?

352
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:16,840
-What do you think?
-Don't be a smart aleck.

353
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,840
-Ronny. Ronny!
-Yeah?

354
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,840
-Want to see something cool?
-What?

355
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,840
You'll see.

356
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,840
It's a litte scary, so
I shouId check it myseIf first.

357
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,840
-I'm not afraid.
-Are you sure? Come on.

358
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:07,840
You know what happens if you
go in there? You don't age.

359
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,840
-What do you mean?
-You never grow up.

360
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,840
You don't change.

361
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,840
-How do you know that?
-I was here yesterday.

362
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,840
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

363
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,840
-How do you know it works?
-I just know, okay?

364
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Don't you dare?

365
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I knew you'd chicken out.
That's just like you.

366
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,840
-I'm not chickening out.
-What do you call it?

367
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,840
-Chicken.
-Cut it out.

368
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,840
Well, get on in there. Go in.

369
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Go. Get in there.

370
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,840
Go in further. It's awesome.

371
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Oh, right. Ronny? Watch out
for the creepers on the floor. Bye.

372
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:14,840
Donny! Come back and open up!

373
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Donny!

374
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,840
Donny! Open up!

375
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,840
-Ronny!
-Ronny!

376
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
Hello!

377
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
Hello!

378
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,840
Donny.

379
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,840
Little brother...

380
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,840
I watched out for the creepers,
like you said.

381
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,840
But I think they'll be here soon.

382
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,840
Hey...

383
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Who...

384
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Who were the flowers for?

385
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,840
-Don't you remember?
-Is this because I forgot?

386
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,840
How can you forget
something like that?

387
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,840
How can you forget
something like what?

388
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Don't you remember who died?

389
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,840
Don't you remember who died?

390
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:25,840
Don't you remember who died?

391
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,840
-Where are we?
-Where you really want to be.

392
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,840
Why is this happening to me?

393
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Because you
were starting to become cold.

394
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,840
I think your time has come now.
Time to open the box.

395
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Don't listen to her.

396
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,840
-She's a liar.
-Do not believe a word he says.

397
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,840
Listen to me. I understand that it's
difficult to grasp what's going on.

398
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:57,840
And you are...what? The other side?

399
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,840
The other side?
That's right - I am the other side.

400
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,840
The other side of her, but not you.
That's what's important.

401
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,840
-Don't listen to him.
-You really should listen to me.

402
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,840
We'll take it from the beginning.
What's happened here?

403
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,840
You Iead a pretty good life,
until she showed up.

404
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:21,840
Then things turned weird. Those are
facts, things we know happened.

405
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,840
Knowing this,
how can you be so sure-

406
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,840
-that she's the one who
wants to help you, and not me?

407
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,840
She's playing with you. Don't you
see? Did she do the childhood bit?

408
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Did you? - Something where you
hit or hurt someone, did something.

409
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,840
Maybe raped someone.
Listen to me: you didn't do it.

410
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,840
She wants you to believe
you've done things you never did.

411
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,840
She wants you to think
you're bad, but you're not.

412
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
You are not a bad person.

413
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,840
She's manipulating you.
I mean, just look at all this.

414
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,840
Are we in Cuba? Maybe not.
Maybe you're in Vänersborg.

415
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,840
Or maybe we're in Cuba.
Or at your house.

416
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:27,840
Or in Vänersborg, or Cuba.
DD, listen to me.

417
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,840
How do I put this? A few days ago,
you were a strong guy.

418
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Going your own way,
making your own decisions.

419
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,840
Didn't care what others thought,
you were your own...

420
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,840
Could you please stop
interrupting me and just let us...

421
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,840
Just let me and DD
have a conversation.

422
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,840
DD, you were a real human being.

423
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,840
Now you're changing into
some low-calorie version.

424
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,840
-A low-fat item. Know what I mean?
-Keep talking.

425
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,840
The only thing I'm asking of you-

426
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,840
-is that you keep living your life
as you've always done.

427
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,840
The end.

428
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,840
-Is that what you want?
-Don't open that box.

429
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,840
If you do it, you will disappear.

430
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Okay. In that case,
I want you to tell me something.

431
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Absolutely. Anything you want.

432
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Who died?

433
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,840
Believe me, DD.
I'd do it, if I could.

434
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,840
Promise, don't take this
the wrong way...

435
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Good old StockhoIm.

436
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,840
It worked. Damn it, it worked.

437
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,840
-What's happened?
-I had an accident.

438
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,840
-Come with me. How are you doing?
-I'm fine. How are you?

439
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,840
Fine, thank you.

440
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,840
We'll take you to the hospital
to check on you anyway.

441
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,840
We just want to check.
Were you the driver?

442
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Right... Hey!

443
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,840
I think there's someone under
the car. I think I hit someone.

444
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,840
Wait here.
- Is there anyone under the car?

445
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,840
Towards the front, by the tires.

446
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,840
Wait!

447
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,840
Little brother!

448
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,840
Little brother?

449
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,840
WE HAVE TO MEET. LOTS HAS
HAPPENED. BIG HUGS! DONNY

450
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,840
Hello, DD.

451
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,840
It's bright in here.

452
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:05,840
Yeah, my little brother
is afraid of the dark.

453
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Because of me.

454
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,840
How insightful.

455
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,840
-Give me the box.
-Where is Promise?

456
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,840
Don't you worry about that.

457
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,840
-Where is Promise?
-I just want the box.

458
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,840
The box, the box... Oh, my God!

459
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,840
I think I lost it!

460
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,840
I don't think so.

461
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,840
Yes?

462
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,840
Hello, friend. We're from
the Church of Latter-Day Saints.

463
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,840
Would you like to
have a talk about Jesus?

464
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,840
Jesus was a young man,
just like you.

465
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,840
And just like you,
he had many questions...

466
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:32,840
Hello, friend. Would you
be interested in God's help?

467
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,840
Good.

468
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,840
-He can't open the box without me.
-Which is why you must die.

469
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,840
Excuse me, all you taxi drivers.
I need some assistance.

470
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,840
I have to go to a place I don't know
where it is, and have no address for.

471
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,840
But I have to get there real fast,
or something bad will happen.

472
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,840
-What's this pIace?
-It is...

473
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:26,840
It's a big place that looks like
it's got antlers on the roof.

474
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,840
And inside there's a contraption
to let you burn things.

475
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:38,840
-Burn what?
-Things. Trash, leaves, people...

476
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,840
-Does anyone know the place?
-Hey!

477
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,840
I know.

478
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,840
It has to be that place.
Pop was an architect, you know.

479
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:00,840
This is the only place that has this
deer aspect to it, antlers and that.

480
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,840
You know? And they have a
rubber burner. Der GummiweIzer.

481
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:14,840
Something Eastern German from the
70's to melt loads of rubber at once.

482
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,840
It's just a container the size of
a bath tub surrounded by fire.

483
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
-Were you in a hurry?
-In a big hurry!

484
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Then we'll just u-turn right here.
Taxi, that's service for you.

485
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,840
Okay, there it is. GummiweIzung.

486
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,840
-Can you wait here?
-Yeah, the meter's off.

487
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,840
I'm in here!

488
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,840
-Hey there.
-Hello, Göran.

489
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,840
Take care of this girI. Hurry up.

490
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,840
It'll be fine, just fine...

491
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,840
Hi, I wanted to...

492
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,840
-I need your help.
-You're wanted for murder!

493
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,840
-I need help.
-What's happened?

494
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,840
-She's been badly burned.
-I can tell. What happened?

495
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,840
-Can we talk about that later?
-We'll take her to admissions.

496
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,840
Go in here. I'll go get
a doctor as quickly as I can.

497
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,840
Make sure
she keeps breathing, okay?

498
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,840
-You'll get your films tomorrow.
-Fine.

499
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,840
Thank you for coming.

500
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,840
I thought you were...immortal.

501
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,840
No, we're...

502
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:08,840
We're sensitive to fire.

503
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,840
I think your time has come now.
Time to open the box.

504
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,840
Give it a try.

505
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,840
What was it your brother
said to you in the root cellar?

506
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,840
-What did he say?
-That someone had died.

507
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,840
Did you feel that?

508
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,840
Whose glasses are those?

509
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Katta's.

510
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,840
Katta's...

511
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,840
There used to be three of us.

512
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,840
Me, my brother and Katta.

513
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,840
Katta.

514
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,840
Katta was older than me.
She was older and had...

515
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:10,840
She was blonde
and she had wavy...curly hair.

516
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:16,840
She wore glasses, because
she was damned near blind.

517
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:23,840
She collected things of glass...

518
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,840
Glass figurines. From the woods.

519
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,840
Glass animals.

520
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,840
She'd gotten a package in the mail,
something new.

521
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,840
She showed it to me. She had...

522
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,840
The sun was shining, and there
was a cold smell to the air.

523
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
Wet, leaves...

524
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,840
A fox, she'd gotten a fox.
A glass fox.

525
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,840
She said, ''All I need is a reindeer,
and I'll have the whole forest''.

526
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:12,840
Then we'll
have the whole forest. Us.

527
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,840
Then they came...

528
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,840
Right, they showed up.

529
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,840
-Come closer.
-They started arguing.

530
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,840
-Come on.
-I just want to try something.

531
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,840
-Damn, she's ugly.
-Especially up close.

532
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,840
-Hey, four-eyes. You look like shit.
-You really look like shit.

533
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,840
-Did you fart? Cause you stink.
-Cow's cunt!

534
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:55,840
-I'm sorry. We were just kidding.
-We didn't mean it.

535
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,840
They started arguing
with Katta, not me.

536
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,840
I didn't do anything,
I just watched it happen.

537
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,840
I was reaIIy scared.
I didn't dare do anything.

538
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,840
-Step on them!
-Step on the glasses!

539
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,840
-Step on them.
-Step on them now!

540
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,840
Step on them, you little fag!

541
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:08,840
That's when I realised that Katta
couldn't get home-

542
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,840
-without her glasses. So I ran back.

543
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,840
She was right by the main road.

544
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:23,840
I called out her name, and waved
my arms, so she could see me.

545
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,840
And she turned around,
looked at me...

546
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,840
But Katta didn't die right away.

547
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,840
She had to go to the hospital.

548
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:19,840
I never dared to...
I didn't go into her room.

549
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:30,840
Dad came out, and I
asked him how she was doing.

550
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,840
He said that she had just died.

551
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,840
That she wasn't afraid to die.

552
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,840
She just wanted to live,
that's what she wanted.

553
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,840
To live.

554
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,840
She wondered where I was,
where I had been.

555
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,840
I just sat there.

556
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:17,840
What did you feel then,
when she disappeared?

557
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,840
When she died?

558
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,840
When she died...

559
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,840
-...I just fell apart.
-But you were not to blame.

560
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,840
You were not to blame.

561
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:08,840
Katta... I've never...

562
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,840
...loved anyone like I loved Katta.

563
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:19,840
Donny, you were not to blame.

564
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,840
Where's that damned doctor?

565
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,840
Be strong this time.

566
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,840
Hello?

567
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,840
Hello!

568
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,840
Enough of this bullshit.

569
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,840
Last chance, DD.

570
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,840
What do you say? What'll it be?

571
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:07,840
What do you say, DD? How about
we forget about all this and move on?

572
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:12,840
Start all over again, you and me.

573
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,840
What do you say?
Let's have some fun.

574
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:24,840
Back to all the fun.
The fun world, the fun life.

575
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,840
What do you say?

576
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,840
You look a little peaked.

577
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:47,840
After all, I love you.
You know that, DD. Right?

578
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,840
What do you say?

579
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,840
What do you say?

580
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,840
Well?

581
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:10,840
What do you do
about what you cannot have?

582
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,840
Well?

583
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:51,840
You know, your father collected
the shards of the glass animals-

584
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,840
-and drove them down to Småland.

585
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:02,840
He wanted to create something new
from what had been ruined.

586
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,840
The glass blowers down there
said nothing.

587
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,840
They just collected
all the shards and did it.

588
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,840
Not a word
about payment or overtime.

589
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,840
They just did it.

590
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:01,840
How long are you staying?

591
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,840
How long do you think?

592
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,840
What you're feeling now,
what you feel inside here...

593
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,840
...spread that around.

594
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,840
Oh, right... The cops.

595
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,840
Wanted. Oops.

596
