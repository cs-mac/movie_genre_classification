1
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,391
I wasn't expecting you.

2
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,726
I wasn't expecting you.

3
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,634
We love you so much.

4
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,537
We love you so much.

5
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,882
Button up your shirt, André.

6
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,036
André!

7
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,038
André!

8
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,078
André!

9
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:10,296
In the sluggish,
lazy afternoons at the farm...

10
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,471
I hid away in the woods...

11
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:17,234
from my family's worried eyes.

12
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:20,709
Soothing my feverish
feet into the ground,

13
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,350
and cover myself up with leaves,

14
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:31,787
I slept as quietly
as an ailing plant...

15
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:35,324
wilted by the weight
of a red blossom...

16
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,834
Were those stems
around me all fairies...

17
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:50,499
patiently, watching
my adolescent slumber?

18
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,771
Where those ancient urns...

19
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,610
calling me out from the porch?

20
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,218
André!

21
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,418
André!

22
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,595
And was the use of those calls,

23
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,327
if faster messengers...

24
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:20,097
rode the wind skillfully,
corrupting the atmosphere?

25
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,340
When my slumber was ripe...

26
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:32,246
I harvested it as a fruit,
voluptuously and religiously.

27
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,285
I remembered my father's sermons.

28
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,985
He said: "Our eyes are
the lanterns of our bodies.

29
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:48,031
If our eyes are good,
our bodies shall carry the light.

30
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,667
But if our eyes are blurred...

31
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,197
it means that's a dark,
gloomy body."

32
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,014
The shutters...

33
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,987
Why are the shutters closed?

34
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:07,435
"TO THE LEFT OF THE FATHER"

35
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,707
BASED ON THE NOVEL
"LAVOURA ARCAICA"

36
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:18,317
BY RADUAN NASSAR

37
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,620
A FILM BY
LUIZ FERNANDO CARVALHO

38
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,972
Don't you worry, brother.

39
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,440
Find the serious voice
you're looking for

40
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,647
Ask me what's been going on.

41
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,945
Disagree with me...

42
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:51,248
and shatter the family
chinaware against my eyes.

43
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:49,080
This is how we used to sit
around the table for meals...

44
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:53,719
or for sermons:
Father at the head...

45
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
to his right,
ordered according to age,

46
00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,682
There was Pedro, Rosa,
Zuleika and Huda.

47
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:06,257
To his left, Mother, myself...

48
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,162
Ana and Lula, the youngest.

49
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,135
The right branch...

50
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:16,673
had grown spontaneously
from the trunk.

51
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:21,176
But the left branch was scarred,

52
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:28,046
as if Mother, where the left
branch started, were an anomaly,

53
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:33,214
a morbid offshoot,
weighed down by affection.

54
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,069
You have no idea of what
we've been through since you left.

55
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:51,738
You would be shocked to see
our family's strained face.

56
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,244
It's hard for me to
say this, brother...

57
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:06,256
but Mother can't hide
her sobbing anymore.

58
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,959
She didn't tell anyone
you had left.

59
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:20,501
That day, at lunch time,

60
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:24,540
each one of us felt

61
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,577
the weight of your empty chair.

62
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:48,123
The day dragged on while
we worked with Father...

63
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,364
we thought about
our sisters at home...

64
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:58,033
busy in the kitchen,
or embroidering on the porch...

65
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:02,010
sewing, or cleaning out the pantry.

66
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,313
No matter where the girls were...

67
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,181
they would never be
the same after that day.

68
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:12,789
They no longer filled
the house with joy.

69
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:19,959
You should have
been there, André.

70
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:25,298
You should have seen Father,
locked up in his silence.

71
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,509
Right after dinner he left
the table and went outside.

72
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:39,108
No one saw him withdraw.

73
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:43,647
He stood there...

74
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,955
staring blankly
into the dark night.

75
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,996
Finally, at bedtime,
when I went to your room...

76
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,636
I opened your closet
and pulled the empty drawers...

77
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,237
only then I understood...

78
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,500
as the eldest brother,
what had really happened:

79
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,677
The family's destruction
had begun.

80
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,445
It began long before you think.

81
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:24,194
It began at a time when faith grew
malignantly inside of me...

82
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:30,427
when I had more passion
than anyone else at home.

83
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,236
Me...

84
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,206
a pious child...

85
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,940
would set my Marian society ribbon
next to my bed at night...

86
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:55,320
and think about God waking me
everyday at 5 AM...

87
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,463
for early communion.

88
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,786
Wake up, sweetheart.

89
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:07,992
Wake up.

90
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:20,332
Don't wake up your brother,
sweetheart.

91
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,592
- My heart.
- My heart.

92
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,799
- My eyes.
- My eyes.

93
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:00,071
- My lamb.
- My lamb.

94
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,779
My heart, my eyes...

95
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,347
As soon as I got up...

96
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:17,553
God was there in front of me,
on my bedside table...

97
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,095
and it was a God
I could hold in my hands...

98
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,633
and it filled my innocent chest.

99
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,500
And I went to church
like a balloon...

100
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:59,420
The light we had at home during
our childhood was fine:

101
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:07,104
Home baked bread, hot milk
and coffee, the butter dish...

102
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:25,789
The brightness
of our home...

103
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:36,026
seemed to be even brighter
when we came from the village...

104
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:07,391
That clarity...

105
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,862
later started to disturb me.

106
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:21,012
It would make me strange
and mute to the world.

107
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:35,250
The more united a family,
the worse is the blow.

108
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:41,088
A family's strength and joy
can be destroyed in one blow.

109
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,125
In the woods,
behind the house...

110
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:54,499
under the taller trees,
when the sunlight created

111
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:57,004
a gentle and joyous
play of shadows.

112
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,179
After the smell of roasted meat...

113
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:08,115
was gone, through the leaves
of the fuller trees,

114
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,916
the cloth, that was spread over
the calm grass, was folded away.

115
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:19,825
And I watched it,
sitting next to a trunk,

116
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,762
the frantic preparations
for the dance;

117
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:26,426
young men and women
rushing around,

118
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,732
my sisters joined in,
with their country ways...

119
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:31,807
wearing light,
bright dresses...

120
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,741
along with love's promise
of a greater love.

121
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:39,349
Running graciously,
they filled the woods with laughter...

122
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:43,578
they carried baskets of fruit to
where the tablecloth had been.

123
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,452
The melons and watermelons
were joyously split.

124
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:46,622
And I imagined, once the wine had
dampened his solemnity...

125
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:51,002
the happiness
in my father's eyes...

126
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:57,867
he felt reassured, then that all
would not rot in the ship's hold...

127
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:11,650
And seated like that,
seemingly relaxed...

128
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:16,624
I imagined from a distance
the fresh skin of her face...

129
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:20,423
her lavender aroma,
her full, tender mouth...

130
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:25,194
full of sweetness, mystery and
malice in her date-like eyes.

131
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:31,273
I wanted to dig my nails
into the soil...

132
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:37,711
and lie in that pit,
covered with damp earth.

133
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,665
Come on, sweetheart.

134
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,468
Come play with
your brothers and sisters.

135
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:36,368
Leave me alone, Mother.

136
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,975
I'm having fun.

137
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:05,559
That bright dust, when I look back
into that distant time...

138
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:13,010
I see the day,
when I had my feet in chains,

139
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:16,078
and I looked down
to avoid her face...

140
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,651
As I left home, my knapsack
weighed on my shoulders...

141
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:34,660
tied to my back,
the two of us walked like twins;

142
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:37,494
yolks of the same egg...

143
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:40,637
eyes looking forward...

144
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,171
and eyes looking backwards.

145
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:08,391
As I stood there,
I saw many distant things.

146
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:15,168
That afternoon,
I made my desperate decision...

147
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:18,706
to dwelve into the soft
womb of time.

148
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,081
Who knows, I could have
told to my brother tenderly:

149
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:37,853
"Go away,
send my regards to the family!"

150
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,964
I could shut the door...

151
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:47,762
then, alone in my darkness...

152
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:52,967
I'd bundle myself in the soft cloth
there was on the wall.

153
00:33:54,145 --> 00:34:00,277
And, thus protected,
give in to wine and to my fortune.

154
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:50,399
SCATENA BOARDING HOUSE
BREAKFAST, MEALS AND ROOMS

155
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:04,447
Since I ran away,
I stifled my revolt

156
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:08,278
and step by step,
I went away from the farm.

157
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:13,914
And If I asked myself,
"Where are we going?"

158
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,729
"We are always going home."

159
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:01,766
When I told Mother
I was coming to see you,

160
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:04,941
she stood back...

161
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:08,044
and her eyes brimmed
with tears.

162
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:10,111
There was fear in her eyes.

163
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:16,315
"Come on, Mother, cheer up,
you should laugh, instead...

164
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:19,683
Don't be like that,
and don't worry.

165
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,088
I promise I'll not argue
with that runaway.

166
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:30,566
You'll see how happy he'll be.
You'll see.

167
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,464
Mother, you'll see how everything...

168
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,004
is going to be like it was,
just like it used to be!"

169
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:44,243
Bring him back, Pedro.

170
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:52,915
Don't tell your brother
or your sisters you're going.

171
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,022
But bring him back.

172
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:06,994
Now I'll bake the sweet rolls,
he enjoyed so much...

173
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:20,746
As she said that, held me firmly
as if I were you, André.

174
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:32,524
That's how you feed a lamb.

175
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,582
Mother has aged a lot.

176
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:38,562
I saw her sitting
on her rocking chair,

177
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:44,898
completely alone and lost
in her grey daydreams

178
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:49,904
unraveling the lace woven
during a lifetime around love

179
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:52,474
and family union.

180
00:38:53,778 --> 00:39:00,445
As I saw her comb in her bun
in majestic simplicity...

181
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:07,046
I felt for a moment
it was worth a history book.

182
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,950
But no one at home has
changed as much as Ana.

183
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:47,390
As soon as you left, she shut
herself in the chapel to pray.

184
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,663
When she is not wandering
aimlessly in the woods...

185
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,861
she hides strangely
over by the old house.

186
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:59,940
None of us can break her
pious silence.

187
00:40:01,446 --> 00:40:04,381
No one causes us more worry.

188
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,268
I don't drink any more.
Nor should you drink any more.

189
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,878
Father's wisdom
isn't in this wine!

190
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,914
The spirit of this wine will not repair
the damage of our home!

191
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:16,377
Put the bottle away, that's serious,
it's about the family!

192
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,886
Lt's all right to have a drink!

193
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:26,596
I'm an epileptic!
An epileptic!

194
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:29,563
Your brother is epileptic,
now you know it!

195
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,192
Go home and tell everyone!

196
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:35,861
Go now, and you'll see that
the doors and windows at home...

197
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:38,098
will bang shut
by this wind!

198
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:41,301
And you, men of the family...

199
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:47,644
carrying Father's heavy tool box,
will walk around the house...

200
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:52,221
violently hammering crossed
boards over the windows!

201
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,085
And our sisters...

202
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:00,558
dressed in black, will run
around the house in mourning.

203
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:06,527
It'll be a chorus of howling,
sobbing and whimpering...

204
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,967
a locked-up family dance!

205
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,040
He abandoned us...

206
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:14,700
And with a flock of scarves
to hide their faces...

207
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:20,441
they will huddle, exhausted,
sobbing in a corner...

208
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:22,118
He abandoned us...

209
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,844
And you will scream
louder and louder:

210
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:28,285
"Our brother is a convulsive.
A possessed epileptic!"

211
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,326
And tell them I have a room in a
boarding house for my fits.

212
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:35,288
We lived with him
and we didn't know.

213
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,468
Never even once we suspected!

214
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:40,262
Never even once we suspected!

215
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:42,462
He abandoned us.

216
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:44,038
He abandoned us.

217
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,842
And yell as you will,
gorge yourselves!

218
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:50,070
Although you don't understand
the sinister web I got caught in!

219
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:53,614
And you, Pedro, as the eldest,
you may lament:

220
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:58,118
"It's sad he has our blood!"
Cry out! Cry out loud:

221
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:02,156
"He's been possessed by
a cursed disease!" Scream it!

222
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,486
What a disgrace has descended
upon our household!

223
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:07,960
"What makes him different?"
And you'll hear the chorus...

224
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:11,293
He's possessed by the devil!
He's possessed by the devil!

225
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:13,902
"He's possessed by the devil!"

226
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,572
Then you go ahead and say:

227
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:17,363
His eyes are gloomy...

228
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:20,544
He's possessed by the devil!

229
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,209
Then keep sputtering,
like stones in a sewer and say:

230
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:31,419
"What terrible crime
has he committed?"

231
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:35,121
"What terrible crime
has he committed?"

232
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:39,092
"He's possessed by the devil!"
And then say:

233
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:41,458
"He has stained the family!

234
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,759
He condemned us to burn
in shameful flames!"

235
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,691
He's possessed by the devil.

236
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,734
He's possessed by the devil.

237
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,908
And you'll always hear the same
cavernous hollow sound:

238
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:57,979
"He's possessed by the devil."

239
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:07,352
And then, as if in blasphemy...

240
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:11,858
raise your arms.
Raise your hands to heaven.

241
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:15,724
He has abandoned us!

242
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,199
He has abandoned us!

243
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:29,811
Plug your ears, Pedro.
Plug your ears.

244
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,141
Stick your fingers in the hole!

245
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,273
And after all the weeping...

246
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,651
all the sobbing
and teeth grinding...

247
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,517
go straight to the linen closet...

248
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,748
open its doors...

249
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:53,020
and look for the old linen sheets,
kept with such care.

250
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,461
You'll see that those
sheets, even those...

251
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:00,560
like everything in our house...

252
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:04,229
even those carefully washed
and folded cloths, everything!

253
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:08,867
Everything in our house was totally
soaked with Father's words!

254
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:12,942
It was him...

255
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,414
It was him who always said...

256
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:20,352
We must start by the truth and
end with the truth.

257
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,108
Look at my arms.

258
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:41,640
Look.

259
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,285
Look.

260
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,622
But it was also him...

261
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:07,236
He was the one who said probably
unaware of what he was saying...

262
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:12,466
and certainly not realizing how
one of us could use it some day.

263
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:35,960
Look at the strength of
the tree growing in isolation...

264
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:39,102
and the shade it provides
to the herd.

265
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:43,940
The troughs...

266
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:49,775
the long troughs emerging isolated
on the immense field...

267
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,076
smoothed by so many tongues...

268
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:59,018
where the cattle comes
for the salt...

269
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:03,284
that purifies its flesh and skin.

270
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,232
Did it ever cross your mind,
even for a short moment...

271
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:55,640
to open the dirty clothes
hamper in the bathroom?

272
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:01,616
Did you ever think
of dwelving in...

273
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:06,688
to carefully remove each and every
intimate garment of the family?

274
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:13,224
I dragged up a shred of each
of us when I dug there.

275
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:19,360
No one heard each one cry
like I did, Pedro.

276
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,001
I knew the family's every mood...

277
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:30,078
moulding away in the vinegary,
rotten smell...

278
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:34,240
of the cold, vein-ridden walls
of a dirty clothes hamper.

279
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,777
No one stuck their hands
in like I did!

280
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:43,486
No one felt the loneliness more.

281
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,585
You had to get out of bed...

282
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:18,620
and wander through the halls.

283
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,167
Listen to the throbbing and
moaning behind all the doors...

284
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,740
and our muffled,
homicidal plans.

285
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:38,278
I knew the body
of the entire family.

286
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:59,414
I held the red dust-covered
sanitary napkins in my hands...

287
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:03,153
as if they were
an assassin's rags.

288
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,796
No one heard us like I did, Pedro.

289
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:18,802
No one loved us like I did.
No one knew the path to our union.

290
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,603
Grandfather led us
along that path...

291
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:24,975
that tall, slender old man carved
out in the wood of our furniture.

292
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:26,774
The truth is,
it was he led us...

293
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,350
he was a guide
carved out of plaster.

294
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:33,417
He had no eyes,
our grandfather.

295
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:41,897
Nothing more than two deep, hollow,
somber pits in his face, Pedro!

296
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:47,162
Nothing else shone besides
his terrible, golden hook!

297
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,989
I'm tired of soothing thoughts...

298
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:26,195
afflicting eyes,
gentle contortions.

299
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,238
I want everything to burn:

300
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:33,566
My feet...

301
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:36,779
the thorns in my arms...

302
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,478
the leaves covering my
wooden body...

303
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:43,750
my forehead...

304
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,290
my lips...

305
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:53,629
provided my useless
tongue is spared.

306
00:55:54,965 --> 00:56:00,232
I don't care
if only laments are left...

307
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:03,895
the family's
sobbing and moaning.

308
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:10,674
Pedro, my brother...

309
00:56:21,158 --> 00:56:24,150
father's sermons were
inconsistent.

310
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:09,063
The world of passions is
an unbalanced world.

311
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:18,448
The passionate must be careful
averting their eyes...

312
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:22,140
so they are not blurred
by the rusty red dust.

313
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:30,122
Building a fence,
simply shielding the body...

314
00:57:30,327 --> 00:57:33,592
those are the ways...

315
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:36,357
to prevent darkness
from one side...

316
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:39,592
from invading and contaminating
light on the other.

317
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:46,040
Through isolation, we can escape
the dangers of passion.

318
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:50,241
But do not think...

319
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:54,845
we should just always
sit and cross our arms.

320
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:59,715
No one in this house shall rest while
there is land to be tilled.

321
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:04,986
No one in this house shall rest
when walls need building.

322
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:13,231
And let no one shall rest...

323
00:58:13,437 --> 00:58:17,168
when a brother is in need.

324
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:27,911
I hadn't left home yet, Pedro...

325
00:58:28,118 --> 00:58:31,315
but I saw suspicion
in Mother's eyes.

326
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,788
I wanted to tell her:

327
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:44,661
"You are saying farewell now
without knowing me."

328
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:51,504
I could have said:

329
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:58,009
"All I did was nestle in the straw
of your womb for nine months...

330
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:04,711
and receiving for many years the
tender touch of your hands and lips."

331
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:09,047
"That's why I'm leaving home...

332
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:12,617
that's why I'm going away."

333
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,995
I could have told her
so much, Pedro.

334
00:59:20,637 --> 00:59:23,401
But I thought it was useless.

335
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,305
"It makes no sense",
I thought...

336
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:32,110
to leave in her poor,
flour-coated hands...

337
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:35,643
an exasperated
carnation stem.

338
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:41,349
"It makes no sense",
I thought twice...

339
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:45,493
to stain her apron...

340
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,423
to cut the cord...

341
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,234
and other leaves.

342
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,202
That's why instead
of saying...

343
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,273
"Mother, you don't know me..."

344
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:12,518
I preferred, Pedro,
with my mouth dry and salty...

345
01:00:14,558 --> 01:00:17,288
I preferred to remain
buckled up before her...

346
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:22,263
as if nothing was the matter.

347
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:35,410
I had nothing to say,
but she wanted to say something...

348
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:37,079
and I thought:

349
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,182
"Mother has something to say
that I might listen to.

350
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:44,876
Something perhaps that
should be saved carefully."

351
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,552
But all I could hear
without her saying anything...

352
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:53,058
were the cracks
in her old chinaware womb...

353
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:58,096
I heard in her eyes a desperate
cry of a delivering mother.

354
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:03,702
I felt her fruit drying
under my hot breath.

355
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:09,503
But I couldn't do anything,
my eyes were darkened.

356
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:14,345
Still, I could have said:

357
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,777
"Mother, you and I have begun
to ruin this house.

358
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,949
The time has come to throw
out the window...

359
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,151
all the dishes and the flies
of our old cup board..."

360
01:01:28,632 --> 01:01:31,328
But I've already told
you Pedro, my eyes...

361
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,992
were darker than
they'd ever been before.

362
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:43,538
Me, the wayward son...

363
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:52,121
It was not of roads
that I dreamt of.

364
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:57,885
I'd never thought
to leave home.

365
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:06,260
I never thought of running afar
searching for sensual thrills.

366
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:13,035
I knew, dear brother,
from the most tender age...

367
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:19,776
how much disappointment
awaited me outside our home.

368
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:29,015
Pedro.
It's your silence I need now.

369
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:33,646
Lift your blinds.

370
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:39,553
Give your eyes free reigns.

371
01:03:39,763 --> 01:03:43,130
Leave aside
the family strength and caution.

372
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,733
And hold your harsh tongue.

373
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:49,233
Moisten your lips...

374
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:51,771
your mouth.

375
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:53,909
And your rotting teeth...

376
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,704
and probe the depths
of your stomach.

377
01:03:56,913 --> 01:04:00,280
Fill this leather pouch
tightened by your belt,

378
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:04,544
let the wine seep
through your pores.

379
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:09,251
That's the only way
to idolize the obscene.

380
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:42,216
Oh, brother...

381
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:47,027
we've come to understand
each other.

382
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:53,035
I can see your mouth
is decongested

383
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:57,565
and the sweetness
of the wine is in your eyes.

384
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:35,829
Take it in your hands, Pedro,

385
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,440
and feel this filthy ribbon.

386
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:51,148
This rag is the subtle
extension of the red fingernails...

387
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:53,879
of my first whore.

388
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:15,010
What a crazy shame...

389
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:19,713
you poor, quivering boy.

390
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:23,181
You've got such a pure face...

391
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:26,048
and such a clean body.

392
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,294
What a crazy shame...

393
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:41,635
to see a boy with peach down...

394
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:47,334
with a smooth, bare chest...

395
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:51,179
burning in bed...

396
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:53,973
like kindling.

397
01:08:05,428 --> 01:08:06,952
Take this.

398
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:09,290
Take this.

399
01:08:11,034 --> 01:08:14,663
Take what you've asked me.

400
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:21,272
Keep this grimy
little ribbon with you...

401
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:32,253
and come back to your niche,
my little saint.

402
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,923
My little saint!

403
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:14,055
That's where
I took my communion, Pedro.

404
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:24,134
Oh, brother. I lied on the blazing
tangerine-filled ground.

405
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:29,804
Didn't I surrender like a child
in the orgy of killer berries?

406
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:38,546
Wasn't it a precarious
peace that came over me...

407
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:42,190
to have my body stretched out
on a weed mattress?

408
01:09:43,926 --> 01:09:47,225
Wasn't this different slumber
perhaps temporary?

409
01:09:48,064 --> 01:09:52,899
To have my fingernails dirty,
my feet numbed.

410
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:57,361
Lice cutting trails
through my hair.

411
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:01,304
My armpits visited by ants?

412
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:07,348
Wasn't this second slumber
perhaps temporary?

413
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:12,586
To have my head
crowned with butterflies.

414
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:17,392
Fat larvae sprouting
from my bellybutton.

415
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,892
My cold forehead
covered by insects.

416
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:24,493
My limp mouth
kissing scarabs?

417
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:33,206
Such a sleepiness...

418
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:35,969
such a lethargy...

419
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:39,046
such a nightmare of
adolescence!

420
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:43,515
What kind of rock is that,
so heavy on my body?

421
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:49,821
There's a mysterious chill
in this fire.

422
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:55,695
Where will I be taken, someday?

423
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:59,324
A white board...

424
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:01,765
and a pale dust.

425
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,303
A silent field...

426
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:09,973
lilies and the taller
cypress trees...

427
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:17,082
such long cries,
mourning my young body!

428
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:25,952
Get a little inside these things
that lulled me to sleep.

429
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:30,464
Fatten your eyes
with that crumpled orchid.

430
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:37,467
With this bracelet
and these pink garters...

431
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:42,007
all these trinkets I bought
with coins stolen from Father...

432
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:44,270
I buried it in this box
to dig it out someday...

433
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,744
and spread them on the ground
thinking, as I do now:

434
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:51,943
It was a long adolescence!

435
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:57,318
Take it with you, Pedro.
Take home all these scraps...

436
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,426
and tell them how did it happen the
story of the son and the brother.

437
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:02,095
Then request a warm night
or a big fat moon.

438
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:04,155
Gather our sisters.

439
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,927
Make them dress up
scantily in muslin...

440
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:09,696
wearing strappy sandals.

441
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:13,636
Paint their placid cheeks crimson,
their eyelids green...

442
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:16,004
and their lashes dark charcoal.

443
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:18,476
Adorn their arms
and their bare necks.

444
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:22,310
Put these cheap beads
on them, ivory models.

445
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:25,248
Have these earrings bite
their earlobes.

446
01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:28,053
And don't forget
the sensuous gestures...

447
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:31,784
exposing their clevage,
and parts of their thighs.

448
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:35,452
Imagining fatal charms for
their ankle bracelets.

449
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:38,862
Provoke on those newly red,
debauched lips...

450
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:41,366
the thick flow
of pestilent fluids.

451
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:45,301
Take it with you, Pedro!
Take all those trinkets home!

452
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,543
And when you get there,
announce solemnly:

453
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:53,374
"From your beloved brother."
But be careful in handling them.

454
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:57,714
"To repay Father's sermons,
our misfit brother also sends...

455
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,822
with the gifts, a heavy,
scornful laughter."

456
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,618
Come on, put them in the bag!

457
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:49,204
As I look back on our utensils...

458
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:53,369
and the family clothing...

459
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:56,875
I hear diffused,
lost voices inside that trench.

460
01:13:58,047 --> 01:14:03,815
I'm not surprised by the clear
water springing from the bottom.

461
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:11,793
And I withdraw
into our weariness.

462
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:15,255
And I step back after such an
exhaustive struggle.

463
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,697
And from our bale of routines
I draw, one by one...

464
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:25,565
the sacred bones
of our code of behavior:

465
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,702
The excess: Forbidden.

466
01:14:30,913 --> 01:14:33,973
Zeal: A must.

467
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,651
And condemned as a vice...

468
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:40,413
through constant preaching
any waste was to be banned...

469
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:43,751
denounced as a serious
threat to our work.

470
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:51,689
And I face again the tepid
message in looks and frowns.

471
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:58,730
And our hidden chagrins
burning through our cheeks.

472
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:05,740
And the acid anguish
of a stingy scold.

473
01:15:06,549 --> 01:15:10,349
And discipline oftentimes rude...

474
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:13,613
there was also the
children's crafts school...

475
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:16,257
forbidding us to buy elsewhere...

476
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:19,292
what could be made
with our own hands.

477
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:24,522
And the toughest law said
that it had to be right there...

478
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:28,328
at the farm, that all of our bread
had to be kneaded.

479
01:15:33,776 --> 01:15:38,736
We never had on our table a
bread that was not homemade.

480
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:43,946
And by the time
we would share it...

481
01:15:44,153 --> 01:15:47,554
which happened
three times a day...

482
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,850
we had of our
ritual of austerity.

483
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:58,125
And it was also at the table,
more than anywhere else.

484
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:04,329
Where with our heads bowed,
we learned about justice.

485
01:16:15,384 --> 01:16:18,012
Move, brother.

486
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,884
Open your eyes!
Set them agog!

487
01:16:26,929 --> 01:16:29,557
Take my hands in yours.

488
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:33,565
Let's go.

489
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:40,704
Once upon a time,
there was a starving man.

490
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:11,904
Who's there?

491
01:17:15,144 --> 01:17:18,409
Where do you come from?

492
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:21,745
Didn't you know...

493
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:28,618
you can have all you want
if you go to our lord and master?

494
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:33,119
Lord and master,
in God's name, I beg for charity.

495
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:37,629
- I am so hungry, I may collapse.
- Stay here, poor man.

496
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,165
I want to break bread with you.

497
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:43,236
You must have
the salt of my table.

498
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,771
God bless you
and your saintly mother.

499
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:50,569
The starving man was writhing...

500
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:56,240
he thought to himself
the poor must be patient...

501
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:59,148
when faced with
the whims of the powerful...

502
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:03,086
refraining from showing
any sign of anger.

503
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:10,490
Dear guest,
my house is your house...

504
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:15,329
and my table is your table.
Make yourself at home.

505
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:19,029
Eat until you are satisfied.

506
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,822
What do you think
of this bread?

507
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:43,688
This bread is very pure and good.

508
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:47,902
I've never tasted
a bread this good.

509
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:52,438
What about the delicacies
on your left?

510
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:55,872
What do you think of this meat
stuffed with rice and almonds...

511
01:18:56,078 --> 01:18:58,672
or these lamb cutlets?

512
01:18:59,181 --> 01:19:02,207
And what do you think
of the aroma?

513
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:12,759
The aroma is inebriating...

514
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,628
as well as the presentation...

515
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:20,232
and the divine flavor.

516
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:25,931
You will now taste
a tidbit from my own hand.

517
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:31,876
You must chew carefully.

518
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,792
Excellent!

519
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:54,201
You may bring dessert.

520
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:01,708
We shall make ourselves sweet.

521
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:07,138
Eat, eat.
Do not stand on ceremony!

522
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:21,227
You must also try these figs
fresh off the tree.

523
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,398
Here.
Eat up, eat up.

524
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,262
God is merciful
to human beings.

525
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:30,194
I am satisfied, sir.
I can't eat anymore.

526
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:34,266
This is strange. You were
so hungry when you arrived...

527
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:38,003
it's amazing
you are already satisfied.

528
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:44,849
No matter, it has been an honor
to share my table with you.

529
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:51,187
Ah... but we still haven't drunk.

530
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:32,395
What a perfect wine.

531
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:41,106
Finally, having searched
all over the world...

532
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:46,338
I have found a man
with a strong spirit...

533
01:21:46,548 --> 01:21:50,177
and firm character, who,
above all, has proven...

534
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:55,186
to have the most important
virtue known to mankind:

535
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,688
Patience.

536
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:00,452
From now on,
because of your fine character...

537
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:07,329
you will live in this huge,
uninhabited house.

538
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,803
You can be certain...

539
01:22:10,005 --> 01:22:13,964
you'll never lack food
on your table.

540
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:20,577
At that moment,
the servants brought a bread...

541
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:26,618
a true bread, and the man,
thanks to patience...

542
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:30,280
was never hungry again.

543
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,820
How could a man who has
bread on his table...

544
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:07,457
the needed salt...

545
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:11,121
meat and wine,
tell a story about a hungry man?

546
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:17,065
How could Father
have omitted so much...

547
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:19,763
every time he told that tale?

548
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:24,135
The most powerful
ruler of the Universe...

549
01:23:24,346 --> 01:23:29,340
confessed that after much
searching he had just found...

550
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:31,951
a strong spirited man...

551
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:33,917
straight minded...

552
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:38,491
who above all had
the rarest of human virtues:

553
01:23:44,466 --> 01:23:47,162
Patience.

554
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,896
But before he could compliment
his guest...

555
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:55,902
father didn't mention
that the starving man...

556
01:23:56,111 --> 01:24:00,070
with the amazing strength
born of hunger...

557
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:04,476
struck violently the old man
the beautiful white bearded!

558
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:19,695
Lord and master of my laurels...

559
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:22,528
you know I am
your submissive slave...

560
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:24,535
I have sat at your table with you...

561
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:27,903
and shared a banquet of
delicacies fit for a king...

562
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:33,377
to finish off,
I've tasted your many old wines.

563
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:38,612
What else can you expect,
my Lord?

564
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,516
The wine has gone to my head.

565
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:42,712
Therefore I am not responsible
for what I just did...

566
01:24:42,924 --> 01:24:45,757
when I raised my fist
against my benefactor.

567
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:55,198
Impatience also has its rights!

568
01:24:56,538 --> 01:24:59,598
Lmpatience also has its rights!

569
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:04,002
Lmpatience also has its rights!

570
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:39,956
I'm 17 years old.

571
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:43,157
I'm perfectly healthy...

572
01:26:43,694 --> 01:26:47,061
and I'm going to start my own
church on this rock.

573
01:26:47,264 --> 01:26:48,959
I'm founding a church for
my own needs...

574
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:54,365
a church I'll enter bare feet,
naked as I came into the world.

575
01:26:56,507 --> 01:26:59,840
I want to be the prophet
of my own history.

576
01:27:00,043 --> 01:27:03,137
Instead of gazing upwards...

577
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:08,841
I want to look with certainty
to the fruits of earth.

578
01:27:09,052 --> 01:27:11,350
And I can do it!

579
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:13,580
I can!

580
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:17,051
I can be the prophet
of my own history!

581
01:27:17,261 --> 01:27:18,694
I can do it!

582
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:20,329
I can!

583
01:27:20,531 --> 01:27:24,228
I can be the prophet
of my own history!

584
01:27:24,435 --> 01:27:26,403
I can!

585
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:31,163
I can be the prophet of
my own history! I can do it!

586
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:33,935
I can!

587
01:28:24,228 --> 01:28:26,788
Maktub.
(lt is written.)

588
01:31:24,975 --> 01:31:30,140
Until someday...

589
01:31:30,714 --> 01:31:33,740
a pestilent breath...

590
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:37,613
invades our carefully
sealed boundaries...

591
01:31:37,821 --> 01:31:41,313
reaching the surroundings
of our home...

592
01:31:41,525 --> 01:31:48,055
seeping slyly through the slits
of our doors and windows...

593
01:31:48,265 --> 01:31:53,202
catching an unaware member
of our family...

594
01:31:54,171 --> 01:31:58,198
no hand in our home...

595
01:31:58,408 --> 01:32:02,936
shall clench a fist
against the stricken brother.

596
01:32:04,281 --> 01:32:06,749
Let each one of us look...

597
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:10,181
more candidly than ever...

598
01:32:10,387 --> 01:32:13,788
upon the desperate brother.

599
01:32:14,357 --> 01:32:20,785
And the care of each one shall
be given to this needy brother,

600
01:32:20,997 --> 01:32:25,764
each of us will inhale...

601
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:28,130
the noxious odor of this brother...

602
01:32:28,338 --> 01:32:32,570
and our gentle hearts will
soothe his wounds...

603
01:32:33,543 --> 01:32:40,210
and our lips will tenderly kiss
his tousled hair.

604
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:46,511
For love within the family
is the supreme form of patience.

605
01:32:48,358 --> 01:32:50,417
It is through family union...

606
01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:56,293
that we may find the
achievement of our principles.

607
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:03,303
And occasionally...

608
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:07,776
amongst our most
immediate needs...

609
01:33:09,346 --> 01:33:14,545
each of you should take the
time to sit on a bench...

610
01:33:14,751 --> 01:33:18,585
with one foot set squarely
on the ground...

611
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:23,885
then, leaning over...

612
01:33:24,628 --> 01:33:28,257
rest an elbow on one knee...

613
01:33:28,532 --> 01:33:31,399
then approach the chin...

614
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:34,661
rest the head
on the back of our hand...

615
01:33:34,938 --> 01:33:40,774
and with gentle eyes,
watch the movement of the sun...

616
01:33:41,077 --> 01:33:43,204
and the rains...

617
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:45,847
and the winds...

618
01:33:46,049 --> 01:33:48,984
with these same gentle eyes...

619
01:33:49,186 --> 01:33:52,678
watch time's mysterious
manipulation...

620
01:33:52,889 --> 01:33:56,723
of the other tools
it skillfully wields...

621
01:33:56,927 --> 01:33:59,657
in its transformations...

622
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:03,661
never once questioning
its unfathomable...

623
01:34:03,867 --> 01:34:07,598
meandering designs...

624
01:34:07,804 --> 01:34:12,366
just as you never
question the pure flat plains...

625
01:34:12,576 --> 01:34:18,378
or the winding trails drawn by
the herds on the pasture.

626
01:34:19,149 --> 01:34:21,617
Because the cows...

627
01:34:22,085 --> 01:34:24,986
always go to the trough.

628
01:34:26,256 --> 01:34:31,159
The cows always
go to the watering pit.

629
01:34:37,434 --> 01:34:43,373
Patience is the virtue
of all virtues.

630
01:34:44,274 --> 01:34:47,869
He who despairs is not wise...

631
01:34:48,245 --> 01:34:53,012
he who does not submit
is foolish.

632
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:01,914
I'm crazy. I'm crazy...

633
01:36:31,314 --> 01:36:33,782
God...

634
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,488
I make no mistake in this fire...

635
01:37:50,894 --> 01:37:53,021
in this passion...

636
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,428
in this delirium...

637
01:37:58,134 --> 01:37:59,829
I should have baited her
with grape seeds...

638
01:38:00,036 --> 01:38:02,596
a winding trail
up to the front stairs...

639
01:38:02,806 --> 01:38:06,469
and held fresh pomegranates
at the front windows.

640
01:38:06,676 --> 01:38:10,077
I should have done
a colorful flower garland.

641
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,612
I should've ran
on the old railing at the porch...

642
01:38:19,355 --> 01:38:21,915
White, white...

643
01:38:22,692 --> 01:38:25,718
Her white face...

644
01:38:50,987 --> 01:38:53,285
Ana!

645
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:20,906
Time...

646
01:39:21,117 --> 01:39:23,483
Time...

647
01:39:23,686 --> 01:39:26,382
This sometimes gentle...

648
01:39:26,589 --> 01:39:29,387
sometimes cruel torturer.

649
01:39:29,592 --> 01:39:33,858
Despotic devil
that affects everything.

650
01:39:35,265 --> 01:39:38,792
He still decides everything.
Now and always.

651
01:39:40,003 --> 01:39:43,166
This is why I bow
down to Time in fear...

652
01:39:43,373 --> 01:39:46,536
and held in suspense, I wonder:

653
01:39:46,743 --> 01:39:50,235
In which exact moment
does the change happen?

654
01:39:52,215 --> 01:39:54,080
Which instant?

655
01:39:55,485 --> 01:39:59,251
Which terrible instant
marks the leap?

656
01:39:59,455 --> 01:40:01,047
Which gale of wind?

657
01:40:01,257 --> 01:40:05,216
Which end in space conspires,
taking us to the limit?

658
01:40:06,863 --> 01:40:10,196
The limit in which all
vibrationless things...

659
01:40:11,568 --> 01:40:14,969
cease to be just part
of daily life...

660
01:40:16,706 --> 01:40:20,608
to come alive in the
depths of our memory.

661
01:43:34,937 --> 01:43:38,737
A miracle, my God.
A miracle!

662
01:43:38,941 --> 01:43:41,409
Let this hand breathe
like mine, oh God!

663
01:43:41,811 --> 01:43:45,679
And in my lack of faith I will
give You back the existence.

664
01:43:45,882 --> 01:43:48,476
Allow me to live this passion!

665
01:43:50,553 --> 01:43:52,987
A miracle!

666
01:43:54,157 --> 01:43:57,285
And in Your name, I'll sacrifice
a lamb of my father's herd.

667
01:43:57,493 --> 01:43:59,961
One of the ones grazing
in the bluish dawn...

668
01:44:00,163 --> 01:44:05,226
a young one in the dew,
a plump and agile, wild animal.

669
01:44:05,435 --> 01:44:08,302
A miracle, my God!

670
01:44:08,504 --> 01:44:10,734
And I'll give you life in return!

671
01:44:48,945 --> 01:44:51,971
We'll drink many wines.

672
01:44:53,483 --> 01:44:57,283
We'll get drunk like children.

673
01:44:57,487 --> 01:45:01,184
We'll climb steep hills,
bare feet...

674
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:03,324
and holding hands...

675
01:45:03,526 --> 01:45:07,121
together we'll set
the world on fire!

676
01:45:24,447 --> 01:45:26,745
It's mine!

677
01:45:26,949 --> 01:45:29,417
It's mine!

678
01:46:19,201 --> 01:46:23,638
The doves in my yard
were free to fly.

679
01:46:24,574 --> 01:46:27,907
They took long journeys,
but they always returned.

680
01:46:29,278 --> 01:46:35,080
For it was nothing,
but love what we had to exchange.

681
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:43,188
They flew far away and I could
recognize them on distant rooftops.

682
01:46:43,993 --> 01:46:48,396
Among stray birds
I hoped someday...

683
01:46:48,598 --> 01:46:51,567
would come to my immense garden.

684
01:47:04,614 --> 01:47:06,081
It was Ana, Pedro.

685
01:47:09,885 --> 01:47:12,445
It was Ana.

686
01:47:12,822 --> 01:47:16,417
My hunger was for Ana.

687
01:47:16,826 --> 01:47:20,318
Ana was my illness.

688
01:47:20,529 --> 01:47:23,930
She was my insanity.

689
01:47:25,134 --> 01:47:27,967
My breath...

690
01:47:29,205 --> 01:47:32,106
my blade...

691
01:47:32,842 --> 01:47:35,367
and my chill.

692
01:47:36,846 --> 01:47:39,474
My breath...

693
01:47:39,982 --> 01:47:42,507
my harassment...

694
01:47:44,553 --> 01:47:47,522
I was the crazed brother.

695
01:47:48,824 --> 01:47:51,759
I was the desperate brother.

696
01:47:51,961 --> 01:47:54,828
I was the vile smelling brother.

697
01:47:56,599 --> 01:48:01,263
I was the one who had
the skin covered with slugs slime,

698
01:48:03,205 --> 01:48:05,639
and the devil's slobber
coating my skin.

699
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:11,077
Hurry up, Pedro,
bring me the basin...

700
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,272
in which we bathed
when we were little.

701
01:48:14,483 --> 01:48:16,678
Bring the warm water...

702
01:48:16,886 --> 01:48:19,013
the ash soap...

703
01:48:19,221 --> 01:48:21,246
the scratchy sponge...

704
01:48:22,925 --> 01:48:27,521
and the white fluffy towel.

705
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:31,599
Wrap me up...

706
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:37,471
wrap me up in your arms.

707
01:48:39,475 --> 01:48:42,967
And dry my tormented hair...

708
01:48:45,548 --> 01:48:50,576
then run your earnest hand
over my neck.

709
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:57,382
You must do it, Pedro.

710
01:49:02,832 --> 01:49:06,290
You...

711
01:49:06,502 --> 01:49:09,801
who were the first
to open our mother.

712
01:49:12,074 --> 01:49:14,542
You...

713
01:49:14,744 --> 01:49:18,908
gifted with the saintity
pertaining to an elder brother.

714
01:49:23,519 --> 01:49:25,749
It was Ana.

715
01:49:28,324 --> 01:49:30,690
It was Ana.

716
01:49:36,031 --> 01:49:37,862
It was Ana.

717
01:49:42,471 --> 01:49:44,598
It was Ana.

718
01:49:51,981 --> 01:49:54,347
Ana...

719
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:08,318
When I saw my brother covering
his face with his hands...

720
01:50:09,298 --> 01:50:12,756
it was clear to me that
he was seeking support.

721
01:50:13,903 --> 01:50:17,168
He was definitely in search of
some solid, hard ground.

722
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,403
I could even hear
his cries for help.

723
01:50:24,446 --> 01:50:30,214
But when he suddenly got
deeply still, it was my Father.

724
01:50:30,419 --> 01:50:32,910
I also thought it was maybe
an exercise of patience...

725
01:50:33,122 --> 01:50:35,215
in which we'd withdraw...

726
01:50:35,925 --> 01:50:39,190
to consult in darkness
the elders' texts...

727
01:50:39,395 --> 01:50:42,193
the noble,
ancestral pages...

728
01:50:43,799 --> 01:50:47,200
but in my trance,
his pain didn't matter any longer...

729
01:50:47,403 --> 01:50:49,803
nor did my respect for the
ancient sayings.

730
01:50:50,573 --> 01:50:53,269
I had to scream in furor
that my madness...

731
01:50:53,475 --> 01:50:55,500
had more wisdom than
Father's wisdom.

732
01:50:56,512 --> 01:51:00,539
That my illness suited me better
than the family's good health.

733
01:51:00,749 --> 01:51:04,207
That my remedies had never
been mentioned in the books.

734
01:51:04,753 --> 01:51:07,881
But there was another
medicine. Mine.

735
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:11,116
I recognized no science
except my own...

736
01:51:11,327 --> 01:51:13,557
and everything was merely
a matter of perspective.

737
01:51:13,762 --> 01:51:17,562
Only my point of view held
any meaning whatsoever.

738
01:51:17,766 --> 01:51:19,461
I wanted to tell him only
a satisfied person would

739
01:51:19,668 --> 01:51:23,297
test the virtue of patience
with other people's hunger.

740
01:51:24,773 --> 01:51:26,764
I had to say all this
in a verbal fit...

741
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,240
turning upside down
the sermon table.

742
01:51:29,445 --> 01:51:32,073
Destroying clamps,
bolts and moorings.

743
01:51:32,281 --> 01:51:35,148
Establishing a different balance,
and gathering strenght...

744
01:51:35,351 --> 01:51:37,410
to go higher and higher.

745
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,555
Tightening mainly my
clandestine muscles...

746
01:51:40,756 --> 01:51:43,623
rediscovering at once
the beast in me,

747
01:51:43,826 --> 01:51:46,260
My hooves, jaws and spurs...

748
01:51:46,462 --> 01:51:51,092
letting the oily grease coat my
sculptured self as I galloped...

749
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,860
with my feathered mane
flying like feathers.

750
01:51:54,069 --> 01:51:57,698
Stepping with my sagittarius
paws the soft belly of the world.

751
01:51:57,907 --> 01:51:59,841
Taking from this pasture
a grain of wheat...

752
01:52:00,042 --> 01:52:03,671
and a fat slice
of wine-soaked wrath.

753
01:52:05,147 --> 01:52:07,411
Me, the epileptic.

754
01:52:07,616 --> 01:52:09,777
The possessed, crazed epileptic.

755
01:52:09,985 --> 01:52:13,421
Me, the starved,
rolling in my convulsive speech...

756
01:52:13,622 --> 01:52:15,351
the soul of a flame.

757
01:52:15,557 --> 01:52:18,685
A veronica cloth
and a squirt of mud...

758
01:52:19,328 --> 01:52:22,525
mixing the salty name of our
sister into this flowing broth...

759
01:52:23,232 --> 01:52:25,462
the perverted name of Ana.

760
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:29,763
Such shivering...

761
01:52:29,972 --> 01:52:31,837
So many suns...

762
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:34,202
Such agony.

763
01:53:04,373 --> 01:53:06,170
And Ana was there next to me.

764
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:09,401
Her presence was
so necessary.

765
01:53:09,611 --> 01:53:12,876
I thought how often,
like two children...

766
01:53:13,082 --> 01:53:15,915
we would be able
to laugh riotously.

767
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,381
Spraying the urine
of each one...

768
01:53:19,588 --> 01:53:21,886
against the other's body.

769
01:53:22,091 --> 01:53:24,685
Wetting ourselves as
we had done just awhile ago.

770
01:53:24,893 --> 01:53:28,795
And mixing together
with our laborious tongues...

771
01:53:28,998 --> 01:53:32,661
the saliva of each other.

772
01:53:33,869 --> 01:53:37,168
Uniting our faces,
wet by our eyes...

773
01:53:38,474 --> 01:53:43,002
cheek to cheek.

774
01:53:44,213 --> 01:53:47,910
Thinking that we were
made of dirt...

775
01:53:48,751 --> 01:53:53,211
and that everything in us would
germinate in the other...

776
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:55,856
with the water
received from the other.

777
01:53:57,292 --> 01:54:01,661
The sweat of one
for the sweat of the other.

778
01:54:41,203 --> 01:54:43,967
My eyes were still closed...

779
01:54:44,173 --> 01:54:46,937
when I touched the hay again.

780
01:54:48,210 --> 01:54:50,508
Ana was gone.

781
01:54:51,947 --> 01:54:55,041
I didn't know love required
watching over...

782
01:54:56,685 --> 01:54:59,313
that there's no such
thing as everlasting peace...

783
01:54:59,521 --> 01:55:02,081
nor a goblet without
a trace of poison.

784
01:55:09,698 --> 01:55:11,689
Ana.

785
01:55:21,743 --> 01:55:23,870
Ana!

786
01:55:34,323 --> 01:55:37,656
Ana, if you're here,
please answer me!

787
01:55:39,962 --> 01:55:42,123
Answer me!

788
01:57:32,307 --> 01:57:33,968
I love you, Ana.

789
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:37,276
I love you, Ana.

790
01:57:37,479 --> 01:57:40,471
Ana, listen, that's all I'm asking.

791
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:48,556
What happened between
us was a miracle, dear sister.

792
01:57:48,757 --> 01:57:52,386
We've discovered our
bodies fit so well.

793
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:56,961
Through this union our
childhood can thrive...

794
01:57:57,165 --> 01:58:00,134
with no sorrow over
our playthings...

795
01:58:00,335 --> 01:58:03,304
no longing for our shared past.

796
01:58:04,973 --> 01:58:07,942
It was a miracle to have
discovered above all...

797
01:58:08,143 --> 01:58:11,772
that we've become whole
in our own home...

798
01:58:13,348 --> 01:58:15,714
just as Father said...

799
01:58:15,917 --> 01:58:19,853
happiness is only
found within the family.

800
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:25,853
It was a miracle, Ana!

801
01:58:27,829 --> 01:58:31,856
This arrangement of destiny
shall not vanish.

802
01:58:35,604 --> 01:58:38,072
I want to be happy.

803
01:58:40,642 --> 01:58:42,405
Me...

804
01:58:43,879 --> 01:58:45,779
the odd son...

805
01:58:48,517 --> 01:58:51,611
the black sheep
no one wants to confess...

806
01:58:53,455 --> 01:58:56,185
the family's good-for-nothing...

807
01:58:57,125 --> 01:58:59,787
but who loves our home.

808
01:59:00,495 --> 01:59:02,258
And I love this land...

809
01:59:02,464 --> 01:59:06,161
and I also love to work,
unlike what everyone thinks.

810
01:59:13,542 --> 01:59:16,773
My hands are blessed
for planting.

811
01:59:17,779 --> 01:59:21,772
I can hear
the call of the land all the time.

812
01:59:24,152 --> 01:59:27,451
I'll take perfect care
of our animals...

813
01:59:27,656 --> 01:59:30,454
sheltering the cows
from gusty winds.

814
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:35,687
Protecting them under the trees
during heavy storms.

815
01:59:38,166 --> 01:59:40,828
I have a shepherd's soul,
dear sister!

816
01:59:41,903 --> 01:59:43,393
I'm very versatile.

817
01:59:43,605 --> 01:59:47,166
There's nothing
in the farm I wouldn't do.

818
01:59:49,244 --> 01:59:52,839
And some day,
our father...

819
01:59:53,048 --> 01:59:58,350
will be lost in his thoughts,
and I'll walk towards him...

820
01:59:58,553 --> 02:00:01,750
sit down by his side,
and very naturally...

821
02:00:01,957 --> 02:00:04,755
start the conversation
we never had.

822
02:00:06,294 --> 02:00:10,321
That's how it'll be,
and wonderful things will follow.

823
02:00:10,532 --> 02:00:13,831
Help me to lose myself in this family
love through your love, Ana.

824
02:00:14,035 --> 02:00:17,493
I can't take another
step in such darkness!

825
02:00:33,588 --> 02:00:35,715
Give me your hand, Ana!

826
02:00:37,159 --> 02:00:39,889
So many things are waiting for us...

827
02:00:42,831 --> 02:00:46,824
A single gesture of yours
will guide my attitude,

828
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:50,863
my behaviour...

829
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,767
my virtues...

830
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:59,904
Everything, Ana,
begins with your love.

831
02:01:00,715 --> 02:01:03,149
That is the seed.

832
02:01:10,425 --> 02:01:12,620
Your love for me...

833
02:01:13,595 --> 02:01:15,460
is the beginning of the world.

834
02:01:24,406 --> 02:01:26,374
Help me, Ana.

835
02:01:26,708 --> 02:01:29,006
Answer me.

836
02:01:31,913 --> 02:01:34,313
Say just one word!

837
02:01:35,116 --> 02:01:38,142
Nod your head slightly,
it's enough...

838
02:01:38,353 --> 02:01:41,288
or gently move your hair...

839
02:01:41,857 --> 02:01:43,984
or the soles of your feet!

840
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:46,285
Be kind to me, Ana!

841
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:01,607
Be kind to me before
it's too late, Ana.

842
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:05,405
Don't push me away,
don't let me go!

843
02:02:07,916 --> 02:02:10,680
I've already said, I'm tired.

844
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:15,453
I want my place
at the family table.

845
02:02:16,291 --> 02:02:18,623
The family can
be spared of our secret.

846
02:02:22,397 --> 02:02:26,629
For my part, I'd even give up
the children we would have.

847
02:02:27,602 --> 02:02:30,571
The old house is enough.

848
02:02:33,074 --> 02:02:37,773
I want to come again and feel
the intense joy of our love.

849
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:43,378
Acknowledge with me where
this passion began...

850
02:02:45,387 --> 02:02:50,620
If our severe Father made a
temple of our home...

851
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,355
Mother...

852
02:02:54,329 --> 02:02:56,889
with her lavish affection...

853
02:02:57,098 --> 02:03:00,966
only made it the house
of our damnation.

854
02:03:10,545 --> 02:03:14,538
I'm thirsty, Ana.
I want to drink!

855
02:03:14,749 --> 02:03:21,416
This wound, this fester isn't
my fault nor is this thorn...

856
02:03:21,957 --> 02:03:24,585
nor the mucus flowing through
from my pores!

857
02:03:24,793 --> 02:03:26,954
I can't be blamed
for this cursed slime...

858
02:03:27,162 --> 02:03:28,891
not for this blooming sun...

859
02:03:29,097 --> 02:03:32,624
this crazed flame.
I can't be blamed for my delirium!

860
02:03:32,834 --> 02:03:34,995
One bead on your rosary
for my passion!

861
02:03:35,203 --> 02:03:37,228
Two beads for my testicles!

862
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:40,533
All the beads for my eyes!

863
02:03:40,742 --> 02:03:43,836
Say ten rosaries for the
brother gone mad!

864
02:03:47,782 --> 02:03:50,410
I'm bathed in spleen, Ana...

865
02:03:50,885 --> 02:03:53,911
but I can still face your rejection.

866
02:04:07,869 --> 02:04:10,497
I won't hide my smile...

867
02:04:10,705 --> 02:04:15,608
if disease plagues
our herds and crops.

868
02:04:16,111 --> 02:04:18,705
I'll turn my back as everyone
rushes around.

869
02:04:18,913 --> 02:04:21,746
I'll cross my arms
when they ask for help...

870
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:23,941
cover my eyes to avoid their
wounds...

871
02:04:24,185 --> 02:04:26,813
turn a deaf ear to their cries...

872
02:04:27,022 --> 02:04:30,822
I'll shrug if the house tumbles
to the ground.

873
02:04:32,694 --> 02:04:37,688
I did not get what I wanted,
I'll have no pity for the world!

874
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,302
To love and to be loved
was all I asked...

875
02:04:42,504 --> 02:04:45,371
but I was cast off unfairly.

876
02:04:45,573 --> 02:04:47,097
I was amputated.

877
02:04:47,308 --> 02:04:51,301
I'm now in the brotherhood
of rejects...

878
02:04:51,513 --> 02:04:54,175
of the forbidden,
the unloved...

879
02:04:54,382 --> 02:04:56,680
the afflicted,
the anxious...

880
02:04:56,885 --> 02:04:59,752
the restless, the writhing...

881
02:04:59,954 --> 02:05:01,888
of the brotherhood
of tainted foreheads...

882
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:04,388
bearing the ashen scar of
sacred envy...

883
02:05:04,592 --> 02:05:06,856
of the thirsty for
equality and justice...

884
02:05:07,062 --> 02:05:10,589
those who eventually
end up bowing to Evil!

885
02:05:10,799 --> 02:05:14,667
His whispering forces us
against the current...

886
02:05:14,869 --> 02:05:18,566
his harsh breath
scratches our ears.

887
02:05:18,773 --> 02:05:21,742
Seducting us until we reject
the fragile solidity of order,

888
02:05:21,943 --> 02:05:23,342
those stone buildings,

889
02:05:23,545 --> 02:05:25,740
constructed on
weeping shoulders!

890
02:05:25,947 --> 02:05:29,747
He is the first, the only,
the sovereign!

891
02:05:33,188 --> 02:05:37,682
Your generous God
is just a servant.

892
02:05:37,892 --> 02:05:44,559
He doesn't see his own laws
fuel the Eternal Fire!

893
02:06:05,653 --> 02:06:08,144
I feel a new wave coming on...

894
02:06:12,627 --> 02:06:15,653
I feel like piercing your saints.

895
02:06:17,098 --> 02:06:19,464
Your tender angels...

896
02:06:20,702 --> 02:06:23,136
I want to bite into
the heart of your Christ!

897
02:07:10,351 --> 02:07:12,478
I'm dying...

898
02:07:14,556 --> 02:07:16,854
I'm dying.

899
02:07:35,610 --> 02:07:39,205
And the thicker
the shell is made,

900
02:07:39,414 --> 02:07:42,941
more suffering there is
under its weight.

901
02:07:43,718 --> 02:07:48,121
Instead of being safe,
they are consumed by fear.

902
02:07:49,657 --> 02:07:51,648
They hide from everyone...

903
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:54,624
not knowing that their
own eyes are withering.

904
02:07:55,697 --> 02:08:00,600
They unsuspectingly
become their own prisoners.

905
02:08:00,802 --> 02:08:04,966
They hold the key,
but they forget what it opens.

906
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:10,500
They agonize over
their personal problems...

907
02:08:10,712 --> 02:08:14,375
and never reach the cure,
for they reject the medicine.

908
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:20,610
Wisdom is found precisely in...

909
02:08:20,822 --> 02:08:23,552
not shutting oneself
in a smaller world.

910
02:08:24,325 --> 02:08:27,817
Being humble, a man
abandons his individuality...

911
02:08:28,363 --> 02:08:31,059
to become part of a greater whole...

912
02:08:32,066 --> 02:08:35,297
from where he draws his greatness.

913
02:08:37,805 --> 02:08:40,569
It is only through the family...

914
02:08:41,476 --> 02:08:45,640
that each of us shall have
a greater existence.

915
02:08:46,781 --> 02:08:52,686
Only by surrendering to the
family that each one shall forget...

916
02:08:52,887 --> 02:08:54,582
about his own problems.

917
02:08:54,789 --> 02:08:57,781
In preserving this unity...

918
02:08:57,992 --> 02:09:03,953
each of us shall reap
the finest rewards.

919
02:09:08,169 --> 02:09:10,194
Our law...

920
02:09:11,873 --> 02:09:17,072
is not to withdraw,
but to join in...

921
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:22,013
not to separate...

922
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:24,977
but to unify.

923
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:29,217
Wherever one shall be,

924
02:09:31,159 --> 02:09:34,890
his brother shall be
there as well...

925
02:12:55,496 --> 02:12:57,987
He's back.

926
02:13:00,067 --> 02:13:02,695
He's in his room.

927
02:13:27,828 --> 02:13:30,456
He who was lost...

928
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:35,494
has returned home.

929
02:13:36,938 --> 02:13:39,930
He for whom we have wept...

930
02:13:42,243 --> 02:13:45,303
has been returned to us.

931
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:51,077
Rosa!

932
02:14:22,116 --> 02:14:24,516
André is ill...

933
02:14:32,326 --> 02:14:34,988
he needs care.

934
02:14:38,599 --> 02:14:42,330
We better let him
rest for a while.

935
02:14:49,477 --> 02:14:51,604
Pedro is right.

936
02:14:51,812 --> 02:14:56,374
Meanwhile we'll prepare
his homecoming party.

937
02:15:50,638 --> 02:15:53,539
Blessed be the day of your return.

938
02:15:57,244 --> 02:16:00,611
Our home has been
wasting away, my son...

939
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:08,249
but it is once again
it is filled with joy.

940
02:16:13,527 --> 02:16:16,587
I want to talk with you.

941
02:16:18,866 --> 02:16:21,699
Later...

942
02:16:23,571 --> 02:16:27,371
once you've rested.

943
02:16:30,544 --> 02:16:32,603
For now...

944
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:39,884
take a bath,
wash off the dust...

945
02:16:41,889 --> 02:16:47,885
before sitting at the table
your mother has set to you.

946
02:17:21,962 --> 02:17:25,295
André, dear brother,
God bless you!

947
02:17:26,767 --> 02:17:29,793
Ana ran off to the chapel
right away to give thanks...!

948
02:17:31,939 --> 02:17:36,205
Mother is preparing your party,
we'll help her.

949
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:37,672
We're inviting everybody.

950
02:17:38,012 --> 02:17:40,173
- Relatives...
- Neighbours...

951
02:17:40,381 --> 02:17:43,942
...friends, cousins, everyone!

952
02:17:48,889 --> 02:17:50,117
But for us in the family...

953
02:17:50,324 --> 02:17:52,690
the greatest joy is
to have you back.

954
02:17:54,361 --> 02:17:58,297
You've brought back twice
the joy we'd lost.

955
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:06,737
Now, let's wash up.
Mother can't see you like this.

956
02:19:15,376 --> 02:19:18,903
My heart...

957
02:19:19,113 --> 02:19:22,276
is acking to see
your scarred face, my son.

958
02:19:23,817 --> 02:19:27,150
Don't hide anything
from your father, be clear.

959
02:19:29,957 --> 02:19:34,860
To make yourself understood,
your ideas must be organized:

960
02:19:35,062 --> 02:19:39,123
Word by word.

961
02:19:40,367 --> 02:19:43,131
In all order there
is a seed of disorder...

962
02:19:44,572 --> 02:19:48,508
in clarity, a seed of obscurity.
That's why I talk like I do.

963
02:19:48,909 --> 02:19:50,501
For example,
I could be very clear and say...

964
02:19:50,711 --> 02:19:52,474
that I had never thought of, ever,
until I changed my mind...

965
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:54,807
I never thought of leaving home.

966
02:19:55,015 --> 02:19:57,142
I could be clear and say as well
that I never thought...

967
02:19:57,351 --> 02:19:59,819
neither before
nor after I left...

968
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,580
I'd find elsewhere
what I wasn't given here.

969
02:20:03,157 --> 02:20:06,024
And what weren't you given?

970
02:20:07,895 --> 02:20:10,363
I wanted to have my place
at the family table.

971
02:20:11,231 --> 02:20:15,292
So that's why
you abandoned us?

972
02:20:15,502 --> 02:20:20,303
Because you didn't have
a seat at the table?

973
02:20:20,507 --> 02:20:22,941
I have never
abandoned you, Father.

974
02:20:23,811 --> 02:20:26,405
All I did, when I went away,
was to spare you from watching me...

975
02:20:26,614 --> 02:20:28,809
surviving on my own guts.

976
02:20:29,016 --> 02:20:30,176
Yet there was always
bread on our table...

977
02:20:30,384 --> 02:20:32,318
and you were never forbidden
to sit down with the family...

978
02:20:32,519 --> 02:20:33,451
on the contrary...

979
02:20:33,654 --> 02:20:38,717
all we ever wanted was to have
you at our table.

980
02:20:38,926 --> 02:20:40,393
I'm not talking about
that kind of food.

981
02:20:40,594 --> 02:20:44,860
Share only that bread may in
some cases be just a cruelty...

982
02:20:45,065 --> 02:20:47,192
it would only
perpetuate my hunger.

983
02:20:47,401 --> 02:20:48,459
What are you talking about?

984
02:20:48,669 --> 02:20:50,034
- It doesn't matter.
- This was a blasphemy!

985
02:20:50,237 --> 02:20:52,569
No. Father this
wasn't blasphemy.

986
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,406
I spoke like a saint
for the first time in my life.

987
02:20:59,246 --> 02:21:01,771
You're not well, son.

988
02:21:04,251 --> 02:21:08,187
A few days work with your
brothers will quieten your pride...

989
02:21:08,656 --> 02:21:11,648
you'll recover your health
very soon.

990
02:21:11,859 --> 02:21:13,292
I'm not interested
in the health you talk about.

991
02:21:13,494 --> 02:21:15,155
There's always a seed
of disease in it...

992
02:21:15,362 --> 02:21:17,830
just as there's a strong seed
of health in my illness.

993
02:21:18,032 --> 02:21:19,863
Forget your whims, son.

994
02:21:20,067 --> 02:21:22,297
Mixing up our ideas is pointless.

995
02:21:22,503 --> 02:21:25,995
Don't try to keep me out
of your problems.

996
02:21:26,206 --> 02:21:28,731
I don't believe in the discussion
of my problems.

997
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:31,869
I don't believe in
exchanging ideas.

998
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:34,274
One plant can never
see the other.

999
02:21:34,481 --> 02:21:36,745
Conversation is
very important, son.

1000
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:40,181
Every word,
indeed is a seed.

1001
02:21:40,587 --> 02:21:43,147
If I lived ten lives,
I'd still think that talking...

1002
02:21:43,357 --> 02:21:45,757
is like an overripe fruit.

1003
02:21:46,827 --> 02:21:49,261
You're young, naturally selfish...

1004
02:21:49,463 --> 02:21:52,057
you think only of the fruit
when planting.

1005
02:21:52,633 --> 02:21:55,796
The harvest isn't the greatest
reward, when we sow...

1006
02:21:56,003 --> 02:22:00,064
we are grateful just by knowing
our lives are meaningful.

1007
02:22:00,274 --> 02:22:04,438
There is glory in the long
cultivation...

1008
02:22:04,645 --> 02:22:06,272
a valuable glory
we hand down...

1009
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:09,108
if indeed,
that is the legacy we bestow.

1010
02:22:09,316 --> 02:22:12,342
- Father, sowing is not enough.
- Of course not, son.

1011
02:22:12,553 --> 02:22:15,420
If others are to reap
what we've sown today...

1012
02:22:15,622 --> 02:22:18,284
we now reap
what's been sown before us.

1013
02:22:18,492 --> 02:22:21,928
That's life,
such is the current of life.

1014
02:22:22,129 --> 02:22:24,359
I'm already disenchanted
with the current.

1015
02:22:25,799 --> 02:22:29,326
Those who sow and don't reap,
still reap what they did not plant.

1016
02:22:29,536 --> 02:22:32,061
I didn't get my share
of the legacy, Father.

1017
02:22:33,073 --> 02:22:35,268
Why forge on?

1018
02:22:35,476 --> 02:22:38,809
My hands are already tied,
I'm not going to bind my feet.

1019
02:22:39,012 --> 02:22:40,912
So, I don't care how
the wind blows.

1020
02:22:41,115 --> 02:22:42,104
I don't see what difference
it makes.

1021
02:22:42,316 --> 02:22:45,012
Things can move forward
or backward.

1022
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:53,390
I don't believe the little
I understand here.

1023
02:22:53,594 --> 02:22:57,052
You can't expect a prisoner to serve
happily in the jailer's house.

1024
02:22:58,165 --> 02:22:59,723
It's absurd to demand
a loving embrace...

1025
02:22:59,933 --> 02:23:02,128
from one whose arms
we've amputated.

1026
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:05,104
Or worse,
a person with maimed hands...

1027
02:23:05,305 --> 02:23:08,035
clapping his feet at his torturer.

1028
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:13,104
The ugly, bowing to the beautiful
becomes even uglier.

1029
02:23:14,181 --> 02:23:16,149
- Go on.
- The poor man applauding...

1030
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,612
the rich becomes poorer...

1031
02:23:17,818 --> 02:23:19,979
the small man,
smaller for applauding the great...

1032
02:23:20,187 --> 02:23:22,815
the short man, shorter,
for applauding the tall, and so on.

1033
02:23:24,057 --> 02:23:26,958
I can't embrace values
that crush me.

1034
02:23:27,594 --> 02:23:30,688
It's a sad game to live in
other people's skin.

1035
02:23:31,098 --> 02:23:35,899
The victim crying for his oppressor
becomes a prisoner twice over.

1036
02:23:41,141 --> 02:23:44,804
What you say is very strange.

1037
02:23:46,847 --> 02:23:49,145
It's a strange world, Father...

1038
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:51,879
which only reunites by dividing.

1039
02:23:54,054 --> 02:23:57,217
Built on accidents,
there's no self-sustained order.

1040
02:23:58,792 --> 02:24:00,282
Merit is spurious, Father.

1041
02:24:00,494 --> 02:24:03,019
I wasn't the one
who planted that seed.

1042
02:24:03,764 --> 02:24:06,062
What are you trying to say?

1043
02:24:07,768 --> 02:24:10,134
I'm not trying to say anything.

1044
02:24:14,341 --> 02:24:18,437
- My son, you're terribly disturbed.
- No, father, I'm not disturbed.

1045
02:24:18,645 --> 02:24:23,514
- Who were you talking about?
- No one in particular.

1046
02:24:25,586 --> 02:24:28,783
I was only thinking
of hopeless cases...

1047
02:24:29,990 --> 02:24:32,652
of those who moan with reason...

1048
02:24:34,328 --> 02:24:39,231
of those who cry out
in thirst, passion...

1049
02:24:39,967 --> 02:24:42,265
and solitude...

1050
02:24:45,906 --> 02:24:48,568
I was thinking only of them.

1051
02:24:56,583 --> 02:24:59,677
I want to understand you, son...

1052
02:25:00,254 --> 02:25:02,415
but I don't understand anymore.

1053
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:07,183
I'm mixing things up as I speak,
my words are rushing, but I'm lucid.

1054
02:25:07,394 --> 02:25:09,692
If there's chaff, there's plenty
of grain in what I say.

1055
02:25:09,897 --> 02:25:11,262
But you're hiding your meaning.

1056
02:25:11,465 --> 02:25:13,990
I've said I don't
discuss my problems.

1057
02:25:14,801 --> 02:25:17,292
It's dangerous to cross
boundaries.

1058
02:25:17,504 --> 02:25:19,529
It takes strength to face reality...

1059
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:23,369
you'd be insane to think
your family hostile.

1060
02:25:23,577 --> 02:25:26,444
Reality isn't the same
for everyone.

1061
02:25:26,647 --> 02:25:29,775
I only know any place is hostile,
insofar as the right to live is denied.

1062
02:25:29,983 --> 02:25:32,975
There's no hostility in this house,
you're not denied the right to live...

1063
02:25:33,186 --> 02:25:35,620
such thoughts are
inadmissible.

1064
02:25:35,822 --> 02:25:38,450
- That's one point of view.
- It's not a point of view!

1065
02:25:38,659 --> 02:25:40,490
We've lived for you children.

1066
02:25:40,694 --> 02:25:44,494
No one in need has lacked
support in this family.

1067
02:25:44,698 --> 02:25:47,098
- Father, sir, you misunderstood me.
- How can I understand you, André?

1068
02:25:47,301 --> 02:25:50,793
You're stubborn,
I don't understand that.

1069
02:25:51,004 --> 02:25:54,838
Where else could you share
your problems?

1070
02:25:55,042 --> 02:25:57,636
Nowhere, much less here!

1071
02:25:59,379 --> 02:26:02,075
Our family life has been
precarious!

1072
02:26:03,216 --> 02:26:06,185
You set impossible limits!

1073
02:26:08,822 --> 02:26:12,155
Father, you just said every
word is a seed...

1074
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:14,350
they contain life, energy...

1075
02:26:15,162 --> 02:26:17,460
and may even contains
an explosive force,

1076
02:26:17,664 --> 02:26:19,256
we run great risks
when we talk.

1077
02:26:19,633 --> 02:26:22,261
Don't interpret me with
suspicion and levity!

1078
02:26:22,469 --> 02:26:24,937
You know you can count
on our love!

1079
02:26:25,138 --> 02:26:27,333
The love we've learned here...

1080
02:26:27,541 --> 02:26:30,339
I discovered later,
doesn't know what it wants.

1081
02:26:30,544 --> 02:26:32,978
It's now just a mere hindrance.

1082
02:26:34,081 --> 02:26:36,709
Love doesn't always unite,
it can separate.

1083
02:26:36,917 --> 02:26:40,876
I could say love in the family
may not be as grand as we think!

1084
02:26:41,088 --> 02:26:43,147
Be quiet!

1085
02:26:46,827 --> 02:26:50,820
Enough of your eccentricity!

1086
02:26:51,031 --> 02:26:52,362
I don't think I'm eccentric.

1087
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:56,064
Still, it doesn't matter what I say.

1088
02:26:56,269 --> 02:27:00,672
Since you think I'm eccentric, who
cares if I'm as plain as the doves?

1089
02:27:02,776 --> 02:27:05,711
If I set an olive
branch on this table...

1090
02:27:05,912 --> 02:27:07,709
you might only see a thistle!

1091
02:27:08,982 --> 02:27:13,009
I'll have no provocation
at this table!

1092
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:14,949
Enough of your pride!

1093
02:27:15,155 --> 02:27:17,146
Control the snake
under your tongue!

1094
02:27:17,357 --> 02:27:19,291
Ignore the devil murmuring
in your ear!

1095
02:27:19,493 --> 02:27:23,953
Be humble in your manner, André,
answer me as a son should!

1096
02:27:24,631 --> 02:27:28,567
- Be clear as a man should be!
- Lf I'm confusing.

1097
02:27:28,769 --> 02:27:31,897
Stop the confusion for once
and for all!

1098
02:27:32,105 --> 02:27:35,939
- Lf I avoid being clearer...
- Be quiet! Be quiet!

1099
02:27:41,014 --> 02:27:44,415
Our water doesn't
flow from this fountain...

1100
02:27:46,253 --> 02:27:49,689
nor our light,
from this darkness.

1101
02:27:49,890 --> 02:27:52,358
Your haughty words aren't
going to destroy now.

1102
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:55,926
What it's taken
millenniums to build!

1103
02:27:56,797 --> 02:27:59,732
No one in our family will
mix words as they speak...

1104
02:27:59,933 --> 02:28:03,699
tangle ideas,
grind everything to dust.

1105
02:28:03,904 --> 02:28:07,772
Because if you open your eyes
too wide, you'll be blinded.

1106
02:28:07,974 --> 02:28:13,913
Furthermore,
pretentious enlightenment...

1107
02:28:14,114 --> 02:28:16,309
is as blinding as darkness.

1108
02:28:16,516 --> 02:28:20,384
Never try to set a new course
to avoid the unavoidable.

1109
02:28:20,587 --> 02:28:23,613
Let no one confuse that
which cannot be confused:

1110
02:28:23,824 --> 02:28:27,282
The fruit bearing
tree with the barren...

1111
02:28:27,494 --> 02:28:30,361
nor the seed that multiplies,
with dry grain!

1112
02:28:30,564 --> 02:28:34,159
The simplicity of our daily life,
with barren thoughts.

1113
02:28:34,367 --> 02:28:37,097
I'm telling you
to hold your tongue!

1114
02:28:37,804 --> 02:28:41,399
I won't have depraved wisdom
contaminating our family!

1115
02:28:43,677 --> 02:28:47,010
It was not love, after all...

1116
02:28:49,549 --> 02:28:51,642
but pride...

1117
02:28:51,852 --> 02:28:53,649
scorn...

1118
02:28:53,854 --> 02:28:56,322
and selfishness...

1119
02:28:56,857 --> 02:29:00,156
that brought
you back home...

1120
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:02,794
That's enough, Yohana!

1121
02:29:04,865 --> 02:29:07,663
Spare our son!

1122
02:29:13,006 --> 02:29:16,339
I'm tired, Father.

1123
02:29:16,543 --> 02:29:18,909
Forgive me!

1124
02:29:28,121 --> 02:29:31,386
I have not returned
with a proud heart...

1125
02:29:33,093 --> 02:29:36,494
I've come home humble
and submissive.

1126
02:29:37,864 --> 02:29:40,025
I have no more illusions...

1127
02:29:42,202 --> 02:29:45,194
I know all about
loneliness now...

1128
02:29:46,139 --> 02:29:48,630
I know about misery...

1129
02:29:50,043 --> 02:29:53,740
And I also know now, I should
never have taken one step from home.

1130
02:29:55,115 --> 02:29:57,709
From now on,
I want to be like my brothers:

1131
02:29:58,518 --> 02:30:01,681
I'm going to submit to
my tasks...

1132
02:30:03,823 --> 02:30:07,259
I'll be out in the fields
before sunrise...

1133
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:10,361
and I'll stay long after sunset.

1134
02:30:14,234 --> 02:30:16,634
My work will be my religion...

1135
02:30:18,371 --> 02:30:21,101
my fatigue will be my euphoria.

1136
02:30:23,777 --> 02:30:26,507
I'll help maintain the family union.

1137
02:30:33,653 --> 02:30:40,115
From the bottom of my heart,
I want to deserve...

1138
02:30:43,530 --> 02:30:45,054
all your love.

1139
02:31:03,817 --> 02:31:06,251
Your words...

1140
02:31:08,088 --> 02:31:12,354
have touched my heart,
dear son.

1141
02:31:16,997 --> 02:31:19,488
The tears of joy...

1142
02:31:23,536 --> 02:31:27,973
erase the bitterness
of your absence.

1143
02:31:28,808 --> 02:31:33,472
I feel a new light on this table.

1144
02:31:35,315 --> 02:31:39,945
For a minute I thought I had sown...

1145
02:31:41,154 --> 02:31:45,887
on barren land...

1146
02:31:46,092 --> 02:31:51,689
on gravel,
or on a field of thorns.

1147
02:31:58,471 --> 02:32:00,735
But no.

1148
02:32:02,742 --> 02:32:09,204
Tomorrow we'll celebrate
the once blind son...

1149
02:32:09,783 --> 02:32:12,581
who can now see.

1150
02:32:17,157 --> 02:32:21,150
So, go rest.

1151
02:32:23,897 --> 02:32:25,888
My son.

1152
02:32:32,405 --> 02:32:35,033
My dear son.

1153
02:32:57,897 --> 02:32:59,956
My heart.

1154
02:33:04,237 --> 02:33:06,535
My eyes.

1155
02:33:09,709 --> 02:33:12,234
My lamb.

1156
02:34:02,061 --> 02:34:03,688
The box...

1157
02:34:03,897 --> 02:34:06,024
my box.

1158
02:34:20,046 --> 02:34:21,980
Lula...!

1159
02:34:27,887 --> 02:34:29,878
Lula...!

1160
02:34:36,396 --> 02:34:38,830
Lula...!

1161
02:34:48,541 --> 02:34:51,032
- Were you asleep?
- Of course.

1162
02:34:51,244 --> 02:34:54,145
Couldn't you tell?

1163
02:34:54,347 --> 02:34:55,974
I wanted to have a little
chat with you.

1164
02:34:56,182 --> 02:34:58,946
- That's why I woke you up.
- Chat about what?

1165
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:02,754
- Lula, I've just come home.
- So what?

1166
02:35:05,625 --> 02:35:07,490
I thought you'd be happy...

1167
02:35:07,694 --> 02:35:09,992
Why?

1168
02:35:11,397 --> 02:35:14,264
- I don't know, I just thought so.
- Well, your thought was wrong.

1169
02:35:16,970 --> 02:35:19,097
If that's how you're going to talk,
then we'd better just forget about it.

1170
02:35:19,305 --> 02:35:22,672
You shouldn't have
started, good-night.

1171
02:35:29,782 --> 02:35:32,080
What's wrong with you, Lula?

1172
02:35:34,254 --> 02:35:38,350
- I just wanted to talk like friends.
- What's wrong?

1173
02:35:38,558 --> 02:35:41,118
What's wrong,
you have the nerve to ask?

1174
02:35:41,327 --> 02:35:44,387
I've been here waiting for you
for over an hour.

1175
02:35:44,597 --> 02:35:46,155
A whole hour, André!

1176
02:35:46,366 --> 02:35:48,425
Now you feed
me this line about friends...

1177
02:35:48,635 --> 02:35:50,159
- I didn't know, Lula.
- You didn't know.

1178
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:52,565
Where else would I be?

1179
02:35:52,772 --> 02:35:55,605
I wasn't out in the pasture,
with the sheep.

1180
02:36:02,081 --> 02:36:04,276
Okay, Lula...
Good- night, then.

1181
02:36:07,453 --> 02:36:09,614
I'm running away, André!

1182
02:36:09,822 --> 02:36:12,814
Tomorrow, during your party.

1183
02:36:16,462 --> 02:36:18,623
I can't stand
this prison anymore.

1184
02:36:19,065 --> 02:36:22,523
I can't stand Father's
sermons, the work...

1185
02:36:22,735 --> 02:36:24,999
nor Pedro watching over me.

1186
02:36:25,204 --> 02:36:27,502
I want to be in charge
of my life, André.

1187
02:36:28,508 --> 02:36:31,739
I wasn't born to live here.
I don't like to work the land...

1188
02:36:31,945 --> 02:36:34,675
not in the sunshine,
much less in the rain.

1189
02:36:34,881 --> 02:36:38,112
I can't stand the boring life
on this filthy farm!

1190
02:36:38,318 --> 02:36:40,718
I said not to talk so loud!

1191
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:49,251
As soon as you left, André...

1192
02:36:51,064 --> 02:36:54,158
I spent all my time sitting up
on the gate...

1193
02:36:56,102 --> 02:36:58,570
dreaming of the open road...

1194
02:37:00,406 --> 02:37:03,341
Iooking out as far as my
eyes could see.

1195
02:37:04,477 --> 02:37:07,446
I couldn't take my mind off
your adventures.

1196
02:37:10,216 --> 02:37:14,585
I want to see lots of cities,
travel all over the world.

1197
02:37:14,787 --> 02:37:16,482
I want to exchange my
nosebag for a backpack...

1198
02:37:16,689 --> 02:37:20,750
travel from place to place,
like a vagabond!

1199
02:37:23,529 --> 02:37:25,929
I'm leaving never to return!

1200
02:37:26,699 --> 02:37:28,929
I'm not giving in to
begging, André!

1201
02:37:29,135 --> 02:37:32,434
I'm brave, I'm not going
to fail like you!

1202
02:37:47,453 --> 02:37:49,785
What are you doing, André?!

1203
02:37:52,792 --> 02:37:54,157
What are you doing, André?!

1204
02:38:07,513 --> 02:38:09,140
Time...

1205
02:38:11,183 --> 02:38:14,619
time and its
inflammable waters.

1206
02:38:15,921 --> 02:38:21,917
The tireless, wide, flowing river.

1207
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:28,325
Father used to say,
"Woe unto him..."

1208
02:38:28,534 --> 02:38:31,230
who tries to hold
back its movement...

1209
02:38:32,471 --> 02:38:35,736
for he shall be
consumed by its waters.

1210
02:38:36,542 --> 02:38:39,943
Woe unto him,
the wizard's apprentice...

1211
02:38:40,146 --> 02:38:42,637
who tears open his shirt
to confront it...

1212
02:38:42,848 --> 02:38:45,840
he will succumb to its flames.

1213
02:38:48,254 --> 02:38:50,745
Time and its changes...

1214
02:38:50,956 --> 02:38:55,825
present in everything,
in every inch, in every grain...

1215
02:38:56,896 --> 02:38:59,456
and also present,
with its seconds...

1216
02:38:59,665 --> 02:39:03,192
in every letter of this
passionate story of mine...

1217
02:39:03,903 --> 02:39:07,100
transforming the dark
night of my homecoming...

1218
02:39:07,306 --> 02:39:11,037
into a bright morning.

1219
02:41:36,889 --> 02:41:38,948
That was how Ana...

1220
02:41:39,158 --> 02:41:42,616
draped in the vulgar
trinkets from my box...

1221
02:41:42,828 --> 02:41:44,921
caught my party like a storm...

1222
02:41:56,175 --> 02:41:59,736
sweeping the dance circle
with her diseased body.

1223
02:41:59,945 --> 02:42:04,848
She controlled everyone
with her violent spirit.

1224
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:24,133
She knew what she was doing...

1225
02:42:24,336 --> 02:42:29,000
with her moist dance
and soaking body.

1226
02:42:30,142 --> 02:42:31,609
She hurled me impetuously...

1227
02:42:31,810 --> 02:42:37,646
into bizarre ecstasy...

1228
02:42:37,850 --> 02:42:42,651
until I saw my legs to one side...

1229
02:42:42,855 --> 02:42:45,187
and arms to the other.

1230
02:42:45,391 --> 02:42:47,359
My amputated arms and legs...

1231
02:42:47,559 --> 02:42:50,153
struggled to regain their
ancient unity.

1232
02:42:56,602 --> 02:42:58,297
Oh versatile devil!

1233
02:44:12,277 --> 02:44:14,040
No, Father!

1234
02:44:14,513 --> 02:44:16,447
What horror, no!

1235
02:44:22,287 --> 02:44:24,118
What horror, no!

1236
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:26,856
Where is the family's union?

1237
02:44:29,027 --> 02:44:30,619
Father!

1238
02:45:08,167 --> 02:45:12,467
Time is the greatest
treasure known to man.

1239
02:45:15,440 --> 02:45:17,601
Although not consumable...

1240
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:22,570
time is our most
valuable nourishment.

1241
02:45:24,016 --> 02:45:30,353
Time is immeasurable,
yet it is our greatest gift...

1242
02:45:32,457 --> 02:45:36,518
it has neither
beginning nor end.

1243
02:45:40,299 --> 02:45:46,966
A miser who compares his
worth with his wealth is poor...

1244
02:45:48,207 --> 02:45:52,837
so is the man who spreads
himself out over vast lands.

1245
02:45:53,312 --> 02:45:55,280
The only rich man
is the man who has.

1246
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:00,508
Learned to live piously
and humbly with time...

1247
02:46:01,453 --> 02:46:06,789
approaching it gently,
never disrupting its current...

1248
02:46:06,992 --> 02:46:12,988
always welcoming it wisely
to receive its favors, not its wrath.

1249
02:46:15,334 --> 02:46:20,636
Life is essentially,
held in balance by this supreme gift.

1250
02:46:22,140 --> 02:46:26,668
When seeking,
if you know when to wait.

1251
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:29,780
And how much time to
give things...

1252
02:46:30,816 --> 02:46:36,311
you won't trip up in error.

1253
02:46:37,322 --> 02:46:43,818
Only the true measure of time
reveals the true nature of things.

1254
