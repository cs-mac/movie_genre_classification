1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,358
Hello.
- Hi.

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,353
Have a seat.

3
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,236
Did you find us all right?
- Yes.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,756
Everything okay?
- Yes.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,716
Coffee?
- Yes, please.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,953
Should I pour you a cup?
- Yes, please.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,880
How about some cognac?
- No, thank you.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,077
Makes it easier to talk.

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,513
Help yourself.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,196
So you're applying for a job
as a window dresser? - Yes.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,149
I was trained at Karstadt.
- I see.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,111
What did you do at Karstadt?
- I decorated display windows.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,239
According to the seasons:
Easter, Christmas...

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,358
In all the departments?
- Yes.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,435
Sports and children's fashion...

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,718
How would you approach your job
today?

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,950
I'm a team-player.
- I see.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,951
What does that mean to you?

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,351
I always got along well
with my colleagues.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,915
Being a team player doesn't mean
everybody's nice to each other.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,791
It means you can cope with conflicts
and find solutions...

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,954
I know how to do that.
Sorry I think...

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,238
Okay, let's stop here.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,074
Good, Herr Kannenberg.
- Job interviews

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,870
were part of my job.
- What did you notice?

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,113
Herr Jansen?

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,590
I didn't think her body language
was quite right.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,150
What do you mean?
- She's very nervous.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,473
She's on the edge of her chair,
as if she wants to slide down

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,793
And just disappear.
- What do the others think?

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,830
She was quite unsure of herself.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,630
You have to sell yourself
when you apply for a job.

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,235
When he asked, "Why are you here",
she said, "I'm a team-player".

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,270
She flunked as a team player.
She doesn't even know what it means.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,397
SUMMER IN BERLIN

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,077
Nothing beats
a good old cup of coffee.

37
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,471
That's tea, Oskar!

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,952
My mother just stopped by.

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,351
She stood next to the stove.

40
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,115
We talked about lots of stuff.

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,556
Your mother died ages ago.

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,596
I wonder which one of us is nuts.

43
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,432
Me 'cause I see my mother?

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,868
Or you 'cause you don't see her?

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,994
See you tomorrow, Oskar. How could
your mother stop by anyway?

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,797
You can shut the windows
and doors tightly...

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,710
...radio gets in.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,189
Use the whole chair.
So you're not squirming about.

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,079
Go ahead and cross your legs.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,553
You have to when you wear
such a short skirt.

51
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,234
It's better.

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,392
You nicely sidestepped
the cognac trap.

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,758
To all of you: never accept any.
It's a popular trick.

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,153
After writing 40 to 80 applications
you've finally got a job interview.

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,552
It'd be a shame to spoil it.

56
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,678
It begins even before you enter.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,913
You could run into anyone
in the hall or elevator.

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,950
One false move and you're done for.
It's quite a rude awakening.

59
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,159
Your hands...

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,959
Where should you put them?

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,033
Don't drink any coffee
if your hands are shaking.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,590
Maintain eye contact.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,993
Frau Engel kept looking away.
It shows how insecure you are.

64
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,119
Look at the interviewer.
It makes you more secure

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,192
and believable.

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,158
Okay?
- Yes.

67
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,155
You're a good girl.

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,791
You have good skin.

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,237
I'm Nicole Pawelski,
but they call me Nike.

70
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,108
Okay, then get me the accordion.

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,393
Why doesn't Ilona come any more?
- She quit.

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,310
Ilona always read to me.
You can make the bed now.

73
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,554
Excuse me.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,193
Why does this cost 120 euros?
- "Climacool 3" is a top-level shoe,

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,433
with cushions in front and in back.

76
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,910
The sole is uniformly
soft and springy.

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,231
It deadens the impact
during running.

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,437
Climacool technology,

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,274
the best running shoe
idea in 20 years.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,798
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

81
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,634
That makes it expensive,
but kids love it.

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,589
So Mom's just got
to bear it, right?

83
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,157
Hi there. It's us again.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,035
I've heard you like my girlfriend?
- Are you nuts?

85
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,716
She's quite good-looking.
Slender and...

86
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,712
What?
No, don't need any medicine.

87
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,071
Come on,
tell us your first name.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,269
He hung up.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,639
Know what? He'll be dreaming of you.
- Or of you. - Or of us.

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,109
I can only use a man
who gets along with Max.

91
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,670
I just need to find one
who gets along with me.

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,958
Max wants new sneakers,
the most expensive ones.

93
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,789
The problem is, we're out of cola.

94
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,189
We wanted to go swimming, didn't we?

95
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,869
It's so nice here with you, Nike.

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,272
We're so above it all.

97
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,676
Can you imagine
living with someone forever?

98
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,957
I don't believe in it.

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,837
I read that the brain produces
a sexual transmitter. It's a fact.

100
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,755
And after a while it's gone.
All at once.

101
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,952
The right ones are usually
the wrong ones. Know what I mean?

102
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,236
I'm actually quite normal.

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,510
It's not even getting dark tonight.

104
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,674
Nah - it's getting light already.

105
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,349
Morning.

106
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,594
Morning.

107
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,596
Good morning, Mom!

108
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,269
Oh, Max!

109
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,879
Nike and I lost track of time
chatting on the balcony.

110
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,192
Sorry.
- It's okay.

111
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,834
That's sweet of you.

112
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,839
Bye, Mom.

113
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,269
Bye.

114
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,351
Hello, Herr Neumann. It's me.

115
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,477
Okay, Herr Neumann. Here we go.

116
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,711
Let's turn around.

117
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,236
Okay... great.

118
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,470
I have to go to school.

119
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,156
Oh no. Shit!

120
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,348
Katrin!

121
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,192
Shit! For Chrissake!

122
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,794
Great!

123
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,708
Hey, what's wrong with you?

124
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,394
You nuts or what?

125
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,713
You can't sleep-walk on the street
You gotta first look left, then right.

126
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,588
You were speeding.
It's a 30-km zone.

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,991
Hey, can you brake normal or not?!
- Who are you?

128
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,358
I slammed into you...
- You ran into me,

129
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,355
so it's your fault. - Not if you drive
like a Grand Prix driver in puberty!

130
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,389
I always stop for women...
- First you drive like a bat outta hell,

131
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,553
then slam on the brakes!
- Not in that tone.

132
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,077
What tone?
You just totaled my car! - Hey!

133
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,038
Hey! Hey!
Did you see me or not?

134
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,556
Sure, how could I miss you?!

135
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,953
How big's my rig gotta be? - You jammed
on the brakes like an idiot!

136
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,917
Should I back up?
- You totaled my car! - Fuck off, man!

137
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,469
Kiss my ass, idiot!

138
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,990
Can we go? - No! You've got to wait
for the cops! You're my witnesses!

139
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,073
I ran into him from behind.
- Hey pal, you're too loud.

140
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,596
Don't gimme that bullshit!

141
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,672
Cut the dumb nails if you can't manage.
- I'm almost done.

142
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,312
Tina, the check!

143
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,470
Oh no, look who's coming.

144
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,874
It wasn't his fault.

145
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,470
Nobody blamed him.

146
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,518
You think he's good-looking?

147
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,636
I'm just observing him.

148
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,995
11.80, please.

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,312
Make it 12.
- Thanks. Have a nice day. - You, too.

150
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,474
Shall we go?
- I'm going to the restroom.

151
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,557
I wanted to thank you
for braking so hard.

152
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,110
Nothing happened.
- No.

153
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,434
But something could've happened.

154
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,431
Something can always happen.

155
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,158
Weren't we leaving?

156
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,717
The coffee's gone!
- Nobody could've stolen it.

157
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,112
It can't run away by itself.

158
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,790
You gotta flush the toilet!

159
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,873
Does anyone visit this place
besides you?

160
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,312
During the war they shot a man
for stealing a jerry can of gasoline.

161
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,678
I saw it myself.
- I know.

162
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,232
Were you there, too?
- No, you told me about it.

163
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,914
Right.

164
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,915
How could you have been there?

165
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,917
It was cold, and you marched
into the dunes to shoot him.

166
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,914
But you didn't aim at him.
- But

167
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,359
the captain cried out,
"The German sword

168
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,197
is still sharp
in the fifth year of war!"

169
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,830
You have to sign here.

170
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,710
What am I signing?
- That I was here.

171
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,958
Frau Engel.
- Hello. - Hi.

172
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,873
Have a seat.

173
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,952
Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks, yes.

174
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,150
Could you hold this, please?

175
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,558
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

176
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,315
Cream?
- Yes. Thank you.

177
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,119
Would you like a piece of cheesecake?

178
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,150
No, thank you. - You don't mind?
- Please, enjoy. - Thanks.

179
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,070
So you're forty?
- Thirty-nine and a half.

180
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,394
You've worked in fashion before?
- Yes.

181
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,635
Could you work outside Berlin
for days at a time? - Basically, yes.

182
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,318
Why are you staring at me?
Do I scare you? - No.

183
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,679
I'm looking forward to working for you.
- You know what's involved, right?

184
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,196
Dressing the dummies,

185
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,272
painting their lips,
gluing on eyelashes,

186
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,992
putting on wigs, creating certain types,
so customers actually see themselves.

187
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,277
Can you picture doing all that?
- Yes.

188
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,796
Although at the moment

189
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,111
they prefer women without heads.

190
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,670
Fur coats - almost no face.

191
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,198
Expensive clothes - almost no face.
Puts a dent in sales,

192
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,196
but it won't last long. Normal women
want to see themselves reflected.

193
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,592
They want to know
if an outfit looks good on them.

194
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,434
I mean,
how would you like to look?

195
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,434
I could give you...

196
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,868
the job now, but I have a stack
of applications I want to look at.

197
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,714
I'll let you know, okay?

198
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,270
Hi, Charly.

199
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,396
Hey.

200
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,198
I knew you'd come this way.
I thought I'd jog with you.

201
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,556
I don't mind.

202
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,152
How far are we running?

203
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,316
Down this street,
then right on Sonnenburger,

204
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,235
across the tracks, then left
on Dänisch. At the Chinese restaurant,

205
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,919
we cross the bridge and take
Schwedter to Gleim and then back again.

206
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,710
We can talk on the way.

207
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,430
"Can two young people

208
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,233
who have truly fallen in love
ever experience a more beautiful

209
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,757
morning... than the one

210
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,720
that follows
their confession of love?"

211
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,078
You can't charge me
for time you spend reading.

212
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,630
I put two oranges in the fridge...

213
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,477
...and the dishes in the cupboard.
- I could listen to it over and over.

214
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,393
We pay lots of money
for your care, Mama.

215
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,189
Where's the magnifying glass
I got for you?

216
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,519
Now you can read by yourself.

217
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,038
"The girl wraps her two soft arms
around his neck,

218
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,038
pulling him, with an indescribable...

219
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,151
feeling of bliss, toward her body."

220
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,997
You see? It works.

221
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,433
Mom, that's no reason to despair.

222
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,397
You're together,
you can help each other.

223
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,553
I'm sure the neighbors
will help, too.

224
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,473
Yes, we're healthy.
Just a minute..., Max!

225
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,916
Just a second... Come here.

226
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,515
It's Grandma.

227
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,917
Hi, Grandma. I'm fine. How are you?

228
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,233
Yes, I will. No, I won't.

229
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,712
I won't forget. Okay, bye, Grandma.

230
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,519
Bye!

231
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,636
I never understand Grandma's dialect.

232
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,474
Why the afternoon shower?

233
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,270
What about those sneakers?

234
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,198
Do you know
how expensive they are?

235
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,876
How about other shoes?
- I don't want any others!

236
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,238
Don't tell me you can't run
in any other shoes.

237
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,917
This is the painter.

238
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,556
I just painted what I saw.
The buildings were so "East German."

239
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,394
To me it's just a building.

240
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,553
Sure, why shouldn't there be
a building in the picture?

241
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,428
Doesn't matter what's in the picture,
it's the painter's spirit that counts.

242
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,035
I painted it a long time ago.

243
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,558
Did you study? - I'm a window dresser.
I just paint for fun.

244
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,559
You can leave it here.
I'll hang it on the wall.

245
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,632
How much are you asking?

246
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,712
I asked some people...
- 120.

247
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,197
You'll never get that much.

248
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,994
You don't want the painting.
You wanna screw my girlfriend.

249
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,199
"You wanna screw my girlfriend!"

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,511
Is it past midnight yet?

251
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,356
It's my ex-husband's birthday.
Can I use your phone?

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,796
"Sorry, nobody's in, and our little cat
can't talk, so leave a message."

253
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,191
Is that his new chick?

254
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,556
Hello, here's another little cat.

255
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,190
I wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

256
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,354
Have a nice day.
I hope you catch every new disease.

257
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,436
All the best from me, too.

258
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,951
"Again she feels a man's hands
grab her arms,

259
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,998
and a voice close to her asks,

260
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,198
'Does my lover not yet know
she's truly a woman? '

261
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,355
Two pairs of lips carry on
a silent but intense conversation."

262
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,116
That's how it was with me.
Similar to that.

263
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,829
Read it again!
- There, the kitchen's done.

264
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,718
But I'm still here.

265
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,588
Which leg did Dad lose?

266
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,319
His left leg, Mama.

267
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,872
His right leg!
And he was a 400-meter runner.

268
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,671
She likes to argue,
and I'm her only daughter!

269
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,957
And I'm her only mother!

270
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,558
How do I get my inheritance
if you die before me?

271
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,477
I don't want
that lovely old clock to sit

272
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,270
in the cellar any longer!
- It was his left leg!

273
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,909
Are the blisters big or small?
- They look terrible.

274
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,313
But only on my left foot.
My sneaker's to blame. - Take it off.

275
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,159
Well...

276
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,672
You do sports?
- I run.

277
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,640
I have something brand new...

278
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,032
a special plaster for blisters.

279
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,592
But you should wear other shoes
for a while. Do you have sandals?

280
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,118
Of course. But he won't
wear them. - Yes...

281
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,311
that'll be 4.95.

282
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,350
Thanks!
- Here you are.

283
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,756
Is it permitted
to sit here?

284
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,359
Please do.

285
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,157
I've gotta piss.

286
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,836
So we meet again.

287
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,559
How's that?

288
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,359
You nearly slammed into my girlfriend.
- Oh..., her.

289
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,956
I think I'll have another glass.
Could I treat you to one?

290
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,749
Why not?
- Red wine?

291
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,752
Okay with me.
- I'll stick to beer.

292
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,833
There!

293
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,392
This round's on the house.
- That's real sweet of you, Tina.

294
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,153
You stop by so seldom.

295
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,359
Oh, sorry!

296
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,910
Listen, Tina Bambina.
- Don't call me Tina Bambina!

297
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,756
When I'm sitting with someone
don't haul over any free rounds.

298
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,950
I don't want to take him away from you.
- Then two wines and a beer.

299
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,034
So...

300
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,352
If you feel like another drink
you're welcome to join me.

301
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,988
And your way is straight ahead.

302
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,549
All I've got left is tangerine liqueur.

303
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,952
I don't drink it.

304
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,795
So, here we are.

305
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,635
<i>Good morning, good morning,</i>
<i>good morning, sunshine.</i>

306
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,238
<i>The night is a secret to you,</i>
<i>but don't be blue...</i>

307
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,313
Do you realize what
went down last night?

308
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,789
What?

309
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,989
I always wanted to try the anal thing.
- That wasn't it.

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,118
Is your name Roland or Ronald?
- My name's Ronald.

311
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,031
Easy to get mixed up.

312
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,755
You've always gotta flush!

313
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,397
I have to talk to you.
My coffee is gone.

314
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,155
Look what I found.
Let's take a break.

315
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,354
Cheers.

316
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,674
Is there any left?
- Yeah.

317
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,952
Only here for the day, too?

318
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,869
Thanks.

319
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,712
Hey, ciao.

320
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,269
Bye.

321
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,877
I thought I'd stop by again.

322
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,750
You know what's strange?

323
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,949
The good men who come here
sit where you're sitting now -

324
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,952
automatically.

325
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,555
And the jerks sit in the armchair.

326
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,194
Strange.

327
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,350
What can I say?

328
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,434
You don't have to say a thing, Roland.

329
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,271
My name is Ronald.

330
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,560
I've got company.
- Oh yeah?

331
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,951
I've got to tell you something.

332
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,039
Him?

333
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,919
Is he staying?
- We're gonna watch soccer.

334
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,312
Since when do you watch soccer?
- Since today.

335
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,391
It's gonna be a long evening.

336
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,156
I don't get it.

337
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,952
4x minus 2y equals 10.

338
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,590
You think Dad knows the answer?

339
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,718
You'll have to call him.

340
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,429
I don't want to understand it.
I'll never need it anyway.

341
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,510
Why not ask me about geography?

342
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,435
Ask me where Timbuktu is.
- Where's Timbuktu?

343
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,514
I didn't mean it that literally.

344
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,359
Oh, Max.

345
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,356
You won't go far with me.

346
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,751
Hi, it's me, Katrin.

347
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,639
Did I wake you?

348
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,355
Yeah, well...

349
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,831
Yeah, I'm sorry about the birthday call.

350
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,514
Yeah...

351
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,710
I just wanted
to get something sorted...

352
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,714
Hello?

353
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,790
I just wanted to ask...

354
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,796
Are you taking Max on vacation
for two weeks or not?

355
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,156
That's so fucked up!

356
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,915
I wanna know now!

357
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,160
Why don't you understand?

358
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,874
Hello?

359
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,313
Asshole!

360
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,278
Coffee or tea?
- Coffee, eggs, cheese, sausage!

361
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,750
I'm easy to please!

362
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,519
Sorry!

363
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,119
Come here.
The way I smell...

364
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,908
The way I smell...

365
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,953
That's how I smell; it's my soap.

366
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,559
What do you transport
in your big car?

367
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,234
Mostly carpets.

368
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,952
But it doesn't fulfill me.
Neither professionally, nor personally.

369
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,358
Can I live here?

370
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,110
Sure, I do love you.

371
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,951
But I only have one key.

372
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,351
I'll get another one made.

373
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,709
That's not how I meant that.
- I don't get it.

374
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,396
The internal and external situations
don't jibe.

375
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,031
I really don't get it.
- Where do you live otherwise?

376
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,556
With my buddy, the guy you met.
- See? I gotta go.

377
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,039
I'm not trying to meddle.
- But you are.

378
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,709
He takes what he can get
without even looking.

379
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,352
I doubt he wasn't looking.
I looked good.

380
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,591
Like a bag of candy.
But my manner was lady-like.

381
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,833
Because he's reserved.
- What is he?

382
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,630
Shy. At least at first.
- That's not the sense I get.

383
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,393
That's your sense not mine.

384
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,758
What does he do?
- He hauls carpets.

385
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,109
He only sleeps with you. - And I only
sleep with him. - That I don't believe.

386
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,234
It works.

387
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,198
That clock survived the war.

388
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,277
For your girlfriend.

389
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,958
Thank you, Frau Timm.

390
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,436
If only my face were as smooth
as my ass!

391
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,558
I guess you haven't seen
your ass in a while.

392
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,276
Hi, Rico.
- Hi.

393
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,232
Come on, let's go.

394
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,269
Nice.

395
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,159
Real cozy.

396
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,031
Has Charly ever been here?
- No.

397
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,519
The dumb thing is:
I'm into her too.

398
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,631
I think that's her decision.

399
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,670
Hi, Charly.
- Hi.

400
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,750
Hi, Charly.
- Hi.

401
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,952
Cigarette?
- Nope.

402
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,548
Do you live here for real?
- Sometimes.

403
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,394
I think it's romantic.
One could even sleep here.

404
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,360
Not if there are rats.
- There aren't any rats here.

405
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,194
Got a cola or something?
- I'm afraid I haven't got any.

406
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,552
Then let's take off. - Go on ahead.
I have to talk to Max about something.

407
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,554
What about?
- None of your business!

408
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,631
Okay, I'll wait downstairs.

409
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,355
What I wanted to tell you...
Don't feel like a traitor though -

410
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,752
because you're friends.
- No problem.

411
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,315
I don't want Rico to smoke.
Tell me if he does, okay?

412
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,039
Sure thing.
- Thanks, you're a real pal.

413
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,359
Frau Engel, please.

414
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,477
If it were up to me
I'd weed out everyone

415
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,670
who abbreviates street.
People who write "St." are lazy, period.

416
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,072
If this date is correct,
your application is three years old.

417
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,710
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to change it.

418
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,157
I had it copied -
I've been applying ever since.

419
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,074
But none of my data has changed.
- You're forty?

420
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,155
39. - Our agency
prefers to place younger people.

421
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,991
I know it sounds silly -
you aren't old.

422
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,998
Can you believe I'm beat in the evening
from explaining that to people?

423
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,070
Yes.

424
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,476
Okay, I'll add you to our file.

425
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,919
Thank you.

426
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,756
But it's hopeless, isn't it?
- It's never hopeless.

427
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,839
You're from Freiburg,
and you moved to Berlin

428
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,196
after the Wall fell?
- Yes.

429
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,718
So, the girl from the West
married the guy from the East?

430
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,349
Unfortunately I had no prejudices.

431
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,554
I'm from the West too:
Weilheim in Upper Bavaria.

432
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,951
One can hear a slight accent.

433
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,709
Yes.

434
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,114
This one or this one?
- That one!

435
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,512
But it's very summery.
- And it's summertime.

436
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,955
He might move in with me.

437
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,669
Don't ruin the evening.
Nothing will change between us.

438
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,868
We wanted to go swimming.

439
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,516
I expected a different reaction
from my girlfriend. - What?

440
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,115
You're supposed to encourage me.

441
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,671
Why are we sitting here anyway?
- Then let's go. - No. I want to stay.

442
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,674
I'm not spoiled:
It's not often that I fall in love.

443
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,991
How can you call that love?

444
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,278
He nearly murdered me! Did you forget
about that? - This is ridiculous!

445
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,470
He isn't here tonight.
- That's not why I'm here.

446
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,792
A cognac with your beer?
- Not necessary.

447
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,957
My pleasure.

448
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,551
Why did you dye your hair?

449
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,876
I wanted to look different.

450
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,556
It's toilet-attendant black.

451
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,757
I think you're nice.

452
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,632
Is his name Roland or Ronald?
- Didn't he tell you?

453
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,359
Sure, he did.

454
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,673
Did you know he has a wife and kid
in Eberswalde?

455
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,031
Thanks. I had a nice time.

456
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,750
I can't, I'm not alone!

457
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,230
Hey! Get lost!

458
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,911
Man! Get lost!

459
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,430
Why aren't you asleep?

460
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,159
Nike, open up!
Something terrible happened!

461
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,557
Katrin? Katrin!

462
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,516
Is she going to die?
- No! No, Max.

463
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,234
Frau Engel?
Can you hear me?

464
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,599
Can you give me your hand?
I'm Dr. Bulling, the doctor on call.

465
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,788
Can you understand me?
Open your eyes, please.

466
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,111
Do you know where we are?

467
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,396
At St. Joseph's Hospital in Weissensee.
Psychiatric ward.

468
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,269
Open your eyes really wide.

469
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,750
Wide open, okay?

470
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,995
Open both eyes. Good.
Could you focus on my finger?

471
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,868
Do you see my finger? Hey!

472
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,750
Open your eyes, please.
Try to cooperate a bit.

473
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,789
Open your eyes wide
and focus on my finger.

474
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,513
Try to follow my finger. Exactly.
And now to the other side. Okay.

475
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,118
Can you see my finger at all?
- Mmh. - Yes.

476
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,353
Blow into this, okay?
For a few seconds.

477
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,354
I don't think that'll work.
- I'll try.

478
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,594
Watch out. Careful. Sit up higher.

479
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,675
Okay.

480
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,593
2.5 g/I.

481
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,948
Do you feel any pain? Does it hurt
when I press on your abdomen?

482
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,715
Did you fall down today?

483
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,474
Lift your head a bit.

484
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,715
I'll call Ward 9.
Just stay calm, please.

485
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,036
We won't find out much tonight.

486
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,997
I won't leave you alone.
I'll sleep here tonight.

487
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,276
We'll sort things out in the morning.

488
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,672
Good night, Max.
- Good night, Nike.

489
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,994
Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,359
I'm looking for Katrin Engel.
- Who are you?

491
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,716
A girlfriend.
I brought her some things.

492
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,194
I only drink when I feel like it.

493
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,355
Yesterday... I somehow lost it.

494
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,958
At the moment
I feel just great.

495
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,398
I finally have a job prospect.

496
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,433
Why lock me up anyway,
while all the sickos are on the loose?

497
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,037
You should lock up that lunatic!
Are you even looking for him?

498
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,510
Look at this.

499
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,472
It's kind of my fault too.
I left her

500
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,599
all alone in that joint.

501
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,191
To be honest,
she's just a normal drinker.

502
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,398
Exactly. I don't drink
any more than you do.

503
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,870
Your liver tells a different story.

504
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,716
That's why I asked you in
for a talk, Frau Engel.

505
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,918
Our tests show that alcohol
has caused definite damage...

506
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,356
I might as well go ahead
and kill myself!

507
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,308
I'll sell all my stuff and
pay my debts and then kill myself!

508
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,190
Max is old enough
to make it on his own!

509
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,515
I'll kill myself, nobody cares!
Or I'll go back to Freiburg!

510
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,032
I don't belong in here
with these alkies!

511
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,752
Nobody said that, Frau Engel.
This is only about you.

512
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,948
We're making you an offer
to stay here for a few days...

513
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,960
to allow us to observe you,

514
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,351
in case of complications
from last night.

515
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,275
It would also let us
counsel you a bit.

516
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,236
Frau Engel, it's an offer
I'd like to make.

517
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,876
You aren't locked up. You're free
to leave if you like, but...

518
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,955
From what you said,
I realize how desperate you are.

519
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,952
I could imagine it isn't only
because of last night.

520
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,353
Perhaps we should talk about it
when you've physically recovered.

521
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,389
Okay.

522
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,110
Dark blue suit and white shirt...

523
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,954
always look good.

524
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,872
My coffee is gone!

525
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,877
Hi, I'm from the Welfare Office.

526
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,070
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

527
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,552
Show me your ID.

528
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,670
It's good you asked me...

529
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,676
All right, Grandpa, shut up,

530
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,036
and no funny business, okay?

531
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,235
Hey!

532
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,874
No matter what happens,
there's gonna be blood.

533
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,399
Oskar?

534
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,271
That never used to happen
in the old days.

535
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,391
I'll be ready in a sec.

536
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,755
I have to go to school.

537
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,156
It's vacation time.

538
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,233
It's summer.

539
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,115
Tell me how it tastes.

540
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,148
I always put curry in my goulash

541
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,754
I'll put curry in it next time.

542
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,076
Want some ice cream?
- No, I don't.

543
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,958
Or peach compote?

544
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,356
I never eat compote.

545
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,998
Can I have a beer?

546
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,149
They were actually intended for me.

547
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,228
Cheers.

548
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,238
I brought a porn movie.

549
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,351
I don't really need that.

550
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,238
Can't you get a better job
than wiping old folks' asses?

551
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,756
Why don't you make something
out of your life!

552
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,635
What're you making out of your life?

553
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,995
I'm actually
an agricultural technician.

554
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,956
Never heard of it.

555
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,157
It's over with, anyway.

556
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,958
But you can't express yourself too well.

557
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,918
Nobody can.

558
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,791
At least I've tried lots of stuff.
I trained to be a seamstress.

559
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,670
And all you do
is haul around carpets.

560
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:03,358
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I just wanna rouse your ambition.

561
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,749
Things aren't like they used to be.

562
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,749
I know they aren't.

563
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,470
Can I ask you something else?
- Sure, go ahead.

564
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,758
You think because we have a sexual thing
you can act like a prick?

565
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,391
I don't get it.

566
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,948
We can go upstairs, or stay here as
long as you like. My mom isn't home.

567
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,759
I don't have much time.

568
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,358
My mother painted those pictures.

569
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,877
Those are three buildings.
- I can see that.

570
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,594
They're repainting all the buildings.
You can see how they used to look.

571
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,558
Does Rico still smoke?

572
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,197
Sometimes... Not always,
but more than he used to,

573
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,431
to be honest.

574
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,478
I wanted to go jogging with him,
but not anymore. I'm an anti-smoker.

575
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,709
I'm athletic, too.
You could also jog with me...

576
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,070
if I train harder.

577
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,835
Max?

578
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,993
This is Charly.

579
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,036
Hello, Charly.
- Hello.

580
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,636
I was just leaving. Goodbye.

581
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,108
Goodbye.

582
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,357
You wanted to join her?
- Not now.

583
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,395
I'm just here for the day.

584
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,033
Just for a few hours.

585
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,592
Let me tell you something.

586
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,317
But don't tell anybody yet.

587
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,194
I won't deliver carpets much longer.
- What'll you do?

588
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,111
Deliver electronics:
computers and stuff.

589
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,797
What's the difference?

590
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,153
Other routes, other people.
More modern altogether.

591
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,114
Even the ancient Romans had carpets.

592
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,435
We haven't agreed on the pay yet.

593
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,390
Then for a change you can buy yourself
some nice stuff.

594
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,758
I've got nice stuff.

595
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,798
Like this ring.
Everybody thinks it's real.

596
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,954
Not me.

597
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,872
<i>Leave the freeway in 500 meters.</i>

598
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,633
You can see where we're going.

599
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,589
How does it work?
- The satellite picked us up.

600
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,036
The satellite knows where we are
and where we're going.

601
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,158
But only 'cause I programmed it.

602
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,759
<i>Drive 38 kilometers to the next exit</i>

603
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,071
<i>and turn around.</i>

604
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,149
Why turn around?

605
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,076
She's a nice girl, isn't she?
- Yeah.

606
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,236
Is Nike looking after you?
- Yeah, but she went away today.

607
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,359
What - where to?
- I don't know.

608
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,154
Who was that man the other night?

609
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,673
I didn't know him.

610
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,751
Did he attack you?

611
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,959
Yes.

612
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,833
When are you coming back for good?
- In about 10 days.

613
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,871
I'm taking a kind of cure.

614
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,917
That's fine. Zero point zero.

615
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,953
Good.

616
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,839
Thanks.

617
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,272
Gotta car?
Or are you riding with someone?

618
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,672
Why?
- You could ride with me.

619
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,552
I think I'm taken.

620
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,999
A nice route. Along the Rhine
to Lake Constance, and then to Italy.

621
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,279
Wanna come along?
- Sorry, but I don't.

622
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,150
You want something from the lady?
- Who the hell are you?

623
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,994
Don't chat her up
or there'll be trouble!

624
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,311
Looking for adventure?

625
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,472
Is that soap for you?
That's never gonna be enough.

626
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,751
You make good sandwiches.

627
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,310
I'm really glad you came along.

628
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,229
Sometimes it gets pretty lonely.

629
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,039
I heard you're married
and have a kid.

630
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,349
Says who?

631
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,839
I just heard it.

632
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,957
Well, if it were true, I'd admit it.

633
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,634
You don't have to lie. There's no need.

634
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,915
I've got no plans for you.

635
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,951
Full?
- Yeah.

636
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,517
Got a girlfriend?

637
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,234
It's not that important to me.
- That's the right attitude.

638
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,358
Always keep a certain independence.

639
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,873
Maybe you aren't the one
to be giving advice. - Why not?

640
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,432
I wish somebody would've had
a sensible talk with me at his age.

641
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,795
Ice cream?

642
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,835
Maybe.
- What kinda ice cream you got?

643
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,837
Vanilla with chocolate and hazelnut.

644
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,796
Vanilla with chocolate.
- Vanilla with chocolate.

645
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,350
Bring me the check, Tina.
- The check's mine.

646
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,352
When the pharmacist was on night duty,
Katrin and I sometimes called him.

647
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,275
For fun.

648
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,068
I'm thinking of my son.

649
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,870
So you do have a kid.

650
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,991
You said I didn't have to lie.

651
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,989
Then you've got a wife, as well?

652
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,949
Yes.

653
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,472
Where is she?

654
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,476
In Eberswalde.

655
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,754
Then you can go there anytime.

656
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,594
That I can.

657
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,955
But my marriage isn't working.

658
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,114
But you can see your son,
can't you?

659
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,189
You never wanted kids?

660
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,357
Not by accident.

661
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,197
I've got two more addresses.

662
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,231
And two more kids.

663
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,318
Oh.

664
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,917
I had no father.

665
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,719
What's that got to do with it?

666
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,750
I shouldn't have listened to my uncle.

667
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,958
He always said, "Doing it standing,
from behind, makes no kids."

668
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,839
But that's nonsense.

669
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,152
What's going on?

670
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,551
Aren't you coming back out?

671
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,591
What's the big idea? Let me in!

672
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,194
Hey! Let me in!

673
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,109
Hey, open the door!

674
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,149
Open the door, you stupid cow!
Open up!

675
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,196
Okay, I've gotta climb down!

676
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,236
It's your fault if I fall!

677
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,358
Your fault!

678
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,031
Please, open it!

679
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,477
It's cold out here.

680
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,154
It's getting colder and colder!

681
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,151
Are you gonna leave me out here
all night, or what?

682
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,273
<i>Good morning, good morning,</i>
<i>good morning, sunshine.</i>

683
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,639
<i>The night is a secret to you,</i>
<i>but don't be blue.</i>

684
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,912
<i>Good morning to you,</i>
<i>now don't be blue.</i>

685
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:23,155
<i>Good morning, sunshine.</i>
<i>Wake me up and come inside.</i>

686
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,274
Oh man!

687
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,589
Hello!

688
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,152
Come here, Nike!
- What?

689
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,959
Come here a moment!

690
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,757
Frau Timm's daughter said
you were late. - Oh no. - Oh yes.

691
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,550
I should have known.
- What was the problem?

692
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,718
I was running kinda late. I don't know.

693
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,829
On certain days everything goes wrong.

694
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,391
I didn't sleep all night.
- Why do you work here?

695
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,712
Why do you work here?

696
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,239
What's this about?
You know I gotta earn a living.

697
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,269
I said I was sorry.
I mean, this is my job.

698
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,796
I got nothing against old folks.

699
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,353
I think about being old someday myself.

700
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,432
You don't look like it.

701
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,594
How should I look?
- Doesn't matter. Frau Timm also said...

702
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,309
you stay longer than you should.

703
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,837
You're assigned to clean her mother,
make breakfast and wash up.

704
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,630
That's 45 minutes at most.
If you want to stay longer,

705
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,396
do it on your own time.
But others are waiting for you.

706
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,794
Sounds like I'm up for promotion.
- Use your brain and you could be.

707
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,437
I think I'm impressing him,
but it's still backfiring.

708
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,912
Why?
- He's more or less moved in.

709
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,915
I'm feeding him.
He once brought me three flowers.

710
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:33,348
But then he's always taking stuff:
yesterday sausages, canned strawberries.

711
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,469
He also has a wife and three kids.
- Then end it!

712
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,350
I'm stuck on him, Katrin.
He does everything right.

713
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,277
He's no big-word fucker -
what he says is stupid.

714
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,390
But he has something very masculine.
He'd be good in advertising.

715
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,597
Want me to go home with you?
- No, Katie, not necessary.

716
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,358
Vodka and cola.

717
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,038
Where is he?
- On the road. - With carpets?

718
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,874
I guess so. Left two days ago.

719
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,669
I wouldn't guess if I were you.
Hi there!

720
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,957
Just get off work?

721
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,311
He said he screwed you on the balcony

722
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,280
while you gazed at the street -
but nobody takes him seriously.

723
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,552
He said you're a whore, but a good cook.

724
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,518
Thanks for the info.

725
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,036
And he has six kids
from different mothers.

726
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,592
And you've got six screws loose.
- I just want you to see the picture.

727
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,159
I'm amazed at the things
you can do.

728
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:04,031
I can do lots more, too.
I can be an all-round partner.

729
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,271
It all depends on you.

730
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,590
We can eat them this summer.

731
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,996
Or I'll eat them next time
I sleep on the balcony.

732
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,150
It's nice to have you back.

733
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,559
I always see your son out running.

734
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,110
His foot seems fine now.

735
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,558
Two pills three times a day.
And read the directions.

736
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,279
Bye.
- Bye.

737
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,759
Hello!

738
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,718
Everything comes from America:

739
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,671
the economy's to blame.

740
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,633
You mean this one?

741
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,998
It's for you.

742
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,073
Thanks, Oskar, but it isn't my style.

743
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,552
It was her favorite dress,

744
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,431
and it isn't good enough for you?
- No... it just doesn't fit me.

745
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,955
It's much too big.

746
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,630
You look pretty.

747
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,909
Thanks.

748
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,279
Hello.

749
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,510
I hope I didn't scare you.

750
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,599
I'm starting a new life this morning.
- I know.

751
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,150
That's what I like about you.

752
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,830
I still don't have a key for upstairs.
Usually I wait in the bar.

753
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,753
Wanna come in for a moment?

754
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,675
Nice sofa.

755
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,551
Pictures are nice, too.

756
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,390
Very real.

757
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,993
It isn't finished yet, is it?

758
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,112
There's no real resemblance yet.

759
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,637
Resemblance
is the hardest part, I think.

760
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,239
Too bad I never saw you...

761
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,198
after that day.

762
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,793
Me?

763
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,519
You're such a dainty being.

764
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,593
May I touch you very gently?

765
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,993
You can't just go and touch me.

766
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,868
After all, Nike is my girlfriend.

767
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,555
Mine, too.

768
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,753
Welcome home.
- Thank you.

769
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,508
What are you doing here?
- I don't have to wait in the bar.

770
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,749
I'll put the flowers in some water.

771
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,437
If I had a key,
I'd have gone upstairs.

772
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,955
I think
he's a good man for you after all.

773
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,832
I'm afraid we're out of cake.
Milk's out too.

774
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,639
Black coffee makes a person beautiful.

775
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,951
Go buy some cake.
- Why me?

776
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:57,069
Go on, do something for your girlfriend.
- What's this married tone of voice?

777
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,550
It's fine without cake.

778
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,437
We were almost on a first-name basis.

779
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,872
Do you mind?

780
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,192
Why should I mind?

781
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,397
Okay, let's use first names.
- Everybody uses first names.

782
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,715
People used to kiss each other.

783
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,197
Or would it hurt your feelings?
- I don't care.

784
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,909
Should I really kiss him?
- Come on, Katrin.

785
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,195
I got my hands behind my back.

786
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,955
C'mon, a real kiss!

787
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,556
I'm Ronald.
- I'm Katrin.

788
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,751
And I'm Nike.

789
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,951
It's good you came.

790
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,272
So I wasn't alone with your girlfriend.

791
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,796
I wouldn't stoop to that.

792
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,511
I'm gonna read a bit.

793
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,279
Since when do you read in bed?

794
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,399
I always did,
until you came galloping in.

795
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,714
You should try it yourself
now and then.

796
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,430
I did... but it isn't my thing.

797
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,957
What does it say?

798
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:05,714
Tell me what you're reading.
- A novel.

799
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,752
Who wrote it?

800
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,954
Stendhal.

801
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,555
Stendal is a town.

802
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,953
Stendhal is also a writer.
A French one at that.

803
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,956
Well, see...

804
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,755
we've learned something new.

805
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,358
We did? You learned something new.

806
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,558
When two people get along,
it isn't necessary that both read.

807
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,990
You're just right for me, Nike.

808
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,349
Have you ever thought about
why you're in this bed?

809
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,953
I don't get it.

810
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,916
Me neither.

811
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,514
We never had any problems.

812
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:16,755
Do you realize what problems
other people have?

813
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,758
Nike, it's so nice.

814
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,355
I mean it!

815
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,112
Love me! Love me!

816
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,752
You forgot something.

817
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,753
That's it.

818
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,954
Morning, Nike.

819
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,318
Come in.

820
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:41,598
Is Max home?
- No, he's out. Running.

821
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,113
Want some coffee?
- I borrowed this from him.

822
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,152
You acted so strange yesterday.

823
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,229
I just dumped the guy.
And I'm through with you, too.

824
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,598
I wouldn't have expected that from you.

825
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,356
You were just after him yourself!
- Are you crazy?

826
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,070
It isn't my fault.
I thought we were friends.

827
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,268
I can do without friends like you.
I'm no parasite.

828
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,993
Is that what I am to you?

829
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,356
I'm independent. I take risks.

830
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,149
Think about your life.
- What for?

831
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:18,154
At least I work for a living!

832
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,198
I'm a mother,

833
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,033
and I've got a kid!
- It's the same thing!

834
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,830
What? - Being a mother
and having a child! Anyone can do it!

835
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,878
You can't, Nike!
- So what!

836
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,475
You're self-centered!
- And you waste my time!

837
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,154
Then get lost!

838
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,033
I hope you shut the windows
when I walk by!

839
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,878
Another one.

840
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,395
All you're getting from me is coffee.
- What's the big idea!

841
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,309
You've gotta stop,

842
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,280
I've no time today.
- Not until I've played it right.

843
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,194
I can't leave you sitting here
with this thing.

844
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:48,878
Ouch! That hurts!

845
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,350
I've got so much on my mind...
- You're mean!

846
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,640
I don't want you to come back!

847
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,635
<i>If I were a bird</i>

848
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,431
<i>and I had two wings,</i>

849
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,356
<i>I'd fly to you.</i>

850
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,318
<i>But...</i>

851
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:26,989
<i>since that can't be so,</i>
<i>but since that can't be so,</i>

852
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,119
<i>I will stay with...</i>

853
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,154
Helene?

854
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,078
What'll it be, pretty lady?

855
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,357
Gimme a beer.

856
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,674
You look kinda worn out.

857
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,990
Problems?

858
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,237
I was hoping
to drink my beer in peace.

859
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,309
I'm not curious.

860
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,397
Sure. I've got news for you anyway.
That guy is history.

861
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,953
What do you mean?
- Just what I said. You can have him.

862
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,639
You think I want him?

863
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,716
I always got that impression.

864
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,559
I've got news for you too.
Your girlfriend went berserk.

865
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,275
I think she wanted to tie one on,
but she didn't get anything from me.

866
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,359
Katrin!

867
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,191
Is everything okay?

868
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,350
I thought something might be wrong.

869
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,998
Where'd you get that idea?

870
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,710
You know who died today?... Helene.

871
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,715
I'm sorry.

872
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,871
Well, I guess I'll be going.

873
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,759
Hi.

874
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,429
Max?

875
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:55,637
Listen, we've got money
coming from your father.

876
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,956
You can have the exact sneakers
you wanted.

877
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,153
Who's there?

878
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,191
Who's there?
- Me.

879
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,871
Max is lovesick.

880
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,353
How nice.

881
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,951
Am I the first?

882
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,357
You - always.

883
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,352
I think I fuck up plenty.

884
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,758
You - never.

885
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,432
We wanted to go swimming
...with Max.

886
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:43,518
Know how old I was
when I first fell in love?... Nine.

887
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,196
He was 14 and his name was Hansi.
Dumb name.

888
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,956
But he was the strongest guy
in our orphanage.

889
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,556
Know what he had the other guys do?

890
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,428
They had to write my name
on their little cocks.

891
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,192
They all wrote "Nike"

892
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,556
with a green felt-tip.

893
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,788
And I had a bad reputation.
At age nine already.

894
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,551
That's life.

895
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,279
I'll say!

896
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,278
AND SO ON...
