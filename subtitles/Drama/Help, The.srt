if I never met a husband?

I need to ask you something.

I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

329
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,093
They start thinking these...

Do you, uh... find men attractive?

Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

I stopped liking men.

Uh, well...

Did you fire her?

We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

to a white family.

415
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:09,592
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

416
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,511
So, a side to this never before heard?

00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,646
You look really nice.

636
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:11,986
Thank you.

637
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,134
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

638
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,755
Miss Skeeter...

639
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:44,183
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

640
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:47,524
This isn't about me.

641
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:50,777
It doesn't matter how I feel.

642
00:42:59,154 --> 00:43:02,328
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

643
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:05,874
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

644
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:09,790
That gonna be hard.

645
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,630
What about Minny?

646
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:13,386
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

647
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:17,390
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

648
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:23,146
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

649
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:26,184
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

650
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:30,566
It feel...

651
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:44,168
Is that your son?

652
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,210
Yes, ma'am.

653
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:53,550
Can we move on to the next question?

654
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:56,591
You don't have to call me ma'am.

655
00:43:57,174 --> 00:43:59,176
Not here.

656
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:06,188
Uh...

657
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,774
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

658
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,574
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

659
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:18,198
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

660
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,964
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

661
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,759
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

662
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,135
OK.

663
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:36,721
Sure.

664
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,569
I don't say my prayers out loud.

665
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:49,901
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

666
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:55,116
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

667
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:59,955
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

668
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:04,543
Go ahead.

669
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:17,269
"My first white baby to ever look after

670
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:20,647
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

671
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:24,856
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

672
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,568
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

673
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:31,325
Alton's mama died of lung disease."

674
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:34,780
[sighs]

675
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:38,871
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

676
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:44,424
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

677
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,596
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

678
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:52,804
Just ate him up.

679
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:56,846
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee. [chortling]

680
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:03,727
You should have seen his face.

681
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:18,709
This was just so great.

682
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:24,004
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

683
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,968
What changed your mind?

684
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:29,797
God.

685
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:33,934
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

686
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:36,142
[Radio on, indistinct]

687
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:51,824
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr. William something.

688
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:59,332
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honor roll.

689
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:03,465
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

690
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,589
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

691
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:15,605
Whoo! I am late. I gotta get going.

692
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:19,775
See you tonight, honey.

693
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:20,980
OK.

694
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:23,237
[Door opens, closes]

695
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:24,522
Go on.

696
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,904
Well, now we're... [clears throat]

697
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,790
...faced with having to choose

698
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:36,577
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

699
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:40,414
Would you consider giving us a loan?

700
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:46,388
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

701
00:47:46,546 --> 00:47:50,551
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

702
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:54,555
Yes, ma'am.

703
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:02,730
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

704
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:08,703
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

705
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:13,662
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

706
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:17,917
Yes, ma'am.

707
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,547
You'll thank me one day.

708
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:25,429
[Minny] You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

709
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:28,300
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

710
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:29,809
might as well throw it all out.

711
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,139
Spoon, too.

712
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:34,523
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

713
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,274
And you put it up in the cabinet.

714
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:39,152
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

715
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,109
Don't do it and see what happens.

716
00:48:41,272 --> 00:48:42,944
Morning, ladies.

717
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:44,779
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

718
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,239
set it down in front of them.

719
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:49,075
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

720
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:52,582
And don't hit on they children.

721
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:55,291
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

722
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,082
And last thing. Come here.

723
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:01,593
Look at me.

724
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,096
No Sass-mouthing.

725
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,593
No Sass-mouthing.

726
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,477
I mean it.

727
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:17,027
Give your mama a kiss.

728
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:24,193
[Aibileen] Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

729
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:31,496
And every day Minny
went without a job,

730
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:34,412
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

731
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,627
Good morning, everybody.

732
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:48,806
But I knew.

733
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:53,270
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

734
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,368
[Excitedly] Hey!

735
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:06,575
[Giggling] Come on!

736
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:11,209
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

737
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,748
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

738
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:21,879
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

739
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm Minny Jackson.

740
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:28,391
You, uh... cooking something?

741
00:50:29,596 --> 00:50:33,021
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

742
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:36,939
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

743
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:40,650
Come on.

744
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:44,826
This here is the kitchen.

745
00:50:46,072 --> 00:50:48,370
What in the hell?

746
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:54,168
I guess I got some learning to do.

747
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:57,964
[Scoffs] You sure do.

748
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:01,175
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

749
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:04,343
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

750
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,511
But if I had it my way,

751
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:11,559
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

752
00:51:11,725 --> 00:51:13,898
None of this old stuff.

753
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,359
The main house has
five beds and baths,

754
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:20,823
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

755
00:51:20,986 --> 00:51:23,159
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

756
00:51:23,321 --> 00:51:25,415
filling up all these empty beds?

757
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:30,202
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

758
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:33,874
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

759
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:37,795
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

760
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:41,932
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

761
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:45,553
Let me at least get you some bus money.

762
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,145
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

763
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:53,646
Wait. So you'll do it?

764
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:57,653
[Shrieks]

765
00:51:57,816 --> 00:51:59,363
[laughing happily]

766
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:01,911
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

767
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:07,418
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

768
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:09,873
Come on.

769
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:12,256
[Laughing, giggling]

770
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:19,597
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

771
00:52:19,756 --> 00:52:21,804
We gots to talk about
some things first.

772
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:25,846
Oh.

773
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:27,640
I work Sunday through Friday.

774
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:30,810
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

775
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:34,356
OK. What time you want me here?

776
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:39,369
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

777
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:41,701
OK.

778
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:43,582
Now...

779
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:45,334
What your husband say you can pay?

780
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:49,087
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

781
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:51,339
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

782
00:52:51,499 --> 00:52:53,672
and find a colored woman in his house?

783
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:56,633
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

784
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:59,219
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

785
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:03,679
I really need a maid.

786
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,058
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

787
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:10,023
[Chuckling]

788
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:11,311
Great.

789
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,993
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

790
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:19,445
I think you done burned up your cake.

791
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,876
Doggone it!

792
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,038
[Running]

793
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,292
[Hilly] OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?

794
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:38,595
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

795
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:43,809
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

796
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:49,736
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

797
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,943
every raffle slot for baked goods!

798
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:54,700
[All cheering]

799
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,863
[Hilly] Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

800
00:53:59,947 --> 00:54:02,041
A big dent!

801
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:06,329
Now...

802
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:09,124
...I just found out
the surgeon general

803
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:12,669
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

804
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:16,841
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

805
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:21,016
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

806
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:22,852
I gave it to you a month ago.

807
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:24,937
I gave that to you myself.

808
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:28,069
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

809
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:34,864
I'll have it in there real soon.

810
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:39,115
Great.

811
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:41,124
[Up-tempo music]

812
00:54:47,457 --> 00:54:49,835
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

813
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:58,760
Thanks.

814
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:07,027
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

815
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:09,484
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

816
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,159
Oh, it's fine.

817
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:17,872
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

818
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:20,409
Oh, thank you, Henry.

819
00:55:20,576 --> 00:55:22,078
You remembered.

820
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:23,588
You're welcome.

821
00:55:26,082 --> 00:55:28,084
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

822
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,554
He's coming.

823
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:35,137
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

824
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:40,055
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

825
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:42,565
Don't you dare say that.

826
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:44,476
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

827
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:46,862
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

828
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,240
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

829
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:56,122
Saturday night.

830
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,954
Good morning.

831
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:40,040
Good morning, Baby Girl.

832
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:42,500
Good morning.

833
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:57,266
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

834
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,524
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

835
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,939
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

836
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:08,949
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

837
00:57:10,276 --> 00:57:12,870
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

838
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:17,042
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

839
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:20,750
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

840
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,551
That's very true.

841
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:31,390
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

842
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:36,971
Write that down.

843
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:46,779
Treelore would like me doing this.

844
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:49,740
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

845
00:57:49,902 --> 00:57:52,325
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

846
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,375
[Minny] Aibileen, Aibileen.

847
00:57:55,534 --> 00:57:58,333
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

848
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,638
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

849
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:16,478
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

850
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,191
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

851
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,148
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

852
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,904
No.

853
00:58:23,063 --> 00:58:25,441
I want to show her perspective.

854
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:29,282
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

855
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:32,119
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

856
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:35,953
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

857
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,872
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

858
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:43,635
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

859
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:48,512
And how we love they children
when they little.

860
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:52,470
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

861
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:53,684
I know.

862
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:57,226
Maybe things can change.

863
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:59,485
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

864
00:58:59,643 --> 00:59:01,190
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

865
00:59:01,354 --> 00:59:02,981
You damn right I don't!

866
00:59:03,815 --> 00:59:05,863
You two give me the heart palpitations.

[man chattering indistinctly]

871
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:26,010
All right. I'm gonna do it.

872
00:59:26,173 --> 00:59:30,144
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

873
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,808
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

874
00:59:37,602 --> 00:59:41,356
I need to see you square on
at all times.

875
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:52,668
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

876
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:53,918
Oh.

877
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:59,508
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

878
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:03,422
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

879
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:04,714
Next.

880
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,225
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

881
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,513
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

882
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,184
[Aibileen] Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

883
01:00:15,935 --> 01:00:19,656
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

884
01:00:19,814 --> 01:00:24,319
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation."

885
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:27,034
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

886
01:00:27,196 --> 01:00:29,790
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

889
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:36,586
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

890
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:43,924
We gots to get some more maids.

891
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,435
It hard. You go try and see.

892
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,223
OK, I will.

All the way from New York City.

I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

Even smells expensive.

You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

I can feel the hope in your fingers.

Holy shit.

- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

Can I take the Cadillac?

908
01:02:00,923 --> 01:02:03,346
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

909
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:06,638
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

910
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:09,398
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

911
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:10,557
I'll drive slow.

Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

So, what do you do with your time?

934
01:03:44,326 --> 01:03:45,373
You work?

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,582
I write.

But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

for The Jackson Journal.

938

You mean housekeeping.

Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

Well, I can.

It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

on your head as an infant?

949
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,673
Or were you just born stupid?

950
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,084
[Coughing]

951
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,097
[squawking]

952
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:49,566
[chopping]

953
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,571
So, what can you cook?

954
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,160
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

955
01:04:59,322 --> 01:05:00,824
Boil potatoes.

956
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:02,960
I can do grits.

957
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,167
[Laughing]

958
01:05:06,497 --> 01:05:07,543
Well...

959
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:12,381
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

960
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:15,640
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

961
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,768
- You got gum in your hair,
- [sizzling]

962
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:22,146
you got a squeaky door hinge...

963
01:05:22,306 --> 01:05:23,307
Crisco.

964
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:26,685
How pretty.

965
01:05:28,604 --> 01:05:30,527
Looks like frosting.

966
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:33,569
You got bags under your eyes.

967
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:35,703
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

968
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:38,448
Mm-hm. Crisco.

969
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:42,915
But it's best for frying chicken.

970
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:45,836
Frying chicken just...

971
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,092
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

972
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,052
At least me, anyway.

973
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:58,098
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

974
01:05:59,678 --> 01:06:00,770
Now...

975
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:03,808
...shake that.

976
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:05,477
Oh.

977
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:13,159
This is so much fun!

978
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,040
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

979
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,914
[giggling]

980
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:23,164
Yep. He dead.

981
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,753
[Sighing]

982
01:06:34,341 --> 01:06:35,684
[Celia] There you are.

983
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:41,891
I'm starved. Looks so good.

984
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:44,151
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

985
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:48,190
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

986
01:06:48,356 --> 01:06:49,528
Let me take your plate back.

987
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:52,285
I'm fine right here, Minny.

988
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:05,922
[sighing]

989
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:12,799
What?

990
01:07:14,259 --> 01:07:16,478
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

991
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:19,389
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

992
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:24,153
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

993
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:25,608
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

994
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:28,615
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

995
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:30,739
You gots to tell him.

996
01:07:30,902 --> 01:07:33,746
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

997
01:07:33,905 --> 01:07:35,532
You're right.

998
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,369
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

999
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,129
Minny don't burn chicken.

1000
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:49,465
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

1001
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,259
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

1002
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:54,769
So you liked it?

1003
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:57,555
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

1004
01:07:57,722 --> 01:08:00,692
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

1005
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,194
This many Negroes and whites

1006
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:04,730
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

1007
01:08:04,897 --> 01:08:07,650
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

1008
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:09,818
The ones you've read.

1009
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,828
Two domestics, that's all?

1010
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,240
[Scoffing]

1011
01:08:14,074 --> 01:08:15,997
[Skeeter] I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

1012
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,164
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

1013
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:23,174
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

1014
01:08:23,334 --> 01:08:26,213
I don't know. At least a dozen.

1015
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:29,723
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

1016
01:08:29,882 --> 01:08:32,226
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

1017
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:34,057
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

1018
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:48,573
We need a dozen more.

1019
01:08:49,402 --> 01:08:53,657
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

1020
01:08:54,575 --> 01:08:56,623
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

1021
01:08:58,496 --> 01:09:00,624
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

1022
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:03,761
[Minny] I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

1023
01:09:03,919 --> 01:09:07,514
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

1024
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:10,222
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

1025
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:14,308
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

1026
01:09:14,471 --> 01:09:15,814
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

1027
01:09:15,973 --> 01:09:17,600
It wouldn't be real.

1028
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:20,690
They Killed my son.

1029
01:09:28,486 --> 01:09:30,739
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

1030
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:34,497
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

1031
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,253
[Whispering] Aibileen.

1032
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:42,335
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

1033
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:46,007
Drove to the colored hospital...

1034
01:09:46,173 --> 01:09:48,141
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

1035
01:09:58,602 --> 01:10:02,823
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

1036
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,823
[Voice breaking]
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

1037
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:15,454
He died right in front of me.

1038
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,670
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

1039
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:26,891
Anniversary of his death comes...

1040
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,428
...every year, and I can't breathe.

1041
01:10:29,594 --> 01:10:31,813
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

1042
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:37,735
You stop this...

1043
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,820
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

1044
01:10:53,036 --> 01:10:56,256
[Hilly] I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

1045
01:10:56,414 --> 01:10:58,633
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

1046
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:01,261
- [Clapping]
- Yes, she does!

1047
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,843
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

1048
01:11:04,006 --> 01:11:05,349
[Women laughing]

1049
01:11:05,508 --> 01:11:07,556
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

1050
01:11:09,595 --> 01:11:11,689
I'm hungry, Mommy.

1051
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:13,020
She's always hungry.

1052
01:11:13,183 --> 01:11:15,106
[All laughing]

1053
01:11:16,019 --> 01:11:17,611
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

1054
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:22,025
[Aibileen] I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

1055
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:30,918
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

1056
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:34,832
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

1057
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:42,677
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

1058
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,514
Separate, but equal.

1059
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,641
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

1060
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:53,025
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

1061
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:12,792
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

1062
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:13,956
No, thanks.

1063
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:17,627
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

1064
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:22,385
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

1065
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,762
Minny and Aibileen already did.

1066
01:12:31,934 --> 01:12:34,528
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

1067
01:12:36,397 --> 01:12:39,400
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

1068
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:42,160
...but my boys are worth more.

1069
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:43,992
I understand.

1070
01:12:47,867 --> 01:12:51,337
What do you understand, Skeeter?

1071
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:58,088
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

1072
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:01,595
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

1073
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:03,768
Of course not.

1074
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:07,931
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

1075
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:11,313
Excuse me.

1076
01:13:14,355 --> 01:13:15,698
Come on, baby.

1077
01:13:17,817 --> 01:13:19,569
[Clearing throat]

1078
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:28,120
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

1079
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:32,085
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

1080
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:34,092
I know.

1081
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:37,881
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

1082
01:13:39,256 --> 01:13:40,803
I'm worried about you.

1083
01:13:41,843 --> 01:13:43,436
Reading this stuff?

1084
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:48,228
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

1085
01:13:48,975 --> 01:13:51,148
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

1086
01:13:51,311 --> 01:13:53,313
you'd be in serious trouble.

1087
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:56,863
I'll be on the lookout.

1088
01:14:01,071 --> 01:14:03,073
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

1089
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:07,960
OK?

1090
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:55,675
[Footsteps approaching]

1091
01:14:57,465 --> 01:14:59,684
Skeeter, get up!

1092
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:02,186
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

1093
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:05,057
What's wrong?

1094
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,568
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1095
01:15:07,726 --> 01:15:12,607
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

1096
01:15:13,691 --> 01:15:15,534
Oh, God.

1097
01:15:15,693 --> 01:15:17,695
Oh, mother.

1098
01:15:17,862 --> 01:15:20,411
You would not like him. Trust me.

1099
01:15:20,574 --> 01:15:21,826
He's a drunken asshole.

1100
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:26,212
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

1101
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,499
Put that on. Hurry!

1102
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,674
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

1103
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,765
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

1104
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:42,897

Was real pretty, remember?

1261
01:25:58,091 --> 01:25:59,434
Miss Celia.

1262
01:26:00,553 --> 01:26:02,396
[Celia] I told you, go home!

1263
01:26:15,152 --> 01:26:16,699
[Loud thudding]

1264
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:19,910
[shouting] I said get out!

1265
01:26:20,073 --> 01:26:21,666
[Rattling]

1266
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:27,589
[sobbing]

1267
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:38,348
Why is there so much blood?

1268
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:42,472
[Breathing heavily]

1269
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:47,858
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1270
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:52,863
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1271
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:57,623
Then I lost it a month later.

1272
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,125
Johnny wants kids now.

1273
01:27:05,664 --> 01:27:07,416
What's he gonna do with me?

1274
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,712
Well...

1275
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:15,133
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1276
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,519
[Exhaling]

1277
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:19,725
He doesn't know about the baby.

1278
01:27:23,934 --> 01:27:25,811
Or the two before.

1279
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:36,449
[Sniffing]

1280
01:28:10,442 --> 01:28:13,286
[indistinct chattering]

1281
01:28:20,704 --> 01:28:22,047
[man] Yule Mae Davis?

1282
01:28:24,957 --> 01:28:27,255
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1283
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:31,806
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1284
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:38,811
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1285
01:28:38,972 --> 01:28:42,772
I want to get my purse. [shouting]
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1286
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:45,734
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

1287
01:28:45,897 --> 01:28:49,993
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

1288
01:28:51,487 --> 01:28:52,534
[Sobbing]

1289
01:28:53,906 --> 01:28:55,829
Just let me go!

1290
01:28:56,617 --> 01:28:58,870
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1291
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,549
[Hilly] I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1292
01:29:11,383 --> 01:29:15,559
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

1293
01:29:16,888 --> 01:29:19,983
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1294
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:24,317
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

1295
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,903
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

1296
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:28,739
- [Billy] Oh, yes.
- [Hilly laughing]

1297
01:29:28,901 --> 01:29:30,653
Just go sit down over there.

1298
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:32,869
[Dishes clattering]

1299
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:41,707
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1300
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,501
Now.

1301
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,165
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1302
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:19,881
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

1303
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:22,923
We all are.

1304
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:26,054
- [All] That's right.
- I'll help you.

1305
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,891
[Woman] I used to take
a shortcut every day

1306
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,769
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

1307
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:36,478
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1308
01:30:36,641 --> 01:30:40,487
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1309
01:30:40,646 --> 01:30:44,241
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1310
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:50,665
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1311
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,043
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1312
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:59,670
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1313
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,177
He did.

1314
01:31:02,336 --> 01:31:05,385
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1315
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:09,760
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1316
01:31:10,844 --> 01:31:13,142
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1317
01:31:14,139 --> 01:31:18,519
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1318
01:31:19,562 --> 01:31:22,406
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1319
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:24,113
Mean for sport.

1320
01:31:26,444 --> 01:31:29,118
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1321
01:31:30,198 --> 01:31:32,326
But in everybody's mind

1322
01:31:32,493 --> 01:31:35,872
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1323
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,383
Owned me.

1324
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:46,930
[Miss Stein] I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

1325
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:49,890
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1326
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:51,804
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1327
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:54,976
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1328
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,645
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1329
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:00,610
You do not want it in the pile.

1330
01:32:00,773 --> 01:32:01,865
Yes, ma'am.

1331
01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:05,370
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1332
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:08,081
I understand.

1333
01:32:15,748 --> 01:32:18,547
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1334
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:21,713
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1335
01:32:28,845 --> 01:32:29,891
[Doorbell ringing]

1336
01:32:30,054 --> 01:32:31,556
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

1337
01:32:31,723 --> 01:32:33,566
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1338
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:35,352
Aibileen?

1339
01:32:37,854 --> 01:32:39,447
Hey, Elizabeth!

1340
01:32:39,606 --> 01:32:41,950
It's me, Celia Foote.

1341
01:32:42,109 --> 01:32:43,907
[Hilly stammering]

1342
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:47,540
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1343
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,919
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1344
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:55,082
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1345
01:32:58,293 --> 01:33:00,216
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1346
01:33:00,379 --> 01:33:02,222
- Shh!
- [music stops]

1347
01:33:05,551 --> 01:33:08,304
- Hey!
- [all gasping, giggling]

1348
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:09,518
Shh!

1349
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:14,777
I brought a chocolate pie!

1350
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:19,358
My maid, Minny, made it.

1351
01:33:20,693 --> 01:33:23,196
[All giggling]

1352
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:28,952
[woman] She's in the bushes.

1353
01:33:50,767 --> 01:33:55,522
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1354
01:34:03,822 --> 01:34:07,247
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1355
01:34:09,327 --> 01:34:10,499
Why, Minny?

1356
01:34:12,623 --> 01:34:16,503
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

1357
01:34:16,669 --> 01:34:18,592
Mad you married one of their mens.

1358
01:34:19,422 --> 01:34:23,347
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

1359
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,059
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1360
01:34:26,221 --> 01:34:27,894
when they were still going steady.

1361
01:34:28,056 --> 01:34:30,150
Mm-hm.

1362
01:34:30,309 --> 01:34:34,563
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

1363
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,942
No wonder!

1364
01:34:40,945 --> 01:34:45,121
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1365
01:34:45,992 --> 01:34:48,666
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1366
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:51,752
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1367
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:56,174
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1368
01:34:57,296 --> 01:34:59,594
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1369
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,354
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1370
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:09,647
That looks bad.

1371
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:13,363
Let me take a look.

1372
01:35:14,231 --> 01:35:15,904
I got to get these peas on.

1373
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:18,819
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1374
01:35:19,027 --> 01:35:20,529
[sighing]

1375
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:42,641
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1376
01:35:44,389 --> 01:35:46,483
I'd give it right back to him.

1377
01:35:48,017 --> 01:35:50,896
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1378
01:35:51,063 --> 01:35:53,816
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

1379
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,155
[church bell tolling]

1380
01:36:04,243 --> 01:36:06,587
[man]
From here, the members of the family...

1381
01:36:09,957 --> 01:36:13,302
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1382
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:16,465
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1383
01:36:23,014 --> 01:36:25,813
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1384
01:36:27,852 --> 01:36:29,195
Mrs. Kennedy.

1385
01:36:30,606 --> 01:36:32,608
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1386
01:36:32,774 --> 01:36:34,868
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1387
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:37,779
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1388
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:52,506
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1389
01:36:53,254 --> 01:36:56,508
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1390
01:36:56,674 --> 01:36:58,017
figure out who who?

1391
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:03,144
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1392
01:37:05,643 --> 01:37:09,113
[Sighs]
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1393
01:37:10,314 --> 01:37:12,112
But we ain't got no choice.

1394
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,611
Sorry.

1395
01:37:15,737 --> 01:37:19,616
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1396
01:37:21,117 --> 01:37:23,245
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1397
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:29,713
Mmm.

1398
01:37:29,876 --> 01:37:31,844
Mm-mm-mm.

1399
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:36,468
So...

1400
01:37:38,302 --> 01:37:41,146
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1401
01:37:44,017 --> 01:37:45,189
Did they?

1402
01:37:52,568 --> 01:37:55,162
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1403
01:37:55,321 --> 01:37:56,573
I'm glad you like it.

1404
01:37:56,739 --> 01:37:58,115
Mmm.

1405
01:37:59,741 --> 01:38:01,789
Oh.

1406
01:38:01,953 --> 01:38:06,880
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1407
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:08,509
Take me back?

1408
01:38:11,005 --> 01:38:14,760
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1409
01:38:14,925 --> 01:38:17,678
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1410
01:38:17,845 --> 01:38:20,473
...and something else real special.

1411
01:38:22,017 --> 01:38:23,269
Mmm.

1412
01:38:23,435 --> 01:38:27,611
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1413
01:38:30,609 --> 01:38:32,031
Mama can have a piece.

1414

Have you lost your mind?

I just wanted to see her take a bite.

Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

name, or what country I live in,

1547
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,727
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1548
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:48,440
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1549

and that she ate Minny's shit.

for 12 people.

over here if I begged.

I can't do this to Johnny any more.

the terrible awful.

That you was making fun of her.

It's my fault she pounced on you.

If you leave Mr. Johnny...

1565

...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

Oh.

1726
02:03:19,499 --> 02:03:20,967
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1728

I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1729

Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

In fact, I'm sure of it.

1731
02:03:37,519 --> 02:03:39,738
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

02:03:40,397 --> 02:03:42,274
Go on.

1733
02:03:42,442 --> 02:03:45,537
Get off my property. Now!

1734
02:03:46,613 --> 02:03:49,867
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

Yes, ma'am.

02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:29,243
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1741
02:04:29,951 --> 02:04:31,578
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1742
02:04:33,288 --> 02:04:35,791
Because we are going shopping.

How do you know about New York?

Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

Courage sometimes skips a generation.

Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

I can't leave you like this.

1751
02:05:17,335 --> 02:05:20,463
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1752
02:05:20,629 --> 02:05:23,098
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1753
02:05:23,258 --> 02:05:26,432
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1754
02:05:26,595 --> 02:05:31,021
but I have decided not to die.

1755
02:05:36,522 --> 02:05:37,694
Oh, Mama.

1756
02:05:37,857 --> 02:05:39,575
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1757
02:05:39,734 --> 02:05:41,987
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

- but they wouldn't allow it.

All of them.

But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

No.

when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

were missing from the felt wrapper.

kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

1857
02:13:56,768 --> 02:13:59,817
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1858
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:04,403
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1861

She says she doesn't have them.

1864

Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:26,513
And I'll be calling the police.

I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

of her own children.

Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1873
02:15:03,632 --> 02:15:05,509
but I can send you for being a thief.

1874
02:15:05,675 --> 02:15:08,098
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1875
02:15:08,804 --> 02:15:11,933
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1876
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,775
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

1877
02:15:15,937 --> 02:15:18,611
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:29,372
Call the police, Elizabeth.
[gasps]

1881
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:32,838
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1882
02:15:32,997 --> 02:15:33,998
[Elizabeth] Aibileen, stop!

1883
02:15:34,165 --> 02:15:36,212
You a godless woman.

1884
02:15:38,252 --> 02:15:40,346
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1885
02:15:43,007 --> 02:15:44,350
Ain't you tired?

1886
02:15:57,773 --> 02:16:00,196
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1887
02:16:14,834 --> 02:16:17,256
Don't go, Aibee.

1888
02:16:18,462 --> 02:16:20,806
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1889
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:25,390
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1890
02:16:25,553 --> 02:16:28,306
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1891
02:16:28,473 --> 02:16:30,441
No, that's not the reason.

1892
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,150
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1893
02:16:34,313 --> 02:16:36,566
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1894
02:16:36,732 --> 02:16:38,734
Baby. Baby.

1895
02:16:39,735 --> 02:16:42,238
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1896
02:16:42,405 --> 02:16:44,533
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1897
02:16:44,699 --> 02:16:50,126
You is kind. You is smart.

1898
02:16:50,288 --> 02:16:51,961
You is important.

1899
02:16:52,124 --> 02:16:54,001
That's right, Baby Girl.

1900
02:16:59,214 --> 02:17:00,682
Don't go, Aibee.

1901
02:17:00,841 --> 02:17:02,058
I gots to, baby.

1902
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,643
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1903
02:17:22,949 --> 02:17:25,202
[Aibileen] Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1904
02:17:27,662 --> 02:17:30,541
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1905
02:17:30,706 --> 02:17:33,425
[Screaming] Aibee!

1906
02:17:35,337 --> 02:17:36,634
[Mae Mobley screaming]

1907
02:17:36,797 --> 02:17:38,890
God says we need to love our enemies.

1908
02:17:39,048 --> 02:17:40,391
[Mae Mobley] No!

1909
02:17:42,302 --> 02:17:43,645
It hard to do.

1910
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:46,353
[Yelling]

1911
02:17:49,893 --> 02:17:52,021
But it can start by telling the truth.

1912
02:17:57,193 --> 02:18:00,788
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1913
02:18:04,159 --> 02:18:06,207
Once I told the truth about that...

1914
02:18:08,205 --> 02:18:09,878
...I felt free.

1915
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:21,394
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1916
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:25,432
And the things I seen and done.

1917
02:18:31,188 --> 02:18:35,534
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1918
02:18:38,863 --> 02:18:40,991
I guess it's gonna be me.
