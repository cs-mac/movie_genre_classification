00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,290
Why would a Briga
pursue another Briga?

19
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,556
Capture the shuttle.
Top priority.

(music playing)

37
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,191
NARRATOR:
Around its blue parent planet,

38
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:20,757
Gaia circles Annwn,
a world at war.

39
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,690
Once this world was controlled

40
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:27,657
by eight tribes
called the Garm...

41
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,256
Briga, Wurm, Basse, Seta,

42
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:38,157
Borzoi, Zenen,
Kumtak, and Columba.

43
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:43,790
Each tribe had
its own form and language

44
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,789
based on its function,

45
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,289
and they served
the god who created them.

46
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:57,590
However, Danaan, the Creator,
left this world one day,

47
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:01,289
and these tribes
who were left behind

48
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:06,289
began to fight each other
for supremacy.

49
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:09,423
After a long period
of conflict,

50
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,924
the atmosphere
has been contaminated

51
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:15,289
and the surface
left covered in ruins.

52
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:18,790
Of the eight tribes,
only three,

53
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:24,323
the Briga, Columba, and Kumtak,
now remained.

54
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:26,389
And even the Druids,

55
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:31,757
said to convey the word of God,
have died out.

56
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,490
The Briga have established
dominance of the surface

57
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,556
with their military might.

58
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:45,691
The Columba rule the skies
by deploying mechanized units.

59
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,857
The Kumtak have
barely managed to survive

60
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,157
by offering their superior
information technology to Briga.

61
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,156
The Briga and Columba, the two
great tribes of land and air,

62
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,423
were about to begin battle
of dominance over Annwn.

<i>KIAKRA</i> COMPUTER:
Data consolidation complete.

67
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:56,256
Thank you for your brave service
to the <i>Kiakra,</i> Khara-22.

68
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:00,890
New identification code
for the squadron is Khara-23.

69
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,690
INTERROGATOR: Type, Kumtak.

70
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,422
I.D. code unknown.

71

INTERROGATOR 2:
Accessing auxiliary brain.

Infiltrating memory hive.

73
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,924
INTERROGATOR 1:
Function, system analysis

74
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:44,556
and interrogation,
also information management.

75
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,657
Consistent with the Kumtak
information officers

76
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,289
serving the Briga.

77
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,689
Scan the Garm
terminal access log.

78
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:55,790
INTERROGATOR 2:
Last access, minus-3716 sen.

79
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,422
His breach
was minus-2517 sen.

80
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,323
You're telling me he's been
off the Garm network

81
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:01,724
for over a thousand sens.

82
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,356
INTERROGATOR 2: He must be
operating as a stand-alone.

83
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,123
What about
that other individual?

84
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,890
INTERROGATOR 2: Type, unknown.

85
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,790
Function, unknown.

86
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:16,923
INTERROGATOR 1:
There's a powerful firewall

87
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,457
in the subject's
auxiliary brain.

88
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,523
Could be a trap.

89
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:25,624
Auxiliary brain manipulation
is a Kumtak specialty.

90
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,356
Try the Kumtak's
memory nest again.

91
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,523
See what he knows
about the other subject.

92
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:33,289
INTERROGATOR 2:
Scanning. Extracting.

93
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:36,824
INTERROGATOR 1: Type, Druid.

94
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,922
I.D. code unknown.

95
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,556
- A Druid?
- A Druid?

96
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,824
- Impossible.
- A Druid?

97
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:46,422
For the sake of argument,
let's say it is a Druid.

98
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,623
The more important question

99
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,289
is not one of existence,
but of action.

100
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,922
What would drive a Kumtak
to flee the Briga?

101
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,423
If the terminal access logs
are correct,

102
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,290
he's been on the run
for some time.

103
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:01,257
We've no choice
but to interrogate them directly

104
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,889
if we're to learn
anything of substance.

105
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,922
INTERROGATOR 2: Wait.
Trace data detected

106
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,623
in the type-Druid's headgear
and secondary buffer.

107
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:09,656
Extracting.

108
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,190
Is that...

109
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:29,889
Danaan?

110
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,724
(yawns)

111
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,256
KUMTAK: Are you
the Columba pilot

112
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,190
that died trying to save us?

113
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:16,557
What if I am?

114
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:19,690
WYDD: Thank you.

115
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:25,222
I was just following orders.

116
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,822
WYDD: Maybe so,

117
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:30,289
but it seems like someone else
would like to thank you.

118
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,156
You seem entitled
to receive a blessing,

119
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,757
although that would be
for a Gula to decide.

120
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,157
(Gula groans)

121
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,623
(whimpers)

122
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:49,223
Garm in this ship
restrict a Gula's movement?

123
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:56,489
To be touched by a Gula

124
00:13:56,523 --> 00:14:00,624
is to receive a blessing
of great fortune and protection.

125
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,323
To the best of my knowledge,

126
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:06,856
Nascien is the only one
the Gula's ever blessed.

127
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,756
Would you care to try?

128
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:21,490
(Gula grumbles)

129
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:34,423
(whimpers)

130
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,556
(grumbles)

131
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,789
(brakes squeal)

132
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,356
Hmm.

133
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,324
(machinery humming)

134
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:20,256
(platform whirring)

135
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,222
Where is the Gula?

136
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:35,623
A Gula is always searching
for someone or something.

137
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,756
(music playing)

138
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,789

139
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,523

140
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,290

00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,655
(grumbles)

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,524
(whimpers)

143
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,889
How did you get down here?

144
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,324
(grumbles)

145
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:31,656
Gula!

146
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,423
Interrogation will commence.

147
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:51,688
Kumtak, who is that individual
you fled the Briga with?

148
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,524
My dear interrogator,

149
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:59,556
you are aware of the existence
of the Sage of the Trees,

150
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:03,156
those who convey all the words
of our creator, Danaan?

151
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,523
If by the Sage of the Trees,

152
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:08,489
you mean Druids, then yes.

153
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:13,357
We are familiar with both
their existence and extinction.

154
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,855
WYDD: Yes, along with
the Wurm, the Basse,

155
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:20,190
the Seta, the Borzoi,
and the Zenen,

156
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:24,390
all extinct
after years and years of war.

157
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:27,689
Now with the Kumtak
near extinction,

158
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,688
only the Columba and the Briga

159
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,890
remain
in any significant numbers.

160
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:34,722
Your point, Kumtak?

161
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,390
Every Garm knows this.

162
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:39,589
These are keystone memories
of our collective database.

163
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,889
Yes, but just because
you commit something to memory

164
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:45,289
does not make it a fact.

165
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,622
In our collective memory,

166
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:50,789
the last of the Druids
were killed off long ago,

167
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:55,156
but the truth is, one survives.

168
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,389
Druids are said to have
access to tremendous power,

169
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,656
and if that power
could be harnessed,

170
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:09,189
then total systems dominance
could be achieved.

171
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:12,390
That, at least,
was the thinking of the Briga.

172
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,223
The Briga tried to use
the power of the Druids?

173
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:18,189
That sounds like
something they would think of.

174
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,689
There are stories that a Kumtak
once tried to use Druids

175
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,890
to gain the power of Danaan
and challenge the Briga.

176
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:44,788
But that Kumtak's ambitions
brought great shame to his pack,

177
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:49,255
and he was ousted from the clan
as a heretic.

178
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,890
Surely there's no need

179
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,757
to follow in the footsteps
of that Kumtak

180
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,390
who played with systems
beyond his comprehension

181
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:58,222
and ended up a pariah.

182
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:03,355
WYDD: No matter how much
the Columba boast

183
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,156
of their speed and mobility,

184
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,022
the Brigas' mighty warships
and armored forces

185
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:10,955
remain as great
a threat as ever.

186
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:14,122
Would you not call
attacking a powerful enemy

187
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:16,856
the very height of foolishness?

188
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:19,123
So why have you come to us?

189
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,856
The Briga and the Kumtak

190
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,389
have been united
for countless cycles.

191
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,689
Enslaved, not united.

192
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,690
So you've come to offer us

193
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:32,656
the power of the Druids
against the Briga

194
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,823
in exchange
for your tribe's freedom?

195
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,956
If that is what you want,

196
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:45,623
then, yes,
that is what I'm offering.

197
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,122
(barks)

198
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:51,855
Gula.

199
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,855
(Gula whimpers)

200
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,056
(grumbles)

201
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,722
- (barks)
- Gotcha.

202
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:12,390
LEAD INTERROGATOR: Kumtak...

203
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,855
you say
that by combining our power

204
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:18,289
with that of the Druid,
we can destroy the Briga.

205
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:21,723
How do we know
that what you say is true?

206
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:25,189
WYDD: If you allow me access

207
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:26,922
to this ship's
information core,

208
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,288
I will combine it
with the Druid's,

209
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,389
and you will see firsthand
the true power of the Druid.

210
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,088
Don't be ridiculous, Kumtak.

211
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,055
You'll trigger an overflow
and destroy the braincase.

212
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,390
Sir, you aren't
seriously considering

213
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,188
giving him access, are you?

214
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,390
The Kumtak are notorious

215
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:46,289
for their skills
at manipulating data.

216
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,921
How do we know
what this Kumtak says is true,

217
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,757
that it's not all
some elaborate trap

218
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,322
by the Briga, sir?

219
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:56,122
Give the Kumtak access
to the <i>Kiakra's</i> main core.

220
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:57,288
Sir!

221
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,888
There is a Druid
standing before you,

222
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,155
a Druid.

223
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:04,223
Don't you understand
what this means?

224
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,788
Give the Kumtak access now.

225
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,022
INTERROGATOR 1: Yes, sir.

226
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:11,756
Port opened
in the staging area firewall.

227
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,723
Thy right hand
shall teach them to fear thee.

228
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:20,223
See for yourself
the power of the Druids.

229

(chorus vocalizing)

Danaan, you make yourselves
known to us only in visions.

232
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:20,722
We only speak to you in dreams.

233
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:21,722
Stop it!

234
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:23,721
Cut her off! Cut her off!

235
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,290
(energy crackling)

236
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:32,721

is to take back
the Kumtak and the Druid alive.

242
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,155
Ignore the Gula.

243
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,289
Any Columba, you kill on sight.

244
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:06,023
Team one, take care
of the sleep hive.

245
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:07,721
Team two, hit the hangar

246
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,088
and ground
as many Six-Wings as you can.

247
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:13,255

327
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:13,754
(Gula barks)

328
00:39:20,354 --> 00:39:24,221
Even an obstinate Briga
like him knows it's a grave sin

329
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:27,154
to kill one
who's been blessed by Gula.

330
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,154
(grumbles)

331
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:35,954
(yawns)

332
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,188
(seabirds calling)

333
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:56,754
WYDD: You used manna.

334
00:39:56,788 --> 00:39:59,988
It makes you faster, stronger,

335
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:02,755
allows you
to heal more rapidly

336
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:05,255
than if you were
in your sleep hive.

337
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:10,955
But there's a price to pay.

338
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:13,221
If you use too much at once,

339
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:16,821
your body will destroy itself
from within,

340
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:21,188
accelerating your metabolism,

341
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,623
aging you, wearing you out.

342
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:31,254
You talk like you know
more about the Garm

343
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,054
than they know about themselves,

344
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,188
like you've forgotten
you're one of us.

345
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,355
Have you ever wondered

346
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,854
what it truly means
to be a Garm?

347
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:43,088
Our core memories
are so limited.

348
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,988
Think. Your weapons,

349
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:50,121
the Columba carriers,
the Briga cruisers,

350
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:53,389
the systems
that operate them all,

351
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:57,055
nothing was created
by the Garm.

352
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,887
How long have they existed?

353
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:03,654
No matter how hard
we trace our memories

354
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:06,221
or how we trace the records,

355
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,955
the answer's the same.

356
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:12,088
Nothing is created by the Garm.

357
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,755
They've existed
from the very beginning.

358
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:18,954
The Garm don't create.

359
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:20,621
We maintain.

360
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:28,321
If we don't know
where we came from,

361
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,356
how would we know
where we're going?

362
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,822
(seabirds calling)

363
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:42,854
KHARA: Heresy.

364
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:45,887
What you're saying is heresy.

365
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720
A Garm fulfills his mission.
That's all.

366
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:49,955
Is it?

367
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:55,188
Do you know where you are?

368
00:41:57,154 --> 00:42:00,254
Do you know what that is?
The Torc Sea.

369
00:42:00,288 --> 00:42:01,955
Danaan, our creator, made it

370
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:05,755
to separate the Garm
from the lands of the Druids.

371
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,987
Those lands are
forbidden to Garm like us.

372
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,721
Only there can I follow
the memories of Danaan,

373
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:16,188
who vanished from these lands.

374
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,654
Danaan?

375
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:26,721
(sighs)

376
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:30,155
Don't you?

377
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:34,155
Don't you want to know
why our creator left us?

378
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,254
WYDD: Once we cross
the Torc Sea,

379
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:14,421
Nascien will lead me
to Dual Grund,

380
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:16,055
where I can gain access

381
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:19,255
to the upper-level systems
of the Druids.

382
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:22,821
That is where the truth
behind Danaan's absence lies.

383
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:27,089
And what about me?

384
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,021
And the Briga?

385
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:33,222
You just expect us
to follow you?

386
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,888
Cut off from your packs,

387
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,754
Garm like you will die
wandering in the wasteland.

388
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:41,022
Your memories
will not be downloaded.

389
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:44,021
You will not reawaken
in your sleep hive cells.

390
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,287
But in Dual Grund,

391
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:48,821
you may find another fate
waiting for you.

392
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:51,988
What, I cannot say.

393
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,221
But cut off from your pack
as you are, the choice is yours.

394
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,687
The tide is rising.

395
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,254
Are you coming or not?

396
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:11,921
(beads rattle)

397
00:44:18,787 --> 00:44:21,254
SKELLIG: Where do you think
you're going, Kumtak?

398
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:27,722
Across the Torc Sea
to Dual Grund.

399
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:31,854
(sighs)

400
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:33,421
You're not going anywhere.

401
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:36,854
My mission's to take you
back to Briga command.

402
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:39,655
You can die now

403
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:42,088
or later on your own
out in the wasteland,

404
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,854
but we're going to Dual Grund.

405
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,154
SKELLIG: You're not gonna
make it across on foot.

406
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,355
Get on.

407
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,055
Why should I trust you, Briga?

408
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:04,287
'Cause if I could kill
a Garm blessed by a Gula,

409
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,121
you'd already be dead.

410
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:11,421
I've come too far to let this
crazy Kumtak just walk away.

411
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:13,687
You wanna go to Dual Grund?

412
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:14,855
I'll take you.

413
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:17,287
Once your business there
is finished,

414
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:20,088
I'm gonna take this crazy Kumtak
and the Druid

415
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:21,322
back to Briga command,

416
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,921
and the Gula could do
as the Gula pleases.

417
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,387
Deal.

418
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,089
SKELLIG: So you do have
some sense, Columba.

419
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:35,687
It's Khara, Khara-23.

420
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:38,421
(Skellig chuckles)

421
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:40,687
You're telling me
your generation code?

422
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:43,054
(laughs)

423
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,787
That information's
only shared within a pack.

424
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:50,155
I am Wydd, Wydd-256.

425
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:58,055
The Druid is Nascien-666.

426
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:00,821
You're kidding me.

427
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:09,654
I'm Skellig...

428
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:11,854
(sighs)

429
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:13,822
Skellig-58.

430
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,255
(tank whirring)

431
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:31,855
NARRATOR: These people
who have all lost their packs

432
00:46:31,888 --> 00:46:34,821
miraculously meet and begin

433
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:37,921
their pilgrim's journey
to the holy land

434
00:46:37,954 --> 00:46:42,354
in search of the memories
of the Garm.

435
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,320
(women vocalizing)

436
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:35,722
(chorus vocalizing)

437
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:06,921
(women vocalizing)

438
00:48:17,054 --> 00:48:18,055
(singing ends)

439
00:48:21,754 --> 00:48:23,688
(music ends)

440
00:48:25,953 --> 00:48:26,920
(rifle fires)

441
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:29,755
(barking)

442
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:33,888
Not bad.

443
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:40,186
Funny.

444
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:43,421
A Gula can live where birds are,

445
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,121
but we can't.

446
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,788
How much manna
do we have left?

447
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,021
Uh, three selmas,

448
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,887
if we're strict
with rationing.

449
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,888
And there'd be even less

450
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,320
if the Druid didn't seem
to be surviving off her...

451
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,754
connection with these stones.

452
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:06,820
Even if we make it
to Dual Grund,

453
00:49:06,854 --> 00:49:11,722
if there's no manna there,
we're finished.

454
00:49:13,186 --> 00:49:15,286
You're regretting
your decision?

455
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,720
(chuckles)

456
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,321
A Briga never regrets
his actions.

457
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:23,321
You remember that.

458
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:49,820
- (sighs)
- (whimpers)

459
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,253
(chuckles)

460
00:50:01,286 --> 00:50:02,287
(sighs)

461
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,754
(sighs)

462
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:34,253
I came to relieve you.

463
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,654
I'm fine.

464
00:50:43,453 --> 00:50:45,154
Go back to sleep.

465
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:50,854
I can't sleep when Wydd
sleeps so soundly.

466
00:50:50,888 --> 00:50:53,955
What does he know that we don't?

467
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,855
I thought you trusted him.

468
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:57,288
(scoffs) Hardly.

469
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:01,754
I can't shake the feeling
that he had something to do

470
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:03,822
with the disaster
that brought down the <i>Kiakra.</i>

471
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:07,086
Well, if you can't trust him,

472
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,187
what makes you think
you could trust a Briga like me?

473
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:13,687
We have a deal.

474
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,086
(chuckles)

475
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,787
Unbelievable.

476
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:21,920
If you're a code 23,

477
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,621
that means you have a long
service record as a warrior.

478
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:28,788
A Garm without a pack

479
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:31,821
tends to throw caution
to the wind.

480
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:34,688
If that's true,
I'm not the only one.

481
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,186
(sighs)

482
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,888
It's not the same thing.

483
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:42,787
I have my mission.

484
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:44,755
You made a choice.

485
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:48,854
Out here,
is there really a difference?

486
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:58,354
Go get some rest.

487
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:00,921
If I need relief, I'll...

488
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:02,921
I'll come and wake you.

489
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:06,654
I told you I'm not tired.

490
00:52:15,721 --> 00:52:17,922
(sighs)

491
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,654
Do you, um...

492
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:45,154
What did it feel like,

493
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:47,253
to be touched by a Gula?

494
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:48,987
Do you feel...

495
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:50,687
Do you feel any different?

496
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,321
It's just...

497
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:01,355
I don't know how to explain it.

498
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:05,286
She drools a lot.

499
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,254
Is it, um...

500
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,921
Was it sticky?

501
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:20,787
I felt something warm and soft
when she touched me...

502
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,720
not on the outside,
but on the inside,

503
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:29,721
if that makes any sense.

504
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:34,987
And her scent...

505
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,388
I feel like I've smelled it
somewhere before.

506
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:45,920
I don't know.

507
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:49,754
Your Briga pack
didn't have any Gulas?

508
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,287
We used to.

509
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,887
I never saw one, no.

510
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:04,919
Gulas are short-lived,

511
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:07,153
eh, and clones are forbidden.

512
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:18,254
Skellig,
what's your first memory?

513
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,387
Uh...

514
00:54:28,454 --> 00:54:31,655
uh, target practice maybe?

515
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:34,254
Mission briefing?

516
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:37,354
No, back further.

517
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:41,088
What's the first thing that you
can recall ever experiencing?

518
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,354
For me, I think...

519
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:50,121
the first thing that I ever saw
was light coming in

520
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,354
when my sleep hive cell
opened up.

521
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,987
Your first memory isn't
something similar to that?

522
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:01,655
So what if it is?

523
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,053
We're Garm.

524
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:05,786
We fight. We die. We download.

525
00:55:06,986 --> 00:55:08,886
(chuckles)

526
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,755
Being around the Druid's
going to your head, Columba.

527
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:15,053
"What is your first memory?"

528
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:17,054
Why is it any more important

529
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:20,787
than your third
or your tenth or your last?

530
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,021
Skellig,
why are there no young Garm?

531
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,953
Gulas give birth to pups.

532
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:31,853
Even birds at the Torc Sea lay...
raise chicks from eggs.

533
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:34,786
Why is it just the Garm
that have no young?

534
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,154
Danaan created us that way.

535
00:55:40,154 --> 00:55:43,187
Why would Danaan create
the Garm to be like that?

536
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,655
What was the point?

537
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:48,053
Is that why
you wanna go to Dual Grund?

538
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:50,621
What, to... to find answers?

539
00:55:51,688 --> 00:55:53,121
I don't know.

540
00:55:53,154 --> 00:55:54,920
(scoffs)

541
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,786
You asked if something changed
when Gula touched me,

542
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:01,187
and something did.

543
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,186
I don't know what,

544
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:05,986
but something
inside of me changed,

545
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:09,420
and if going to Dual Grund
tells me what that something is,

546
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:10,953
then so be it.

547
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:19,053
(sighs)

548
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:24,354
You should go.

549
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:33,387
Go.

550
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:11,886
SKELLIG: Visibility's shot!

551
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:14,286
I can't see anything,
just this fog.

552
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,120
It's too dangerous
to keep going.

553
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:18,353
We're stuck.

554
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:20,787
KHARA: Wait.

555
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,120
I think the fog's thinning out.

556
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:25,887
Skellig, there on the left.

557
00:57:25,919 --> 00:57:28,886
SKELLIG: Distance, 390 nortes.

558
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,054
What is that, a hill?

559
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,754
(distant birds squawking)

560
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,053
KHARA: I've heard the birds
can travel from this world

561
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,920
to the other using their wings.

562
00:58:02,454 --> 00:58:04,887
WYDD: The place
where the world ends

563
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,954
and the world begins.

564
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,621
Dual Grund.

565
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,120
This is the place,

566
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:18,020
the exact vision that Nascien
projected in my sleep.

567
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:19,920
In your sleep?

568
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:22,153
You mean you dream?

569
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,887
I thought only the Gula

570
00:58:23,919 --> 00:58:26,153
were blessed
with the ability to dream

571
00:58:26,187 --> 00:58:28,787
until I met Nascien.

572
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:37,321
I've never doubted

573
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:40,021
or regretted my decisions,
and yet...

574
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,387
coming to the holy land,

575
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,053
it could bring disaster
to the Briga.

576
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:51,254
There's no turning back now,
not for us,

577
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:53,053
nor for the world.

578
00:58:54,453 --> 00:58:57,853
If we are the harbinger
of things to come,

579
00:58:57,887 --> 00:59:00,220
what lies ahead?

580
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:02,286
If that was not the case,

581
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,653
then why would a heretic like me
and Nascien have turned up?

582
00:59:06,686 --> 00:59:11,287
And you can't say that Khara
willingly left her pack.

583
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:16,320
Neither did I, I suppose.

584
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:21,087
Perhaps we'll have
a more different future

585
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,620
if Danaan's curse is lifted.

586
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:26,720
The future.

587
00:59:28,852 --> 00:59:31,819
That's such an absurd concept.

588
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:37,020
Briga, all we have
is the future.

589
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,053
Ah, Kumtak.

590
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:43,653
Guess there's
no turning back now.

591
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:48,988
(birds squawking)

592
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,021
(chorus vocalizing)

593
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:13,753
(singing ends)

594
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,786
(barks, grumbles)

595
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,653
(whimpers)

596
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:14,021
Cold feet, Skellig?

597
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:19,386
Only way forward's on foot.

598
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:21,286
Someone's gotta be backup,

599
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,387
and I'm the only one that knows
how to work this thing.

600
01:01:27,453 --> 01:01:29,753
You keep your com channel open.

601
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,786
You run into trouble,
just say the word.

602
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:35,419
(Gula barks)

603
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:37,053
Khara...

604
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:43,054
What?

605
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:48,053
It's the first time...

606
01:01:54,453 --> 01:01:57,386
It's the first time
you called me by name.

607
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:03,121
(sighs)

608
01:02:05,987 --> 01:02:07,254
What about you?

609
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:08,886
I, um...

610
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:11,953
I don't need
as much manna as you.

611
01:02:11,987 --> 01:02:15,188
Besides, I got my pal here
if anything goes wrong.

612
01:02:21,752 --> 01:02:23,253
You said there was something

613
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:25,954
you wanted to find out
at Dual Grund.

614
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,187
Go find out.

615
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:35,720
Go find out if there's a future
waiting for us, for the Garm,

616
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,720
something that's different
than this.

617
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:44,121
Go.

618
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:16,921
(water splashing)

619
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,987
(sniffing)

620
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,054
(grumbles)

621
01:04:39,153 --> 01:04:41,088
(ticking)

622
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,286
(rumbling)

623
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,786
KHARA: Skellig,
there's something in here.

624
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,053
80 markes ahead.
Do you see it?

625
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:57,787
SKELLIG: I see it.

626
01:04:57,819 --> 01:05:00,753
I'm picking up two more
on your left and right as well.

627
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:01,820
Look out. They're moving.

628
01:05:08,253 --> 01:05:10,420
KHARA: I'm going in
for a closer look.

629
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,986
SKELLIG: Be careful, Khara.

630
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,153
Whatever's out there, it's big.

631
01:05:15,185 --> 01:05:16,653
(rumbling)

632
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,621
(chorus vocalizing)

633
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,821
(metal creaks)

634
01:05:26,752 --> 01:05:29,087
KHARA: Skellig, it's a Giant!
It's moving!

635
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:42,819
Wydd, stay low,
and stay out of the way.

636
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:44,953
Skellig, fire! Keep firing!

637
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,153
SKELLIG: Don't worry about him.

638
01:05:46,186 --> 01:05:47,987
Worry about the other two
on your flank!

639
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:49,020
KHARA: Got it.

640
01:05:54,153 --> 01:05:55,186
Something must have
been triggered

641
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:57,387
when Nascien
accessed the system.

642
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,687
Anything else
you forgot to tell us?

643
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:03,320
These Giants have a weakness.
They're not like us.

644
01:06:03,352 --> 01:06:07,252
They require physical connection
to the... to their network

645
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:10,086
in order to identify
and attack an intruder.

646
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:13,120
Cut the connection, and that
should stop those Giants.

647
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,787
Skellig, did you get that?

648
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,786
SKELLIG: Loud and clear.
Cut the cable, kill the Giants.

649
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,754
Skellig,
you keep them distracted.

650
01:06:19,786 --> 01:06:20,988
I'll find the cables.

651
01:06:45,086 --> 01:06:47,021
(engine grinding)

652
01:06:56,153 --> 01:06:57,854
SKELLIG: Anytime now, Khara!

653
01:07:00,853 --> 01:07:02,186
Found it!

654
01:07:07,118 --> 01:07:09,053
(creaking)

655
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,986
SKELLIG: That's one down, Khara.

656
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:16,352
- (tube hisses)
- (grunts)

657
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:18,920
SKELLIG: Be a decoy,
and flank the Giant!

658
01:07:26,786 --> 01:07:28,219
(grunts)

659
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,754
(creaking)

660
01:07:45,252 --> 01:07:47,252
Nice shooting, Skellig.

661
01:07:47,286 --> 01:07:49,954
WYDD: Khara, can you hear me?

662
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:50,986
Wydd, go ahead.

663
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:52,985
WYDD: We found an access point.

664
01:07:53,018 --> 01:07:55,352
Nascien's going to try
to disable the defense system,

665
01:07:55,385 --> 01:07:56,819
but it will take time.

666
01:07:56,852 --> 01:08:00,152
Can you keep
the remaining Giants distracted?

667
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:03,354
KHARA: Just hurry, Wydd.

668
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:07,886
SKELLIG: I'll take the big one.

669
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,387
You take the little one.

670
01:08:12,787 --> 01:08:14,620
KHARA: Big one? Little one?

671
01:08:22,285 --> 01:08:24,219
(distant gunfire echoing)

672
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,753
(women vocalizing)

673
01:08:40,386 --> 01:08:41,387
(singing ends)

674
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:50,253
(gasps)

675
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:54,020
What happened
to "the big one"?

676
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:56,386
SKELLIG: They're all big ones.

677
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:06,853
(energy crackles)

678
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,854
(grunts)

679
01:09:30,886 --> 01:09:32,087
Skellig!

680
01:09:33,286 --> 01:09:35,854
(gasping)

681
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:38,654
Skellig, run.

682
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,821
- (grunts)
- Skellig!

683
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:42,287
(yells)

684
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:57,753
(yelling)

685
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,086
(panting)

686
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:23,820
WYDD: We've disengaged
the system.

687
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:24,819
We're safe now.

688
01:10:24,851 --> 01:10:26,885
Khara, do you read me?

689
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:29,886
We've located the position
of the central terminal,

690
01:10:29,919 --> 01:10:32,654
the core of Dual Grund.

691
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,686
Nascien will show you the path.

692
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,286
KHARA: We have to help Skellig.

693
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:39,687
Forget Skellig.

694
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,120
Nothing could've survived
that explosion.

695
01:10:42,153 --> 01:10:47,952
Khara, if you want to know
the truth, forget Skellig,

696
01:10:47,986 --> 01:10:50,986
and follow the path
that Nascien reveals.

697
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:00,786
(fire crackling)

698
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:25,386
(silence)

699
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,653
(footsteps approaching)

700
01:12:00,152 --> 01:12:01,319
(grumbles)

701
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:13,053
NASCIEN: You have
served me well, Kumtak.

702
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:15,620
Nascien.

703
01:12:23,985 --> 01:12:26,919
(groaning)

704
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:43,719
(panting)

705
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:49,753
(overlapping voices)
I am Malakh,

706
01:12:49,785 --> 01:12:51,786
messenger of the Gods.

707
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:59,053
Nascien is only the shell I wear
when I walk in your world.

708
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:03,052
Garm type, Druid, you call it.

709
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:09,052
I have come to this place so I
may fulfill my lord's bidding.

710
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:11,019
(rumbling)

711
01:13:27,218 --> 01:13:29,152
(chorus vocalizing)

712
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:10,953
WYDD: I found you.

713
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:13,019
I protected you.

714
01:14:14,452 --> 01:14:16,287
I killed for you.

715
01:14:17,885 --> 01:14:19,186
For what?

716
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:25,086
Tell me.

717
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:27,320
Tell me, what have I done?

718
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:39,053
(metal clanking)

719
01:14:53,452 --> 01:14:54,886
Malakh.

720
01:14:54,919 --> 01:14:56,786
(groans)

721
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:01,386
Speak not my name.

722
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:04,219
Listen well, Kumtak.

723
01:15:04,253 --> 01:15:07,220
My name is Wydd,

724
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,886
Wydd-256.

725
01:15:09,918 --> 01:15:13,819
NASCIEN: Time had
stood still for the Garm,

726
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:19,818
but by your coming here,
it has begun to flow once more.

727
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:24,986
The time of the Garms'
extinction has begun.

728
01:15:25,018 --> 01:15:28,386
(groans)

729
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:33,252
Your body
will still prove useful to me.

730
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:36,053
The braincase of a Kumtak

731
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:42,052
will be able to freely access
the central Garm network.

732
01:15:42,086 --> 01:15:46,086
I shall make free use of it.

733
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:49,985
However,
all other central memories

734
01:15:50,019 --> 01:15:52,719
will be deleted from it.

735
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:56,719
I am Wydd,

736
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,852
Wydd...

737
01:15:58,886 --> 01:16:00,686
256.

738
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:04,953
I am Wydd,

739
01:16:04,986 --> 01:16:07,653
Wydd...

740
01:16:07,685 --> 01:16:09,986
2-5...

741
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:14,386
NASCIEN: How peculiar.

742
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,852
It would appear
that the few thoughts

743
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:19,786
remaining
in this body's braincase

744
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:24,019
do not wish its memories
of you to be deleted.

745
01:16:24,053 --> 01:16:27,886
I have placed here
a flaming sword,

746
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:30,819
which turns every direction

747
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:34,918
to guard the way
to the Tree of Life.

748
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:35,953
(automatic weapon fires)

749
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:38,619
(splash)

750
01:16:52,952 --> 01:16:54,853
(clicking)

751
01:16:56,052 --> 01:16:58,919
(clicking)

752
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:21,952
(grunts)

753
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:31,819
KHARA: Give it up.
There's no way out.

754
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:33,353
You're trapped in there.

755
01:17:33,386 --> 01:17:36,153
My name is Khara-23.

756
01:17:36,186 --> 01:17:39,919
Now tell me, why do we fight?

757
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:44,352
What meaning does the Garms'
endless fighting have?

758
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:45,819
Answer me.

759
01:17:52,384 --> 01:17:54,785
(overlapping voices)
The owner of this body

760
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:56,786
already appears
to know the answer.

761
01:17:56,818 --> 01:17:58,953
Then tell me.

762
01:17:58,985 --> 01:18:00,852
(thunder rumbling)

763
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:04,052
(rain falling)

764
01:18:47,253 --> 01:18:50,120
What was is and ever shall be.

765
01:18:50,153 --> 01:18:53,619
I form the light
and create darkness.

766
01:18:56,452 --> 01:18:59,185
When this world
was not yet formed,

767
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:03,052
They came from far, far away.

768
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:06,653
Then They divided this world
into heaven and earth

769
01:19:06,685 --> 01:19:11,052
and filled the space between
with living things.

770
01:19:11,086 --> 01:19:12,853
- (clanking)
- (chorus vocalizing)

771
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,153
Finally They created the Garm

772
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:19,285
and bequeathed unto them
a portion of their technology

773
01:19:19,318 --> 01:19:23,053
that allowed the Garm
to control this world.

774
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,752
The Garm
were separated into tribes

775
01:19:29,786 --> 01:19:31,786
according to their abilities.

776
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:37,085
Eventually
they named themselves...

777
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,753
Briga, Columba, Kumtak.

778
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:47,119
And they named the individuals
that formed the tribe

779
01:19:47,153 --> 01:19:48,853
and went on to name

780
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,719
every living thing
that filled this world.

781
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:56,718
To name something
is to show dominance over it.

782
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,251
And when They
were named by the Garm,

783
01:19:59,284 --> 01:20:02,120
They abandoned the Garm
and left this world.

784
01:20:03,785 --> 01:20:07,785
They forbade the Garm
the power to create new life,

785
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:12,053
for They feared the Garm
and their reckless desire

786
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:14,952
to conquer all
that was in their world.

787
01:20:14,986 --> 01:20:20,219
And since that time,
the Garm have had no future,

788
01:20:20,252 --> 01:20:23,020
only a present.

789
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:28,251
And now the Giants will rise
and burn Annwn to ash.

790
01:20:31,752 --> 01:20:35,352
What was is and ever shall be.

791
01:20:35,385 --> 01:20:39,819
I form the light
and create darkness.

792
01:20:39,851 --> 01:20:40,918
Wait.

793
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:43,186
What do you mean,
"Ever shall be"?

794
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:45,885
Who are "They,"
and where have They gone?

795
01:20:47,317 --> 01:20:49,185
They've already begun
their next experiment

796
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:51,652
in the place
closest to this world.

797
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:54,419
That's why this world
must be destroyed.

798
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:56,686
You keep saying, "They."

799
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,920
Why don't you say their name?

800
01:21:00,184 --> 01:21:04,053
Even now, you ask their name.

801
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:05,419
(sighs)

802
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:09,252
They call themselves...

803
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:13,186
(alien language)

804
01:21:16,452 --> 01:21:19,753
(sighs)

805
01:21:21,318 --> 01:21:23,719
It means "jealous,"

806
01:21:23,752 --> 01:21:26,987
for They are a jealous God.

807
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:44,053
(chorus vocalizing)

808
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:16,185
(crying)

809
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:57,852
(singing, music end)

810
01:23:02,452 --> 01:23:04,385
(music playing)

811
01:23:11,217 --> 01:23:13,118
07-01...

812
01:23:13,152 --> 01:23:14,319
36...

813
01:23:14,352 --> 01:23:16,219
Message from
early warning craft.

814
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:19,786
Two echelons Danaan
from bearing 01-09...

815
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:22,318
- 06-03...
- 04-07...

816
01:23:22,352 --> 01:23:24,285
- Three echelons...
- 02-07...

817
01:23:24,318 --> 01:23:26,685
