1
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,942
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:24,067
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,442
<i>And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...
Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:35,275
<i>Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:38,025
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:41,025
<i>Try and make believe
this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:44,192
<i>... because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,817
<i>Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,525
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,858
<i>... I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,817
<i>There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,525
<i>... scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,608
<i>And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:05,775
<i>... the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,983
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,775
<i>I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:12,983
<i>... that I'm covered
with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,733
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,692
<i>And at first I thought,
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,275
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,150
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,983
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn."</i>

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,442
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:35,650
<i>... this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:38,692
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion
of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,608
<i>... that happens in
the final moment before death."</i>

29
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:45,358
<i>And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

30
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>... because I looked back
at the building...</i>

31
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,317
<i>... and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,567
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:57,775
<i>... that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:01,233
<i>... not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,192
<i>... but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,025
<i>... whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:12,525
<i>... the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,275
<i>... more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:20,317
<i>And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,692
<i>... for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:26,692
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,108
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:32,025
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:36,567
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:40,942
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:43,567
<i>It must stand the test of time."</i>

47
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,775
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:52,233
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,942
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.</i>

50
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,358
<i>So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,192
<i>Because I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,692
What does that exactly mean?

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,275
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,025
We found 97.

55
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,733
<i>I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.</i>

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,067
She will not go away.

57
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,025
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

58
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,317
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,692
<i>... about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,233
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,275
...pending and unresolved.

62
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,025
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

63
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,692
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,942
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,567
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,192
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:04,817
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,483
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

69
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:10,650
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,067
I'll see the turn.

71
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,608
Check.

72
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,358
Check.

73
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,108
Check.

74
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,275
Half the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,150
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,525
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,025
We played together a couple times.

78
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:35,275
That lamp place on Bowery.

79
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,108
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

80
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,692
- The Galaxy.
- That's it.

81
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:44,025
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

82
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,442
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

83
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,025
- You don't remember me?
- I remember you.

84
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,442
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

85
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:55,942
You bought some hair too.

86
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,400
With your money.

87
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,692
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,608
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,942
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,567
That was a good location.

91
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:13,567
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept telling me.

92
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,567
Action's on you.

93
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,942
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,525
Good to see you again.

95
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,275
Hello?

96
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:57,692
<i>- Michael.
- Walter.</i>

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,108
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:05,358
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,442
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,608
Just now?

101
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,442
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,692
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,025
Where?

104
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:19,025
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,192
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,233
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,900
Tell him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,358
<i>All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,275
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,025
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,608
I'm walking to the car right now.

112
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,150
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:40,900
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,525
All right. I'll be in the car.

115
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,817
<i>What they did, see,
they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,775
They widened the street.

117
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,858
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:48,525
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

119
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:52,275
...and they've got these new...
These... These...

120
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,525
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

121
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,983
- That corner there. It is blinding.
- They'll have to work that out.

122
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,983
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,775
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

124
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,192
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

125
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,317
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

126
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,400
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

127
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,150
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

128
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,525
Well, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,275
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:27,400
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

131
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,358
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?

132
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,483
A trial lawyer.

133
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,525
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,275
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

135
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:40,442
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:44,358
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

137
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:48,192
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

138
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:50,400
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,817
I suggest you go local...

140
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,858
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

141
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,067
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,275
Hey, you believe this?

143
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,733
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 12 years!

144
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,650
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

145
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:09,108
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

146
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,483
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

147
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,858
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

148
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,900
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,983
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

150
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,900
I don't know what Walter
promised you...

151
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,525
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,817
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

153
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:31,608
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

154
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,358
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,025
Elliot.

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,483
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,358
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle...

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,358
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

159
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,733
You answer me that!

160
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,442
What if someone had stolen the car?

161
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,775
Happens all the time.

162
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:14,025
Cops like hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,233
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

164
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,608
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

165
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:23,108
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,525
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

167
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,275
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:30,817
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

169
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,733
There's no play here.

170
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,858
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,692
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,942
The math on this is simple.

173
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,108
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

174
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:52,358
That's the police, isn't it?

175
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,942
No.

176
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,442
They don't call.

177
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,525
Hello.

178
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,900
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

179
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,567
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,608
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,858
You got a pen?

182
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,192
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,067
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,608
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,192
Did you eat?

186
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,233
Dad's down there waiting already.

187
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,275
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,692
Yes, I had a waffle.

189
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,733
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

190
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,233
It's a miracle.

191
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,525
Gloves?

192
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,317
Henry!

193
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,525
Come on.

194
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:54,858
Get in.

195
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,442
Got it?

196
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,858
<i>So no one's even sure
exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,192
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

198
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:13,067
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

199
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,442
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,608
Right.

201
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:21,233
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,567
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

203
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,650
This is where they all came.

204
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:29,817
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,025
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:35,358
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.

207
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:37,525
And nobody has any alliances.

208
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,983
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

209
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,150
...maybe the person you're talking to...

210
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,817
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

211
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,692
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.

212
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,192
Sounds familiar.

213
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:53,275
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

214
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:56,608
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

215
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,525
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,525
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.

217
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,567
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

218
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,192
- The book?
- Yes.

219
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:08,733
Bring it on Saturday, I'll...

220
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,150
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,442
Okay.

222
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:16,025
Well, here we go.

223
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,858
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

224
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,483
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,067
Thanks.

226
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:38,817
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,
assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,983
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,233
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

229
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,650
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

230
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,317
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

231
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,900
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

232
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,817
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,692
He says you're still gonna be short.

234
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,608
How short?

235
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:17,192
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:20,400
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,567
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:27,608
He took 1500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,400
Make a bid.

240
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,650
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,858
Just lying around, no.

242
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,483
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.

243
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,650
Forget that.

244
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:46,150
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

245
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,525
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

246
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:54,317
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:58,192
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,150
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,817
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:05,650
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:10,483
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,525
Make an offer.

253
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:20,358
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

254
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:25,067
But live like that? Even they do a program...
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,233
And then they slip? Forget it.

256
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,775
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,942
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,275
I don't know.

259
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,442
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

260
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,567
I'll ask.

261
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,275
- Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.

262
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:21,775
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,942
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,442
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave
he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,942
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,525
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:34,317
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:36,983
<i>She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,400
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,692
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,942
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:45,650
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,025
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:50,442
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

275
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,525
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

276
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,650
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,025
Thanks.

278
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,817
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,317
We left word.

280
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,650
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

281
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:04,817
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,650
<i>- This is Miami?
- Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,317
And they charged him.

284
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:11,775
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client...</i>

285
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:17,400
<i>I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,608
<i>- Yeah.
- Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,317
<i>- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:26,108
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,525
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:30,150
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

291
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,692
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:35,400
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,900
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:40,025
<i>None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,275
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

296
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:44,775
<i>- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

297
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,858
Are we merging?

298
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,525
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:53,817
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

300
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:56,108
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,858
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

302
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:02,192
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,525
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

304
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:06,483
Like I would know.

305
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,358
I don't know.

306
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:12,192
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,608
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,942
Evan?

309
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,483
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

310
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,608
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:26,192
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction...

312
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:29,900
<i>At the moment,
U/North currently has 70,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:33,108
<i>... in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,317
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:41,192
<i>Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:47,025
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

317
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,858
We have... We have, right now...
We have...

318
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,233
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

319
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,192
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

320
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:02,108
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...

321
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,025
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,608
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is...

323
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:09,233
Overwhelming.

324
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,650
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,442
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues...

326
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:20,025
It's quite substantial.

327
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,775
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:25,150
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:30,567
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,067
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,483
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,108
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

333
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,150
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:45,650
<i>... how do you keep a balance
between work and life?</i>

335
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,275
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:53,108
I think that's... That's something that...

337
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:56,608
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

338
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,567
It's a shifting balance, really.

339
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,900
It's, you know, you... You try to...

340
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,358
<i>When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,400
...who needs balance?

342
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:11,983
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

343
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,150
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

344
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,483
When Don asked me to take...

345
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,108
When Don Jeffries brought...
Don Jeffries brought me...

346
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:24,233
Don Jeffries brought me in here
12 years ago...

347
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,525
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,650
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

349
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:35,150
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

350
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:39,483
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,400
But, is it challenging? Yes.

352
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:48,233
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

353
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,525
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

354
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:57,650
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

355
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,692
...you're in the wrong place.

356
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:04,942
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and...

357
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:07,525
We're in the middle of an interview.

358
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,692
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,150
Jesus.

360
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,650
For chrissake.

361
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,067
You're saying he did this in...?

362
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,317
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:23,150
- Barry.
- Hang on.

364
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,775
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

365
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,108
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:35,942
<i>... I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:40,900
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,858
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,983
<i>It must stand the test of time."</i>

370
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,942
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,567
<i>This moment, today,
here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:59,150
<i>... and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.</i>

373
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,108
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,983
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,650
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:11,525
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,983
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,
for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:19,275
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

379
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:23,150
It was... It was... It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

380
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:26,400
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

381
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,942
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,858
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

383
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:38,733
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,192
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,775
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:49,150
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:53,775
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

388
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:56,025
- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

389
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,150
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:00,650
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:05,567
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

392
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:09,275
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

393
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:12,858
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,108
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna...

395
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,567
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,983
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,233
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year..."

398
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,983
- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,483
Because it's years! It's lives!

400
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,483
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

401
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,858
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,400
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:46,900
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

404
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:51,275
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

405
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:53,442
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,858
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?

407
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,983
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,692
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

409
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,067
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

410
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,900
- That was our agreement.
- Sue me.

411
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,275
We okay in there?

412
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,983
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,650
They killed them, Michael.

414
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:21,025
Those small farms, the family farms.

415
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,692
Did you...? Did you...?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
No.

417
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,192
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

418
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,317
She's God's perfect little creature.

419
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,942
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12 percent of my life...

420
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,733
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,692
When did you last take one of these?

422
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:42,567
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

423
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,192
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:48,608
- If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.

425
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:51,442
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

426
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:54,317
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

427
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,817
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:29:57,317 --> 00:30:00,275
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:03,650
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

430
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,817
<i>We came back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:13,983
<i>... and we were in shock, but we still...
We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,608
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:17,775
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,983
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,733
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,150
<i>- From your mother?
- Yes.</i>

437
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:28,317
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:32,650
<i>Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,067
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people..."</i>

440
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,483
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,900
<i>- Anna.
- "Down at...</i>

442
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:41,733
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,817
<i>- I'm just...
- Excuse me.</i>

444
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:46,067
<i>- Anna, they're...
- What's he doing?</i>

445
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,942
<i>Excuse me. She's a...
No, this is testimony. This is...</i>

446
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,108
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:53,650
<i>You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:55,525
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, l...</i>

449
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,275
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:03,358
<i>And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:08,275
<i>... that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:12,233
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,317
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,358
<i>- This is my offering!
- No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,775
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:23,483
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are
my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,400
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,983
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God...</i>

459
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:39,233
I guess that's it.

460
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,692
When do we get Don?

461
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,817
She said to try back in half an hour.

462
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,900
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,775
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

464
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,525
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

465
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,983
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:10,317
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:13,525
Michael Raymond Clayton.

468
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:18,608
<i>Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:22,483
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,317
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:28,650
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,442
<i>... in 1977.</i>

473
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:34,983
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,150
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:43,233
<i>1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,358
<i>... Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:48,900
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,525
So he's a partner?

479
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
No. He's listed as special counsel.

480
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:56,108
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

481
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:59,650
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:02,192
<i>He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:06,025
<i>This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,525
- Hi.
- Close the door.

485
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:26,983
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,400
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:33,150
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:37,900
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

489
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,942
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

490
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:44,608
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

491
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,942
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:52,067
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:55,525
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

494
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:58,025
All right.

495
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,733
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,192
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,358
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

498
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:07,192
- I am.
- Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:09,525
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,775
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:14,192
Other side wants to talk,
they can call New York.

502
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,442
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

503
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:20,692
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,650
Find it.

505
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,942
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:37,525
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:40,942
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a...</i>

508
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:43,192
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,900
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

510
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:51,483
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

511
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,650
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,983
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

513
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,025
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:00,400
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,525
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

516
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,025
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:10,858
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

518
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,983
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,442
They all think it's just them.

520
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:19,650
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:21,983
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,650
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:29,442
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,317
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,275
...to hear it?

526
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:39,358
Yeah. But later they will.

527
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,358
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

528
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,775
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

529
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,900
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,358
<i>- Who?
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:54,192
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Henry, it's after 11.</i>

532
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:56,150
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:35:56,317 --> 00:36:00,317
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

534
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,150
<i>The book is Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:05,067
Realm and Conquest.

536
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:08,317
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,025
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

538
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,317
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:23,942
<i>Realm and Conquest. Thank you.</i>

540
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,150
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

541
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:50,817
- You're late.
- I know.

542
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:53,483
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

543
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,358
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,692
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

545
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,150
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,650
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

547
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:05,775
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,692
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

549
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:11,442
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:15,525
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

551
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,817
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

552
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:21,650
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

553
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:24,608
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

554
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,358
What does this mean?

555
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:28,317
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:31,150
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,108
He wasn't really making much sense.

558
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:34,817
This is totally unacceptable.

559
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:37,942
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

560
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:40,025
In the morning, I have to call my board.

561
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:44,775
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:49,108
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

563
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,067
I understand.

564
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,150
What sickness is he talking about?

565
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,983
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

566
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,442
Frostbite.

567
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:00,567
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:03,025
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

569
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:07,650
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

570
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:10,525
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:13,358
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

572
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:16,608
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:19,608
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:23,525
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

575
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:26,692
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

576
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,525
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:32,483
...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

578
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,650
I thought you wanted an explanation.

579
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:37,567
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

580
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,775
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

581
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,733
He was mostly just quiet.

582
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,775
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

583
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:54,442
- He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?

584
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:56,358
A super job, Elston.

585
00:38:56,525 --> 00:39:00,192
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

586
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:01,775
I'll do that for sure.

587
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,775
Did you see her?

588
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,275
- Who?
- Anna.

589
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:28,192
No.

590
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,942
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

591
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:35,483
Well, we need her.

592
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:42,108
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:46,692
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

594
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,608
No, they're lost.

595
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:53,817
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.

596
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,858
This what you wanted?

597
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:58,942
To be a janitor?

598
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,483
Live like this? All this?

599
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,942
Do what you do?

600
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,733
It can't be.

601
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:09,650
It's...

602
00:40:09,817 --> 00:40:13,442
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

603
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,192
That's... That's how it feels.

604
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,858
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

605
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,442
Get some sleep.

606
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:42,317
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:46,317
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

608
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,692
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:51,942
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

610
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:53,983
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,358
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,275
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:06,358
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

614
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,567
12-BKR-6.

615
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,983
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:14,400
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,900
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

618
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,067
Don said that I could...

619
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:24,025
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

620
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,150
<i>Do you have e-mail
at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,567
I do.

622
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:29,900
<i>- Are you alone?
- I am.</i>

623
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:34,900
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,483
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,942
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

626
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:41,067
<i>But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:42,942
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,858
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:12,858
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

630
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:15,692
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.

631
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:18,817
Is the lease worth anything?

632
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:24,817
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...

633
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,983
The fixtures are gone, but there's...

634
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,858
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:35,983
But there's a...

636
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:43,400
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,275
Okay, yeah, I will.

638
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,442
All right. Thanks.

639
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:01,358
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,275
Arthur!

641
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:07,817
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,275
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:18,525
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,067
Arthur, op...!

645
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,983
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,817
Arthur!

647
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:35,233
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!

648
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,858
Arthur?!

649
00:43:58,192 --> 00:44:00,025
- Mr. Verne, hey.
- Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:02,442
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

651
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:05,483
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

652
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,525
- We ready?
- Yep.

653
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,733
For chrissake.

654
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,775
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,817
That's really his signature?

656
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:20,942
Where's the original?

657
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:26,150
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

658
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:35,150
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:37,317
Well, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:37,483 --> 00:44:41,442
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

661
00:44:46,192 --> 00:44:47,775
What are we looking for?

662
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:52,150
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,108
What a mess this is.

664
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:00,983
I want all this...

665
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,025
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:08,525
Any luck, Michael?

667
00:45:09,233 --> 00:45:13,358
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:15,483
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

669
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,858
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:18,192
- He moved.
- I know.

671
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:20,692
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,525
- I called, I got the machine.
- So he could be anywhere.

673
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,692
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

674
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,608
- Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, India.

675
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:32,900
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

676
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:34,900
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,858
We got a lot of groveling to do.

678
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,150
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,525
I was punting.

680
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:43,358
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.

681
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:44,525
Saddle up?

682
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,775
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:50,275
- Where?
- Does that really matter?

684
00:45:50,442 --> 00:45:53,358
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

685
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:56,858
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:59,233
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why the hell not?

687
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,192
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

688
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,942
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:07,817
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

690
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:11,108
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

691
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:14,775
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:17,608
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,275
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:36,108
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,442
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:16,608
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:20,025
<i>If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:23,442
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:28,025
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:32,817
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:36,692
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,942
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.

703
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:40,567
But you gotta call me back.

704
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,150
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,400
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:48,567
<i>Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,108
<i>And there's a chemical part.
We both know it.</i>

708
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:53,483
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:56,817
<i>... then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:47:56,983 --> 00:48:00,442
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:03,192
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:05,025
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:09,192
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:10,942
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:11,108 --> 00:48:14,567
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:18,442
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,442
<i>We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,692
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

719
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,442
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:33,192
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

721
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:35,692
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

722
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,608
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

723
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:42,983
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,567
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

725
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:49,733
<i>Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

726
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:52,650
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:54,192
Hang on.

728
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:59,108
<i>Anna!</i>

729
00:50:01,108 --> 00:50:03,192
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:07,525
<i>- Anna!
- Anna!</i>

731
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,775
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,483
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,983
Hello?

734
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,567
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:33,317
<i>- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?</i>

736
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,317
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:37,442
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:40,233
<i>- Yeah.
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,942
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

740
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,817
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:50,358
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:55,317
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

743
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,275
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,942
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,650
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:05,817
I mean, does it...?
Does it really matter?

747
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:10,150
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're...</i>

748
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,608
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:15,442
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:17,608
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,442
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:22,358
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

753
00:51:22,525 --> 00:51:23,942
That guy?

754
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:27,608
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:29,608
Sorry.

756
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,942
No. That's... That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

757
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:37,817
<i>She can't believe I can do anything
on my own.</i>

758
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:39,442
Well, that'll change.

759
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:41,483
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,650
<i>Yeah, but, see,
that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:51:44,858 --> 00:51:47,983
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,275
<i>That we could... We could do that together
if you want. I mean...</i>

763
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,692
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,275
I can get you 12 by Monday.

765
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:59,483
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

766
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,150
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:04,858
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

768
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,150
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

769
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:10,233
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,650
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:14,025
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:18,067
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,858
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:21,817 --> 00:52:23,525
Are you back at the tables?

775
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:26,608
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:31,817
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:36,025
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

778
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,650
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:44,233
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

780
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:46,483
You got a week.

781
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:50,650
- Hey, Michael. How are you?
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:54,108
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

783
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:56,317
I am trying to get him out
in 15 minutes.

784
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:58,900
- Is he upstairs?
- He's taken over the living room.

785
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,983
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:05,900
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,900
Marty?

788
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,025
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:30,525
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

790
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:32,567
...he's building a case against U/North.

791
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:34,733
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?

792
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,317
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:36,858 --> 00:53:39,525
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

794
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:43,858
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

795
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:46,983
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,692
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,400
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

798
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:55,775
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

799
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:59,483
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

800
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,358
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,442
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,733
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,650
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:17,150
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

805
00:54:17,317 --> 00:54:20,150
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:21,900
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:23,525
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

808
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:26,483
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:30,525
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:30,942 --> 00:54:32,650
There's nothing final on the merger.

811
00:54:32,817 --> 00:54:35,733
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

812
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,567
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,650
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

814
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:43,858
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,692
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

816
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,567
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

817
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:50,317
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

818
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:52,525
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

819
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:55,275
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

820
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:57,108
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:54:57,275 --> 00:55:00,317
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

822
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:02,150
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:03,525
You think that's special?

824
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:06,358
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

825
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:10,192
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:14,650
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:17,817
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

828
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:22,025
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

829
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:25,608
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:29,775
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,150
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:37,025
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

833
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:38,817
- I never said that.
- No?

834
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,317
Maybe you should have.

835
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:45,150
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:55:45,317 --> 00:55:48,483
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

837
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,775
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

838
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:54,900
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

839
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:59,233
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

840
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,983
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

841
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,442
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:04,692 --> 00:56:06,108
Hey.

843
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:08,317
When did you get so fucking delicate?

844
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,983
I'm late.

845
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:53,650
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

846
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:55,817
It's not that kind of a problem.

847
00:56:57,483 --> 00:56:59,858
- How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

848
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:15,692
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

849
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:18,983
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

850
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:29,317
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:32,275
- What?
- I wanna go home.

852
00:57:32,442 --> 00:57:34,233
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,650
Hold up!

854
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,525
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:57:45,192 --> 00:57:48,150
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:57:48,317 --> 00:57:49,650
Wait up.

857
00:57:50,483 --> 00:57:53,858
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:58,025
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

859
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:01,483
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

860
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,233
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's... It's still warm.

861
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,025
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:12,817
So welcome home.

863
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:16,900
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,442
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

865
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:21,442
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:24,108
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

867
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:27,525
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:31,275
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,317
And how's that going?

870
00:58:33,483 --> 00:58:35,942
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

871
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:41,650
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

872
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,108
That's my goal.

873
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:46,650
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

874
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:48,192
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,483
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,817
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:58:55,983 --> 00:59:00,483
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:04,442
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:07,358
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

880
00:59:07,817 --> 00:59:11,775
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

881
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:13,192
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:16,692
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:20,067
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:22,942
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

885
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:24,858
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:28,358
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

887
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:31,067
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:34,525
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:34,692 --> 00:59:38,150
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

890
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:41,567
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

891
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:45,983
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

892
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,025
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

893
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:50,692
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

894
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:54,358
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

895
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,692
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

896
00:59:56,858 --> 01:00:00,650
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:06,275
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:08,317
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:13,358
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:16,358
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

901
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,358
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:21,525
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:27,317
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:28,983
I'll help you think this through.

905
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,400
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

906
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:35,733
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,567
Michael, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:45,025
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,483
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,525
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:00:51,692 --> 01:00:54,317
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,483
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

913
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,025
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

914
01:00:59,483 --> 01:01:04,733
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,275
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

916
01:01:08,442 --> 01:01:11,150
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:14,025
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

918
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:19,442
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

919
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:22,108
I'm not the enemy.

920
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:24,650
Then who are you?

921
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:39,192
<i>We find the seed.</i>

922
01:01:43,192 --> 01:01:45,275
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

923
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:50,317
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

924
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:54,400
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

925
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:07,858
<i>We find the seed.</i>

926
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:13,858
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

927
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,067
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

928
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,525
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

929
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:42,567
What the hell is he doing?

930
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,858
<i>We find the seed.</i>

931
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,150
<i>You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

932
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,192
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

933
01:03:09,983 --> 01:03:11,150
Yes!

934
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:15,358
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

935
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,942
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.</i>

936
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:22,650
<i>So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...</i>

937
01:03:22,817 --> 01:03:28,067
<i>... for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.</i>

938
01:03:28,233 --> 01:03:31,525
<i>June 19th, 1991.</i>

939
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:33,400
"Conclusion:

940
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:36,233
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

941
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,650
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

942
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:45,483
<i>Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?</i>

943
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,525
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

944
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,775
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

945
01:03:51,942 --> 01:03:53,775
Okay? Okay.

946
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:56,358
<i>"In-house field studies
have indicated...</i>

947
01:03:56,525 --> 01:04:01,275
<i>... that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...</i>

948
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:05,608
<i>... are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...</i>

949
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,692
...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

950
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:12,233
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

951
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,733
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

952
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,983
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

953
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:21,275
<i>- "Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.</i>

956
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:29,900
...these potentially lethal exposures."

957
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:31,858
Now, I love this.

958
01:04:32,025 --> 01:04:33,942
Not only is this a great product...

959
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:37,817
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

960
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:40,692
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

961
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:45,067
<i>... the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...</i>

962
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:50,108
<i>... would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.</i>

963
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:53,358
<i>These costs,

<i>... were not summarized here."</i>

965
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,442
Which, loosely translated, means:

966
01:04:57,608 --> 01:05:01,650
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

967
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:04,983
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

968
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:08,817
<i>"Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...</i>

969
01:05:09,025 --> 01:05:11,692

970
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:15,567

972
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:24,733
<i>You don't need me
to tell you what that means.</i>

973
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:26,317
<i>Goodbye.</i>

974
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:32,525
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

975
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:35,983
You have to contain this.

976
01:05:37,692 --> 01:05:39,942
- Contain?
- Right.

977
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,525
Well, that's my question.

978
01:05:43,317 --> 01:05:47,650
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

979
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:49,650
Along those lines.

980
01:05:49,817 --> 01:05:52,817
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

981
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:58,192
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

982
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,192
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

983
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:02,900
We deal in absolutes.

984
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,983
Okay. I understand that. I do.

985
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:11,567
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

986
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,567
Well, the other way?

987
01:06:15,608 --> 01:06:17,483
Is the other way.

988
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:23,858
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

989
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:27,525
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

990
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:36,275
Do you think it's doable?

991
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:41,025
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

992
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:44,275
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...

993
01:06:44,442 --> 01:06:45,775
Okay.

994
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:53,317
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

995
01:06:57,025 --> 01:06:59,858
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

996
01:07:00,025 --> 01:07:03,150
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

997
01:07:03,317 --> 01:07:05,483
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
- Come on.

998
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:08,108
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

999
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,858
Come on.

1000
01:07:11,025 --> 01:07:12,650
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1001
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:14,775
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1002
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:18,233
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1003
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,358
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1004
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:24,650
All right, Eddie.

1005
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:28,108
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1006
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:29,692
Happy birthday.

1007
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:31,650
You have time for cake?

1008
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,400
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1009
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:35,567
You going in?

1010
01:07:37,317 --> 01:07:39,483
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

1011
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,025
You're not both running out?

1012
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:42,983
I got a situation.

1013
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,817
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

1014
01:07:44,983 --> 01:07:47,358
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

1015
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:50,483
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1016
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,567
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

1017
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:56,108
Good. You can drive him home.

1018
01:07:56,275 --> 01:07:57,692
Just stay for an hour.

1019
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,067
The girls did all this stuff.

1020
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:02,358
He'll be asleep by then.

1021
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:08,317
Timmy's been calling me.

1022
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:13,817
He's afraid to talk to you.

1023
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:15,150
He should be.

1024
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:17,900
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?

1025
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:20,025
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,775
The in-laws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:22,733 --> 01:08:25,775
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:25,942 --> 01:08:29,608
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:29,775 --> 01:08:32,400
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1030
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:36,275
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:37,483
I got my hands full.

1032
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:41,358
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,650
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1034
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:49,067
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:53,525
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1036
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:56,275
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,317
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:01,483 --> 01:09:03,858
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:04,025 --> 01:09:06,483
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

1040
01:09:06,692 --> 01:09:09,733
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,483
That was my big play, all right?

1042
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:15,483
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1043
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,233
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:19,275 --> 01:09:21,233
Cool down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,192
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:34,483 --> 01:09:36,108
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:39,067
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:13,358 --> 01:10:15,733
Ready? And, lift.

1049
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,233
Ready and go.

1050
01:10:42,192 --> 01:10:43,233
Wipe.

1051
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,317
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:27,858 --> 01:11:29,192
We're good.

1053
01:12:03,525 --> 01:12:06,650
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:08,817
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1055
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,942
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:11,108 --> 01:12:14,192
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...

1057
01:12:14,358 --> 01:12:16,233
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,650
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:21,442
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

1060
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:23,608
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

1061
01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:25,983
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:27,858
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

1063
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,275
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:40,442 --> 01:12:41,775
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:12:44,442 --> 01:12:45,858
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:50,525
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:12:51,525 --> 01:12:55,192
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:12:55,358 --> 01:12:56,983
In front of the kid?

1069
01:12:57,192 --> 01:13:00,650
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:01,692 --> 01:13:05,275
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1071
01:13:05,775 --> 01:13:08,067
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:11,692
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:19,942
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

1074
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,942
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:22,108 --> 01:13:23,900
That and everything else.

1076
01:13:55,233 --> 01:13:56,692
What?

1077
01:13:58,983 --> 01:14:00,358
Your Uncle Timmy...

1078
01:14:01,025 --> 01:14:06,483
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:10,692
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:10,858 --> 01:14:13,983
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:18,900
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1082
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:21,275
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:23,233
But when you see him like that...

1084
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,150
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1085
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:28,900
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

1086
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:32,650
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:32,858 --> 01:14:35,233
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,692
Okay?

1089
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:45,108
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,150
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1091
01:14:51,858 --> 01:14:53,192
Okay?

1092
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:07,692
Hello?

1093
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:21,567
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1094
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:26,358
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1095
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:32,025
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:36,525
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:40,442
There's pills all over the place.

1098
01:15:41,233 --> 01:15:46,317
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:49,400
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:15:49,567 --> 01:15:53,150
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so...

1101
01:15:55,525 --> 01:15:58,650
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

1102
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:03,817
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:06,150
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:09,358
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1105
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:14,233
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,525
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:18,192 --> 01:16:21,233
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1108
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,108
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1109
01:16:25,525 --> 01:16:26,900
Sorry.

1110
01:16:28,942 --> 01:16:30,400
Sure.

1111
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:37,650
Okay.

1112
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:46,483
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1113
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,317
I'll tell him hello.

1114
01:16:49,483 --> 01:16:51,483
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

1115
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,733
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,692
I'm sorry for your loss.

1117
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:16,775
- Michael.
- Jeff.

1118
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:18,400
This is tough.

1119
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,150
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:33,900
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,525
What a thing.

1122
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,942
- Hold on.
- I don't even know...

1123
01:17:38,108 --> 01:17:40,025
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.

1124
01:17:40,192 --> 01:17:43,400
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1125
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:47,025
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:50,567
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1127
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,067
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:54,775
Go. Go.

1129
01:17:55,525 --> 01:17:56,858
You okay?

1130
01:17:57,567 --> 01:17:59,317
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:02,650
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:05,525 --> 01:18:09,733
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,150
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:13,108
I just couldn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:16,442
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1136
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,525
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,442
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:24,608 --> 01:18:26,150
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:29,317
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:29,483 --> 01:18:31,733
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,150
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1142
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:37,317
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1143
01:18:37,525 --> 01:18:38,900
Why?

1144
01:18:40,358 --> 01:18:43,525
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1145
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,858
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:18:51,358 --> 01:18:52,983
Good years.

1147
01:18:54,525 --> 01:18:58,692
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:04,025
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1149
01:19:05,192 --> 01:19:06,817
You can say it.

1150
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:11,275
We caught a lucky break.

1151
01:19:14,275 --> 01:19:16,567
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:21,275 --> 01:19:24,692
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:24,858 --> 01:19:26,608
- They accepted?
- In principle.

1154
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:29,608
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1155
01:19:29,775 --> 01:19:32,692
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:32,858 --> 01:19:34,733
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1157
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,983
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:43,817
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1159
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:46,567
It's...

1160
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:48,400
It's what we got.

1161
01:19:49,525 --> 01:19:52,358
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,150
Hello.

1163
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:28,900
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,150
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,817
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:36,858
<i>- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?</i>

1167
01:20:37,025 --> 01:20:40,858
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1168
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:42,817
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:20:43,025 --> 01:20:45,858
<i>This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:20:46,025 --> 01:20:47,983
<i>- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:20:48,192 --> 01:20:52,400
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again...

1172
01:20:52,567 --> 01:20:54,858
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

1173
01:20:55,358 --> 01:20:57,317
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:20:57,525 --> 01:20:59,942
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:00,108 --> 01:21:01,650
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:04,858
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,775
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:42,650
Anna?

1179
01:21:43,483 --> 01:21:46,442
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:49,275
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1181
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:52,442
Please open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:05,442
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:06,233 --> 01:22:11,525
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1184
01:22:14,358 --> 01:22:17,650
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1185
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:23,358
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1186
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:25,858
...and show me, and I would see...

1187
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:29,692
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1188
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,775
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:34,942 --> 01:22:36,525
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:42,733
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1191
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:47,983
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1192
01:22:50,608 --> 01:22:55,442
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

1193
01:22:55,608 --> 01:22:58,275
...for a first-class ticket.

1194
01:22:58,442 --> 01:22:59,900
And I just...

1195
01:23:03,858 --> 01:23:05,775
I got on the plane.

1196
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,483
I believed him.

1197
01:23:15,233 --> 01:23:19,900
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:20,733 --> 01:23:24,733
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1199
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:28,358
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:32,358
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.

1201
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:34,067
No.

1202
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:37,400
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:43,275
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,817
No.

1205
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,525
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:06,233 --> 01:24:09,108
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

1207
01:24:10,608 --> 01:24:12,275
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

1208
01:24:13,192 --> 01:24:16,275
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,608
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1210
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:22,400
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

1211
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:25,192
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:25,358 --> 01:24:27,858
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1213
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:29,650
You really wanna know?

1214
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,150
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:52,358
What are we doing?

1216
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,942
Freeze!

1217
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,817
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1218
01:27:58,025 --> 01:28:00,275
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,983
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:05,067
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.

1221
01:28:05,233 --> 01:28:08,108
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:11,567
- Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

1223
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:13,567
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1224
01:28:13,733 --> 01:28:16,192
- I said, who else is here?
- Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:17,733
Check in there.

1226
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:21,817
You move, I'll take your head off.

1227
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:56,108
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:28:56,275 --> 01:28:58,358
- Now I owe them both my balls.
- I'm sorry.

1229
01:28:58,525 --> 01:29:00,525
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

1230
01:29:00,692 --> 01:29:03,775
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:03,942 --> 01:29:05,317
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:08,525
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:08,692 --> 01:29:10,692
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

1234
01:29:10,858 --> 01:29:13,192
- Who called 911?
- What?

1235
01:29:13,525 --> 01:29:16,442
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1236
01:29:16,608 --> 01:29:19,025
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you...?

1237
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:20,775
This never happened.

1238
01:29:22,067 --> 01:29:24,108
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1239
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:26,317
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1240
01:29:26,525 --> 01:29:30,650
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:30,817 --> 01:29:32,900
You know exactly what you are.

1242
01:29:46,525 --> 01:29:48,025
We tried calling you six times.

1243
01:29:48,192 --> 01:29:50,317
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1244
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:53,650
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:29:55,025 --> 01:29:57,483
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,525
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1247
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:22,442
Is everything all right?

1248
01:30:22,608 --> 01:30:23,817
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:24,525 --> 01:30:27,608
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...

1250
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:30,817
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,233
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1252
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,483
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1253
01:30:56,025 --> 01:30:57,358
Hello.

1254
01:31:02,442 --> 01:31:05,733
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1255
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:07,608
What?

1256
01:31:15,025 --> 01:31:17,150
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:17,358 --> 01:31:18,817
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:19,025 --> 01:31:20,775
We have a situation.

1259
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:42,108
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:31:42,275 --> 01:31:45,317
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:31:53,483 --> 01:31:54,817
Marty.

1262
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:58,317
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:31:58,525 --> 01:32:00,483
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late...

1264
01:32:00,692 --> 01:32:02,317
We never got to finish last night.

1265
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,608
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1266
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:07,817
- No, I left right after you left.
- If you say so.

1267
01:32:08,025 --> 01:32:10,692
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:14,150
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1269
01:32:14,317 --> 01:32:17,483
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1270
01:32:17,692 --> 01:32:20,608
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1271
01:32:20,775 --> 01:32:24,108
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:24,275 --> 01:32:26,525
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1273
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:29,817
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:30,358 --> 01:32:32,650
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:32,858 --> 01:32:36,150
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

1276
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:40,442
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1277
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:46,650
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:48,483
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:51,525
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:32:51,692 --> 01:32:53,817
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:56,442
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1282
01:32:56,608 --> 01:32:59,525
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:32:59,692 --> 01:33:01,692
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:04,608
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1285
01:33:04,775 --> 01:33:08,192
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:08,358 --> 01:33:10,775
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:10,942 --> 01:33:12,983
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1288
01:33:13,192 --> 01:33:16,150
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1289
01:33:16,317 --> 01:33:18,025
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1290
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:21,858
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1291
01:33:22,025 --> 01:33:24,692
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:26,858
That's 80.

1293
01:33:27,358 --> 01:33:29,150
We're calling it a bonus.

1294
01:33:30,025 --> 01:33:32,025
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:32,192 --> 01:33:33,817
That's assuming this all works out.

1296
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:35,150
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:36,858 --> 01:33:40,150
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1298
01:33:40,358 --> 01:33:43,192
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1299
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:45,483
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1300
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:47,358
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:33:47,525 --> 01:33:51,317
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1302
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:54,067
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:33:54,733 --> 01:33:57,442
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1304
01:33:57,608 --> 01:34:00,275
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:00,442 --> 01:34:03,025
- If I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:03,192 --> 01:34:04,442
So there you go.

1307
01:34:04,608 --> 01:34:06,275
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:09,317
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:09,692 --> 01:34:12,983
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:13,608 --> 01:34:16,317
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

1311
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:21,192
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1312
01:34:24,775 --> 01:34:26,150
You're welcome.

1313
01:35:18,983 --> 01:35:21,358
You said 12. This is 75.

1314
01:35:21,525 --> 01:35:23,650
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:25,692
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:31,650
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1317
01:35:31,858 --> 01:35:33,525
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:35,192
That's right.

1319
01:35:36,108 --> 01:35:37,817
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:40,192
Michael.

1321
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:53,358
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:35:55,192 --> 01:35:56,483
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:59,525
- Check.
- Half the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:35:59,692 --> 01:36:00,983
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:40,108
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:36:40,275 --> 01:36:42,317
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:07,525
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:07,692 --> 01:37:09,650
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1329
01:37:09,817 --> 01:37:13,983
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:37:49,692 --> 01:37:50,775
Get out.

1331
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:54,275
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:37:56,025 --> 01:37:56,983
<i>- Walter?
- Michael.</i>

1333
01:37:57,192 --> 01:37:59,358
<i>- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.</i>

1334
01:38:03,775 --> 01:38:05,692
You have eight...

1335
01:38:06,608 --> 01:38:09,317
<i>... six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:09,525 --> 01:38:11,817
<i>... four, three...</i>

1337
01:38:12,025 --> 01:38:13,650
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:17,067 --> 01:38:20,108
<i>- Tell him to stay off the phone.
- All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:22,150
Am I clean?

1340
01:38:22,317 --> 01:38:23,525
Just keep walking.

1341
01:38:23,692 --> 01:38:25,942
You copy. Am I clean?

1342
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,150
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1343
01:38:29,692 --> 01:38:33,233
<i>- to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,858
<i>- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.</i>

1345
01:38:39,525 --> 01:38:42,983
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:11,108 --> 01:39:14,650
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...

1347
01:39:16,442 --> 01:39:18,358
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1348
01:39:25,942 --> 01:39:29,150
- I don't know what Walter promised you...
- A miracle worker!

1349
01:39:29,317 --> 01:39:32,525
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:32,692 --> 01:39:34,525
"Hang Tight. I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1351
01:39:34,692 --> 01:39:36,358
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

1352
01:39:36,525 --> 01:39:40,067
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:39:45,858 --> 01:39:47,775
We're up. Just got a signal.

1354
01:40:11,608 --> 01:40:13,983
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:15,317
Maybe he's lost.

1356
01:40:15,525 --> 01:40:17,317
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.

1357
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:21,858
He was alone, right?

1358
01:40:22,025 --> 01:40:24,817
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:27,275 --> 01:40:28,900
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:00,733
Talk to me.

1361
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,483
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:05,025
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:20,858 --> 01:41:22,442
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:22,608 --> 01:41:23,983
- Where?
- He took...

1365
01:41:24,483 --> 01:41:26,442
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

1366
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,358
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

1367
01:41:39,525 --> 01:41:41,650
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

1368
01:41:51,817 --> 01:41:54,483
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:57,692
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:04,567 --> 01:42:07,192
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:07,358 --> 01:42:08,442
The signal or the grid?

1372
01:42:08,608 --> 01:42:11,317
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:02,525 --> 01:43:03,983
Give me the cell.

1374
01:43:06,525 --> 01:43:08,192
Our signal's good.

1375
01:44:46,025 --> 01:44:47,275
What?

1376
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,608
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:44:51,775 --> 01:44:53,442
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:04,858
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1379
01:45:05,025 --> 01:45:08,650
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...

1380
01:45:08,858 --> 01:45:10,317
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

1381
01:45:10,525 --> 01:45:13,025
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
- No. Michael Clayton.

1382
01:45:13,483 --> 01:45:14,525
What?

1383
01:45:14,692 --> 01:45:17,608
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1384
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:19,650
What?

1385
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:23,150
Holy shit.

1386
01:45:37,358 --> 01:45:42,275
<i>It has been and it remains
the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:45:42,442 --> 01:45:46,525
<i>... that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.</i>

1388
01:45:46,692 --> 01:45:50,775
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1389
01:45:50,942 --> 01:45:56,108
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1390
01:45:56,275 --> 01:45:58,817
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1391
01:45:59,025 --> 01:46:02,442
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1392
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:06,525
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:07,525 --> 01:46:11,942
<i>You all have
a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:12,525 --> 01:46:16,483
<i>... which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:16,692 --> 01:46:19,442
<i>Over the past several months
we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:19,608 --> 01:46:22,942
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:23,108 --> 01:46:26,942
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1398
01:46:27,442 --> 01:46:28,900
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:29,067 --> 01:46:33,025
<i>... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:33,192 --> 01:46:35,275
<i>... up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:35,692 --> 01:46:39,942
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:46:40,108 --> 01:46:44,650
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1403
01:46:44,858 --> 01:46:46,150
...in the middle there.

1404
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,650
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:46:48,817 --> 01:46:53,150
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:46:53,317 --> 01:46:55,150
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:46:55,317 --> 01:46:58,525
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1408
01:46:58,692 --> 01:47:01,150
...and within this fiscal year...

1409
01:47:01,317 --> 01:47:07,150
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1410
01:47:07,692 --> 01:47:11,858
<i>The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:12,317 --> 01:47:17,108
<i>... the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:17,275 --> 01:47:18,983
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:22,400
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1414
01:47:23,483 --> 01:47:26,983
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1415
01:47:27,192 --> 01:47:29,442
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1416
01:47:31,858 --> 01:47:32,817
Well...

1417
01:47:55,942 --> 01:47:57,775
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:00,817 --> 01:48:02,983
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:03,192 --> 01:48:06,150
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:08,692 --> 01:48:11,942
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:13,525 --> 01:48:17,192
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:20,358 --> 01:48:21,858
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:22,025 --> 01:48:24,150
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:24,317 --> 01:48:25,650
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:25,858 --> 01:48:27,650
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1426
01:48:27,817 --> 01:48:30,483
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1427
01:48:30,692 --> 01:48:34,317
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1428
01:48:34,525 --> 01:48:36,692
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1429
01:48:36,858 --> 01:48:40,150
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:48:40,358 --> 01:48:41,650
I'm calling Marty.

1431
01:48:41,858 --> 01:48:44,192
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1432
01:48:44,358 --> 01:48:47,150
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:48:47,358 --> 01:48:49,150
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:48:49,358 --> 01:48:53,150
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1435
01:48:53,317 --> 01:48:56,733
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1436
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,650
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1437
01:48:59,858 --> 01:49:03,483
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:03,692 --> 01:49:06,358
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:06,525 --> 01:49:07,858
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:08,025 --> 01:49:11,483
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:14,150
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:14,358 --> 01:49:17,817
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1443
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:21,275
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:21,442 --> 01:49:24,858
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:26,900
...and you're gonna kill me?

1446
01:49:27,858 --> 01:49:30,650
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:30,858 --> 01:49:34,525
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:34,692 --> 01:49:38,525
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1449
01:49:40,025 --> 01:49:41,483
What do you want?

1450
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:43,150
What do I want?

1451
01:49:43,358 --> 01:49:44,942
I want more.

1452
01:49:45,442 --> 01:49:47,192
I want out.

1453
01:49:47,358 --> 01:49:49,983
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:52,983
Is there a number?

1455
01:49:53,192 --> 01:49:54,775
Ten is a number.

1456
01:49:54,942 --> 01:49:56,983
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,483
Ten million?

1458
01:50:00,692 --> 01:50:04,108
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1459
01:50:04,692 --> 01:50:06,567
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:09,025
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:09,608 --> 01:50:11,525
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
01:50:11,692 --> 01:50:14,650
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1463
01:50:16,525 --> 01:50:18,900
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1464
01:50:19,067 --> 01:50:21,192
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1465
01:50:21,358 --> 01:50:22,858
Where? My car?

1466
01:50:24,442 --> 01:50:25,483
All right.

1467
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:29,650
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1468
01:50:29,858 --> 01:50:31,650
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1469
01:50:34,025 --> 01:50:38,775
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1470
01:50:38,942 --> 01:50:42,650
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1471
01:50:42,858 --> 01:50:44,942
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1472
01:50:45,108 --> 01:50:47,483
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

1473
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:50,233
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1474
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,733
Karen?

1475
01:50:52,442 --> 01:50:54,317
- One second.
- Everything okay?

1476
01:50:55,692 --> 01:50:56,650
Yes.

1477
01:50:57,692 --> 01:51:01,483
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1478
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:02,775
- Yes.
- Say it!

1479
01:51:02,942 --> 01:51:06,817
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1480
01:51:06,983 --> 01:51:09,275
- Karen! Everyone's waiting.
- I'm coming, Don.

1481
01:51:10,317 --> 01:51:11,650
You have a deal.

1482
01:51:12,233 --> 01:51:13,483
You're so fucked.

1483
01:51:13,858 --> 01:51:15,150
What?

1484
01:51:15,692 --> 01:51:17,525
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1485
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:19,942
- Take a wild guess.
- Is there a problem?

1486
01:51:20,108 --> 01:51:22,817
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1487
01:51:22,983 --> 01:51:25,775
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

1488
01:51:25,942 --> 01:51:27,525
Is this fellow bothering you?

1489
01:51:27,692 --> 01:51:28,942
Am I bothering you?

1490
01:51:29,108 --> 01:51:33,150
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1491
01:51:33,317 --> 01:51:34,983
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1492
01:51:35,192 --> 01:51:38,817
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1493
01:51:39,692 --> 01:51:40,983
All right. Here we go.

1494
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:44,317
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1495
01:51:45,942 --> 01:51:48,650
- What are you doing?
- We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1496
01:51:48,858 --> 01:51:51,150
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1497
01:51:51,358 --> 01:51:54,608
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1498
01:51:54,775 --> 01:51:56,942
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1499

Have your guys cover every exit.

1500
01:51:59,025 --> 01:52:01,817
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1501
01:52:02,483 --> 01:52:03,817
Did you get all that?

01:52:04,025 --> 01:52:06,192
Yeah. Got it.

1503
01:52:09,858 --> 01:52:12,650
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

Sure.

1505
01:52:14,692 --> 01:52:17,483
Just stay close, okay?

Okay.

1507
01:53:29,442 --> 01:53:31,275

Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1509
01:53:42,192 --> 01:53:43,858
Just drive.
