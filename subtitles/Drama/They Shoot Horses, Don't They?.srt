1
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,355
The doctor's decision is...

2
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:10,353
Lillian Kramer stays on
in the marathon!

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,287
The doctor assures me Lillian
just has a slight sinus headache.

4
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:31,054
Headache.

5
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:34,254
For all that quack knows, she's...
she's got a brain tumor.

6
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,224
No, I don't think so.

7
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,222
I'm not exactly sure, but I think
it's different with a brain tumor.

8
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:48,555
Different symptoms.

9
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,789
Yeah? How do you know?

10
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,524
I saw it in a movie...

11
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,522
...with Anita Louise
and Richard Cromwell.

12
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,458
That's what she died of--
Anita Louise.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,456
A brain tumor,
but it was different.

14
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:10,556
Everything just suddenly
got dim for her one day.

15
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:14,790
Until finally, she couldn't see at all.

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,490
She couldn't even see Richard Cromwell
when she kissed him good-bye.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,259
Yeah?

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,992
Then what, she just died?

19
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,892
Kind of.

20
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:32,890
She just drifted off
listening to her favorite tune.

21
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:38,090
And then she was dead.

22
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:43,225
No pain or anything?

23
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,924
They probably lied.

24
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:50,361
Bobby?

25
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:58,963
Come on, kid.
Come on.

26
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,961
Come on, break's over.
Come on.

27
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:05,661
- Tommy?
- Yeah, Sailor.

28
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,595
Kid's sleeping.

29
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,362
Frank, we got a dead one here.

30
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,062
Give me that ammonia.

31
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,132
- Do you know where you are?
- What?

32
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,130
- Give him another dose.
- No!

33
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,265
Leave him alone.

34
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,399
Are you all right?

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,397
Hang on to me.

36
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:50,265
- You sure you can make it?
- He's gonna be okay now.

37
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,565
- I asked him, not you!
- Sure.

38
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,563
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

39
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,730
Here.

40
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,700
Just like in marriage, folks,

41
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:23,699
these kids have got to get off
by themselves once in a while,

42
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,867
but exhausted as they are,

43
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,467
it's tougher to stay
on their feet alone,

44
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,465
so keep your eyes on them,
because it may be all over soon

45
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:35,532
for one of these brave,
struggling kids.

46
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,368
Get your hot dogs!

47
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:43,366
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!

48
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,101
Red hots! Hot dogs!

49
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:49,769
Get your hot dogs!

50
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,535
Only a nickel!

51
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:53,668
Five cents!

52
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,666
Hot dogs!
Get your red hots!

53
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,939
- What's the matter?
- Get 'em off me!

54
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,206
- What?!
- Get 'em away!

55
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,673
What?!
Matron! Nurse!

56
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,807
- What's the matter?
- They're crawling all over me!

57
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,573
- Get them off me!
- There's nothing--

58
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,340
Help me, please.

59
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:42,338
- They're crawling all over me!
- You're all right.

60
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:45,838
- There is nothing wrong.
- Hold her down!

61
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,640
- What's the matter with her?
- She's squirreling.

62
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:52,541
Hold her!

63
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,539
Tell 'em to turn up the Victrola.

64
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,441
Please help me!

65
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,207
That won't help her none.

66
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,875
Shirl...

67
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:03,841
They're crawling on me!

68
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,641
Listen to me, Shirl.
Listen to me.

69
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,474
They're crawling on me!

70
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:09,808
Where are they? Tell me.

71
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,475
Tell me where they are.
Here, on your arm?

72
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:15,473
They're gone.
Here, on your shoulder?

73
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:18,509
- Yes.
- There.

74
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,175
They're all gone.
They're all gone.

75
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,275
They're all gone.

76
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,273
- They're all gone?
- Yes, they're all gone.

77
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,876
Better douse her in the shower.

78
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:30,874
Come on, honey, you're all right.
You're all right.

79
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,608
You're all right.

80
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:42,174
That's quite a technique.

81
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:46,474
I would've thought you'd put her
on display, charge a little extra.

82
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,641
No. It's too real.

83
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,147
Gloria?

84
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,981
I hope that little episode in there
didn't shake you up too much.

85
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,348
No.

86
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,815
Cigarette?

87
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,915
No.

88
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,249
No.

89
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,516
Ten minutes rest, folks,
and then the dance goes on and on.

90
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,816
Remember, one admission
entitles you to stay as long as you like.

91
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,883
So, while the kids are resting and being
attended to by our medical staff,

92
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,052
why don't you visit
our beautiful Palm Garden,

93
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,752
where we serve refreshments
of all types.

94
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,750
Thank you, thank you
Yowsah!

95
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:20,753
Yeah, that looks
kinda like her dress.

96
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,751
It is.
You can tell just looking at it.

97
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:28,085
Well, even if it is her dress,
it's ruined now.

98
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,318
There's nothing I can do about it.

99
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:34,621
But aren't you gonna try
to find out?

100
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:37,619
I mean, somebody stole it
and ripped it all up.

101
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:43,086
Maybe you should call everyone together
and try and find out who did it.

102
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,619
It wasn't one of the kids.

103
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:52,520
How do you know?

104
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,520
Because I took it.

105
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,588
- But why?
- For the good of the show.

106
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,655
That's what we're all
interested in, isn't it?

107
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,653
The show.

108
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:13,120
No, it's a contest.

109
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,289
Isn't that what it's supposed to be?

110
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,656
Isn't that what you advertised?
A contest.

111
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:20,556
Not for them.

112
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:23,389
For you maybe, but not for them.

113
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,387
You think they're laying out two bits a throw just
to watch you poke your head up into the sunlight?

114
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:30,157
Or Alice look like she just
stepped out of a beauty parlor?

115
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,923
They don't give a damn whether
you win or James and Ruby

116
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,921
or Mario and Jackie or the Man
in the Moon and Little Miss Muffet.

117
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,055
They just want to see a little misery out there
so they can feel a little better, maybe.

118
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:46,588
They're entitled to that.

119
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,288
Look at us.
We're all like this now.

120
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,122
Dirty, swollen feet, no sleep.

121
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,358
What do you want?
Isn't that enough?

122
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,356
Sure, as long as they can believe in it.

123
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,389
But how can they with Alice
looking like she's on her way

124
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:07,224
to a ball at Buckingham Palace?

125
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:09,324
She was breaking the spell.

126
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,322
Now she looks like she's supposed to,
so now they can believe in her.

127
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,691
Simple enough?

128
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,689
Why don't you go sack out
while you got a little break time left?

129
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:26,390
Yeah.

130
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,724
Robert?

131
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:56,727
Take me outside.

132
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:58,428
- We can't.
- Please.

133
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,960
Alice, break's almost over.
We can't.

134
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:03,958
Somewhere.
Please, anywhere.

135
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,962
Talk to me.

136
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,295
Alice...

137
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,929
Talk to me.
Tell me things.

138
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,295
Talk to me.
Hold me.

139
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,462
My strap--pull it down.

140
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,896
Kiss me, hold me.
Talk to me.

141
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:42,996
Talk to me, Robert.

142
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,530
- What about?
- About you, about yourself

143
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,596
The buttons.

144
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,896
About where you grew up.
Tell me where you were born.

145
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,896
Chicago.
I was born in Chicago.

146
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,530
Chicago. I've never been there.

147
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,396
I can't imagine it.
Tell me about your family.

148
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,296
- What does your father do?
- He's dead.

149
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,897
He was a pharmacist,
but he died.

150
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,530
- It's caught, Alice.
- Pull it.

151
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:03,930
He caught the flu and he died.

152
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,830
It's caught.
I can't get it undone.

153
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,828
- What should I do?
- Pull it!

154
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:12,397
There.

155
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:15,395
Kiss me.
Touch me.

156
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,397
Kiss me, kiss me.

157
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:21,395
- Alice, somebody's gonna come in.
- It doesn't matter.

158
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:25,129
Kiss me.

159
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,565
Tell me about your--
Did you have brothers?

160
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,865
- Sisters?
- No.

161
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,863
I had a brother.

162
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,530
He died at the Somme.

163
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,433
Guess what his name was.
Try to guess.

164
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,566
- I don't know.
- Guess, guess!

165
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,533
- I don't know.
- Guess, guess!

166
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,232
- I don't know.
- It's so easy.

167
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:59,230
- George. Robert.
- No.

168
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:22,465
No, wait, don't leave.

169
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,067
- Alice, I--
- Don't, don't.

170
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:55,567
After a few minutes,
play my favorite number.

171
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:28,002
- Well, shall we dance?
- Go to hell.

172
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:09,839
Perfect.

173
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,939
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

174
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,937
our own Russ Columbo--
Mr. Coley James.

175
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,808
Gloria?

176
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:57,911
Hot dogs!

177
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,909
Premier Mussolini was promoted
tonight, says Norman H. Davis,

178
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,710
American disarmament
representative at Geneva,

179
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,644
at a dinner in one
of the leading hotels of Rome

180
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,411
Signore Marconi, the inventor,

181
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,977
various members of the cabinet,

182
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:12,975
and Alexander Kirk,
American Charge d'Affaires

183
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,476
with members of the American
Embassy staff also attended.

184
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,211
Following cordial conversations

185
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:21,045
with the Premier
and his cabinet members,

186
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:23,745
Mr. Davis went
to Mr. Kirk's home, where they...

187
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:24,978
Don't touch me.

188
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:26,978
...results of the election
over the radio

189
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,711
Mr. Davis continues
his disarmament discussions today

190
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,710
with Italian experts in a long
interview at the Foreign Office.

191
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,310
In Boston, Anthony Bender, 43,
was allowed to vote,

192
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,013
but first,
he had to prove he was alive.

193
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,180
When Bender entered
the polling place,

194
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,178
he was challenged,
"Sorry, you can't vote here."

195
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,413
"Why not?" he asked.

196
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,411
"You're listed as dead,"
he was told.

197
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,613
Bender immediately produced
proof he was very much alive,

198
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:57,611
and officials decided
he could cast his ballot.

199
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,914
Firemen in Detroit
are still battling the fire

200
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:03,912
that has claimed the life of Johnny Sciutto
and his brother Guido.

201
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:07,245
Fire Chief DeCoine says containment
is not expected until early tomorrow morning

202
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:12,611
Damage is estimated
in excess of $41,000.

203
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,179
This is 50,000 watt
Clear Channel station KFI...

204
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:20,281
- Don't!
- in downtown Los Angeles.

205
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:21,948
And now,
a look at the weather.

206
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,514
Temperatures are expected
to drop to the middle 40s

207
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,512
in parts of the San Joaquin Valley...

208
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:33,879
Late night and early morning fog
is expected at all beach areas,

209
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:36,315
with temperatures in the low 50s.

210
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,115
Tomorrow should be
clear and warmer,

211
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:41,113
with a high of 64 downtown,
60 at the beaches, and 68...

212
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,415
I changed my mind.

213
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:24,916
Your partner's waiting for you

214
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:35,283
She was leaning against the railing.

215
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:39,183
She was completely relaxed,
completely comfortable.

216
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,818
I didn't have a perfect view,

217
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,817
but I could see enough of her face and lips
to see that she was...

218
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,318
...smiling.

219
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,316
One thousand hours!

220
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,716
And to help us
celebrate the occasion,

221
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,553
Jeff Maxon and his music!

222
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,551
Take it away, Jeff!

223
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,318
Yowsah! One thousand hours
of continuous dancing.

224
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:22,318
Forty-two days
of grueling, grinding,

225
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:27,085
gravity-defying gyration,
and here they still are.

226
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:32,118
Twenty-one courageous couples
still dancing

227
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,785
And how long before
one of them, and just one,

228
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:40,885
will survive to win
the monster marathon?

229
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,252
Gloria?

230
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:59,488
Who's that?

231
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,486
No one.

232
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:07,320
You wanna talk?

233
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,487
No.

234
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,123
I wish you'd go back to her.

235
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:25,121
How?
You know what she thinks.

236
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:29,823
That didn't happen.

237
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:32,822
- Wanna move on the other side?
- No.

238
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:39,421
- Sleep?
- No.

239
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,189
What the hell do you want?

240
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:50,155
- Anyone ever tell you you're--
- Yeah, they told me.

241
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:43,691
And don't forget, folks,
ladies free at matinee tomorrow.

242
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:49,891
Until 3pm, that is.

243
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,760
And I have an important announcement here

244
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,758
about John Hirschman,
reserved seat cashier.

245
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:59,292
He is now happily convalescing
at Santa Monica Hospital

246
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:02,627
after a severe attack of appendicitis

247
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,625
We know that you'll join us
in congratulations to him

248
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:08,625
and wishing him a speedy recovery

249
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:12,326
Thank you, thank you, thank you

250
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:44,896
Inside of the floor.

251
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,629
These people are paying to see you.

252
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,627
- All right.
- Come on.

253
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,661
I'm coming!

254
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,196
Moon belongs to everyone

255
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:23,162
The best things in life are free

256
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,830
The stars belong to everyone

257
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,297
They gleam there for you and me

258
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,864
The flowers in spring

259
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:52,864
The robins that sing

260
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,964
The sunbeams that shine

261
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,198
they're yours, they're mine

262
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:05,864
And love can come to everyone

263
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:13,932
The best things in life are free

264
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:22,631
The best things in life are free

265
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:34,734
Beautiful, beautiful!

266
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,901
How about that?
Wasn't that nice?

267
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:39,468
Our own number 68!

268
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,467
This is Ruby Fix, a lovely little lady
with an armful of charm

269
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:47,133
a roomful of courage,
and a houseful of hope.

270
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,767
And I know you all join me
in wishing her and her bundle of joy

271
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:56,433
a joyous ride through life.

272
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,403
I just hope it was worth it to ya.

273
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:08,936
We need the money.

274
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:11,470
It's celebrity time again tonight, folks.

275
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,870
A welcome
for Miss Helen Twelvetrees

276
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:16,868
and that rising young star,
Mr. Ross Alexander!

277
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:23,801
But every night is celebrity night
at the mammoth marathon.

278
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,135
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

279
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,004
She looks like her kinda.

280
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:40,002
Who?

281
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:45,169
Like my aunt.

282
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,105
God, what a bitch.

283
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:51,438
He said he was gonna be here.

284
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,436
lf there was a prize for bitchiness,
she'd have won.

285
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:58,336
Glasses, short balding guy.

286
00:29:58,473 --> 00:30:00,238
Pits, like from acne.

287
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,338
Christ, you should've
heard her screaming.

288
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,306
- "Get that mangy mutt outta here."
- He's assistant director.

289
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:07,772
"You ain't bringing no animal
into my boarding house."

290
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,272
He's going on a ten-day
western at Monogram.

291
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,772
I wouldn't have brought him
back there, anyway.

292
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,005
Maybe something for me in it.
Something, maybe.

293
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:16,739
He just followed me, that's all.

294
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,272
Maybe, maybe. Maybe.

295
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:22,073
And I wouldn't have kept him,
except she started screaming.

296
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,473
I hope he wasn't stringing me.

297
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:25,673
I said I'd tell her husband she was
screwing one of the boarders,

298
00:30:25,674 --> 00:30:28,671
- Crumb.
- which she probably was

299
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:35,338
But he was sick inside
with something.

300
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,173
Her husband?

301
00:30:38,174 --> 00:30:39,940
No.

302
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,474
The boarder.

303
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,472
No, for Christ's sake, the dog!

304
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:49,272
And it kept getting worse, so he'd shake
all the time and dirty himself all over...

305
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,907
and whine and cry all night long.

306
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:55,905
Stupid damn thing!

307
00:30:56,342 --> 00:30:59,339
He kept whimpering
and hollering and wouldn't shut up.

308
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,439
I mean, what the hell is God doing
sitting around up there?

309
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:07,639
What the hell good is He if He can't
make one lousy sick dog shut up

310
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:10,739
and stop waking up
her goddamn boarders?

311
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:16,040
And you know what I did?

312
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,240
See, after everybody had gone to bed,
I carried him down to the parlor.

313
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,207
And she had this mohair sofa--
it was her favorite one.

314
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,041
And I fixed him a place on it.

315
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:40,041
What the hell, forget it.

316
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:58,641
You should be sleeping.

317
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,377
I'd just wake up.

318
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,375
You want anything?
Something for your feet?

319
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:07,845
How about a saw?

320
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:10,843
Is there anything the doctor can give you?
Something to make you feel better?

321
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:14,243
- What's he got?
- Some aspirin.

322
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:19,709
That's what I figured.

323
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:41,213
- Have you seen Joel?
- I seen him, all right.

324
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:44,211
Boy, that's a real sweetheart
you picked this time--just like that.

325
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:47,344
And I'm the one
that's gotta tell Rocky.

326
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:52,446
Cheers.

327
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:55,114
Don't give me any of that song
and dance crap! What's going on?

328
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:57,413
Just exactly what appears
to be going on.

329
00:32:57,414 --> 00:33:00,280
I've shaved, I've changed,
and I am now packing.

330
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,414
- For what?
- I have a job.

331
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:05,013
It's not much of a job,
but it's a job.

332
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,013
Ten days in a Monogram western.

333
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:10,011
You bastard!
You're not running out on me!

334
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:13,245
No? Just stand there
and watch, sweetheart.

335
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:21,348
Will she make it?

336
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,848
Will she make it?

337
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,846
After over 1,100 hours
of incredible endurance,

338
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,546
there she is, alone,
but still fighting,

339
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:32,979
still hoping,
still trusting--Gloria Beatty.

340
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,613
Seventeen hours--
that's all she has left.

341
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:42,413
Will she find a new partner
before those hours run out?

342
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,847
Will fortune reward
her pluck and spirit?

343
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,481
Will she make it?

344
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:21,650
I ain't quittin'.

345
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:24,648
I'm not gonna give up.

346
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,218
How are the tabs?

347
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,551
Pretty much the same.

348
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,549
Phone calls are down,
cleaning's up.

349
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,583
Yeah?

350
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:55,450
What happens
if I don't get a partner?

351
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,117
You've got 11, almost 12 hours.

352
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:02,419
I can count.

353
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,352
What happens?

354
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,351
You know the rules.

355
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:14,851
You could change 'em.

356
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:18,651
No. The crowd's got to have
something they believe in.

357
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:22,551
Once they quit believing,
they quit coming.

358
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,618
Anything else, but not that

359
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:52,253
Tommy, we got a dead one.

360
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:56,153
Just give him to me.

361
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,687
Here we go.

362
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,087
Jesus!

363
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,256
If two knees
touch the floor, she's out!

364
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,254
Come on! Come on!

365
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,187
Come on, Sailor!

366
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:31,754
Out! Take her away.

367
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,690
Miss Shirley Clayton.

368
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,688
We're going to miss you, Shirl.
Isn't that right, folks?

369
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,524
So long, Shirl, but don't despair.

370
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:49,522
Every heart in this room is with you,
and that's what really counts.

371
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,858
It's hard on all of us,

372
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,856
after we've lived all these hours
and weeks together,

373
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:02,022
to see one of these wonderful,
courageous kids fallout.

374
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,256
But life goes on,
and so does the marathon!

375
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:36,726
Three minutes left!

376
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:39,724
Three minutes of harrowing,
heart-breaking hustle!

377
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:41,127
Yowsah!

378
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,793
Over 1,200 hours
of continuous dancing,

379
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,060
and yet there they still are,

380
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:48,527
fighting, struggling to stay in the race

381
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:50,894
But the last three couples will lose

382
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,892
The last three couples
will be eliminated!

383
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:57,126
Yowsah, yowsah!
Come on, let's hear it, folks!

384
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:08,259
Let's hear it over there!

385
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:49,563
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- My chest!

386
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,698
Come on, lean on me.
Put your arm around me.

387
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,566
Lean on me!

388
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,564
Where does it hurt?
What is it?

389
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,664
One minute!

390
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,998
It's just a little bit further!

391
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:15,467
Come on, you salty old bastard!

392
00:40:15,468 --> 00:40:17,100
Where's the fight? Come on!

393
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,467
Come on, goddamn it!

394
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:20,734
Hang on to me!
I'm tired of losing!

395
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,732
Come on!

396
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,066
It looks like our sea faring man and our little
hard luck lady are in deep trouble.

397
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:40,500
Come on, goddamn it!
We're gonna make it.

398
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:44,266
Thirty seconds!

399
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,935
Walk!

400
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:49,933
Walk! Walk!

401
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:01,434
Walk, goddamn it!

402
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,667
Walk!

403
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:13,369
We're gonna make it!

404
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,870
- Five!
- Walk!

405
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:16,370
- Four!
- Come on!

406
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:19,368
Three! Two! One!

407
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:23,936
Scratch them three kids,

408
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:26,170
- and there are the losers!
- Sailor, we made it!

409
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:28,137
Get 'em to the spots.

410
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,370
- Arthur and Jean...
- Sailor!

411
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:32,037
Pattie and Don,
Dusty and Jessel...

412
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:33,138
We made it!

413
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:36,104
Let's have a big hand
for the losers.

414
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:39,102
Come on, folks, let's hear it

415
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,202
It looks like our ancient mariner
may have taken a little spill.

416
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:53,139
There's nothing to worry about

417
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,872
He's all right!
Leave him alone!

418
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:56,505
- Get her off me!
- No, please!

419
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:59,503
- Get her out of here!
- He's gonna be all right!

420
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,437
What are they doing to him?
He's gonna be all right.

421
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:18,873
I just had a message
from our house physician.

422
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:21,039
Nothing in the least serious

423
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,037
Just a case of heat prostration.

424
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:27,705
And I understand that Harry,
crusty old salt that he is,

425
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,640
wanted to stay on in the marathon,

426
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,638
but the doc says "no,"
and when it comes to something like this,

427
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:37,271
the doctor's word is law.

428
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:48,074
He's gonna be all right.

429
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:49,974
So long, Sailor.

430
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:52,007
But we know
you'll be back to see us

431
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:55,006
and to cheer the other kids on.

432
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,772
You have ten minutes
to enjoy yourself

433
00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:04,939
in our beautiful Palm Garden.

434
00:43:35,077 --> 00:43:37,176
But I'm not better off.

435
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:40,174
I'm sorry.

436
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:54,975
Alice

437
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:06,044
Oh, my God.

438
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:09,042
Get out of the way.

439
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,877
Get out of here.

440
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,477
Come on, move, dammit!

441
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:55,113
You can come out now.

442
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:58,111
Nobody's gonna hurt you

443
00:45:02,381 --> 00:45:05,113
Don't you wanna come out now?

444
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:08,112
You might catch cold in there.

445
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:13,979
You don't wanna do that, do you?

446
00:45:14,149 --> 00:45:17,146
Please.

447
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:24,848
I just wanna help you.

448
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,846
I just wanna turn off
the water, that's all.

449
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:33,813
I just wanna turn off the handle.

450
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:39,848
All right, I won't...

451
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:42,846
...if you don't want me to.

452
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:54,514
Tell me.

453
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:59,314
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

454
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:08,882
He...touched me.

455
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:15,815
Who?

456
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:19,048
He...touched me.

457
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:23,848
Get out of here!

458
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:30,215
Is he dead?

459
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:33,651
Sailor?

460
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:36,649
You mean Sailor?

461
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:41,051
No.

462
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:44,049
You have my personal word
he's gonna be fine.

463
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:20,252
Someone screamed.

464
00:47:21,054 --> 00:47:24,051
That was you, Alice.

465
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:45,520
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl, boy gets girl!

466
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:50,655
That's the story
of our sweetheart couple--

467
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:53,653
Gloria Beatty and Robert Siverton!

468
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:58,788
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

469
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,786
Now, I'm no Hollywood scenario writer,

470
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,955
but I know what
the end of this story should be.

471
00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:07,222
Right, Robert?
Right, Gloria?

472
00:48:07,223 --> 00:48:08,655
Wrong.

473
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:11,654
Does the prisoner wish to make a statement
to the court before sentence is passed?

474
00:48:16,857 --> 00:48:19,854
No.

475
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,687
No, sir.

476
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:28,090
Come in, come in, kids.

477
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:31,088
Just sit down,
make yourselves comfortable.

478
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,355
I know this is your rest period,
so just sit down and rest.

479
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:42,855
I had a little notion, kids--
something that could help the show,

480
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:44,924
something could benefit all of us.

481
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,891
And in particular,
it could benefit the two of you,

482
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,091
and at the same time,

483
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,089
give the folks out there
something to get worked up about.

484
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:56,289
What are you gonna do--put us in cages
and let 'em throw peanuts at us?

485
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,758
All kidding aside--

486
00:48:57,759 --> 00:49:00,756
Who's kidding?

487
00:49:05,893 --> 00:49:08,890
The thing I want is I want
you two kids to get married.

488
00:49:12,726 --> 00:49:14,659
Right here on the dance floor.

489
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,657
A public wedding.

490
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:21,058
I mean, you get divorced
right after the show, if you want.

491
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,057
It's just for effect.

492
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,292
What do you say to that, Robert?

493
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:30,291
- I don't know, I guess so.
- He says no.

494
00:49:31,394 --> 00:49:33,326
Does she do
all the talking for you, Robert?

495
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:36,324
That's right.

496
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,793
Well...

497
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:43,791
Robert, maybe it'd be better
if just her and me discussed it.

498
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:45,460
Okay?

499
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,458
Yeah, sure.

500
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:52,225
But the idea is okay with you.
That's what you said, right?

501
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:55,161
No, sir, I didn't say that at all.
All I said was--

502
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,394
It's the same thing,
it's the same thing.

503
00:49:57,395 --> 00:50:00,392
It'll just be a minute.

504
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:14,428
What's your problem?

505
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,561
You're afraid of getting married?

506
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:19,560
You're not happy until you've
screwed everything up, are you?

507
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:24,126
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

508
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,195
I'm not marrying anybody!

509
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:29,695
It's business!

510
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,695
Strictly business, for God's sake.

511
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,693
Look, you come out with something--
new clothes...

512
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:37,496
...plenty of free gifts, silverware,

513
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:39,695
waffle irons, toasters,
that kind of stuff.

514
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:41,729
What am I gonna do
with crap like that?

515
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,496
Sell it, hawk it!

516
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:45,763
Look, for God's sake,
I'm trying to help you a little.

517
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:48,761
Maybe you'll come out
with 2 or 300 bucks--that's something.

518
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:52,828
Unless you wanna walk out of here
with the pennies they're throwing at you

519
00:50:53,898 --> 00:50:56,895
Yeah? And what if
just maybe we win?

520
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:07,495
Look, sweetheart, I've been
in this business a long time.

521
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:12,062
I may not know a winner
when I see one...

522
00:51:12,832 --> 00:51:15,829
...but I sure as hell can spot a loser.

523
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:21,729
You son of a bitch!

524
00:51:21,732 --> 00:51:24,165
Maybe.

525
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,163
Do you wanna come out of this
with a couple hundred bucks or don't you?

526
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,765
The winners get 750 apiece.

527
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:33,763
Right, less the bills.

528
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,765
What bills?

529
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:39,763
Look, this marathon
don't run itself, you know.

530
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:42,499
I got bills stacked up every day.

531
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,166
And I keep tabs.

532
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,732
You kids cost me money.

533
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:48,731
Extra laundry, cleaning, phone calls,
medical bills, you name it.

534
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,699
What is this?

535
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,697
The tabs on you and Robert.

536
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,000
You're charging me this?

537
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:01,400
Only if you win.

538
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:04,398
If you don't win, you don't pay.
I'm not out to cheat anybody.

539
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:20,166
Oh, Jesus.

540
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,565
Gloria, we have to get back.

541
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:30,166
What the hell's the point?

542
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:40,167
Right.

543
00:53:51,306 --> 00:53:54,303
Where the hell's the other one?

544
00:53:57,373 --> 00:54:00,370
Well, don't just stand there.
Why don't you help me?

545
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,438
What does it look like exactly?

546
00:54:05,439 --> 00:54:08,436
Like this. What do you think
it's gonna look like, a necktie?

547
00:54:12,073 --> 00:54:14,639
I'll tell you one thing.

548
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,638
I'm not leaving this
goddamn stink hole without it.

549
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:20,039
That's the last pair I got.

550
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,037
And I cut out streetcars
for a month to get 'em.

551
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:26,107
Is this it?

552
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:29,105
No, for Christ' sake, it's silk.

553
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:40,474
I found it.

554
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:41,807
Here, is this it?

555
00:54:41,808 --> 00:54:44,805
Yeah.

556
00:54:45,975 --> 00:54:48,972
Jesus, I'm sorry.

557
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:04,806
Gloria, don't...

558
00:55:07,342 --> 00:55:09,642
Look, maybe you can
fix it up or something,

559
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:12,640
sort of sew it up or...

560
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,740
Gloria, let me see it.
Maybe you can sew it up.

561
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,607
I've still got 71 cents.
Maybe I can buy--

562
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:37,774
Shut up!

563
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:49,008
It's not
the goddamn stocking, anyway.

564
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:53,375
Forget it.

565
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:20,812
I used to love
to look at the ocean...

566
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:24,380
...walk by it,
just sit and listen to it.

567
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:30,846
Now I don't care
if I ever see it again.

568
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,580
That...or anything else.

569
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:47,680
What are you gonna do now?
Try the movies again?

570
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:53,414
No.

571
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:57,181
I'd never make it.

572
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:02,414
And maybe it wouldn't
make no difference even if I did.

573
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:07,981
Maybe it's just the whole
damn world is like Central Casting.

574
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:12,681
They got it all rigged
before you ever show up.

575
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:17,115
I know what you mean.

576
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:21,615
I know just what you mean.

577
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:26,216
Do you?

578
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:35,082
What are you gonna do?

579
00:58:40,653 --> 00:58:43,650
I'm gonna get off
this merry-go-round.

580
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,083
I'm so sick
of the whole stinking thing.

581
00:58:51,187 --> 00:58:54,184
What thing?

582
00:58:54,853 --> 00:58:57,850
Life.

583
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:01,950
And don't give me
no sunshine lectures.

584
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:05,450
I wasn't going to.

585
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,584
Then what were you
looking at me that way for?

586
00:59:11,453 --> 00:59:13,886
I wasn't.

587
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,884
I was just trying to see your face

588
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:22,752
Well, keep looking.

589
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:29,718
Stick around for the end.

590
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,687
Help me.

591
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:41,855
Please. Please.

592
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,259
Tell me when.

593
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,257
I'm ready.

594
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:36,426
Now?

595
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,424
Now.

596
01:02:09,962 --> 01:02:12,028
What happened?

597
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:14,228
Just move on.

598
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:17,226
Better things to do. Beat it.

599
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:44,260
Come on, let's go.

600
01:02:46,031 --> 01:02:49,028
Let's go.

601
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:55,662
Why'd you do it, kid?

602
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:01,195
She asked me to.

603
01:03:02,698 --> 01:03:05,695
Obliging bastard.

604
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:16,095
That the only reason
you got, kid?

605
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:19,731
They shoot horses, don't they?

606
01:03:19,732 --> 01:03:22,729
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

607
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,431
Here they are again!

608
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:27,429
These wonderful, wonderful kids,
still struggling, still hoping

609
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:33,563
As the clock of fate ticks away,

610
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:37,030
the dance of destiny continues!

611
01:03:38,366 --> 01:03:41,363
The marathon goes on
and on and on.

612
01:03:43,934 --> 01:03:46,931
How long can they last?

613
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,799
Let's hear it!
Come on!

614
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,732
Let's hear it!
Let's hear it!

615
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
