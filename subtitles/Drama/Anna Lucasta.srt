1
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,810
Hi, Noah.

2
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,319
Hello, Anna. How are you doing?

3
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,825
Fightin' 'em off, Noah.
Fightin' 'em off.

4
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,319
Somebody threw a rock
through Uncle Ben's window

5
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
and pinched a pair of binoculars.
Any comments?

6
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,829
I came across the bridge.

7
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,835
I have nothing
against Uncle Ben.

8
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:05,329
It's too dark to pitch rocks.

9
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,329
That's the one thing
I need, binoculars.

10
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,830
And cops are not
my favorite people.

11
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,330
Take it easy.

12
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,839
That's the talk, Anna.

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
Hi, blanche, why don't you give
the man back his binoculars?

14
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,339
Of all the back-handed remarks.

15
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,339
That's what I'm always telling
you about her, eddy.

16
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,839
You never know where
you stand with her.

17
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,340
He knows where he stands.

18
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,849
Both of you
better watch your step

19
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,860
if you want to stand
in good with me.

20
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Where is everyone tonight?

21
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,675
The streets are like graveyards,
houses like tombstones.

22
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:46,670
Everything's
slowed down to a stop.

23
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,170
When your train is
going too fast,

24
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,685
God puts the brakes on
to give you a chance to think.

25
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:57,180
I don't want to think,
I want to drink.

26
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,679
Do it again.

27
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,180
You ain't paid for
the first one, baby.

28
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,689
Ain't my credit good?

29
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,189
With me, sure.

30
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,189
But I've got
the landlord to think of.

31
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,190
Take out for the first one,
Noah, and leave the bottle.

32
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,199
I'm choosey who I drink with.

33
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,199
Some people have
absolutely no manners.

34
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,699
I'll take a rum cola, Noah.

35
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,199
Let her have it, Noah.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Thanks, eddy.

37
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,200
But drink it right here
at the bar.

38
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,215
Oh, don't let
me spoil the party.

39
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:25,709
This is for the party.

40
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,710
Such a mercenary atmosphere..

41
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,710
How about a little conversation?

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Converse.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,719
How you been?

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,719
It worries you, huh?

45
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Yeah, I've been
thinking about you.

46
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,730
You know, I've been watching
you for over a year now.

47
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,230
How am I doing?

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,230
You get along with the fleet, but so far
they haven't named any ships after you.

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,740
I don't mix with admirals.

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,739
Look, I run
an exclusive place uptown.

51
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,240
We don't cater
to sailors in my place.

52
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
Just captains of industry.

53
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,760
I'll dress you up
in the right clothes,

54
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,750
and you'd look natural on the
arm of some tired businessman.

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
What do I have to do?

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,770
Be a hostess.

57
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,259
You can talk plainer than that.

58
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,760
That's all. Like I said, my club is
real exclusive. No rough stuff.

59
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,769
You just sit and drink
with the customers.

60
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,269
Rake-off on every drink.

61
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,769
Of course, you'd have to learn
how to smile a little.

62
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,269
What goes with the smile?

63
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,270
Mingle, like you do down here.
Except you get paid for it.

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,790
Get paid for what? So far
you haven't said anything.

65
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,279
Look, I run an exclusive club.

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
What's different about your
place makes it so exclusive?

67
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,289
For one thing,
the law won't bother you.

68
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,789
You've got it made.

69
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,789
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
I'm coming up in the world.

70
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,790
Not in mine.

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,799
I'd like to remedy that.

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,810
What's your prescription,
doctor?

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Me.

74
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm not all business. I take a little
pleasure myself once in a while.

75
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,815
Now, working in my place, it's only natural
we'd spend a little time together.

76
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,809
I'd rather do time
than spend it with you.

77
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,810
A couple of
years softening up in the can.

78
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,830
You're scaring me
to death, louse.

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,820
Now I'm getting mad.

80
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,329
Ow! You rotten little bum!

81
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,840
What'd she do to you, eddy?

82
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:26,829
Burned me on the neck
with her cigarette.

83
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,329
He almost tore my arm off.

84
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,830
Well, now you know where you
stand with each other.

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,339
I'm not wastin' my time
with no waterfront tramps.

86
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,850
Well, excuse me for lmn'!

87
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,839
Not you, but you.

88
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,339
Better change your mind
and stop being so particular.

89
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Someday you may need a pal.

90
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,349
I'd rather pal with rats.

91
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,360
Keep it up, and you will.

92
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,849
Are you gonna stick
around here all night?

93
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,859
Well, you don't have
to get so tough about it.

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,859
I'm only going to stay
for a little while.

95
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,359
Gee, my feet are killing me.

96
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,859
You got a smoke?

97
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
You know they still sell 'em
in every drugstore.

98
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, I know.

99
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,869
But I'm cuttin' down on tobacco.

100
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,870
Gives me the heartburn.

101
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,370
Thanks, kid.

102
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,879
Hey, Noah, I'm dyin'
for a drink.

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm dyin' for a cash customer.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Hey, Noah.

105
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,895
How'd you like to buy
a nice pair of binoculars?

106
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,889
Go ahead and take a look through 'em.
See what you could see.

107
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,889
Without looking through 'em, I can
see from 1 to 10 at hard labor.

108
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,890
Give 'em back to Uncle Ben.

109
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,399
I didn't break that window.

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,399
And I didn't steal
no binoculars, either.

111
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,399
I was walkin' down the street,
mindin' my own business,

112
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
and there was that
hole in the window

113
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,920
and the binoculars sittin'
right there on the edge.

114
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,909
They fell in my hand.
I found 'em.

115
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,910
Hey, Anna, do you think there's a
reward for findin' lost articles?

116
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,919
I'd sure like to be found.

117
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah.

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Gee, you look
a million Miles away.

119
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,940
Get lost, will you? Get lost.

120
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,929
I was only tryin'
to cheer you up.

121
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,430
Stay in the dumps. Who cares?

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,450
Hey, where you gonna
sleep tonight?

123
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,939
Why should I tell you?

124
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,440
All right, be huffy.

125
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,940
I don't care where I sleep.

126
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,455
You better go on home, Anna.
I'm locking up.

127
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:26,949
Here's a couple
of sandwiches for the road.

128
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,949
What about something
to wash 'em down with, Noah?

129
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,950
Here, get yourself
a cup of coffee someplace.

130
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,480
Do you know where
a lady can sleep for 4 bits?

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,479
Sell anything today, Frank?

132
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,980
Well, yes and no.

133
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,500
Had a couple of very interesting
prospects, Stanley.

134
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,490
Yeah, but did you
sell anything today?

135
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,489
You know, you have a nasty habit

136
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,990
of reducing everything to money.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,999
That's what money.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,499
Did you take in any?

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,499
You make money your God and it'll
plague you like the devil.

140
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,199
I'm plagued with all the junk you
got cluttering up this yard.

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Hey, give me a hand with this.

142
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,715
You have absolutely
no imagination.

143
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,209
Can't you see this is a
treasure trove of antiques?

144
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,709
I say it's junk.

145
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,710
Yes, but don't you know when
junk gets old enough,

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,219
it becomes antique?

147
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,225
Now you take this little
masterpiece, for instance.

148
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,219
Now I can't leave
this out all night.

149
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,720
Might tempt some honest man
to become a thief.

150
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,740
Hello, darling.

151
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,229
Hi, Stanley.

152
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,729
Did you have a hard day?

153
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,229
You said it. Monday's
always a back-breaker.

154
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,230
I know.
You sit over on the couch.

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,250
I'll help you
with your slippers.

156
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,740
Stella,.

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,740
Look at that rip.

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,740
Every time I raise my arm,
it tears again.

159
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,249
Take it off. I'll sew it up.

160
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,749
Well, you sewed it up yesterday.

161
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,260
I'll patch it from the inside.

162
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,749
You're getting careless
in more ways than one.

163
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,749
How many times have
I told you to wash your hands

164
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,250
after handling that junk?

165
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,759
What for?
Dirt never hurt nobody.

166
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,759
It's healthy.

167
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,765
All that stuff
about dirt and germs

168
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,759
is just a lot of bunk.
Ain't it, Frank?

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,260
Hey, ma, hurry up
with the dinner, will you?

170
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,269
I'm starved.

171
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,769
Oh, Frank, special delivery
came for pa today.

172
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,769
I saved the government 15 cents
by bringing it up myself.

173
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,770
When congress hears about this, I'm
sure we're gonna get a tax cut.

174
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,279
I'll take it up to pa.

175
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,290
Why ain't he down here?
It's time to eat.

176
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,279
He's got another
one of his headaches.

177
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,779
Headaches. He's got a hangover.

178
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,779
It's more than that.

179
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,280
He's got some kind of psychosis.

180
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,289
Psychosis, bunk.

181
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,789
He just likes to hit the bottle.

182
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,295
That's not true..

183
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,289
Hey, wait a minute.
Who's that letter from?

184
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,290
Hey... hey, who'd have anything to write
to Joe that was special delivery?

185
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,799
It's from bessemer, Alabama.

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,305
Probably one of his old cronies
puttin' the bite on him.

187
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,299
All folks down South think
California's the gold country.

188
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,800
Well, he ain't gonna
get any of my money

189
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,309
to send to those Alabama Hicks.

190
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,809
That's easy, you ain't got none.

191
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,820
You little nickel snatcher.

192
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,309
Look, I got a business, eh.

193
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,310
I put the money I make
back into the enterprise.

194
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,309
Enterprise? Don't make me laugh.

195
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,310
You just use that
not to take a job.

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,330
Well, I'll ignore that
unkind remark and tell you

197
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,819
why I wouldn't give the old man
a dime to send to Alabama.

198
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,819
Why? It's the principle
of the thing.

199
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,319
Everyone's got
to make their own way.

200
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
That's democracy,
everyone for himself.

201
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,835
That ain't democracy. Democracy is,
"all for all and one for one."

202
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,829
and you're the one.

203
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,829
I was until you had
to go and make it 2.

204
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,330
It ain't
a question of democracy.

205
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,339
It's a question
of pampering people.

206
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,850
Nobody never got
nowhere with pamperin'.

207
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,839
You take us, for instance.

208
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,839
Now where'd we be if we'd
stayed down in Alabama?

209
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,339
Where do you think we are now?

210
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
In California.

211
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,349
What's that got us?

212
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,849
I don't know where it got you.

213
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,355
I know where it's gonna get me

214
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,349
as soon as this tight
money situation eases up.

215
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,849
You just try walking out on me.

216
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,349
Ain't that a woman for you?

217
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,350
Always makin'
the thing personal.

218
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,359
Where was I?

219
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,870
Easin' the money situation.

220
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
Oh, yeah. The country ain't never
going to balance the budget

221
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,359
as long as they keep
on gmn' stuff away.

222
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,860
Now, you take this here new thing,
this here foreign giveaway program.

223
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,910
Do you think that's right?

224
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,869
Sure that's right
because I heard a guy...

225
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,369
who the hell is telling
this thing, me or you? Me.

226
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,869
That's how much you know.

227
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,430
I heard a guy
talkin' only last night...

228
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,385
now you see? You see?
What's the use?

229
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:16,879
Trouble with you is,
you listen to too much talk.

230
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,879
Trouble with me is,
I listen to too much you.

231
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,379
Listen, now if you really
want to know

232
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,880
why we shouldn't send money to
those southerners, I'll tell you.

233
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,389
Why, Frank?

234
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,389
Because it's pamperin'.

235
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,390
When they get hungry,
they'll find a way to eat.

236
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,390
And the only way
to eat is to work.

237
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,890
And the only ones who eat without
Workin' is the politicians.

238
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,410
And just as soon as this country
gets back on its feet again,

239
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,399
that's just what I'm
a politician.

240
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
And that's when the country
will really be on its butt.

241
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,910
Eh, I sure did marry beneath me.

242
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,410
That's another trouble women.

243
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,909
Hey, ma, when are we gonna eat?

244
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,910
Now.

245
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,425
If you don't get some solid food inside
you, instead of all that candy,

246
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:58,419
you'll give birth
to a chocolate marshmallow.

247
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,720
Dinner's ready, Joe.
We're waitin' for you.

248
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,740
All right, Theresa. I figured it
was about time. Thank you, Katie.

249
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,729
Did you have a nice nap, honey?

250
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,229
I got a little sleep.

251
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,230
Well, you're
feelin' all right, then..

252
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,239
No, Theresa, I feel terrible.

253
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,245
Every time I try
to read this letter,

254
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,239
the words just
jiggle around like bugs.

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,239
Here, you read it for me, Katie.

256
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Of course, Joe.

257
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,749
Are we gonna hold up my
dinner for this mess?

258
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,760
I want everyone to keep quiet
and listen to it

259
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,249
because it's from my old
friend, Otis slocum,

260
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,749
and it's bound to be good.

261
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,750
If he wants our old clothes,
he's out of luck.

262
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,759
We got 'em on.

263
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,765
Shh, let Katie read the letter.

264
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:39,259
"My dear friend Joe lucasta, I hope you
are fine and rich in California."

265
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,760
here it comes..

266
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,769
"I just sold my farm
because the doctor says.

267
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,275
"I work too hard
and got to take it slow

268
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:47,269
"and stay off my
feet from here on.

269
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,270
"All my boys and girls got
married, all except Rudolf..

270
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,785
Rudolf's getting painfully
restless for a woman."

271
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:56,280
tell him to take a cold shower.

272
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,280
Shut up, Stanley..

273
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,280
Read on, Katie.

274
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,295
"Good healthy women
are scarce down around here

275
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:05,789
"owing to so many
of the young folk"

276
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,789
"leaving this
part of the country."

277
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,789
"So I gave Rudolf
his share of the farm"

278
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,290
"so he can get
himself a good wife"

279
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
"when he comes west.
He's bringing $4,000, Joe."

280
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,299
"And I want you to pick him
a good, strong woman,

281
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,299
"clean and God-fearing..

282
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,800
"I know you will do this,
for old times' sake.

283
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,820
"So bless you, Joe, and be
good to my boy Rudolf.

284
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,309
Otis slocum."

285
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,309
what does that farmer think?

286
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,309
You can buy a woman
like you buy a pig?

287
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,810
Sometimes pigs is a better buy.

288
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,819
When are we gonna eat?

289
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,319
I'll bring you
yours in a trough.

290
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
$4,000.

291
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,319
That's a whole lot of money for
a jerk to be carryin' around.

292
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,820
Yeah, really too much.

293
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,829
$4,000 is a lot of money.
We need it bad.

294
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,329
Frank, you can't stoop that low.

295
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,829
Well, if he's willing
to pay for a woman

296
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,830
and we get him one,
we ain't cheatin' him, are we?

297
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,830
It's business.
That's what it's like.

298
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,839
Yeah, and I gotta get a whole new
wardrobe after the baby comes.

299
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,845
And we gotta get
a new bed for Stella and me.

300
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:59,339
I'm tired of nailin' that thing
together in the middle of the night.

301
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,840
This family could
use a second car.

302
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,849
There's a swell Ford
down at the used-car lot

303
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,860
for only $800.
It's convertible, too.

304
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,350
Stop it!

305
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,319
Stop spending Otis slocum's money.
I won't let you.

306
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,880
Well, you ain't got it yet.

307
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,400
Besides you don't have to do nothin'.
We'll do it ourselves.

308
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,389
I said, no!

309
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,389
He just said you don't
have to do nothin'.

310
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,890
If we don't get it,
somebody else will.

311
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,899
What chance has
a dumb son of a gun got

312
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,410
keepin' that kind of money
in this town?

313
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,399
Don't let them do anything.
It's disgusting.

314
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,399
We ought to be able to get some
real nice girl for Rudolf.

315
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,900
All the girls I know
are married or got kids.

316
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,909
There's Irene's sister.

317
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,920
But ever since she went to San Francisco,
she wouldn't look at no farmer.

318
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,409
How about tom's daughter?

319
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,409
What the devil's going on here?
Give me some meat.

320
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,410
He'd pay us to take
her off his hands.

321
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,419
Who did you say, Stanley?

322
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,919
Tom's daughter.

323
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,419
Say, by George,
you've got somethin' there..

324
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,419
She'd take anything in pants.

325
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
You talk to her tomorrow,
will you, stell?

326
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,429
I'll call her tonight
right after dinner..

327
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,935
That's the best
time to catch her.

328
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,929
Good, be sure and do that, eh.
Mmm-hmm.

329
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,429
You've got it all figured out..

330
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,930
It never struck you that Rudolf
might have his own ideas

331
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,439
of what he wants in a wife?

332
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,439
You're right, Katie.
You're absolutely right.

333
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,439
We've got to get
the guy somethin' good..

334
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,940
We can't take a chance on
a false number. Uh-huh.

335
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,449
Oh, what's the use?

336
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,460
I know who we'll get for Rudolf.

337
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:12,449
Who, ma?

338
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,950
Anna.

339
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,959
Who did you say, Theresa?

340
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,459
I said, Anna.

341
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,959
Have you gone out of your mind?

342
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,459
No, Joe.

343
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,960
It come to me like a big light.

344
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,970
Here's our chance
to give Anna a fresh start.

345
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,469
I made a rule, we don't talk about
her in this house no more.

346
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,469
And I keep that rule, Joe.

347
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,470
We don't talk no bad about Anna.

348
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,979
This is good for her.

349
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,485
This is good we can do Anna.

350
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:43,979
She ain't no good,
but she'd do for him.

351
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,479
You're speaking
of your own sister.

352
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,479
So what?
She's nothing but a slut.

353
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't you say that, Stella.

354
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,489
There's no one got
a right to call her that.

355
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,495
Pa didn't kick
her out for nothing.

356
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:54,989
You shut your mouth,
or I'll slap you down!

357
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,489
You just try.

358
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,490
Nobody's gonna slap
my wife down but me.

359
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,499
You and who else?

360
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,510
Right. Let's settle this thing.

361
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,499
Let's all keep our heads.

362
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,499
Now here's our chance to look at
this thing from the human angle.

363
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

364
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,509
Well, we've all got
different angles.

365
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,509
Let's just put them all
together and do as I say.

366
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,009
Now anybody can see
that ma is right.

367
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,009
She's absolutely right..

368
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,610
Anna's the girl we ought to get for
Rudolf, so we'll just get her.

369
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,019
Never! Never in this world!

370
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,030
Maybe she's changed.

371
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:24,020
She don't look a day older.

372
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
How do you know?

373
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,530
Stanley?

374
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,006
A friend of mine saw her. I... i
didn't want to tell you, ma.

375
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,529
Tell me what?

376
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,506
Nothin' ma. Anyway, she's... she's
lookin' just great.

377
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,529
What if she won't have Rudolf?

378
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,030
Stop that talk.

379
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,539
Didn't you just hear
Katie read the letter?

380
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,039
Didn't you hear Otis tell me to
find his son a God-fearing woman?

381
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,539
Joe, you've got
to give Anna this chance.

382
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,040
No!

383
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,549
No, Theresa!
Have you gone crazy?

384
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,049
But, Joe, she...

385
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,049
I swore it then, -

386
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,549
she don't come
back in this house!

387
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,550
She don't come
back in this house!

388
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,059
Well, I guess he means she don't
come back in this house.

389
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,060
No. No. Joe wants her back.

390
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,569
It's just that stubborn,
bullheaded pride of his

391
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,069
that hates to admit
he's done wrong.

392
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,569
You don't know
what you're doin', ma.

393
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,069
They only want her back
to sell her like an animal.

394
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,070
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, child.

395
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,079
All I know is I want
Anna back, that's all.

396
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,079
I'll make Joe go fetch her.

397
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,085
I'll break him down, you'll see.

398
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:26,079
Do you think she can
make that old ox see the light?

399
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
If she don't, I guess I'll just have
to have a little talk with him.

400
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,590
If I don't get
that new wardrobe,

401
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,100
I won't be able
to step out of this house.

402
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,089
I never dreamt people
could be so inhuman.

403
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,089
At least we're not hypocrites.

404
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,090
Well, who's a hypocrite?

405
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,599
You. You're not so keen on lmng

406
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,280
under the same roof
with that streetwalker.

407
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,680
That never entered my head.

408
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
I'd like to meet Anna.

409
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,599
I've a feeling she's got a
lot of her mother in her.

410
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And I never met anyone sweeter
and nicer than Theresa.

411
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,109
Let go of me, Theresa.

412
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,115
I won't let you go

413
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,109
till you promise me
you'll let Anna come back.

414
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,610
Get away from me, Theresa!

415
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,609
If we don't give her this
chance, we may never get...

416
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,110
oh, ma. Are you hurt, ma?

417
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,119
You girls take ma upstairs.
Let her rest.

418
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,619
He's got to give Anna another chance.
He's got to.

419
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,180
It's all right, ma,
you leave him to me.

420
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,619
Go up with them, Stanley.

421
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,619
I wanna talk to him, too.

422
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,120
I ain't talkin' to none of you.

423
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,629
I'm gonna talk
and you'll listen...

424
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,129
you get out of my house!

425
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,629
We only want to get
some sense into you, pa.

426
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,629
You two, get out!
We should throw you out.

427
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,129
Who's paid the rent for 2 years?

428
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,130
Shut up!

429
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,139
Don't tell me to shut up.

430
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,616
Cut that out. Now beat
it, like I told you.

431
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Go on!

432
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Gee, I hate to see that, Joe.
That's bad,

433
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,149
your own son
raisin' his hand to you.

434
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,655
That's bad upbringin'.

435
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,650
You ain't done
so good by Stella, either.

436
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,149
I had a hard job
housebreaking that woman.

437
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,150
Seems like the only one you showed
any loving care for was Anna.

438
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,159
You was real fond
of her, wasn't you?

439
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
I was.

440
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,159
Yeah, she turned out to be
your prize mistake.

441
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,169
Well, that's the pity of it all,

442
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,170
"It's an ill wind that don't
carry a silver lining."

443
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,170
now we can make some good out
of all this bad, you and me.

444
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,690
I know what you're drmn' at,
so you can save your breath.

445
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,179
Oh, sure.

446
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,179
You ought to know I ain't
the one for wastin' words.

447
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,680
There's much quicker ways of
gettin' things done than talk.

448
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,250
Now why was it
you kicked Anna out, Joe?

449
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,189
Why did you do it?

450
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,189
I did what the hymnbook told me.

451
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,689
The hymnbook?

452
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,199
Now you ain't
a religious man, Joe.

453
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,210
Can't even get you
to go to church on Sunday.

454
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:24,699
You rather lay in bed.

455
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,699
No, it wasn't the hymnbook.

456
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Now, ma says it was your pride.

457
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,709
Now you could have never took
no pride in this family.

458
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,709
So what was it, Joe,
that made you kick her out?

459
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,209
And why won't you have her back?

460
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,710
'Cause I ain't gonna let you
spend Otis slocum's money.

461
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,719
There ain't nothin' in this world
I hate more than I do a liar.

462
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,225
That ain't a lie.
It's the truth.

463
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:43,719
You just heard from Otis today,

464
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,719
yet you kept Anna out of this
house for all this time.

465
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm gonna give you one last
chance to say the truth, Joe.

466
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,229
So come on, out with it.

467
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,730
It'll save you
a whole lot of sweat.

468
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,729
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

469
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,230
There ain't no truth
but what I've already said.

470
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh, yes, there is.
You're afraid.

471
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,745
You're afraid to admit
you done wrong.

472
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,239
That's what's eatin' your guts.

473
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,239
I did right, I tell you!
I did right.

474
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
What are you
hollerin' about, Joe?

475
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,750
What's the matter with you?

476
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,250
Nothing.

477
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,249
Nothing.

478
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,749
Nothing?

479
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,250
Look at you, trembling like an old fool.
What are you trembling about?

480
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,759
Because all the things you say are lies.
All lies.

481
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,270
Then prove it!

482
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,259
Prove it by bringin' her
back and showin' all of us

483
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,259
you can act
like a father to her.

484
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,760
A nice, kind father, Joe.

485
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,270
No. No.

486
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,269
Yellow, huh?

487
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,769
Then I guess I'll just have
to give you a little courage.

488
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,769
This is where
you need it, Joe, right here.

489
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,440
Let's get downtown and get you
on that bus for San Diego.

490
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,050
I can't do it.
I can't do it, I tell you.

491
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,960
But you gotta, Joe.
M-maybe tomorrow.

492
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,449
No, tonight.

493
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,949
Stanley, what was the name of
that place your friend saw Anna?

494
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,950
Noah's wharf cafe.
Is he gonna go?

495
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,959
Your son asked you
a question, Joe.

496
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,970
I ain't got the fare.

497
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,959
Here, give me some fare,
Stanley.

498
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,459
Easy. That money's
Katie's as well as mine.

499
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,960
Am I gonna have
trouble with you, too?

500
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,469
Come on, Joe.

501
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,969
Frank, is he going?

502
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,469
Yeah, ma. He had a change of heart.
Is he really going?

503
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,470
That's my good Joe.

504
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,990
Come on,
you're holdin' up the parade.

505
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,979
Yeah, when you gotta go,
you can't stay.

506
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,979
I knew you'd do it, Joe.

507
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
God bless you.

508
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,490
We're gonna have
our little Anna back again.

509
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,010
Come on.

510
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,500
Lester, boy,
your fate is in my hands.

511
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,009
Hey, Noah!

512
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,510
I'm closed.

513
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,009
Come on, man.

514
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,010
Open up for a hot sailor
on a cold night.

515
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,019
Hey, Noah, it's Danny Johnson.
Let him in.

516
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,030
Now I'll never get to bed.

517
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,519
Hi, Noah. Hey, wait a minute
don't shut that door.

518
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,020
There's a lonesome gob
out there.

519
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,529
Lester, what are you gonna do?

520
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,170
Stand in the breeze all night?
Come on in.

521
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,529
Hello, baby.

522
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,530
Hiya, Danny.

523
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,530
Is it good to see you!

524
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Hey, don't handle me
like a sack of potatoes.

525
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,039
Hey, you lost weight, baby.

526
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,539
Yeah, among other things.

527
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,539
But you're still a fine-looking chick.
Thanks.

528
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,039
Hey, Lester, look what I found.

529
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,540
Well, you sure
don't lose no time.

530
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,560
No, this is the girl I've been
tellin' you about. Oh, pardon me.

531
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:28,049
And pardon me. Is this
the last of the convoy?

532
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,049
Yeah, Noah, it's
the last of the convoy..

533
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,550
This is Lester. He's the cat with
all the loot. He's treasurer.

534
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,559
Lester, I want you
to know Anna lucasta.

535
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,570
Once you've met Anna, you've
come up against the main event.

536
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,559
How are you?

537
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,059
How do you do?

538
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
It looks as though
you've met someone in Lester.

539
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,569
Now you know that I only know
the best kind of people.

540
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,069
Come here and tell me something.
Why didn't you write me?

541
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,569
We docked in long beach
and took a cab

542
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,569
all the way here
to find you, didn't we?

543
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,570
That's right, but it sure
was worth the cab fare.

544
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,079
Hey, your friend's
got the makings.

545
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,079
Yeah, I towed him along to
bring out my finer qualities.

546
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,079
He says I'm a gentleman
in the rough.

547
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,580
I sure am rough, ain't I,
baby, and don't you love it?

548
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,659
May... maybe I'd better go
and write myself a letter.

549
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,730
No, man, stay
and enjoy yourself.

550
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,220
Enjoy myself?

551
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,740
Well, uh, maybe I
could order some drinks?

552
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,730
Hey, now, that's a good idea.

553
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,729
Why couldn't you
have thought of that?

554
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,230
'Cause my mind's racing
way ahead of that, baby.

555
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah, but we've got company,
remember?

556
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,239
Did you say something
about a drink, sailor?

557
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,739
Pardon me for buttin' in.

558
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
Don't apologize.

559
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,249
You're too
good-looking for that.

560
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,255
Now come on. Don't get him
all steamed up, baby.

561
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,749
This is his first cruise.

562
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,249
But not my first port.

563
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,249
Now come on, folks, what'll it be?
And let's make it snappy.

564
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,750
Just bring out a big,
fat bottle.

565
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,759
Beer for me.

566
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,259
What did that cab set us back?

567
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,265
What's the difference?

568
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,759
It was worth our while,
wasn't it?

569
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,759
It must have cost us $20
getting here.

570
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,759
And I kept sayin'
to myself on the ride,

571
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,260
"maybe she hooked some bigshot.

572
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,769
Maybe she left town
or somethin'."

573
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,775
quit your jazzin'.

574
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,769
I ain't jazzin'. Ask Lester.

575
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,269
But no more problems now, baby.

576
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,769
I found you, and you ain't never
gonna slip away from me again.

577
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,770
You can bet your boots on that.

578
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,279
Now truthfully,
what does that do to you?

579
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,279
Does that bring out
my finer qualities, Lester?

580
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,779
Well, it sort of...

581
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,280
what does he know?

582
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,789
He likes everything plain.
He's got no taste.

583
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,990
Wait a minute, there's something
else that goes with it.

584
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,789
Ah, here we are. Dig.

585
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,790
Hey.

586
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,290
Danny, this looks like
it's been worn before.

587
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,799
Now let me see
if I can find the rest.

588
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,299
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, where's papa?

589
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
Lester, where's papa?

590
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,815
If you left papa
on the ship... here he is.

591
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:33,809
Where do I wear that?

592
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,809
You don't wear him, honey.

593
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,309
He's someone you're gonna
get to know real well.

594
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,310
Another one of your
west Indian puzzles.

595
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,319
How do I take him apart?

596
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,400
You don't take him apart. You treat him
with respect, and he'll do you favors.

597
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,819
Like right now, he's planning
something really big for you.

598
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Do you know what
he's talking about, Lester?

599
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,329
Oh, it's a mighty big plan.

600
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,829
Tell her who papa is.

601
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,329
Uh, that's a model of agoue,
the Haitian God of the sea.

602
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,829
Seems he's good to sailors.

603
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,330
Looks like papa and me
has got something in common.

604
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,839
Oh, come on,
be serious, will you?

605
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,360
You see, my cruise is up
in a few days.

606
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,839
And I ain't about to sign up
for another 4-year hitch.

607
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,839
What did they do? Give you the rush?
Give me the rush?

608
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Did you hear that?
Ain't it ridiculous, papa?

609
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,849
The admiral himself
begged me not to leave,

610
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,860
didn't he, Lester?

611
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,349
He cried like a baby.

612
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,349
What do you do now?

613
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,349
Now I get me a hack,
and I go back to hackin'..

614
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,850
And pretty papa here is gonna
ride the radiator cap.

615
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,900
There's the little matter.

616
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,370
Of a previous drink
for the lady.

617
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,360
Lester, pay the man, will you?

618
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,859
Here you are, honey.

619
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Here's looking at it.

620
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,369
Happy times.

621
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,375
Where did you say
you are you from, Lester?

622
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:34,369
Hartford, Connecticut.

623
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,869
Oh, a real blue blood.

624
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,869
You know, this cat
can even speak French.

625
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,870
No kidding? Yeah.

626
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,879
Say something in French, Lester.

627
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,385
Oh, I only know a few words.

628
00:26:42,386 --> 00:26:43,879
I bet they're the right ones.

629
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,379
Yeah, but like I was saying...

630
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,880
yes, what were you saying,
Danny?

631
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
About the big plan.

632
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,889
You're gonna go back to hackin'.

633
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,090
That's only half of it, honey.

634
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,900
You know
how it is in the Navy, honey.

635
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,889
You get pushed around
from pillar to post.

636
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,889
I figure now that I'm out,
what I need is an anchor.

637
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
Around your neck.

638
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,399
Ha-ha-ha, funny. Funny, funny.

639
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
I know what you think,
you think like everybody else,

640
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,899
you think that all I do
is hang in joints like this

641
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,830
with broads, and boozin',
and lovin', don't you?

642
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,410
Mmm-hmm.

643
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,409
That's only part of it.-

644
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,420
the side that wants a home
with someone in it.

645
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,409
Someone you come home to after a
hard day's hackin' and say...

646
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,909
"hack me a hunk of steak."

647
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,910
what do you mean?

648
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,419
She means you're
lookin' for a cook.

649
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,925
What're you tryin' to do?
Louse this thing up?

650
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,920
What "thing"?
What are you leading up to?

651
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,419
Look, I'll give it
to you straight, baby.

652
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,420
A home without a woman in it
is just a pile of cold bricks.

653
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,440
Now what do you say me
and you get together, huh?

654
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,450
Are you asking me
to marry you, Danny?

655
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,940
Well, something like that.

656
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,449
What's something like marriage?

657
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,455
It's practically the same thing.

658
00:27:52,456 --> 00:27:53,949
What's the same thing?

659
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,449
Look, honey, havin' a preacher
say a few words over you,

660
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,950
and gmng him $2,
anybody can do this.

661
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,959
Let's me and you
be different, huh?

662
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,470
How different?

663
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,959
Well, look, honey, take on
the islands, for instance.

664
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,959
Lester will bear this out.

665
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
When a cat meets a chick
and they dig each other,

666
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,975
they put a coconut
in middle of the ground,

667
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,969
a guy comes along
with a knife and goes, Chuck.

668
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,470
And like that, they're married.

669
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,990
Did you bring any coconuts
in that bag, Danny?

670
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,479
Why don't you marry her, Danny?

671
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,979
Lester, the talking lamp is out.

672
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,979
Take it easy, Danny.
I was only putting you on.

673
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,480
You said it so funny,
you gave me goose pimples.

674
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,000
You shouldn't
scare me like that.

675
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,989
What's wrong with you?
Have you gone nuts?

676
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,150
Sure I'm nuts. So are you nuts.
The whole world's nuts.

677
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,490
Come on, Lester, let's dance.

678
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,499
Oh, I can't dance.

679
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,499
What's the matter?
You got goose pimples, too?

680
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,510
No, I just can't dance.

681
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,999
Oh, sure you can dance.

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,499
I sure wish I could.

683
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,999
I know you can dance
if you want to.

684
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,510
Lester.

685
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,530
Break it up.

686
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Break it up. Break it up!

687
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,040
No dancing allowed. Besides, there are
those who would like to go to bed.

688
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,049
Hey, you know,
that ain't a bad idea, baby.

689
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,130
Hey, what do you say, papa?

690
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,049
Hey, what do you say
about that, huh?

691
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,049
But we haven't finished dancing yet.
Don't close up.

692
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,049
Come on, Lester,
buy us another round.

693
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,050
Yeah, and smile, Lester.
Don't you want to be happy?

694
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,565
Lester doesn't know whether he
wants to be happy or good.

695
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:44,560
But we do, don't we, baby?
We sure do.

696
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,180
Well, here's looking at you.

697
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Yeah, happy times.

698
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,079
Noah.

699
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Well, what's with you?

700
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,089
What can I do for you?

701
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,600
Anna, I came up to see you
and to talk to you.

702
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,589
You handed me enough
to last me a lifetime.

703
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,590
You're on my territory now.

704
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,099
I don't have to take anything
from you here, so beat it!

705
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,099
Hey, who is this old guy?

706
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,599
Boys, you've got strong nerves.

707
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,599
Meet my old man.

708
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
What's on your mind, pop?

709
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,609
I'd like to
talk to my daughter alone.

710
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,109
Let's go, Danny.

711
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,609
No, don't go. Stick around.

712
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,609
Well, you can't refuse
to talk to your father.

713
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,610
Who says I can't? It's a
free country, ain't it?

714
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,110
He told me what he thought of
me when he kicked me out.

715
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,130
I'm here to ask you to forget all
that and to come home with me.

716
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,119
Why the change of heart, pa?

717
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,889
You think I'm loaded
with loot or something?

718
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,459
Don't talk that way
to your father.

719
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,959
Who says she can't?

720
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,959
What are you butting in for?
We still have free speech.

721
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,959
It isn't only me
that wants you home.

722
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,460
It's the whole family.

723
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,480
There ain't nothing wrong
with ma, is there?

724
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:05,470
Anything wrong?
No. No, she's well.

725
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,479
It's just that
she wants to see you real bad.

726
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,490
Won't you come home with me?

727
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,979
I can't.

728
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
Why?

729
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,990
Why the hell do you think?

730
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,989
Why are you
buggin' her, old man?

731
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,990
Can't you see you're
getting her all upset?

732
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,499
Now, you just keep
out of this, sailor.

733
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,505
This is none of your business.
Who says so?

734
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:31,999
I know what she's thinkin'.

735
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,499
And so would you,
if you'd use a little sense.

736
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
She don't
belong at home no more.

737
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,509
You should've thought of that
before you kicked her out.

738
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,509
What right have
you to say that, Danny?

739
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,009
She belongs at home
if they want her.

740
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,509
Have you anything
better to offer?

741
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,009
Will you quit buttin' in?

742
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,010
At least Lester ain't
depending on papa agoue.

743
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,525
If you want the advice of your number
one gin peddler, Anna, you'll go.

744
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,519
At least it'll give you
time to think.

745
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,019
Who wants to
spend a lifetime thinkin'?

746
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,519
You might try it for 5 minutes!

747
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Anna, I have a bus ticket
for you here in my pocket.

748
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,540
Won't you come home with me?

749
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,029
Stanley married one of them
foster girls, didn't he?

750
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,530
Katie, she's a nice girl.
You'll like her, Anna.

751
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,539
I guess mama still makes spoon
bread and peach cobbler.

752
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,040
And she sure keeps the linen
nice and fresh.

753
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,550
Won't you come home with me?

754
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,069
Well,

755
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,070
what have I got to lose?

756
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,069
Nothing but your mind
from boredom.

757
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,570
At least it's 3 squares
and a place to flop.

758
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,579
You can have them with me, baby.

759
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,585
I was many months
without them, Danny,

760
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:52,080
while you were
riding the billows.

761
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,579
Can we go up and get
your things now, Anna?

762
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Take it easy, pa.
I've got them all on.

763
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,100
I'll think about you, Noah,
whenever I get thirsty.

764
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:01,589
Yeah, you do that,

765
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,589
and you send me a postcard, you
know, like "'x' marks my window."

766
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,090
will you frame it, Danny?

767
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
I'll tear it up.

768
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,599
Good hackin', kid.

769
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,599
And take care of Lester,
will you?

770
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Let him bring out
your finer qualities.

771
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,619
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, bigmouth.

772
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,130
You loused up my whole evening.

773
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,119
She wasn't
thinking about an evening.

774
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,119
She was offering
you a whole lifetime.

775
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Oh, Lester, boy, how did
you ever get in the Navy?

776
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,010
Well, I see you bought the car.

777
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,009
Not exactly, Frank.

778
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,009
I got it on a 7-day trial.

779
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,010
Well, not too big,
not too small.

780
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
I approve.

781
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,029
How do you like it?

782
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,540
You still sell the same junk.

783
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,530
Hey, Frank, come on.
We'll be late.

784
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,530
Oh! Stanley, it's beautiful.

785
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,539
Can we use it to pick up Rudolf?

786
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,050
It ain't exactly mine just yet.

787
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:24,539
Get in.

788
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,540
It will be by the time we get
Rudolf back to this house.

789
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,540
♪ Oh, you better mind ♪

790
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,560
♪ You better mind ♪

791
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,049
♪ You've got to give
an account at the judgment ♪

792
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,049
♪ You better mind ♪

793
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,550
♪ You better mind how you talk ♪

794
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
♪ You better mind ♪

795
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,860
Ma, do you think
that sign of Frank's is gonna

796
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,059
inspire Rudolf's confidence
in this family?

797
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,559
I think it's a very pretty sign,

798
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,069
Excepting I believe he would've
inspired more confidence

799
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,110
had he painted George
Washington's picture up there.

800
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,569
You feel pretty
good today, aren't you, ma?

801
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,070
Oh, with Anna back again,

802
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,079
I got a feelin' everything's
gonna be good for everybody.

803
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,585
Ma, I think I'll quit my job and
go into business with Frank.

804
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,579
Whatever makes you happy, son.

805
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,080
Then I guess I better look
for a steady job tomorrow.

806
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,600
I thought you two was the happiest
couple in the neighborhood.

807
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:15,589
She's always pickin' on me.
I can't do anything right.

808
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,670
Oh, it's not him alone, ma.

809
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,090
He's following Frank
and Stella's lead, as usual.

810
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,099
What about?

811
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,599
You know what they're
planning to do

812
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,605
as soon as they get
Rudolf into this house.

813
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:25,599
Well, we all.-

814
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,099
that Rudolf will like Anna
and she'll like him.

815
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,420
You're for Anna,
ain't you, Katie?

816
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,609
You act as though you like her.

817
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,609
Of course I do.

818
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,609
She's an intelligent and attractive
girl and very considerate.

819
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,609
But I'm not going to be
mixed up in any scheme

820
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,110
to use her
for other people's gain.

821
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
You talking to me, Katie?
No, she's slammin' me,

822
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,130
because I think
like Frank and Stella,

823
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:46,119
that if we make Anna respectable by
marrying her to this country hick,

824
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,619
we certainly rate a few of
the potatoes he's carrying.

825
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Well, Katie, if they get married, I'm
sure they'd both want to help out.

826
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,640
You ain't suggested that
to her, have you, ma?

827
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,129
Of course not.

828
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,629
I'm waitin' to see if Rudolf's
good enough for Anna.

829
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,630
You just live in the clouds,
don't you, ma?

830
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,145
I feel like I was in heaven
ever since Anna come home.

831
00:36:03,146 --> 00:36:05,139
So good just to hear her voice,

832
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
even though she
does say frisky things.

833
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,140
She made me laugh fit to bust
the other night in bed,

834
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,655
telling me all
about them funny people

835
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:14,649
she waited on in that
restaurant in San Diego.

836
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,650
So that's what
she was slingin', eh, hash?

837
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,650
Yeah, Stanley,
that's how she lived.

838
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,159
I always knew
Anna was good at heart,

839
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,100
and wouldn't end in the gutter
because she made one slip.

840
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:28,159
Do you think
she only slipped once, ma?

841
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I know Anna's good.

842
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,675
Ain't nobody
can tell me different.

843
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:36,169
I know that the first night she
come home, cradled up in my arms,

844
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,669
and cried herself to sleep.

845
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,670
I knew her heart was just as
good and sweet as it was

846
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,690
when she was a little baby
in that same bed at my breast.

847
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:48,179
One time, she woke up, -

848
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,689
"is it rainin'?" And I said,
"yes, honey, it's rainin'."

849
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,689
she said, "that's nice."

850
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,690
went off to sleep again,
just like a little baby.

851
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,205
Joe, why ain't you down at the
station to help bring Rudolf?

852
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,199
I ain't got the heart
to meet him, Theresa.

853
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Glued to a stool
at Mike's saloon.

854
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,709
Yeah, that's right.

855
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,709
Now you keep sober
and tidy up a bit

856
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,950
to meet your best friend's boy.

857
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,209
Let me alone.

858
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,710
Come on, ma.
Let's get the dinner.

859
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,210
What's the matter, pa?

860
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,719
You're nervous
as an old dog with ticks.

861
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,725
The lord strikes down
them who mock their parents..

862
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:26,719
Don't bring me
that hymnbook hi-de-ho.

863
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,219
I'm too fast for that mess. Ah.

864
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,220
What's the matter, pa?

865
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,750
Stanley riding you
about your hymnbook?

866
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,229
Where did you get that?

867
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,229
Ma gave it to me.

868
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,729
I thought I'd read for myself your
gospel about dying and going to hell.

869
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,230
There's a whole lot in here
about heaven, too,

870
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,739
and how to get there.

871
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
I missed them.

872
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,739
"Beulah land."

873
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,740
my pappy and my grandpappy
used to sing.

874
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,250
And sing.

875
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,760
And sing.

876
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,750
♪ Beulah land ♪

877
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,770
♪ Walk in beulah land ♪

878
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,769
They used to sing and sing until they
didn't have a bit of breath left.

879
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,769
And no more gin.

880
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,769
Don't you call
my pappy a drunkard.

881
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,269
You, you heathen!

882
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,770
What's the matter, Stanley?

883
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,779
Why do you always
have to bring people down?

884
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,290
We just got pa to singing.

885
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,279
Come on, pa. Give out some more
of that <i>dwelling in beulah land.</i>

886
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,279
I forgot the tune.

887
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,779
But you were just singing it.

888
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
I forgot it, I told you.

889
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,289
Come on, Stanley, let's dance.

890
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,789
Not with my feet.

891
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,289
How about you and me, pa?

892
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,289
No. No.

893
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,300
You taught me how.

894
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Remember?

895
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,800
Let's dance, pa.

896
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,310
No, don't put your hands on me.

897
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,810
How dare you!
Have you gone crazy?

898
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
Pa!

899
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,169
♪ Beulah land ♪

900
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,170
♪ Beulah land ♪

901
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,690
Anna, would you like a cup
of coffee or something?

902
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,680
No, I-I'll wait for dinner.

903
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,695
You're putting on a mighty big
spread for that gentleman caller.

904
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:41,189
Well, it's the least we could do

905
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,690
for the son
of an old friend of pa's.

906
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,190
And Frank and Stella drive all
the way down to union station

907
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,199
to pick him up?

908
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,199
Simple courtesy.

909
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,199
That's a new word for it.

910
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,199
You shut up.

911
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,699
You're not going to shut me up.

912
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,699
Take it easy, Katie. I know
what Rudolf's coming for.

913
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,200
Ma told me.

914
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,209
They're not interested
in making you respectable.

915
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,720
They're just out to
get Rudolf's money.

916
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:01,209
Are you out of your mind?

917
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,709
Oh.

918
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,210
So the guy's got dough?

919
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,710
How much?

920
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,719
His father gave him...

921
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,219
$45.

922
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,719
$4,000.

923
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,219
Well, you can't do it, Anna.

924
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,220
You can't.

925
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,729
Why not?

926
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,240
Don't you want to see me
respectable, like Stanley says?

927
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:22,729
You'd only be
cheapening yourself.

928
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,730
Well, I'm not too
expensive anyway, Katie.

929
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:40,756
Where's Rudolf?

930
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,249
Yeah, where's Rudolf?

931
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,749
Did he come in? He came in.

932
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,250
What did you do with him?

933
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,759
Oh, I took him out and bought
him a couple of beers.

934
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,270
He got real drowsy.

935
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,759
Then I took him down to the
hotel and watched him unpack.

936
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,259
He's all set now
for a long night's sleep.

937
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Tomorrow morning, I'll go buy him
breakfast and take him to church.

938
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,775
Ain't he coming up to dinner?

939
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:01,269
No, he's not coming for dinner.

940
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,269
Say, what's the mystery?

941
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,269
You two been
cooking up something.

942
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,270
We've got to get a whole new
approach to this thing, Stanley.

943
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,800
This Rudolf ain't
all we bargained for.

944
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,279
What's the matter with him?

945
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,779
Plenty.

946
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,779
Our Rudolf graduated
from agricultural college.

947
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Graduated from college?

948
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,789
With honors.

949
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,789
With honors?

950
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,289
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

951
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,789
Yeah, that boy's daddy
sure done us a dirty trick.

952
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,789
We're still gonna marry him
off to Anna, aren't we?

953
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,289
Not a chance.
He's too clean-cut.

954
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,790
He'd see through her
in a minute.

955
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,799
Then how are we gonna
get the dough?

956
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,299
That's the problem.

957
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,299
Are you sure he's got it?

958
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,299
Oh, hell, yeah.

959
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,300
He's got a wallet in his breast pocket
there that makes him walk lopsided.

960
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,809
If only we hadn't listened
to ma about getting Anna.

961
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,815
We should have got tom's
daughter, like I said.

962
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:42,809
Listen, brainstorm,
Frank mentioned to rudolf

963
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,809
that Otis said he was
anxious to get married.

964
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,310
What do you think he said? What?

965
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,325
"Oh, that was pa's idea. I came
to California to get a job."

966
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:51,819
well, we got to
keep Rudolf away from Anna.

967
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,820
Can't have her disgracing us.
Mmm-mmm.

968
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm afraid
that won't be so easy.

969
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,329
Why?

970
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,829
Because now she's
hot after Rudolf's dough.

971
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,335
Who told her about the dough?

972
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:01,329
You big blabbermouth!

973
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,329
It was Katie, she gave
the whole thing away.

974
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,830
Look, can't I leave
you two alone for a minute?

975
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,839
The moment my back's turned,

976
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,339
some one of you
gums up the works.

977
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,839
Oh, ma, they're back.

978
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,839
Got to get a brand-new approach.

979
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,340
Yes, sir, I know
just what it's gonna be.

980
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,849
I'm gonna take
the investment approach.

981
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,360
Get him to invest his money
in something special.

982
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,849
I've got to approach him
through his interest.

983
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,849
What is Rudolf's interest?
Agriculture.

984
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,350
Mmm?

985
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Frank? Yeah.

986
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,859
Where's Rudolf?

987
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,859
Oh, uh,
he was all played out, ma.

988
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,859
That's a tough trip
from Alabama.

989
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
When are we gonna eat?

990
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,860
He was too tired to
come up to meet us all?

991
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,375
To meet Joe,
his father's oldest friend?

992
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:43,369
Well, uh, I explained to him that
Joe ain't been so strong lately,

993
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,870
and he agreed that
tomorrow would be soon enough.

994
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
When are we gonna eat?

995
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,879
I never was so disappointed.

996
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,879
Got a real Southern
dinner for the boy.

997
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,379
I think he's acting careless.

998
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,880
I don't think he's showing
the proper respect.

999
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,389
Well, you're right there, ma.

1000
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,889
He ain't showing respect.
But then...

1001
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,895
well, you know
these Southern hayseeds.

1002
00:43:00,896 --> 00:43:02,889
Did you tell him
we were expectin' him?

1003
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,389
I sure did.

1004
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,390
But what can you do
when a guy is all tired out

1005
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,399
and don't want nothing but bed?

1006
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,910
He was sure worn out,
wasn't he, stell?

1007
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,399
Could scarcely walk.

1008
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,230
Someone's at the front door.

1009
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,740
See who it is, Stanley.

1010
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,249
Oh, Frank, I think it's Rudolf.

1011
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,250
Well, let the boy in, Stanley.

1012
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,750
Won't you come in?

1013
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,259
We's all mighty
glad to see you, Rudolf.

1014
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,259
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

1015
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,259
I would have
knowed you anywhere.

1016
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,260
Why, he's the spittin' image of
his pappy when he was his age,

1017
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,280
so neat and good-looking.

1018
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,269
Now, Mrs. lucasta, you're
gonna get me all fussed.

1019
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,769
Oh, you mustn't feel like that.

1020
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,270
Got to make yourself at home,

1021
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,285
and let me treat you like
I would my own son Stanley.

1022
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:57,780
It ain't right what Frank said,

1023
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,779
that you're too tired
to eat, is it?

1024
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,779
Too tired?

1025
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,779
Uh-huh..

1026
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Oh, no, ma'am,
I'm never too tired to eat.

1027
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,300
That's the way I like
to hear my sons talk.

1028
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:07,289
I'm Katie.

1029
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,789
Oh, hi, Katie. How are you?

1030
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,789
Excuse me. I have to
get back to the kitchen.

1031
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,289
Come on in and sit down, Rudolf.

1032
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,530
Make yourself at home. Come on.

1033
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,799
Thanks, Frank.

1034
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,299
Uh, where's Anna?

1035
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,799
Keep her up there.

1036
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,799
Well, Rudolf.

1037
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting dinner, Frank?

1038
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,309
But I just didn't feel right not
coming over to pay my respects.

1039
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,815
Oh, think nothing of it.

1040
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,310
Have a shot? I mean, a drink?

1041
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,930
No, thanks. I still feel those
2 beers I had with you.

1042
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,819
Well, it takes a wise man
to know his own limitations.

1043
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,325
That's a good paraphrase
of socrates, Frank.

1044
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,819
Socrates? Oh, yeah,
socrates. Sure.

1045
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,319
I had to read him in college.

1046
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,820
Uh, say, have a cigar, eh?

1047
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,329
Uh, no, thanks.

1048
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,829
No? But if you don't mind...

1049
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,840
oh, go right ahead.
Help yourself.

1050
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:49,829
Thank you.

1051
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,830
Say, Rudolf, uh, what did they teach
you in that agricultural college?

1052
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,839
Most anything I wanted to learn.

1053
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,339
Things like plowing
and hoeing, I suppose, huh?

1054
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,339
Plowing and hoeing? I knew all
about that when I was 10.

1055
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,339
You did, eh?

1056
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,360
Well, of course, I suppose there's
always, uh, new inventions,

1057
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:09,349
oh, like mechanical plows and
mechanical hoes, uh, electric...

1058
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,849
well, ever heard
of a tractor, Frank?

1059
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,850
A trac... oh, tractors,
sure. Oh, my, yes.

1060
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,859
A tractor.

1061
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,859
Yeah, you know, I was talking
with a guy the other day.

1062
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,859
Smart fellow he was, too.

1063
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,360
And, uh, he had a brand-new
approach to these, uh, tractors.

1064
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,380
What was his name?

1065
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,869
His name?

1066
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:32,369
Oh... oh, well, you see, uh, he was
just an inventor. You understand.

1067
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,870
They like to keep these
things secret, you see?

1068
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,890
Nobody's gonna steal his name.

1069
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,380
Uh, no, I... i suppose not.

1070
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,879
Well, uh,

1071
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
let's see.
What was his name? He, uh,

1072
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,389
not mccormick?

1073
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,389
No, no, no.

1074
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,389
Uh, it wasn't deere, was it?

1075
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,390
Deere?

1076
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,390
How do you spell that?

1077
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:52,890
D-e-e-r-e.

1078
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,399
That sounds like it.

1079
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,410
Yeah, that's what it was,
Mr. deere. I remember now.

1080
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:00,399
He ought to know.

1081
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,900
Along with mccormick, he's the biggest
manufacturer of tractors in the world..

1082
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,409
He... uh,

1083
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,420
oh, well,
no, that wasn't the man.

1084
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,409
Uh, you... you see,
this was just an inventor.

1085
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,409
You understand?
A private inventor.

1086
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,910
Oh.

1087
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,419
Well, pa taught me
one thing real early.

1088
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,425
Keep away from new inventions
until they're foolproof.

1089
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:20,750
Pa made his money with the
old-fashioned plow and hoe.

1090
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,270
Yeah.

1091
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,260
Boy, your old man
is a character.

1092
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,270
Mmm, yeah.

1093
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,770
Well,.

1094
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,770
Uh, Rudolf, what is your, uh, special
agricultural interest, son?

1095
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,779
Well, Frank, I'm interested
in everything that goes into

1096
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,279
and comes out of the earth.
Uh-huh.

1097
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,289
But in college, I... i did some special
kind of work with fertilizers.

1098
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,789
Yea...

1099
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,289
fertilizers?

1100
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,789
That's just plain ordinary...

1101
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,790
that ain't nothing but manure.

1102
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,299
You ought to know
someone in that, Frank.

1103
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,799
Pretzels, Rudolf?

1104
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,300
Thank you, Stella.

1105
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,820
Isn't anybody
going to introduce us?

1106
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Oh, uh, that...
That's... that's Anna.

1107
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,840
How do you do, Anna?
Y-you a neighbor?

1108
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,329
A neighbor?

1109
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,830
Oh, did I forget
to mention I had a sister?

1110
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,839
I've been away
for such a long time,

1111
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,350
they've hardly
got accustomed to me.

1112
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,339
Shouldn't take long
to get accustomed to you.

1113
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,339
It don't, as a rule..

1114
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,840
Say, Rudolf, uh, how would you
like me to take you around

1115
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,010
and explain to you about all
these antiques I got here?

1116
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,349
Oh, I-I'd like to, Frank.

1117
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,349
Good, come along.

1118
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,350
Later?

1119
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,850
Oh. Well.

1120
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,870
Where have you been lmng?

1121
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,520
There's something about the
sea that I've always liked.

1122
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,359
Have you ever been to San Diego?

1123
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
No, that's the large
naval base, isn't it?

1124
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,369
Mmm-hmm.

1125
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,369
Lifeblood of the whole town,

1126
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,869
the Navy
and the merchant marine.

1127
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,870
What... what did you
do in San Diego?

1128
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,379
Uh...

1129
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,380
Well, wasn't that ma I heard
calling us to dinner?

1130
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,889
I didn't hear anybody.

1131
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,400
Uh, well, I'll go hurry her up.

1132
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,890
What did you say
you did in San Diego?

1133
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
Well, I didn't go to college.

1134
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,899
Stanley says you graduated.

1135
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,900
Yeah, just last month.

1136
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,909
That's a good-looking
ring you're wearing.

1137
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,915
Keepsake from some
college girl, I'll bet.

1138
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,409
Oh, no, no, no,
that's my fraternity ring.

1139
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,910
Yes, that is an expensive hunk
of jewelry you've got there.

1140
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,925
Got to be careful with your
valuables in this town.

1141
00:49:03,926 --> 00:49:06,419
I wouldn't carry
too much cash around with me.

1142
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,419
Yeah.

1143
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,189
We've got some bad
people in California.

1144
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,259
Say, how'd you like to get a couple
of beers before dinner, Rudolf?

1145
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,759
Come on, let's go have one, huh?

1146
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,260
Oh, no, thanks. I feel fine.

1147
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,769
You do? What the hell...

1148
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,270
just fine..

1149
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,279
Uh, except that it... it is a
little warm in here, isn't it?

1150
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,779
Why don't you
take your coat off?

1151
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,279
I-I-if you don't mind.

1152
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
Be real casual.

1153
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,300
Thank you.

1154
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,790
What you totin'? A gun?

1155
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,290
No, that's my wallet.

1156
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,810
Say, Rudolf, I recently came into
possession of a burglar-proof safe.

1157
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:52,799
I can take this and...

1158
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,300
put it in the bank.

1159
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
Yeah, I plan to
deposit it tomorrow.

1160
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,320
I'll take you down to my bank,
introduce you to the manager.

1161
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,810
Oh, that's Joe.

1162
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,319
I guess you remember,
I told you,

1163
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,330
he wasn't
very strong these days.

1164
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,829
Hello, Mr. lucasta.

1165
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,335
I'm awful glad to meet you.

1166
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:21,829
I've heard about you
all my life.

1167
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,329
Otis.

1168
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,830
No, I'm Otis' son, Rudolf..

1169
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,340
Rudolf?

1170
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,339
Rudolf.

1171
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,340
Well, how's my old friend, Otis?

1172
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Oh, pa's just fine, Mr. lucasta.

1173
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,849
He... he sends you
his very best wishes.

1174
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,350
Otis told me
to get you a good wife.

1175
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,849
So Frank said. That's like pa.

1176
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,350
He... he still think
I'm in short pants.

1177
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,865
You wanna watch out
for the women, son.

1178
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:51,859
Oh, sure.

1179
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,859
And the wine..

1180
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,860
If one don't get you,
the other one will.

1181
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,869
Watch out for your money..

1182
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,880
Don't let nobody get hold of it.

1183
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,369
No, sir.

1184
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,870
You better put it...

1185
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,870
you better...

1186
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,879
you better put it down, Joe.

1187
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,879
Come on now, sit down.

1188
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,879
Let me go!

1189
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,380
Can't you see I'm talking
to my old friend Otis?

1190
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,380
Well, it's too
bad he can't hear you..

1191
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,889
He's a thousand Miles away.

1192
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,889
That's Otis. That's Rudolf.

1193
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:20,889
You let me alone.

1194
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,890
I'm telling you, I'll fight you!

1195
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,889
Just take it easy, Joe.

1196
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,390
Let me go!

1197
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,899
Leave him alone, Frank.

1198
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,399
Pa, would you like to
have a cup of coffee?

1199
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,399
You. Don't you talk to me.

1200
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,900
You get away from me,
or I'll slap you...

1201
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,420
Stanley! Yeah?

1202
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:41,910
Come here.

1203
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:44,409
Let's go.

1204
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,910
You'll have to
excuse Joe, Rudolf.

1205
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,419
He has a psychological problem.

1206
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,419
Yeah.

1207
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,460
He just can't seem to
find the bottom of the bottle.

1208
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,660
I never considered myself much
of a dancer till tonight.

1209
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,959
It must be you. Was that
the mambo we were doing?

1210
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,959
Ha. How do you like that!

1211
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
I can do the mambo
and never had a lesson.

1212
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,050
Where'd you like to go now?

1213
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,980
I'd like to go home..

1214
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,110
I... i haven't had as much
fun in my whole life,

1215
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,609
as I've had
this past week with you.

1216
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,609
The night's gone so fast, I... i didn't
realize it's past... past 1:00 already.

1217
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,109
Is it really?

1218
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,610
You sound tired. Are you?

1219
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,619
A little.

1220
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,119
Oh, I'm sorry, honey..

1221
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,625
I... i kept you out late
every single night, haven't I?

1222
00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:01,119
To you, I guess all
these places are familiar.

1223
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,120
But me, I've been having a ball.

1224
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,129
It's good to be with you, Anna.

1225
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,640
Gosh, I never thought I'd be lucky
enough to run into anybody like you.

1226
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:10,129
I'm glad
you enjoyed your vacation.

1227
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,130
Vacation? I've come
to California to stay.

1228
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,130
I've got my eyes
on a job already.

1229
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,139
Where?

1230
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,145
Valley junior college.
I sent my credentials..

1231
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:18,639
I-I'm just waiting to hear now.

1232
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,140
But I thought
you wanted to farm.

1233
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,639
Modern farming.

1234
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,140
Oh!

1235
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,660
You know, it's a mystery to me how you
ever got yourself into that dress.

1236
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:30,649
It looks like
you were poured into it.

1237
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,150
Now, what do you mean by that?

1238
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,150
Have I said anything wrong?

1239
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,665
Well, it isn't necessary to tell a
girl how she fills out a dress.

1240
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,659
Well, I haven't said anything
I wouldn't to my own sisters,

1241
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,159
and they never took offense.

1242
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,160
Well, I guess it's probably
just my dirty mind.

1243
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,675
Don't say that about yourself.

1244
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:48,169
You're just a little prudish,

1245
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,669
and I like it.

1246
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,169
Have it your way, brother.

1247
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,170
Then we can be friends?

1248
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,180
That shouldn't be difficult.

1249
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,679
Gee, your hands are soft.

1250
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,680
Soft and cool,
like... like... like topsoil.

1251
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,189
Rudolf, what are you?
Just a college cutup?

1252
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,700
Well, if that's
the way I strike you,

1253
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:09,190
sure, I'm just a college cutup.

1254
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,189
Well, you can't be serious, telling
me that my hands are like topsoil.

1255
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,690
You make it sound silly, and
makes me out a plain ass.

1256
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,705
Well, I didn't
mean it that way. It's...

1257
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:18,199
well, you're such a funny kid.

1258
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,699
I never met
anybody like you before.

1259
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,199
Well, I never met anyone like you.
I sure never did.

1260
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,200
You seem to be
looking right through people,

1261
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,209
and reading their thoughts.

1262
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,709
According to you, I don't
always read them right.

1263
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,709
Oh, I think that's because
you don't trust people.

1264
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,709
Someone must have hurt you.

1265
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,210
More than one, brother.

1266
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,730
Why... why should anyone
want to hurt you?

1267
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,720
Let's go.

1268
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,239
Here. It's getting
a little cool.

1269
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,740
Thanks.

1270
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,239
I been talking with your mother.

1271
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
She seems worried about you.

1272
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,749
Why?

1273
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,755
She's afraid
you might leave home again.

1274
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:09,250
I didn't intend
to stay this long.

1275
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,749
Then you haven't found me
altogether unattractive?

1276
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,749
I like you.

1277
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,250
That's a beginning.

1278
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,760
That's where it ends.

1279
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,260
All week long, I thought we were
getting to know each other

1280
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,260
a little better every day.

1281
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,269
Even if we didn't talk,
I felt it,

1282
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,775
that we were beginning to mean
something to each other.

1283
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:33,770
Then, back on the dance floor, while I
was holding you close in my arms,

1284
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,280
I knew I suddenly lost you.

1285
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,780
What is it, Anna?
Please tell me.

1286
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,799
When I was little,
pa was real good to me.

1287
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,805
He changed when the boys started
walking me home from school.

1288
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:02,299
One of them, Charley, was a
good dancer, so pa hated him.

1289
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,300
So he made us break up
the night of the school prom.

1290
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:09,315
I left the house after dinner and
came over here to this park.

1291
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:13,310
I had a feeling Charley would
come here, too, and he did.

1292
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,820
We sat on this bench
holding hands.

1293
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,320
There wasn't much
we could say to each other.

1294
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,820
And then pa came tearing into
the park like a maniac,

1295
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,329
calling me
every name under the sun.

1296
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,930
He took hold of Charley
and hit him hard.

1297
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,329
Then he took hold of me..

1298
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,830
I...

1299
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:36,330
I've never seen a look like
that on a man's face before.

1300
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,350
He... he dragged me back to the
house, forced me to pack my bag,

1301
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,839
took me down to the bus
station, gave me $20,

1302
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
and told me
never to come home again.

1303
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,360
I don't remember
buying a ticket to anyplace.

1304
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:50,349
I was crying so hard.

1305
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,350
I just remember
getting off in San Diego,

1306
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,870
not knowing how to go about
finding myself a place to stay.

1307
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,860
Well, the fleet was in and a
friendly sailor picked me up.

1308
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,880
He took me to dinner,
stole my $20,

1309
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,870
and that's the last act of
human kindness I experienced.

1310
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,269
I'm not cold anymore.

1311
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,269
The wind must have changed.

1312
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,769
Don't go in yet.

1313
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,269
You'll miss your bus.

1314
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,269
I can't leave you like this.

1315
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,770
I'm sorry I spoiled
the evening for you.

1316
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,279
You didn't.

1317
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,790
I'm glad you told me
the things you did.

1318
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,780
It made you seem closer to me.

1319
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,320
That's not why I told you.

1320
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,280
I know.

1321
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,790
You want to be honest with me.

1322
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,789
Well, I'll be honest
with you, Anna.

1323
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,290
I love you.
I want you to be my wife.

1324
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,310
Look, you don't like this town,
we don't have to live here.

1325
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:27,800
Well, we can go back home.
I can teach there.

1326
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,800
We can go anywhere,
as long as you're with me.

1327
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,820
Hallelujah!

1328
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,819
Hallelujah!

1329
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,819
Don't say nothing, honey.

1330
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,820
Just let me hug you.

1331
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,335
And God bless you
for loving my Anna.

1332
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:53,329
Don't be a fool, ma.

1333
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,829
Don't make
something out of nothing.

1334
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,829
You can't tell me,
honey, you don't love him.

1335
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,329
I saw the way
you was kissing him.

1336
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,330
I learned how to
kiss a long time ago.

1337
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,839
But don't you love me, Anna?

1338
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,845
Even a little bit?

1339
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:04,840
Sure I love you,
more than a little.

1340
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,339
But not enough to marry you.

1341
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,339
Honey, you told me
the other night in bed,

1342
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,340
you'd get married
if the right man came along.

1343
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,849
People say
funny things in bed, ma.

1344
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,349
But I know you meant that, Anna.
You wasn't being funny.

1345
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,849
Whoever heard of
such a crazy thing?

1346
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,349
A guy walks into your house
and says hello,

1347
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,850
and the next thing you know, you're
marrying him off to your daughter.

1348
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,865
Nobody's marrying me
off to anybody I don't want.

1349
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:27,859
And it don't take 10 days to fall
in love, it takes only 10 seconds.

1350
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,860
I knew that
the minute I saw your face.

1351
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,875
But everybody
isn't like you, Rudolf,

1352
00:59:32,876 --> 00:59:35,370
with nothing but goodness in
them to show in their faces.

1353
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:36,869
I know you're good, Anna.

1354
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,369
She is good..

1355
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,370
Can't you see
what's happening, Anna?

1356
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,385
God has sent this lovely boy
into our home just for you.

1357
00:59:43,386 --> 00:59:45,379
He's sent him
in answer to prayers,

1358
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,380
'cause you never had
a fair chance.

1359
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,880
And the boy's fell in love
with you from the start.

1360
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,389
That's God's doing, too..

1361
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,895
God's gmng you your chance
for love and happiness.

1362
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:57,889
You ain't gonna break his heart
and Rudolf's, too, are you?

1363
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,390
God can stand anything, ma,
but Rudolf ain't so husky.

1364
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,410
Oh, come on. Stop fightin'
me, will you, Anna?

1365
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,900
Are you deaf, dumb, and blind?

1366
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,409
Didn't you hear anything
I told you in the park?

1367
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:14,409
I heard what you said.
Every word.

1368
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,910
And it makes no difference.

1369
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,910
What are you gonna do
with a guy like this?

1370
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,430
Love him, child,
and make him happy.

1371
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,419
Well, your ma's got
the right idea.

1372
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,420
Now come on, knock that
chip off your shoulder.

1373
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,940
Say you'll marry me.

1374
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,940
At your own risk, Rudolf.

1375
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,950
I'll take it.

1376
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,949
What the hell's goin' on here?

1377
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,070
They're going to be married.

1378
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,459
Who? Anna and Rudolf?

1379
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,959
Who do you think?

1380
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,470
Well, what do you know!
Congratulations, Anna..

1381
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:06,959
Congratulations.

1382
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,459
Thank you, Stella.

1383
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,460
Ma, it looks like we're
gonna lose our little Anna again..

1384
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,980
You may kiss
your brother-in-law, stell.

1385
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,469
All right, all right.

1386
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,470
What do you want to do? Give the
impression our women are loose?

1387
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,485
Where you kids
gonna spend your honeymoon?

1388
01:01:22,486 --> 01:01:24,479
Where Anna wants to.

1389
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,979
I know a nice little
place in San Francisco.

1390
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,479
How would you know?

1391
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,840
You've never been
to San Francisco.

1392
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:29,989
A fellow told me about it.

1393
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,989
Come on, let's
everyone come inside.

1394
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,500
And have a drink to celebrate.

1395
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:36,489
I don't know if
I've ever been so happy.

Frank, run upstairs
and tell katie

1401
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,019
to give you the bride and groom.

1402
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,025
The bride and groom?

1403
01:02:03,026 --> 01:02:05,019
Yes, she'll find them
underneath my bed.

1404
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,519
Hey, ma, lay off the liquor
until after the weddin'..

1405
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,020
Anna's upstairs dressin', Rudolf's
down at the hotel waiting.

1406
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,029
They're not underneath any bed.

1407
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,040
I'm talking about the little bride and
groom that goes on top of the cake.

1408
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,530
Why didn't you say so?
Hey, Katie.

1409
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,030
Katie? Yes?

1410
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,039
Get the bride and groom
from under ma's bed.

1411
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,545
They're in a cardboard box.

1412
01:02:23,546 --> 01:02:24,546
In a cardboard box.

1413
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,039
All right..

1414
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,539
Never can understand
a woman's brain.

1415
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,540
If they don't want to
understand somethin',

1416
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,555
nothin' on God's green earth
will make them.

1417
01:02:32,556 --> 01:02:35,550
Just tell them there's a bride and
groom in a box under a bed,

1418
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,549
they know exactly what you mean.

1419
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:42,050
That's easy, Frank. Women just
play dumb, men are born that way.

1420
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,059
Oh, how do you feel, Joe?

1421
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,059
I thought you was too sick
to get out of bed, Joe.

1422
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,559
I feel a little better.

1423
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,060
Joe, you've come to yourself.

1424
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:52,069
Maybe you'll change your mind
and take Anna up the aisle.

1425
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,075
No, Theresa, I ain't
never gonna feel that good.

1426
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:56,069
You go on back to bed
and stay there.

1427
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,069
I come and go as I please.

1428
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,070
Right now, I'm pleased to look
at your weddin' preparations.

1429
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,085
All set for an orgy, ain't you?

1430
01:03:04,086 --> 01:03:06,579
If you've got it in your head
you're comin' down to church

1431
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,080
and raise a lot of ruckus,
you better get it out.

1432
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,090
'Cause one peep out of you,
and I'll take you out

1433
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,089
and dunk your head in the sink.

1434
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,589
Don't talk crazy. Why would Joe
want to break up the weddin'?

1435
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:18,089
You wouldn't understand, ma.
You're too young and cute.

1436
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Frank, answer the door.

1437
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,105
I gotta get these funny-looking
things out of my hair.

1438
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:25,599
Oh, hey, ma. Uh-huh.

1439
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Put this away
in a safe place, will you?

1440
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,609
Rudolf, what are you doin' here?

1441
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,770
Waitin' around in that hotel
room just made me nervous.

1442
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,119
Is everything going all right?
Oh, sure.

1443
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,119
How's Anna?

1444
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,619
Just dancing with joy.

1445
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,619
Is she nervous?

1446
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,119
Well, nice and nervous,
you know.

1447
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,620
Well, where's Stanley?

1448
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,629
No, he wouldn't be in there.

1449
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,140
I sent him out
to get the car washed.

1450
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:54,629
He should've been back
an hour ago.

1451
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,629
What if he doesn't show up
on time?

1452
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:59,130
Well, then I'll act in the double
capacity as your best man.

1453
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,139
Be sure that everything
comes out all right.

1454
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,650
You got nothin' to worry about.

1455
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,655
Hello, Mr. lucasta. I hope
you're feelin' better today.

1456
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:15,149
I've been feelin' dizzy
all the morning, son.

1457
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,149
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry
to hear that.

1458
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,150
I got a wire from my father
this mornin'.

1459
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,659
He sends his best wishes
to everybody,

1460
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,165
and his special regards
to you, Mr. lucasta.

1461
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:25,659
Yeah, I can see your pa
drmng your ma

1462
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,659
to their wedding
in that old high cart,

1463
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,660
as though it was yesterday.

1464
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,669
Well, I hope Stanley
didn't have a flat tire.

1465
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,670
Oh, no,
the car's carryin' a spare.

1466
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,190
Matter of fact, that's the
only good tire on the car.

1467
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,180
Maybe I better give you the
ring and papers, just in case.

1468
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,690
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1469
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,189
Uh-huh.

1470
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,189
Rather small...
I mean, uh, little.

1471
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,689
Uh, that is, rather neat.

1472
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,190
It's not too expensive,
but excellent taste.

1473
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,199
License, huh?
Yeah, let's see, uh-huh.

1474
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,699
What is that? Oh.

1475
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,700
Say, you know,
these health certificates, uh,

1476
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,709
that's somethin' new
since I was married.

1477
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,209
Yeah. All nice and healthy.

1478
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,710
You're a healthy boy, all right.

1479
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,225
You know, I was talkin'
with a guy the other day.

1480
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:26,719
Smart fellow he was, too.
This is what he said.

1481
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,719
He said, "the trouble
with most modern marriages"

1482
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,720
is that they're all
contracted in ignorance."

1483
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,235
and he was right, too.
He was 100 percent right.

1484
01:05:33,236 --> 01:05:35,730
Yes, it's wonderful how many
ignorant people get married.

1485
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,730
Ain't it the truth!

1486
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,939
Katie, how's Anna, Katie?

1487
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,439
Just fine.

1488
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,945
Can I see her for a second?
No, it's bad luck.

1489
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:46,939
But I've got some
important news to tell her.

1490
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:47,940
I'll tell her.

1491
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,449
What is it?

1492
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,955
Valley junior college
has confirmed my appointment.

1493
01:05:52,956 --> 01:05:55,949
I just got a letter from
the... the head of the school.

1494
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,449
They want me to start teaching
in the fall term.

1495
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,450
That's wonderful, Rudolf. I hear
that's a very fine school.

1496
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,965
A real live Professor
in the lucasta family.

1497
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:05,460
Well, who'd have thought it?

1498
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,459
Anna will be so thrilled
when I tell her.

1499
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,959
Let me tell her. Right now,

1500
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
you've got to get out of here.

1501
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:14,480
Your bride will be down, and you
mustn't see her before church.

1502
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:16,969
Goodbye now, Rudolf.

1503
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,470
Oh, goodbye, Katie.

1504
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
Isn't Stanley back
with the car yet?

1505
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,479
Oh, I sent him down
to get it washed.

1506
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,480
He's probably taking a joyride.

1507
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,980
Guess I have to knock some
responsibility into that boy's head.

1508
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,000
I tell you, Katie, this day is
almost too much for a man to bear.

1509
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,019
Ma's cake would've
burned to a crisp,.

1510
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,220
If I didn't get a premonition
in the middle of the night

1511
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,520
to come down
and shut off the oven.

1512
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:14,035
Oh, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.
That's my middle name.

1513
01:07:14,036 --> 01:07:16,029
You're certainly
in the groove today, Frank.

1514
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,529
The preacher ought to let you
say a few words in church.

1515
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,530
Ain't that some bride?

1516
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,050
Now, who would think 2 women could
look so different in the same dress?

1517
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:25,039
When I wore it,
you looked different yourself.

1518
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,540
There was some sort of line to
show where your chest started.

1519
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,549
There's Stanley.

1520
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,050
Hey, ma. Step on it.

1521
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,049
All right, all right.

1522
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,550
Stella,
you sure do make pretty hats.

1523
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,559
But, ma, you got it on
upside down.

1524
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,059
Oh, who'd know the difference?

1525
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,059
Is it all right now?

1526
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,060
You look just lovely.

1527
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,569
My little baby.

1528
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,069
This is all I've been lmn' for.

1529
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,570
Mom, I love you.

1530
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,070
All right. Let's break it up
and get goin'. Come on.

1531
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,579
Come on, ma.

1532
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,579
Don't cry, mama, don't cry..

1533
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:11,080
Well, as the man said, "4 score
and quite a few years ago",

1534
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,600
our forefathers brought forth on
this continent a new nation..."

1535
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,119
May I help you?

1536
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,119
I came to see the Dean.

1537
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,619
Have you an appointment, sir?

1538
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,619
No, I don't have an appointment,
but I think he'll want to see me.

1539
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,620
May I ask what it's about?

1540
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,470
I have some information concerning
that teacher he's going to hire here.

1541
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,130
What's his name? Rudolf slocum.

1542
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,145
What are you laughin' about?

1543
01:09:04,146 --> 01:09:07,139
I thought Frank would never
give you the ring.

1544
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,140
He sure hated to part with it.

1545
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,160
How's that, Mrs. slocum?

1546
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,670
Couldn't be better..

1547
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,159
We've done it. We really
are traveling together.

1548
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,659
Let's get away quickly, shall we?
Let's not waste a minute.

1549
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,160
I have to go to the hotel,
check out, get my clothes.

1550
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,169
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

1551
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,675
But I don't want to wait
for that. Can't we go now?

1552
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:37,669
Your folks have gone to a lot of
trouble for the celebration.

1553
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,670
We should stay, wait until they
get back, and cut the cake.

1554
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,679
Sure, let's all sit down
and have a piece of cake.

1555
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,685
We're not gonna have
our first argument

1556
01:09:44,686 --> 01:09:46,679
just as soon as
we leave the church, are we?

1557
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,179
I don't have
an argument left in me.

1558
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,680
Oh, we're never going to.

1559
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,690
We're going to be happy
all our lives together.

1560
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,700
I'm sorry. I guess you're right.

1561
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,690
Of course I am.

1562
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,189
I'll be back before you miss me.

1563
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,190
Rudolf!

1564
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,699
Hold me. Hold me
tight enough to kill me.

1565
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,719
Hi. Anybody home?

1566
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,225
You're early. The guests
haven't started to arrive yet.

1567
01:10:24,226 --> 01:10:25,719
Mind if I wait inside?

1568
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,219
Yeah. Make yourself at home.

1569
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,720
Thanks.

1570
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:36,729
Hello, baby.

1571
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:38,229
Don't take your coat off.

1572
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,229
Why?

1573
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,230
You've got to
get out of here right away.

1574
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,739
What's goin' on here?

1575
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,750
And what are you dressed up
for, a fancy dress ball?

1576
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:46,739
I've just been married.

1577
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,240
Ah, come on, Anna.
Don't shake me up.

1578
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,749
Hey, it does look like
somebody's been married.

1579
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,755
It couldn't be you, could it?
Why not?

1580
01:10:53,756 --> 01:10:55,249
I just got this letter
you sent me.

1581
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,749
I beat it down here,
like you asked.

1582
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,750
Danny, I thought after 2 days here,
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

1583
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,580
That's when I sent you that
letter to come down and get me.

1584
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,080
But a lot has happened
since then.

1585
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,759
Oh, go on. You ain't married.

1586
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,760
Hey, wait a minute.

1587
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,760
Hey, who was that guy
that just left?

1588
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,270
My husband.

1589
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,270
Well, what do you know?
What do you know?

1590
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,770
Hey, what happened? Did that
funny old man of yours

1591
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,279
try to put somethin'
over on you?

1592
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,285
No, it's on the level, Danny,
and it's of my own doing.

1593
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:26,279
Who is this guy?
Where'd he come from?

1594
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,779
He's the swellest guy
I've ever met.

1595
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,780
When did you meet him?

1596
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,280
When I came home.

1597
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,289
What did he do?
Put somethin' in your drink?

1598
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,795
I don't know,
but I'm sure floatin'.

1599
01:11:33,796 --> 01:11:36,289
Ah, come on, baby. You're talking
to Danny Johnson, remember?

1600
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,289
Well, you're a swell guy,
too, Danny.

1601
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,790
Thanks a lot, but you don't
have to con me, Anna, ever.

1602
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,799
Come on, what's the gimmick?

1603
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,299
Is the heel loaded?

1604
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,569
I wouldn't care
if he didn't have a nickel.

1605
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,130
Oh, then he is loaded.

1606
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,650
That makes all the
difference in the world.

1607
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,639
What is this stuff?

1608
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,139
Look. Danny, you're a
good sport, aren't you?

1609
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,140
It all depends.
What's on your mind?

1610
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,660
Will you beat it? Will you get
out of here before he sees you?

1611
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,149
Are you ashamed of me?

1612
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,649
No. You know better than that.

1613
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,650
I'm in love with the guy.

1614
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,170
You used to tell me that,
too, baby.

1615
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,159
I didn't. I couldn't have. I...

1616
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,159
I didn't know
what it was until now.

1617
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,660
You sure made me feel like it
every time we came into port.

1618
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:20,669
Well, I was always glad
to see you, Danny.

1619
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,669
I even missed you when you
were... when you were away.

1620
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:25,669
But, we were 2 kids out to get our kicks.
To hell with tomorrow.

1621
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,670
That's the way to live.
What's your plan?

1622
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,185
Marry a guy who kisses you
goodbye at breakfast,

1623
01:12:30,186 --> 01:12:32,679
goes off to the office while you
stay at home baking pies,

1624
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,680
then he plays the fiddle to you?
That's horrible!

1625
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,179
Rudolf isn't a bit like that!

1626
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,680
Rudolf? You married
a guy named Rudolf?

1627
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:43,689
Anna, that's not a name.
That's a cigar.

1628
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,689
I'm sorry you don't like
his first name,

1629
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,190
because his last name is slocum.

1630
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,700
Rudolf slocum?

1631
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,699
He sounds like a farmer.

1632
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,200
That's what he is.

1633
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,709
Oh, no, I don't believe it..

1634
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:04,209
I... i just do not believe that
you would marry a farm...

1635
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:07,210
you know what I ought to do? I
ought to punch him in his mouth.

1636
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,219
In fact, that's what I'll do.

1637
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,225
I'll wait here,
when he walks in the door,

1638
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:13,219
I'll beat his brains out.
It's very simple.

1639
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,719
You're getting out of here.
Right now.

1640
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,219
And leave you with this farmer?

1641
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,720
Don't be silly.
He's not your kind.

1642
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,735
You'd go crazy in a week
without the lights and swing.

1643
01:13:20,736 --> 01:13:22,729
That's why I'm here.
That's what I'll give you.

1644
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,729
I'm through with it.
I don't want it anymore.

1645
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:27,730
You can't get away from it! Anybody
looking for it can see it in your eyes

1646
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,739
like I did the first flash
I got of you.

1647
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,250
You don't belong to one man.
You'll never belong to one man.

1648
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:33,739
You can't!

1649
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,740
Yes, I can.
I know I can. Damn you!

1650
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,240
I know what you're trying to do.

1651
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,749
You're trying to scare me!

1652
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,755
I'm trying to save you
a lot of grief, baby!

1653
01:13:40,756 --> 01:13:43,749
You and me, we're real people,
Anna. We're the real stuff.

1654
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,749
Many's the time
we set the earth on fire.

1655
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,750
You stick with me
and we'll burn it up!

1656
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,270
Are you... Are you finished?

1657
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,770
Yeah, I'm... I'm finished.

1658
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,280
Now will you leave?

1659
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,780
Yes, I'll leave.

1660
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,780
And please don't try
to see me anymore.

1661
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,780
I'll remember that.

1662
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:20,800
I'll remember that when you
come crawlin' back to me.

1663
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,789
When you do,
I'll probably take you back

1664
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,790
because I'm just about
as weak as you are.

1665
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,799
Oh, Anna...

1666
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,310
goodbye, Danny.

1667
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
This ain't goodbye, baby.

1668
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,809
How do you do?

1669
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,810
How do you do?

1670
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,809
Nice car you have outside there.

1671
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,810
Thanks a lot.

1672
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,819
Danny just came down
to offer his congratulations.

1673
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,830
Is that so? Yeah.

1674
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,819
Congratulations to you,
too, pop.

1675
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,819
You ought to be
a very happy man today.

1676
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,320
I've seen you someplace before.

1677
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:58,830
Yeah, in San Diego.

1678
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,835
Yes, you were the sailor that
was kissing her at the bar.

1679
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,329
Well, you know how it is, pop.

1680
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,829
What's a little kiss
between friends?

1681
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:06,830
Nothing. Nothing at all,
with folks like you.

1682
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,980
I'm sorry we don't have time for a sermon.
I've got to get dressed.

1683
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,839
And Danny's anxious
to be on his way.

1684
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,339
Beat it, Danny.

1685
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,609
You'd better hurry, daughter. You
don't want to keep Danny waiting.

1686
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,179
Uh, he's not waiting for me.

1687
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,679
Go ahead, Danny, beat it!

1688
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,180
You better wait, Danny.
She'll be needing someone.

1689
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,689
What for?

1690
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:28,700
To take you away.

1691
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:32,189
I'm drmng away from here in a few
minutes with... with my husband.

1692
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,690
You think so?

1693
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,199
You think he'll still want you
when he knows all about you?

1694
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,710
He does know!

1695
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,699
I told him everything, pa.

1696
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,699
I mean, everything.

1697
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,200
Honest..

1698
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:48,215
I... i tried to talk him out of it,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

1699
01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:50,209
I know it's hard for you
to believe that,

1700
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:52,209
because you despise me so.

1701
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:55,210
But it's true.

1702
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,225
Won't you please try to
let me make good now?

1703
01:15:58,226 --> 01:16:00,719
And if I mess it up,

1704
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,719
I won't bother anybody anymore.

1705
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,220
Nobody will ever see me again.

1706
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,729
I'll know what to do
and where to go.

1707
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,229
You're just what you are,

1708
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,730
and nothin' on God's green
earth will ever change you.

1709
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,239
Now wait a minute, pop.
Why so fast on the trigger?

1710
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,250
Besides, what's the
percentage in you bustin' up

1711
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:20,239
your little girl's wedding?

1712
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,240
Shut up, Danny. Pa, I've got
happiness in the palm of my hand.

1713
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,749
And if you mess it up,
I swear I'll kill you!

1714
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,249
And I don't care what happens because
there'll be nothing to live for.

1715
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,249
Baby, you don't have to.
If you want his mouth hushed,

1716
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,250
I'll fix it so Rudolf
won't understand a word.

1717
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,259
Rudolf don't have to
hear a word from me.

1718
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,759
I don't have to tell him.

1719
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,259
What have you got on your mind?

1720
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,760
Theresa told me
he was getting a job

1721
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,759
somewhere near here, teaching.

1722
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,260
He is. Is he?

1723
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,780
You got somethin' to say,
old man, you say it!

1724
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:49,770
I don't have to say it.

1725
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:51,770
It's been done.

1726
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,280
What's been done?

1727
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,779
I paid his Dean a visit.
We had a nice talk.

1728
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,780
He agreed
he shouldn't hire a teacher

1729
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:08,300
whose wife might teach his students
something they can't get from books.

1730
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,789
You crazy old idiot.

1731
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,290
You're not protecting him.

1732
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,299
You're destroying him!

1733
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,310
And wherever else
he tries to get a job,

1734
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,799
I'll go and see that Dean, too.

1735
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,299
Weren't you satisfied
with messing up my life?

1736
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,300
Must you mess up Rudolf's, too?

1737
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,309
You don't care
what man's making love to you,

1738
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,309
just as long as it's a man.

1739
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,809
Go back to your 3 square meals
and your flop with Danny!

1740
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:32,809
Let's go. I don't
like the way he's acting.

1741
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,810
Get me out of here!

1742
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,819
Get the hell out of here!

1743
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,830
Go on, take her out of here!

1744
01:17:37,831 --> 01:17:41,320
Put her in your damn car
and drive her to hell!

1745
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,389
Yeah.

1746
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,890
I'll take it.

1747
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,900
Money.

1748
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,900
And burn this.

1749
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,429
You gettin' good and lost, baby?

1750
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,940
I never want to be found.

1751
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,380
Hi, blanche.
How's the world treating you?

1752
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,380
Hi, Noah. How are all the animals
in this smelly old ark?

1753
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,895
Meet the world's greatest
lover, Danny Johnson.

1754
01:21:00,896 --> 01:21:02,889
Danny, meet Noah.
Blanche, meet Danny.

1755
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:03,890
Danny, meet Anna.

1756
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,270
Don't just stand there, man.
Bring out the best.

1757
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,899
Ain't nothin' too good
for my old lady.

1758
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,405
What are you using for money?

1759
01:21:10,406 --> 01:21:12,399
If I had money,
I wouldn't be here.

1760
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,899
Come on, you know I'm good for it.
Bust loose, will you?

1761
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,900
Yeah, bust loose with the cork
and let the gin flow.

1762
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,909
What's the matter, Noah?
You paralyzed?

1763
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,420
You've both had enough already.

1764
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,909
Enough? I never get
enough of anything.

1765
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:24,909
I just got started.

1766
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,410
Great idea you had,
comin' here to your friends.

1767
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,919
Your friends
wouldn't even let us in.

1768
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,425
Oh, Anna, if you wish, you may
stay at my place tonight.

1769
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:34,419
Never mind. I.-.

1770
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,919
"Let's all pitch in together."

1771
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,420
I'm pitching in with Danny.

1772
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,929
Didn't I promise to love you
forever and ever?

1773
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,440
Or was that some other guy?

1774
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,929
I'm thirsty.

1775
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,929
Hey, Noah, come on,
a couple of beers, huh?

1776
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,429
Beers? What's the matter?

1777
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,930
You gone cheapskate
or somethin'?

1778
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,439
You been flingin' the dough
pretty good.

1779
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,445
Come on, spend it.
Mine's double gin.

1780
01:21:51,446 --> 01:21:53,940
You ain't gettin'
even a beer, Anna.

1781
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,450
Give it to me.

1782
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,449
What are you doing?

1783
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,949
Look, I'm no mooch. When I'm broke, I quit.
So does the broad with me.

1784
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,950
But I can't stop now.
We've got to keep going.

1785
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,240
Honey, I'm with you all the way,

1786
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,459
but we've used up
this town and that's for sure.

1787
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,459
But we've got to go, go, go,
Danny. Time's a-wasting.

1788
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,959
Honey, get your hooks out of me!

1789
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,960
I'm trying to figure it out.
I'm thinkin'.

1790
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,469
I smell wood burning.

1791
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,980
Well, that's funny.
That's real funny.

1792
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,970
Well, come to the party, man.
You're driftin'.

1793
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,660
You know, sometimes I can't
ever figure out

1794
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,979
how I got mixed up with you
in the first place.

1795
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,180
I never asked you for nothin'.

1796
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,400
Oh, no, not much. Just every
stitch on your back,

1797
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,479
booze by the case,

1798
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
and spending money like I
was printing it myself.

1799
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,500
It's not fashionable to go
broke in this town, Danny.

1800
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:41,989
You're out of style.

1801
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,489
I told you, Anna,
to quit pushin' me.

1802
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,489
Who's pushin'?

1803
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,490
That's what you need
is a good push.

1804
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You...

1805
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
No. That's what you'd like,
isn't it?

1806
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:00,520
I'm not about to go to the chair
for beating your brains out!

1807
01:23:00,521 --> 01:23:03,009
That's exactly what I'd do
with another night of you.

1808
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:05,009
Go ahead and laugh!

1809
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,509
You know what she did?

1810
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:07,510
She busted up my cab.

1811
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,519
Papa agoue was riding
the radiator cap

1812
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,525
and she knocked his head clean
off and busted my luck with it.

1813
01:23:12,526 --> 01:23:15,519
If she busted your luck, why do
you keep tagging along with her?

1814
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,520
6 months pay gone down the
drain in one lousy week.

1815
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,029
And for what?

1816
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,035
Oh, hit the road. Who needs you?

1817
01:23:22,036 --> 01:23:24,029
You bet I'll hit the road, baby.

1818
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,529
I must have had rocks in my
head to carry you this far.

1819
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,030
And I'll take this,
if you don't mind.

1820
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,039
I don't figure on
keeping up the payments.

1821
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,045
It's nothing
but a piece of junk, anyway.

1822
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:34,039
It stopped running
the moment I kissed you.

1823
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,539
You kissed me, all right, baby.

1824
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,540
You're the kiss-of-death broad.
That's you.

1825
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,549
Danny Johnson's
got a lot of traveling to do,

1826
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,055
and a lot of lmn' to do,
and I'm checkin' out.

1827
01:23:42,056 --> 01:23:43,819
And don't bother
writing me any letters

1828
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,880
because from now on,
I'm sticking to women

1829
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,900
who have only one thing.-

1830
01:23:47,901 --> 01:23:48,901
me.

1831
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,890
Danny.

1832
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,905
Anna, I was just talking
to eddy over at the chambers.

1833
01:23:57,906 --> 01:24:00,399
Seems like he's given the gate
to one of his girls

1834
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,399
and now she's tryin' to make out
like he was beating her up,

1835
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,900
at the very same time
he was down here

1836
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,915
gettin' a hole
burned in his neck

1837
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:09,909
by that cigarette
you pushed into him.

1838
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,909
You remember that night,
don't you?

1839
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:13,910
Heaven knows you never give me

1840
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,919
no reason to do you no favors.

1841
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,925
But when I see somebody throwing
themselves away like you are,

1842
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:23,419
it's just my natural instinct
to try and save them.

1843
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:26,420
And I don't care what you say,
eddy's a swell guy.

1844
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:27,940
He needs you
for a witness to prove

1845
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,429
he wasn't even
in the chambers that night.

1846
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,929
So if you go to him and tell
him you'll stand by him,

1847
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:34,430
you could have his shirt.

1848
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,939
In fact, you could
move right into the job

1849
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,950
he just threw that broad out of.

1850
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:40,439
No, thanks, blanche.

1851
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,939
Now you look here, Anna.

1852
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,940
You can't go around kicking every
man who likes you in the pants.

1853
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,949
Pretty soon,
there'll be none left.

1854
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,960
Why don't you go haunt
some other bar?

1855
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:50,950
Oh, don't you rush me.

1856
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,950
Anna,

1857
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,959
you can't fight
eddy off forever.

1858
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,470
And besides, you'd be doing me
an important favor with him.

1859
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:01,959
Huh, Anna?

1860
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,460
Good night, blanche.

1861
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:07,480
All right, I'm leavin' already.

1862
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,970
Anna, there's a nice breeze
comin' right off the ocean.

1863
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,980
Oh. Oh, well.

1864
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,510
What's with you?

1865
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,020
It would look
ridiculous on me, anyway.

1866
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,030
Planning on shipping out, huh?

1867
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,529
Rio..

1868
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,529
What?

1869
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,530
Rio de Janeiro.
You know, Brazil.

1870
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,539
That's the spot.

1871
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,039
Brazil?
I saw that on a map once.

1872
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,539
That's at the bottom
of the world.

1873
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,039
No, it ain't.

1874
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,039
Same distance below the equator
that we are above it,

1875
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,540
and the climate's even nicer.

1876
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,549
You been there?
Oh, yeah. Lots of times.

1877
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,055
I got a cousin that runs
a soft drink joint down there.

1878
01:26:29,056 --> 01:26:32,549
Let me see. The <i>iberia leaves tomorrow
night, the hispanita on the 20th. .</i>

1879
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,550
Hey, I know
the mate on the <i>hispanita. .</i>

1880
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,560
He'd let me
work my passage over.

1881
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,059
Take me with you, Danny.

1882
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,560
I intend to.

1883
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,559
First I got to work your fare.

1884
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,060
I can work. I can do anything.

1885
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,569
I'll shovel coal.

1886
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,569
Honey, ships today use oil.

1887
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:49,569
I'll have to buy your ticket.

1888
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,069
Sell your cab.

1889
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:53,069
Can't. It's in hock up
to the hilt.

1890
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,570
Wait a minute.
The <i>hispanita on the 20th. .</i>

1891
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,085
If I work
around the clock hackin',

1892
01:26:58,086 --> 01:26:59,579
we could make the one
on the 20th.

1893
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,579
No, let's take the one tomorrow night.
The first one that's leaving.

1894
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,579
Honey, relax. We'll go.

1895
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,080
2 weeks won't make a difference.

1896
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:06,589
It will to me.

1897
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,595
My cousin must be

1898
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:09,089
really busting them up
down there.

1899
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,089
Imagine, a place
with booze on every corner,

1900
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,089
and they're just
getting used to soda pop.

1901
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,090
It'll be a good business
to break into.

1902
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,599
On the cuff? Thanks.

1903
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,105
Maybe if we went down
to the wharf,

1904
01:27:18,106 --> 01:27:20,099
the skipper on <i>iberia
will give us a break. .</i>

1905
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,599
Not on your life. I know him.

1906
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,100
Better chance cutting bait with
a shark than get his favor.

1907
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,109
Maybe I could sweet-talk him.
That's out.

1908
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,115
I don't even want you
to joke about it.

1909
01:27:28,116 --> 01:27:29,116
I wasn't joking.

1910
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:32,109
I said, we'll go
when I can pay your fare.

1911
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:35,110
Let's get out of here
tonight, Danny. I gotta.

1912
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,619
Now let me think.

1913
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,625
Maybe I can hit
Noah on the head.

1914
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:40,120
He ought to be good
for about $20.

1915
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,119
For $20, you'd have to kill me.

1916
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,620
That's funny. Funny.

1917
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:48,629
I've got money.

1918
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,629
You been holding out on me?

1919
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:54,130
No, it's the money Rudolf
gave me to buy my trousseau.

1920
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,639
Where is it?

1921
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,139
I hid it in my room.

1922
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,139
Come on, baby, there's
still gas in the cab.

1923
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,140
Let's go.

1924
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,139
What's wrong?

1925
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,640
Nothin'.

1926
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,149
It's yours, ain't it?

1927
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:08,649
I mean, he gave it to you?

1928
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,149
Honey, Brazil.

1929
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,165
And we'll never come back
to this place again?

1930
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:21,659
What for? We only have bad
times to remember here.

1931
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,159
I wish we were on that boat now.

1932
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,160
Soon, baby, soon.

1933
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,189
Come on.

1934
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,689
No, I better wait here.

1935
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,690
Oh, it's Sunday.
They're all in church.

1936
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,210
Come on.

1937
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:10,709
Why,.

1938
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,209
It's not here.

1939
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,709
Are you sure you put it there?

1940
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:15,710
I thought I put it in my doll.

1941
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,730
Aw, honey, this is no good. You can't
find it rummaging around like this.

1942
01:29:18,731 --> 01:29:21,219
Relax and take your time.

1943
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,720
Close your eyes and think.

1944
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,740
Honey, will you... honey, will
you sit down and listen to me?

1945
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:32,229
Ah. Now,
with that kind of money, baby,

1946
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,730
we can buy 2 tickets
and travel cabin style.

1947
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,739
Who's that?

1948
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,240
The old man must be in his room.
Let's get out of here.

1949
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,755
You better give a look.

1950
01:29:47,756 --> 01:29:49,750
He's just sleeping off a drunk.

1951
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,750
He sounds sick to me.

1952
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,959
He ain't sick or drunk.

1953
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,470
He's dying, Anna.

1954
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,460
I couldn't even hear
his heartbeat.

1955
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,460
I tell you, Anna,
your old man is dying.

1956
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:41,969
Just a month too late.

1957
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,969
A lot of good
that's gonna do me now.

1958
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,469
That's a terrible thing to say.

1959
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,470
You go over there
and say something to him.

1960
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:50,479
You hold his hand, make it up if
you have to, but do something.

1961
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,485
I'll go call the doctor.
Where's the phone?

1962
01:30:53,486 --> 01:30:54,980
In the lmng room. I'll go.

1963
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,480
No. You stay here. I'll go.

1964
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,490
Angel.

1965
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,999
Did you have a good day
at school today?

1966
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,500
Did teacher give you
some homework?

1967
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,800
I'll help you
with your homework.

1968
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,639
My little smart baby.

1969
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,640
Someday you're gonna grow up
and be a real fine lady.

1970
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,650
Anna,

1971
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,659
If I'm not Workin' next Sunday,

1972
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,659
I'll take you to the z-z-zoo.

1973
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,160
Remember that old elephant?

1974
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,160
He... he remembers you.

1975
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:50,669
Remember how he took the
peanuts that you gave him?

1976
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:53,669
That's because he likes you,

1977
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:57,170
and he knows that
you like him, too.

1978
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,690
E-e-elephants are smart,
that way.

1979
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,690
Anna,

1980
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,190
my little... little... little
baby.

1981
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,200
Oh, good Jesus,

1982
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,700
sweet, sweet Jesus,

1983
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:32,210
look after and watch over
my little...

1984
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,220
baby.

1985
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:46,730
Pa. Pa..

1986
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,230
The doctor's on his way.

1987
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,740
He... he kept
calling me "angel,"

1988
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,260
like he used to
when I was little.

1989
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,749
I didn't know
what to say to him.

1990
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,750
All I could do was sit here
and watch him die,

1991
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,759
while he prayed to Jesus
to watch over me!

1992
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:56,350
What's got...
What's got into that boy?

1993
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,865
Well, he can't be that hungry..

1994
01:34:58,866 --> 01:35:02,359
Oh, yes, the preacher did
make an extra-long sermon.

1995
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,360
Gotta speak to that man.

1996
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,369
He sure takes good care
of the soul.

1997
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:08,369
But the state of stress
the world's in today,

1998
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:10,370
a man's got to have
a pretty good pair of kidneys.

1999
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:13,369
You know, I was reading in the
medical journal the other day,

2000
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,870
the doctors say
the chief trouble

2001
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,879
with modern-day cmlization
is the headache.

2002
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,390
And you know what a headache is?

2003
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,879
