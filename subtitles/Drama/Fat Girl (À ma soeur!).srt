30
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,898
Anyway when you're in love with a boy, you always want to pin him down,

31
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,005
so after three days, he wants to break free

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,546
and get as far away as possible.

33
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:45,533
Oh yeah? We could see who can get a nice guy first.

34
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,589
And I'll be nice. He doesn't
even have to be that great.

35
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,834
Any guy will do,
even a fatty like yourself.

36
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,627
That shows how stupid you are.

37
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,490
You might look great,

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,300
but as soon as they get to know you,
they're no longer interested.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,370
But they're not even interested in getting to know you.
I'm too young.

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,487
They'd be scared to sleep with me,

41
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,622
whereas you have no morals at all.

42
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,115
But I don't sleep around.

43
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,458
That's the only thing you don't do.

44
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:15,480
You have an odd idea of what
'not sleeping around' means.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,579
Well that's what matters.

46
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,798
I don't think so.

47
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:23,511
If I meet a man I love,
then I want him to be my first time.

48
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:26,618
He won't think that my first time's important.

49
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,536
The first time should be with a nobody.

50
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:32,235
I don't want some guy boasting
that he took my virginity.

51
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,376
Men are all sick.

52

#Vene Carnevale/Tavernanova#

53
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,038
Let's stop here. I'm knackered.

54
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:08,682
Come on, let's keep going.

55
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,904
I thought you wanted a drink.

56
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:15,306
That place is shit.

57
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,364
You can sit at my
table if you want to.

58
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,003
Tell your friend to join.
She's my sister.

59
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:03,831
You can't just sit down like that,
you should ask if people mind.

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,566
No it's fine, I offered.

61
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,806
Go ahead.

62
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:17,656
It's very kind of you.

63
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:21,742
Because when there's no seats,
and you're tired and thirsty...

64
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,883
It's nice to meet someone friendly.

65
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,878
Fernando.
Elena.

66
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,762
My little sister, Anaïs.

67
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,474
Don't just stand there like a lump.

68
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,782
Can I buy you a drink?

69
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:54,310
Coffee.

70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,422
Are you Italian?

71
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,915
Yes, from Rome.

72
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,636
A banana split,
my favourite.

73
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:21,292
We're on holiday here,
we're staying in a residence.

74
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:26,334
It's nice because it's quiet,
but we can't get out easily.

75
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,407
We're not allowed out anyway.

76
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,158
Speak for yourself.

77
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,851
Don't worry!

78
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,030
He can't understand a word you're saying.

79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,329
He's just being polite.

80
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,342
No, no it's fine.

81
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:50,021
But can you speak slower?
As I need to improve my French.

82
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,956
I'm in secondary school.

83
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,646
Well I've just finished year 11

84
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,839
and now I'm going to be in year 12.

85
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:06,894
I don't know what I'll do in the future,
but it's useful for now.

86
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,624
I'm doing literature and science.

87
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:17,409
I've not been in secondary school for ages,
I'm a student now.

88
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:20,602
I study law.
<i>Avvocato.</i>

89
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:23,652
You're a student?

90
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,448
That must be different. You're free.

91
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,046
That's the problem.

92
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,610
Because we don't have to attend classes,

93
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,710
and then we have to take exams.

94
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,900
You can always retake them in June,
but you don't want to fall behind.

95
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,443
Besides, my dad wouldn't understand.

96
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,221
What does he do?
My dad?

97
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:48,177
He's an <i>avvocato internazionale.</i>

98
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,508
Mine's a managing director.

99
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:36,023
Sorry, my shift's about to end.

100
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,005
I'll see you back at the gate.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,941
Don't tell me you've been waiting that long.

102
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,953
I almost went home.

103
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,433
You're a babe.

104
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:44,051
I couldn't believe there was a tornado.
We're in France.

105
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,513
Exactly. We never have tornadoes.

106
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:51,966
And the bed was shaking and I was petrified.

107
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,509
so I didn't go downstairs for safety,

108
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,859
I just pulled the sheets over my head

109
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:02,821
and decided to ignore it
and go back to sleep.

110
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:06,650
I must have been crazy, as if sleeping would help-
What do you study?

111
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,568
Sorry?
What do you study?

112
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:14,133
I study law. Next year I'll
be in my third year of law.

113
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,855
Criminal law?

114
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:23,140
Yes, I'm more interested in that,
as I think it's a lot more useful.

115
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,189
But I'd like to do international law,
in order to be a business lawyer.

116
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:33,261
Bu I'd like to start by working for good causes.

117
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,237
So you're going to be doing international law?

118
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,303
Yes, my father insists on it,

119
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:40,603
because he's already an international lawyer,

120
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:43,589
and so he wants me to follow in his footsteps.

121
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,489
Have you got to know each other?
Thank you.

122
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,874
Is that OK for you?
Yes that's fine.

123
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,331
I'm putting him on a diet.

124
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,272
So you think I'm fat?

125
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:57,138
No, but you're not exactly thin for your age.

126
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:05,627
Haven't forgotten anything?
I was worried there wouldn't be any left.

127
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,796
And people wonder why she's fat.

128
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,016
It's easy to see.
She scoffs it down like a pig.

129
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:16,195
What's the point of saying that?
It's obviously hormonal.

130
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,530
It's not her fault.

131
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,490
Maybe, but she won't stop eating.

132
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,103
I've lost my appetite.
Oh, come on.

133
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,987
So how did you meet my daughters?

134
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,571
François!

135
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,669
Young people meet as they do.

136
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,238
It just happens like that these days.

137
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:45,171
For I get so bored,
It's not over yet,

138
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,106
After my life,
And my survival,

139
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:53,174
After I've died,
I'll still be bored,

140
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:55,181
More than ever before,

141
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,652
If only I could find,

142
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:02,851
A specter or ghost,
A woman or man,

143
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,846
An animal,
I don't mind,

144
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,944
To dream,

145
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:16,191
Aren't my lips soft?
And don't I kiss well?

146
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,660
Yes, I love you,

147
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,847
But I don't want to marry you yet.

148
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,981
Because I now know that men like me,

149
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,079
I want to try other things.

150
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:38,856
Don't I kiss well?

151
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,819
I've only been kissed once.

152
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,532
Are you jealous?

153
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:54,043
I didn't really cheat on you.

154
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,301
Women aren't like bars of soap.

155
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,188
They don't wear away!

156
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,949
Each over gives them something more.

157
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,405
It's you who benefits from it.

158
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:16,070
You disgust me.
How can I find you so attractive and repulsive?

159
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,378
I'll give everything to you.

160
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,775
I've never slept with anyone before, you know?

161
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,141
What are you doing?
Can't you ask?

162
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,814
What are you doing?
Shut up.

163
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:06,704
You going out?
No how the hell could I?

164
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,096
Did you invite him here?

165
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:12,892
Go to sleep.

166
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:16,292
You hear nothing, see nothing
and know nothing.

167
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,453
You don't need
make up to sleep.

168
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,548
I told you to go to sleep.

169
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,860
And remember to not start looking

170
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,647
You got the right place.

171
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:56,243
You told me it was the
first door on the left

172
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,568
My little sister's sleeping.

173
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:09,261
The gateman almost didn't let me in.

174
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,662
How did you get in then?
I gave him some money for a drink.

175
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,663
Shall we put some music on?
No we can't.

176
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:36,464
It's no big deal.
What's no big deal?

177
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:41,714
It's as if the music was
more important than me.

178
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,417
As if it was more important to you.

179
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,331
I could get offended.

180
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,722
What do you mean?
Nothing.

181
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,847
Sorry If I don't speak you language well.

182
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:06,399
I'd like to to tell you
all sorts of things.

183
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,444
That you're so pretty.

184
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:16,274
Yeah I know. It's hard to not be
able to understand.

185
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:21,234
To think that I could've studied Italian
but did Spanish instead.

186
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:24,100
They're all macho.

187
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,278
I can learn Italian next year.

188
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,396
No I need to learn French.

189
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:33,740
I don't see why.

190
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,275
When I come to see you in Paris,
I'll have learnt more French.

191
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:41,011
You're gonna come and visit me in Paris?
Yes.

192
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,551
Well, I don't actually live in Paris.

193
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,542
I live in the suburbs.

194
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:50,974
But my house is great.

195
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:54,641
That doesn't matter.
I'm coming anyway.

196
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,265
You were your bra to bed?

197
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,808
No, I just forgot to take it off.

198
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:31,974
Can't you help me?

199
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,235
A boy has to work.

200
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,831
If it's too any, then it's no fun.

201
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:43,431
Don't worry. These things
are always complicated.

202
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:46,258
Really?

203
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,504
Did you have many before me?
Am I not the first?

204
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,997
No, you're not the first.

205
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,768
Yeah, but I'm asking if
you've had lots and lots.

206
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,436
What does it matter?

207
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:10,616
Right now, I'm here with you.

208
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,961
Yeah, but how many have you had?

209
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,397
Not that many.
How many?

210
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:20,765
Dunno.

211
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:24,017
But if you don't know,
then that means lots.

212
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,450
Are you jealous?

213
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:29,993
I've never had one like you.

214
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:31,987
You sure?

215
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,817
Even if I don't sleep with
you but the others do?

216
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,701
It makes a difference.

217
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,285
I haven't been interested
in a virgin since...

218
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,460
Since?

219
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,703
Since I was 15.

220
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,141
So did you sleep with all the
other girls on the first date?

221
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,272
First or second, same thing.

222
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,266
No, it's not the same.

223
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:36,238
You can tell it's all they want.

224
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:40,279
And sometimes it's so obvious
that it repulses me.

225
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:44,183
There was one...

226
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,705
She invited me to dinner,
then straight to her room.

227
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:52,284
Well you're in my room.
But it's not the same.

228
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,565
This is different. There's no other way.
But listen.

229
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,958
Someone told me that this girl
had wanted to go out with me since

230
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:05,836
the start of the year, but I hadn't noticed.

231
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:10,661
So she asked me to dinner
and then we were in her room.

232
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:15,591
So we started drinking and there
were four bottles of wine.

233
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,496
Four of them, just like chance.

234
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:21,413
So we started drinking and
didn't eat anything.

235
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:25,504
I thought to myself,
'you went get me, bitch!'

236
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,101
I mean a girl can't drink
as much as a guy.

237
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:33,370
So I slow down my drinking

238
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,435
and I keep filling up her glass.

239
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,523
And half past midnight, I
look at her and tell her,

240
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:44,075
'Gotta go. I'll miss the last tram.
Good night!'

241
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:48,452
I left her absolutely hammered
and mad at me

242
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:51,318
and she's never spoken to me since.

243
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:53,045
Didn't you like her?

244
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:58,166
Well she was pretty cute, but I got
a thrill out of leaving her like that.

245
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,810
Besides, she wasn't the only one.

246
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:06,938
I've done that loads of times.

247
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,816
It's too easy with girls.

248
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:18,089
Were you in love with
the others you slept with?

249
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:23,163
I can tell you're getting jealous.
Yes, you're jealous.

250
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:26,012
The others don't count.

251
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:30,552
I only sleep with them as I'm a guy. That's all.

252
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,718
So if you slept with me,

253
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,546
Wouldn't I be like all the other girls?

254
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:40,502
No.

255
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,003
I'd respect you.

256
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,207
Even if you sleep with me?

257
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,924
Promise me you won't do it.

258
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,987
Because I wouldn't want that.

259
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,111
I swear on my mother's head
that I'll stay on the edge.

260
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,209
On the edge doesn't count.

261
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,559
It does count.
It doesn't.

262
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:49,699
It does.

263
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,957
Because I count.

264
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:55,055
You're the only one that counts.

265
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:11,364
I'm scared you won't hold back.

266
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:14,213
Don't worry about it.
That's my problem.

267
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:18,777
I'm a man. I know if I can hold
back or not and I can.

268
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:25,352
But I'd like to have you properly.

269
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,186
That's not possible.

270
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:33,835
Isn't it stupid if I have to get with
another girl who I don't like?

271
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,859
Will you need to?

272
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:44,705
Well yeah, but I don't want to finish myself off

273
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,981
in the toilet, it's sick.

274
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,031
I love you.

275
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:07,713
I really love you, but give me some time.

276
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:40,021
I told you I didn't want to.

277
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,697
I haven't done anything.

278
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,436
I thought you wanted to.
I didn't do anything.

279
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,499
You realise that you've
ruined everything?

280
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:07,915
You've ruined everything.

281
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:10,443
It was fine.

282
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,680
Yeah it was fine.
Can't you see that things were going well?

283
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,248
I can't.

284
00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:49,629
I can't like this.
Not so early on.

285
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,391
I didn't trick you.

286
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:11,587
I warned you.

287
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,097
I'm not a pricktease.

288
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:15,557
Are you mad?

289
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:19,796
How can I resist you pressing
up against me like that?

290
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,058
You think I'm some sort of saint?

291
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,117
Can't you see what you're doing to me?

292
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,076
Do you think this is good for me?
No.

293
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,465
But...

294
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:44,732
Don't you think your first time
should be with someone who loves you?

295
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:47,580
Yes.

296
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:06,267
That would be a real test of your love.

297
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:09,205
A real test of love.

298
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:12,889
From you to me
and from me to you, too.

299
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,447
You know that there are so many guys

300
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,990
who run when they see that a girl's a virgin?

301
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,320
As it's too much hassle and responsibility.

302
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,062
Then they come back once the job's done.

303
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,872
Really?
Yes.

304
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:32,243
That's disgusting.

305
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:38,307
Otherwise, I'll have to find
a girl who's older than you.

306
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,990
That's disgusting as well and I don't want that.

307
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:47,147
I don't want that.

308
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,348
You're a little girl.

309
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,506
You're a little girl who looks like a woman.

310
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,044
You have to forgive men.

311
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,437
You're not mad at me?

312
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:25,199
Are you mad?

313
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:27,926
I want you.

314
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,810
If you were kind...

315
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,804
If I were kind?

316
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,245
All girls take it in the rear.

317
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:07,076
All girls?
Yes.

318
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:10,190
Because then it doesn't count.

319
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:14,748
They can say that they've
never slept with anyone.

320
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:17,828
That's sick.
No, it isn't.

321
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:20,310
No it's not sick. It's proof of love.

322
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,669
If you love me the way I love you...

323
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:09,588
I feel like crying.

324
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:12,045
No, don't.

325
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,808
You musn't. That was a wonderful gift.

326
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,971
Didn't you feel what it did for me?

327
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,363
Yes, but I'm ashamed.

328
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:37,744
You've shown your love for me.
It was a test of love.

329
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:42,159
A proof of love, you see?

330
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:45,168
From me to you and you to me.

331
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:00,570
Do you still love me?

332
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,860
Yes.

333
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:08,451
Don't worry.

334
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:13,205
You're the sort of girl

335
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,018
who men dream of marrying.

336
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:20,242
You'd like to marry me?

337
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,889
If you weren't so young then yeah.

338
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:33,770
I have to sit my exams first.

339
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:36,601
Would you wait for me?

340
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,069
What else am I doing except waiting for you?

341
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:53,039
Stay.

342
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,078
Yes.

343
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,801
It's morning.

344
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:45,504
I have to go home.

345
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:25,222
You know what I'd like before I go?

346
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,649
I'd like you to take me in your mouth.

347
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:36,207
Not with my little sister here.

348
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,878
She's asleep.

349
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:46,991
Yeah but she might be pretending.
You don't know what she's like.

350
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:48,700
She's jealous.

351
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,887
She doesn't realise that I'm older than her.

352
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:54,806
I told you she's sleeping.

353
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,928
No, it'd really bother me if she saw me.

354
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,805
I want to sleep!

355
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:10,384
I'm sick of your noises.

356
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:12,342
You weren't asleep?

357
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,724
You've been spying on us all night?

358
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:18,737
No, I was trying to sleep.

359
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:21,229
I'm not interested in your anal adventures.

360
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:23,081
You little bitch!

361
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:26,481
And I'm the little bitch?

362
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,066
That's a good one!

363
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:34,193
My sister gets played with all night long

364
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:38,021
without thinking about me and I'm the bitch!

365
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:45,664
Are you mad at me?

366
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:53,089
I feel dirty. I just feel uncomfortable.

367
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,707
Is it because of my sister?
No, it's not her.

368
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:06,084
It's because what should be so natural
been two people who love each other-

369
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:07,526
It's just sinister.

370
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:11,888
I just don't want it to happen again, you see?

371
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,754
Do you want to break up?

372
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:28,537
I want to love you.

373
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:37,270
Next time.

374
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:42,753
Next time we'll do it.
Do you want to? Do you still want to?

375
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,292
Answer me!

376
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,894
Of course I do.

377
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,654
If you'd said no, I would've died.

378
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,736
I'll be your first lover.

379
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:30,236
You're very very first...
who'll make you dream of love.

380
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,797
And you'll always remember me.

381
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,826
Even afterwards when you're with other lovers.

382
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:41,567
I'll always be the first.

383
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,202
And won't you always remember me?

384
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,108
Guys aren't like girls.

385
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:47,761
No, you can't ever leave me.

386
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:12,923
Stop.

387
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:16,751
Stop!

388
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:20,672
Stop it!

389
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,968
Stop, you'll catch a cold.

390
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:25,318
No I'm not cold.

391
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:32,617
No, no!

392
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:38,515
Do you know what we risk by doing this
together, under my country's law?

393
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:39,693
Tell me.

394
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,723
I'll go to prison.

395
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,358
It's too dangerous. You're not sixteen.

396
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:47,224
That's not fair. It's me who wants it.

397
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:05,140
See, it wasn't me who stopped first.

398
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,086
Next time...

399
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,185
I'll teach you all about love.

400
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:38,197
Returned goods?
In the returned goods column then!

401
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,647
There's a lot? No difference!

402
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,044
Well what did you fuck up then you idiot?
It was all going so smoothly!

403
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:46,445
Just when I turn my back!

404
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,546
You want me to come back, eh?

405
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:57,498
You know, that idiot is forcing me to go back.

406
00:39:57,908 --> 00:40:01,344
No, you should let them deal with it by themselves.

407
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:04,104
You should enjoy this holiday, then return.

408
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,253
Do you think it's easy to
start a company from scratch?

409
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:12,334
Everyone's so lazy at first
before it starts to take off.

410
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:16,767
If you start off on the wrong path,
things mess up very quickly.

411
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:20,865
Dealing with one arsehole can leave you with no money.

412
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:26,818
Oh, come on.
It's the old story of things going wrong.

413
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:30,058
You're ten years ahead of the
competition and you feel strong.

414
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,354
And then you could screwed
over by a financial problem...

415
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,039
Eat, you'll feel better.

416
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:42,228
What's Anaïs doing?
Nothing much.

417
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:46,702
Don't shout, I'll go get her.

418
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:17,532
Okay I was a bit harsh,
but you understand right?

419
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:20,176
I'm not a bitch, but I get annoyed easily.

420
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:24,421
It's not your fauly.
I'm sick of following you around.

421
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:26,967
No it's not like that.

422
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:30,240
But you know that if you're not with me,
then they'll never let you out.

423
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,371
It reassures them when I drag you along.
See? You said 'drag me along'.

424
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:42,166
Yes, tomorrow.

425
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:45,353
No, the morning's best.
Oh well, never mind.

426
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,267
Ten past eight.

427
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,738
Finally!

428
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:54,299
What's the point of being here,
if we can't be here together?

429
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,216
Yes, thanks, good bye.

430
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:03,646
What's wrong with her?
Nothing.

431
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:09,258
You don't seem that happy.

432
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:15,258
I don't work tirelessly all the time
to see a face like that on holiday.

433
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:22,307
I can't even stay on holiday, I'm supposed to go back,
and I'm the only one not looking upset.

434
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:24,195
Look at you all!

435
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:28,599
It's good to see you looking happy.
I'm glad I'm going home tomorrow.

436
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,647
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with her?

437
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,122
It's adolescence, she'll be fine soon.

438
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,220
She'd better be fine soon.

439
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:57,688
It can't be that bad.
You haven't lost your appetite.

440
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,036
It'll do you some good.

441
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:17,238
When you eat, you don't think of anything else.

442
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,333
François, you almost forgot this.

443
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:04,303
But if dad's flying back-

444
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:07,446
Then what?
We'll go back by car.

445
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:10,118
I'll drive.

446
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:15,538
If I'm tired then I'll stop at a
service station to have a nap.

447
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:19,241
It'll just take a little bit longer.
So you'll be driving?

448
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:24,364
Oh come on, I can do it.
I just don't like to, That's all.

449
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:46,698
Each year I wonder how long it'll take
for your dad to get called back.

450
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,494
He broke his record this time.

451
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:55,121
He can't stand going on holiday and
hates it even more when his partners do.

452
00:44:56,768 --> 00:45:00,240
You'll see, he'll get them
back to work immediately.

453
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,091
I'm not like him then.

454
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:05,190
I understand him.

455
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,411
Holidays suck.

456
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,773
Don't start that again.

457
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,853
You're not getting the
exact same dress as me.

458
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,954
Aren't you tired of copying me?

459
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,704
You can try and be original sometimes.

460
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:36,253
It's not the same colour.

461
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:37,982
It's the same dress.

462
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:42,095
I always have to be stuck with you,
then you copy me as well.

463
00:45:42,215 --> 00:45:45,103
I'm not copying. I didn't
know you tried the same one.

464
00:45:45,223 --> 00:45:47,471
Not my fault if I think it looks nice.

465
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:49,819
Yeah, you could take my boyfriend as well.

466
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:52,889
And say, 'oh didn't see he was already yours.'

467
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:54,797
He's not yours. He's not a dog.

468
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:58,835
Yes, he is mine. And you're just a little
bitch who's always trying to copy me.

469
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:02,235
You don't stand a chance.
You'll never be like me.

470
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:05,426
You must be joking.
I'd never want to be like you.

471
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:09,396
Well you better not copy me anyway.

472
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:12,886
It's not my fault that I didn't
see it was the same one.

473
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:30,434
Shorter.

474
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:43,015
No, I want it to be shorter.
It's prettier below the knee.

475
00:46:44,229 --> 00:46:48,057
It's me who's going to be wearing it,
so I want it to be shorter.

476
00:46:49,713 --> 00:46:51,386
No, I'll do it.

477
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:54,302
You're being so difficult,
I can't take you anywhere!

478
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:22,041
It's a bit scary out here.

479
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:25,597
Well I think so,
but I feel safe with you.

480
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:31,455
No it's great out here.
You can't even see the road.

481
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:35,024
I hope we get lost and never make it out.

482
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,634
Like an urban legend.

483
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,059
Are you nuts?

484
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,220
<i>I left my heart to decay,</i>

485
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,453
<i>On the windowsill,</i>

486
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,408
<i>I trust in a future day,</i>

487
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:37,506
<i>The crows will come,</i>

488
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:40,550
<i>With their beeks so very sharp,</i>

489
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,414
<i>They will peck away,</i>

490
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,334
<i>At this lump of raw meat,</i>

491
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:50,563
<i>That they wanted to eat from,</i>

492
00:48:50,683 --> 00:48:53,501
<i>I left my heart to decay,</i>

493
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:57,595
<i>On the windowsill,</i>

494
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:00,587
<i>Although I can still enjoy myself,</i>

495
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:04,065
<i>I still feel anxious,</i>

496
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:07,452
<i>If you still see the flock,</i>

497
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:10,581
<i>Of crows fighting over it,</i>

498
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,715
<i>Don't be worried by them,</i>

499
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:16,890
<i>As I'm not worth a bit,</i>

500
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,590
<i>I left my hear to decay,</i>

501
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,560
<i>On the windowsill,</i>

502
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,587
<i>I trust in a future day,</i>

503
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:30,029
<i>Maybe the crows will come,</i>

504
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:32,895
<i>With their beaks so very sharp,</i>

505
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:36,527
<i>They will peck away,</i>

506
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:39,269
<i>At this lump of raw meat,</i>

507
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:42,765
<i>Over which you thought you had control</i>

508
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,913
Slut.

509
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:55,889
You'd never know that we're sisters.

510
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:03,281
It's true.
We don't look like anyone.

511
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:10,955
It's as if we were born from ourselves.

512
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,038
It's funny as we have nothing in common.
I mean, look at you.

513
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:21,380
You have small, beady eyes.

514
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:24,300
Whereas mine aren't.

515
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:29,926
But when I look deep into your eyes,

516
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:33,489
it makes me feel like I belong,

517
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:35,999
as if they were my eyes.

518
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:41,450
I feel the same thing.

519
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:44,880
That's why we're sisters.

520
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:48,970
When I hate you, I look at you
and I can't anymore.

521
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:53,866
It's like hating a part of myself.

522
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:57,952
That's why I hate you so violently.

523
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:02,444
Because you should be like me.

524
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:07,305
But sometimes I feel like you're the complete opposite.

525
00:53:07,758 --> 00:53:09,860
Yeah I feel that as well.

526
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:18,604
That's why you make me angrier than anyone else.

527
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:23,945
I don't want to forgive you for anything.

528
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,665
You have no rights,
but I have the right to look at you.

529
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:34,309
We hate each other,
as we're raised as rivals.

530
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,696
It's mum and dad's fault.

531
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:38,993
But it's not really their fault.

532
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:42,643
They think that it's good
and makes us competitive.

533
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:47,388
I think you hated it when I was born.

534
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:52,924
I mean when I was a baby,
you used to act like my mummy.

535
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:55,275
But when I got bigger-

536
00:53:55,395 --> 00:53:56,912
Fatter!

537
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,172
Bitch!

538
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:03,160
When I couldn't look down at you
any more for ordering me about,

539
00:54:03,926 --> 00:54:06,543
When you couldn't play mummy with me anymore,

540
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,204
And when I caught up to your language level as well,

541
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:13,231
Really? I don't remember that.

542
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:16,845
Are you sure you're not
just making this up?

543
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:20,513
No, I remember it all well.

544
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:26,175
The day you weren't so keen on educating me

545
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,943
was one evening, when we were together
in our pink twin beds

546
00:54:32,495 --> 00:54:36,537
and you started bossing me
around all of a sudden.

547
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,169
and just like that I pounced on you.

548
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:45,267
I was happy as you complained to mum,

549
00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:49,967
as I pinched you really hard
and you had two really bad bruises.

550
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,474
Since then,

551
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,305
you've lost all your power.

552
00:55:00,355 --> 00:55:02,705
You never bossed me around again.

553
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:05,287
I don't remember that at all.

554
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:07,619
I remember it well.

555
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:12,393
But I was nice to you.
I use to push you in your buggy.

556
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:15,027
And call myself Maman LéLaine.

557
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,013
I hated that.
Really?

558
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,268
But it's so unfair.

559
00:55:43,388 --> 00:55:47,292
You're allowed to do things
two years earlier than I was.

560
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:53,735
Yeah OK, that's true.

561
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,877
But what else would be good about being second?

562
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:04,469
Besides so many people can't
remember which one of us is which.

563
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:09,134
I mean we have the sirname,
but nothing else in common-

564
00:56:09,254 --> 00:56:11,751
We have absolutely nothing in common!

565
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:13,282
Bitch!

566
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:15,407
I said nothing nasty!

567
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:22,956
Do you want to know a secret?

568
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,122
Fernando gave this to me.

569
00:56:45,294 --> 00:56:47,306
It's an engagement ring.

570
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:52,184
A mauve opal.
He can't have given you that!

571
00:56:52,304 --> 00:56:53,956
You're out of your mind.

572
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,981
There's got to be a catch.

573
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:58,263
No, this way we're engaged now.

574
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:00,644
It's a promise.

575
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:03,347
I'll get it resized.

576
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,904
When did he give it to you?
In the dunes.

577
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:12,174
That's dodgy. I don't think
you should've accepted it.

578
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:15,172
It's not right. It's just too valuable.

579
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:18,341
Yeah it is, I mean I didn't
want some shitty ring!

580
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:22,756
And you didn't ask where he got it from?
He said he got it from his grandmother.

581
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:27,799
I think I'm going to give myself to him tonight.

582
00:57:28,474 --> 00:57:31,429
'Give yourself to him?'
What do you mean?

583
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:34,883
If he uses a condom,
then I'll let him go all the way.

584
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:37,679
Spare me the details, please.

585
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:42,825
You've no idea how scared I am.

586
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:45,509
Still, I have to go through it one day.

587
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:49,373
So it may as well be with someone I love.

588
00:57:52,862 --> 00:57:56,387
What do you think?
What do you suggest?

589
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:02,251
Well between what you've already done and that,

590
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:05,349
there's no moral difference in my opinion.

591
00:58:05,469 --> 00:58:07,750
There's a massive difference!

592
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:14,069
Well for my first time,
I want it to be with someone I don't love.

593
00:58:14,189 --> 00:58:16,132
Because afterwards,

594
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,331
you realize that he doesn't love you
and that you don't love him and you feel stupid.

595
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,554
You'll change your mind when you fall in love.

596
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:26,856
Doubt it.

597
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:30,008
In any case, don't mind me.

598
00:58:30,128 --> 00:58:34,085
As long as you don't wake me up,
you can go at it all night.

599
00:59:04,454 --> 00:59:06,181
Kiss me.

600
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:16,281
I'm scared.

601
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,991
Be gentle.
No.

602
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:22,875
One hard push and then it's over.

603
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,934
No, gently.
Trust me.

604
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:58,562
Do you think the public come to see you,
just for the thrill of it?

605
01:01:59,658 --> 01:02:01,790
No, not at all.

606
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,737
Why not?
Why do you say that?

607
01:02:04,857 --> 01:02:08,681
My show deals with sexual issues.

608
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:11,362
There's no sex. I believe that's different.

609
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:14,269
Maybe I confuse sexual issues and sex itself.

610
01:02:14,389 --> 01:02:18,578
It's research into sexual issues. That's all I think.

611
01:02:19,812 --> 01:02:22,827
It's a big problem in France.

612
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:26,430
You have Bardot, who's a sexual issue.

613
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,308
No, she's a case, not an issue.

614
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:31,790
No she's a case, so she is an issue.

615
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:35,315
You should read what De Beauvoir wrote.

616
01:02:35,435 --> 01:02:40,425
She wrote some amazing things.
I love Bardot, but she's an issue.

617
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:43,227
So why do you investigate these sexual issues?

618
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:48,114
Because it's an obvious issue that everyone understands.

619
01:02:48,234 --> 01:02:51,445
It's a very simple human issue.

620
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:54,689
And no one is perfect in this way.

621
01:02:54,809 --> 01:03:00,751
Whilst there are many more difficult issues,
there's so much confusion in the world.

622
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:03,873
What about you?
How do you feel about this issue?

623
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:06,858
I'm not saying.

624
01:03:14,445 --> 01:03:16,364
Isn't this woman great?

625
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:22,714
I'll never know the people I'd like
to know. They were before my time.

626
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,625
Excuse me, is this
the Pingot household?

627
01:03:33,998 --> 01:03:36,572
It's not that difficult to say yes.

628
01:03:36,823 --> 01:03:39,397
But it would be stupid to expect an answer.

629
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:42,618
In that case. I'll come in.

630
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:45,992
I'm Fernando's mother!

631
01:03:46,112 --> 01:03:48,901
Sorry for just walking in!

632
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:51,962
Are you Elena's mother?

633
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:54,353
Am I disturbing you?

634
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:56,422
Not at all.

635
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,818
The moss grows so quickly with all this wet grass.

636
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:04,661
Well you see, this is awkward.
Very, very, very awkward.

637
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:07,366
No, not at all. Really.

638
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:12,574
This is a very awkward situation.

639
01:04:12,694 --> 01:04:15,010
No, not at all.
I'm bothering you.

640
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:18,508
No, I must compliment you. Your son is-

641
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:23,503
No, no, no, this situation is awkward.

642
01:04:23,623 --> 01:04:26,639
I don't know where to begin.

643
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:34,277
You see, every Summer I bring along a few valuable jewels with me.

644
01:04:34,661 --> 01:04:40,158
Some are precious, some are not so much. There's a variety.

645
01:04:41,037 --> 01:04:43,275
I don't check on them every day.

646
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:46,078
The problem is that they're souvenirs.

647
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:49,428
Rings represent the men,

648
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:55,556
who we made realize that they had to offer them to us.

649
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:58,395
I don't understand.

650
01:04:58,515 --> 01:05:01,393
But it's completely ridiculous and unthinkable

651
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:06,806
to give such a valuable ring to such a young girl,

652
01:05:06,926 --> 01:05:09,587
who you just happened to meet,

653
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:12,186
on holiday.

654
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:13,693
It's absurd!

655
01:05:13,813 --> 01:05:15,825
What ring do you mean exactly?

656
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,624
My mauve opal!

657
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:24,334
I just don't see how she could've accepted it so easily.

658
01:05:24,631 --> 01:05:29,001
My son is too young to dispose of my belongings.
I'm not dead!

659
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,590
But-
I don't intend to die!

660
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,065
He's such an idiot!

661
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:37,771
Look I don't understand a thing that's going on,
but neither of my girls would do this.

662
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:39,279
Elena!

663
01:05:48,096 --> 01:05:50,472
There you are!
Where's your sister?

664
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:53,137
I'm not paid to keep an eye on her.

665
01:05:54,095 --> 01:05:55,541
You're scaring me.

666
01:05:55,846 --> 01:05:59,821
You're always ready to back her up when she fucks up aren't you?

667
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:03,203
You're crazy.
Don't pretend you don't know what's happening.

668
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:06,003
She has a ring that belongs to this lady.

669
01:06:06,825 --> 01:06:10,830
Couldn't your son have come himself?
Stop it!

670
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,744
You're leaving already?
We have to go home one day.

671
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:32,150
You didn't stay very long.
That's life.

672
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:37,589
Can we put some music on?

673
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:54,605
I didn't do anything.

674
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:58,846
I always get yelled at because of her.

675
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:05,705
And my holiday's been ruined.

676
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:42,816
I'm warning you that your father wants to have you examined.

677
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,772
How about a police report too?

678
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:53,894
Published in the papers.

679
01:08:54,977 --> 01:08:57,855
He has no right to.
Yes, he does.

680
01:08:57,975 --> 01:09:00,261
You should've thought of that first.

681
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:04,343
So you never had a first time?

682
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:09,150
Did you ask for your father's permission?
This isn't about me.

683
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,195
I'm sick of this.

684
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:18,596
Stop acting up, I'm sick of your sniveling!

685
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:21,203
It's not my fault I'm crying.

686
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,792
Well cry in silence then!

687
01:09:27,136 --> 01:09:28,644
Mum.

688
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:34,126
Please stop the car. I'm going to be sick.

689
01:09:46,463 --> 01:09:48,275
Isn't she a bitch?

690
01:09:49,188 --> 01:09:51,960
She seems happy.
Shut up!

691
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,671
I hate her.

692
01:09:56,285 --> 01:09:57,990
I hope she dies.

693
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:08,830
But I don't care. I'll die with her.

694
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,322
Speak for yourself.

695
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:15,876
I don't want to die.

696
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,439
No risk of that.

697
01:10:20,307 --> 01:10:22,439
You're not the one in trouble.

698
01:10:31,568 --> 01:10:33,731
Turn that down, it's horrible!

699
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:37,719
It's me who's driving. I need to keep myself company.

700
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:49,495
People are all pigs.

701
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:51,140
Like all French people.

702
01:11:55,538 --> 01:11:58,203
Well, we have our own problems as well...

703
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:16,185
You're still eating?

704
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:46,255
Mum, that's bad.
Yeah, but there are many other things you shouldn't do...

705
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:25,133
I'm shattered.

706
01:15:26,808 --> 01:15:28,742
I need to sleep a bit.

707
01:15:47,683 --> 01:15:49,313
I need to pee.

708
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,175
Do you think she told dad everything?

709
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,977
And that he'll have me examined?

710
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,478
I don't know.

711
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:41,453
It's disgusting that people think it's their business.

712
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,179
It's disgusting to be a virgin.

713
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,213
I'm scared.

714
01:17:54,112 --> 01:17:58,224
And he was a bastard, for making me think we were getting engaged.

715
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:02,899
And with his mother's wedding ring as well...

716
01:18:04,618 --> 01:18:06,430
Stop thinking about it.

717
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:08,395
Go to sleep.

718
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,917
I can't stop thinking about it.

719
01:18:14,946 --> 01:18:16,803
He was the first.

720
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:19,970
You'll have many more.

721
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,092
So now you won't give them such a hard time.

722
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:31,245
Yeah, but I can't stop thinking about him.

723
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:35,318
Go to sleep. He's already forgotten you.

724
01:18:35,438 --> 01:18:36,882
You're a bitch.

725
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:39,105
No, I'm just being honest with you.

726
01:18:40,293 --> 01:18:42,166
You deserve a lot better.

727
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:44,503
Go to sleep.

728
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,710
Lock your door.

729
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:04,796
You're not going to hurt me?

730
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,395
Shut up!

731
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:29,562
We found her in the woods.
She said she wasn't raped.

732
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:32,349
If you don't want to believe me, then don't.

733
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:47,484
CJMONSTERNATOR Titles

734
01:23:47,604 --> 01:23:51,214
Those were my first ever subtitles!
