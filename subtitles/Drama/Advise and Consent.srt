{3875}{3908}Thank you.
{3912}{3968}-Morning, son.|-Good morning, senator.
{3976}{4007}Thank you.
{4161}{4199}Taxi!
{4349}{4399}Sheraton Rark Hotel.
{4738}{4814}-Good morning, Senator Danta.|-Good morning, Willoughby.
{5076}{5112}Hold it.
{5172}{5226}Why wasn't I let in on this?
{5230}{5284}-May I help you?|-Dot, Senator Munson.
{5288}{5339}Oh, just a moment, senator.
{5352}{5411}Good morning, Bobby.|How are you this morning?
{5415}{5481}You know how I am|this morning, Mr. Rresident.
{5485}{5542}I guess I'm in for it, aren 't I?
{5546}{5612}That's a hell of a thing to do|without talking to me.
{5616}{5688}Bobby, it's been over two weeks|since Shepherd died.
{5692}{5804}We couldn't go on forever without|a secretary of state. I had to get it done.
{5808}{5880}What was the matter|with the list of men we agreed on?
{5884}{5956}No, not one of them can really fill the bill.
{5960}{5995}Robert Leffingwell can.
{6000}{6050}You know how valuable he's been to me.
{6054}{6159}Sure, he's great. But the man's got more|enemies in Congress than anybody.
{6163}{6268}He's never played ball with us, not even|the most ordinary, political-courtesy kind.
{6272}{6378}Well, maybe that's the reason I want him.|He doesn 't waste his time on trifles.
{6382}{6474}Mr. Rresident, a United States senator|is not a trifle.
{6478}{6519}That's a joke, Bobby.
{6524}{6586}Fine. But Leffingwell's no joke.
{6590}{6654}And I have to stuff him down|the Senate's throat.
{6658}{6729}Now, look, I knew we were running a risk,|but I want him.
{6733}{6826}He can give us some creative|statesmanship, and God knows we need it.
{6830}{6913}Oh, come on, now.|What's our toughest problem?
{6917}{6968}You want me to talk|to Warren Strickland?
{6972}{7035}There's no point talking|to the minority leader.
{7040}{7093}Our troubles are coming|from our own party.
{7097}{7127}Seab Cooley.
{7131}{7199}We can work out a deal with old Seab.
{7203}{7256}He says we can work out a deal with Seab.
{7266}{7331}-Who's with you?|-Stanley Danta.
{7336}{7415}Stan's always right there|on the job, isn't he?
{7420}{7500}He's the best whip ever in the Senate.|Tell him I said so.
{7510}{7571}He says you're the best whip|we've ever had.
{7587}{7687}Tell him the best whip we've ever had|says Seab Cooley will trade for one thing:
{7692}{7722}Leffingwell's head.
{7726}{7755}What'd he say, Bob?
{7760}{7819}That Seab won't trade on this,|and he's right.
{7828}{7900}We've licked Cooley before.|We can do it again.
{7904}{7991}Then we'd better get at it.|Suppose you start with Tom August.
{7996}{8104}-When did Tom become a Cooley man?|-He isn't. He's not a Leffingwell man either.
{8108}{8182}Since he's chair of Foreign Relations|we have to sweeten him up.
{8186}{8269}I'll call him in right away.|Good luck, Bobby.
{8297}{8368}-Oh, boy.|-You want off this one?
{8372}{8427}I'm with you, Bob.
{8458}{8543}There's no doubt|he's made a wild pitch...
{8547}{8623}...but I'd like to back him up|all I can right now.
{8628}{8673}Sure, I know.
{9168}{9199}Hello, Bob, Stan.
{9204}{9273}-Good morning, senator.|-Come on in.
{9319}{9432}About 5'8", blond, a little cleft|in the chin, black dress, mink stole.
{9436}{9515}Sorry. Didn't see anybody|answer to that description.
{9540}{9580}Why don't you get married, Lafe?
{9584}{9671}A United States senator should stabilize|with a good, solid marriage.
{9675}{9716}If I did, I couldn't get elected.
{9720}{9780}It's the unmarried mothers|who put me in office.
{9784}{9826}Why don't you stabilize yourself?
{9830}{9895}There's a difference between|widowers and bachelors.
{9899}{9933}Widowers have more dignity.
{9937}{10079}-How do you feel about this lollapalooza?|-I think the president's nuts to name him.
{10083}{10115}But I'll vote for him.
{10120}{10199}What about your friend Brig Anderson?|Think he'll jump the whale?
{10204}{10307}-Leffingwell scuttled his power bill.|-Brig won't be influenced by that.
{10312}{10371}-Not on this.|-I'm trying to count a few noses.
{10376}{10448}-Suppose you give Brig a ring to make sure.|-lf you like.
{10452}{10528}-Hello.|-Hello, Warren? Good morning. Bob Munson.
{10532}{10623}-Beating the bushes early, aren't you, Bob?|-I have a lot of bushes.
{10627}{10672}It's your garden, friend, not ours.
{10676}{10755}How many votes against Leffingwell|on your side of the aisle?
{10760}{10851}Somewhere between 1 7 and 20.|That's giving him the benefit of the doubt.
{10855}{10915}With the president's right|to name his cabinet?
{10920}{11006}Try that line on the members of your|own party. Say, Seab Cooley.
{11017}{11099}-Hello, Brig? How's the boy?|-Right in the middle of breakfast.
{11103}{11136}What's on your mind, Lafe?
{11140}{11226}Just wondered what you think about|the appointment. Crazy, huh?
{11236}{11304}-Think so?|-Well, it's gonna be a rough one.
{11308}{11346}I wouldn't be surprised.
{11350}{11428}-I thought you might be upset about it.|-Why would I be upset?
{11432}{11486}The trouble he gave you|on your power bill.
{11490}{11582}-That's right. He did, didn't he?|-You mean it's okay?
{11586}{11683}-ls that what Bob Munson wants to know?|-You got television on your phone?
{11687}{11734}Just a second, Lafe.
{11740}{11781}-You going, baby?|-Yeah.
{11785}{11821}-You still love me?|-Yeah.
{11825}{11868}-How much?|-That much.
{11872}{11925}Time for her bus, Brig.
{11929}{11992}Have a nice time in school today, honey.
{12050}{12101}-Lafe?|- Yeah.
{12105}{12165}Look, I'm not grinding|an ax for Leffingwell...
{12169}{12235}...but I'm not gonna commit myself|right now either.
{12239}{12327}I'd like to wait and hear what he has to say|at the committee hearing.
{12331}{12443}Apart from that, I'm just gonna sit back|and watch Seab Cooley light up the sky.
{12956}{13023}Had your fire and brimstone|this morning, Seab?
{13027}{13096}Yes, sir, Mr. Majority Leader.
{13100}{13179}Laced with hot bourbon|and branch water.
{13183}{13259}I expect you can see the flames|coming out of my ears.
{13264}{13299}Can we have a little talk?
{13304}{13361}If you mean about|Mr. Robert A. Leffingwell...
{13365}{13463}-...it'd be a fruitless conversation.|-The president, the party and l...
{13467}{13523}...would take it as a favor|if you'd lay off.
{13527}{13598}I honor the president, I love my party...
{13602}{13720}...and I admire you, Mr. Majority Leader,|except where it crosses with my convictions.
{13724}{13813}I believe Mr. Robert A. Leffingwell|will lead us straight to perdition.
{13817}{13862}Come on, we know what's eating you.
{13866}{13948}Leffingwell made a liar out of you|in a hearing five years ago.
{13952}{14057}-It's a long time to carry a grudge, Seab.|-Maybe for a young fellow like you.
{14061}{14187}In my table of time, it happened just|like yesterday. Good day, gentlemen.
{14243}{14343}Scares you, doesn't it?|All that 40 years in the Senate.
{14433}{14473}Good morning, Seab.
{14490}{14557}-I was just gonna call your office.|-On the run, Fred.
{14561}{14653}I know. We've all gotta hop for this one,|but we'll put Leffingwell over.
{14657}{14745}Boy, he is it, Bob. He's really it.|He's a great man, a great talent.
{14749}{14835}-I'm throwing my organization behind this.|-You got an organization?
{14839}{14874}Are you kidding?
{14879}{14946}Eight chapters in eight cities,|my peace organization.
{14950}{15023}Who you making peace with?|The Kickapoo lndians?
{15028}{15066}You find peace amusing?
{15070}{15162}It's just that Stan's on the lndian Affairs|subcommittee, isn't it, Stan?
{15166}{15207}I'll be with you in a minute.
{15211}{15335}Fred, what do those guys do|besides strew roses in your path?
{15340}{15393}Just my brain trust.
{15397}{15461}You can't hold a senator's job|by kissing babies...
{15465}{15541}...and shaking hands, you know. Bob....
{15589}{15645}The hearing will go|to a subcommittee, right?
{15649}{15730}I haven't any word from Tom August yet.|I don't know his plan.
{15734}{15820}Well, if it does--|I say, if it does, I don't wanna push....
{15824}{15908}Whoever's made subcommittee chair|should be pro-Leffingwell, right?
{15912}{15942}Possibly.
{15946}{16083}Well, I've done my share of the hack work.|I ought to be in line for a spot like this.
{16088}{16166}Fred, right now I'm just trying|to get the situation in hand.
{16170}{16226}I know, but I wanted|to get my bid in early.
{16230}{16319}I've gotta fly to New York for the afternoon|and meet my eastern group.
{16324}{16416}-Suppose I call you later on?|-Yeah. Do that. Call me.
{16716}{16795}-Van Ackerman's looking for a horse to ride.|-He won't get it from me.
{16800}{16859}He won't care.|He doesn't belong here, Bob.
{16863}{16930}-You'll have to cut him off the vine.|-He'll fall off.
{16934}{16994}-Morning, Bess.|-Morning, senator. Your calls.
{16998}{17067}-First, see if you can get me Leffingwell.|-Yes, sir.
{17071}{17139}Sir, 21 9 telegrams so far.
{17143}{17219}-Most of them favorable to Leffingwell.|-Good.
{17230}{17311}-Good morning, senator.|-Morning.
{17615}{17695}-Leffingwell residence.|-Senator Munson calling Mr. Leffingwell.
{17699}{17757}Senator Munson? Wait a minute.
{17891}{17977}-Dad, it's Senator Munson on the phone.|-What?
{17984}{18058}The phone. It's Senator Munson.
{18083}{18145}-Tell him I've gone out.|-Why?
{18149}{18222}Because he'll want me to do things|that might obligate me.
{18226}{18338}Why do you want me to lie? If you're in,|you're in. If you're out, you're out.
{18342}{18407}Son, this is a Washington, D.C.|kind of lie.
{18411}{18514}That's when the other person knows you're|lying, and also knows you know he knows.
{18518}{18563}-Follow?|-No.
{18567}{18673}-Senator Munson will understand.|-Okay, if you say so.
{18832}{18871}He's not here. He went out.
{18876}{18937}-Do you know where I might reach him?|-No, ma'am.
{18941}{19060}-He didn't leave a forwarding address.|-Oh, I see. Well, thank you.
{19092}{19182}-I can't reach Mr. Leffingwell, senator.|-All right, Bess.
{19186}{19249}-I'll take these calls down the line.|-Yes, sir.
{19253}{19341}Wouldn't you think he'd know|we'd know he's dodging us?
{19345}{19424}He might become the best|secretary of state we'll ever have.
{19532}{19595}Want me to make you one of these?
{19625}{19708}-Thanks just the same.|-It's good.
{19728}{19832}-Don't you wanna be secretary of state?|-Think I should want to?
{19836}{19924}-Big job.|-That's a fact.
{19928}{20003}-I think you ought to want it.|-Why?
{20007}{20106}Well, you know. All that trouble,|and war and stuff like that.
{20110}{20178}Maybe you could do something about it.
{20184}{20263}-I'd like to try.|-That's the way I'd figure it.
{20268}{20326}It's worth a try.
{20373}{20459}As you get to the top of the stairway,|look at the painting on the right.
{20464}{20551}This painting portrays one of the worst|conflicts of the Mexican War.
{20555}{20612}In this painting, it's interesting to note...
{20616}{20684}...that Lieutenants Lee and Grant|fought side by side.
{20688}{20749}They were classmates at West Roint,|as you know.
{20753}{20859}The skylight came from Rhiladelphia.|It was placed there in 1 859.
{20863}{20932}The medallions in the skylight|are hand-painted.
{20936}{21013}They were done by Gibson and Company|and placed there in 1 859.
{21017}{21083}-Good morning, Max.|-Miss Harrison, Lady Maudulayne.
{21088}{21156}-Good morning, Maxwell.|-Max, this is Madame Barre.
{21160}{21211}Her husband is the new|French ambassador.
{21216}{21294}-Welcome to the Senate, madame.|-Thank you.
{21410}{21477}-Good morning, Lady Maudulayne.|-Good morning.
{21568}{21630}-Good morning.|-Good morning.
{21985}{22040}Bob. How are you?
{22080}{22135}Good morning, Orrin.|Everything all right?
{22139}{22248}Bob, it's going around the Leffingwell|hearing might be set for tomorrow.
{22252}{22293}That's rushing things, isn't it?
{22297}{22374}As we need a secretary of state,|I wouldn't say it's rushing.
{22378}{22442}Senator Strickland, wouldn't you say|that's sudden?
{22446}{22534}Senator Munson's party is going to be|strongly divided on Leffingwell.
{22538}{22628}Perhaps the senator would push it through|before that division ruptures.
{22632}{22729}I wonder if the minority leader is qualified|to speak for the majority party.
{22733}{22840}On the right of that aisle is the minority,|and on the left is the majority.
{22844}{22887}All of those are left?
{22892}{22992}-Does America have so many leftists?|-Oh, no, darling. It's purely geographical.
{22996}{23108}I mean, they're all Republicans or Democrats.|No communists or anything of that sort.
{23112}{23204}They do have liberal types,|but they don't necessarily sit on the left...
{23208}{23273}...conservatives don't necessarily|sit on the right.
{23336}{23367}Boys.
{23372}{23434}-Bill.|-Aaron, nice to see you.
{23438}{23511}That man, the one on the dais,|Harley Hudson.
{23515}{23571}He's the vice president|of the United States.
{23575}{23655}-He's very attractive.|-Yes, dear. Harley's very sweet.
{23660}{23723}He's from one of those|odd little states, isn't he?
{23728}{23784}He was governor of Delaware, you mean.
{23788}{23895}-He's the president of the Senate, Celestine.|-But you said he's the vice president.
{23900}{24001}It's confusing. We'd call him Lord|High Chamberlain or something sensible.
{24005}{24115}It's very sensible. His job,|as vice president of the country...
{24120}{24216}...is to preside over the Senate,|which makes him its president.
{24220}{24268}-Then he's also a senator.|-No.
{24272}{24371}He presides over the Senate,|but he's not a senator. He can't even vote.
{24376}{24420}He can vote in case of a tie.
{24424}{24483}The Senate will come to order.
{24502}{24572}The chaplain will now offer prayer.
{24584}{24661}Our Father, in these days|of stress and strain...
{24665}{24733}...when men are called upon|to bear great burdens...
{24737}{24837}...give this Senate the strength|and charity...
{24841}{24954}...to ascertain of each who would serve|his nation his true nature and purpose...
{24958}{25036}...Iest through inadvertence|and oversight...
{25040}{25131}...there slip into seats of power,|those who would misguide...
{25136}{25177}...and mislead this great people.
{25181}{25246}Even the parson is getting into|the Leffingwell act.
{25250}{25371}Your blessings, O Lord,|and help them to serve in your ways.
{25376}{25407}Amen.
{25515}{25551}Mr. President.
{25556}{25611}Recognize the senior senator|from Michigan.
{25616}{25716}I ask unanimous consent that the journal|of yesterday's proceedings be approved.
{25720}{25767}Without objection? So ordered.
{25771}{25847}Mr. Rresident, I suggest|the absence of a quorum.
{25851}{25895}Absence of a quorum suggested.
{25900}{25959}-Clerk will call the roll.|-Mr. Abbott....
{26386}{26527}Finish your story. Bob's got the Linotype.|Somebody's bound to pop on Leffingwell.
{26626}{26682}Call to the post early, huh?
{26808}{26875}Better wake up, Senator McCafferty.
{26940}{27055}-Senator, quorum call.|-Opposed, sir. Diametrically opposed.
{27059}{27124}No, no, senator. It's a quorum call.
{27169}{27239}Mr. Ardell.
{27243}{27289}-Mr. Ashley.|-Here.
{27310}{27371}-Take over for a few minutes?|-Oh, sure.
{27376}{27419}Mr. Bellingham?
{27423}{27510}-Mr. Bender of California?|-Present.
{27514}{27638}-Bob? Where's Seab?|-Oh, he'll make an entrance pretty soon.
{27642}{27738}-Can I help with Leffingwell?|-Can't think of a thing. We'll just mark time.
{27742}{27802}I'll gladly talk to anybody you want me to.
{27806}{27868}-Excuse me.|-Tom August came from the White House.
{27872}{27933}-ln the cloak room.|-Sit in for me.
{27937}{28028}-What's going on, Stan?|-Oh, hi, Harley. Looks like a bumpy day.
{28032}{28099}I was asking Bob if I could do|anything to help.
{28103}{28139}Filling up, huh?
{28144}{28201}Funny how they can always|smell gunpowder.
{28205}{28241}Yeah.
{28245}{28352}Did I tell you I murdered my wife last night,|buried her under a kumquat bush?
{28356}{28441}Oh, well.... Easy come, easy go.
{28445}{28493}What? What did you say?
{28497}{28616}I said I might as well get up there|and let the tourists rubberneck at me.
{28620}{28718}-I'm sorry, Harley.|-All right. Forget it. Forget it.
{28725}{28767}-Excuse me.|-Sure.
{28785}{28859}-Hello, Bob.|-Morning, Tom.
{28871}{28939}The president wants a closed hearing.
{28954}{28995}That's impossible.
{29000}{29095}Cooley would find a way to open it up|if he had to use a can opener.
{29100}{29142}That's what I told him.
{29146}{29228}We'll have to name a subcommittee|and let it go at that.
{29232}{29335}-Who do you have in mind to chair it?|-I thought Powell Hanson.
{29340}{29402}It'll look like you're rigging it|for Leffingwell.
{29406}{29467}Put him on the committee,|but not as chairman.
{29471}{29544}It's got to be somebody|who can handle Cooley.
{29548}{29610}What would you think|of Fred Van Ackerman?
{29614}{29660}Caught you too, huh?
{29664}{29735}-Got me out of bed this morning.|-Well?
{29739}{29783}I don't know.
{29788}{29841}The man has no tact.
{29845}{29903}Of course, he could cope with Seab.
{29917}{29983}So could Brig Anderson over there.
{29988}{30031}I thought of Brig.
{30035}{30117}But he's Fred Van Ackerman's junior.|Fred would split a gut.
{30121}{30208}Let him split. Brig knows|how to be a senator.
{30212}{30303}All right. Let's tag him and get organized.
{30372}{30463}-Brig, may we interrupt for a moment?|-Sure.
{30467}{30585}Brig, how would you feel about handling|the subcommittee on Leffingwell?
{30589}{30631}-I'd feel fine.|-Bob.
{30635}{30724}Orrin Knox is up on Leffingwell,|and Seab is warming up.
{30728}{30787}Here we go, gentlemen.
{30896}{30975}The president must have known|the reaction would be adverse...
{30980}{31053}...for the name Leffingwell|is synonymous with arrogance...
{31057}{31116}...and an eggheaded|determination to ignore....
{31120}{31183}When have you let somebody|else do your dirty work?
{31188}{31225}You mean Orrin Knox, Bob?
{31229}{31348}You find Orrin doing somebody else's|dirty work, and that'll be a pretty do.
{31352}{31467}-The office of federal power committee...|-This was a complete surprise.
{31471}{31509}...which he now administrates.
{31513}{31608}And in each of these, he has,|under the protection of the president...
{31612}{31683}...gone his own way|without consultation...
{31688}{31748}...with the appropriate committee|of the Senate.
{31752}{31805}Mr. President, will the senator yield?
{31809}{31880}I will yield when I complete|the text of my statement.
{31884}{31979}Mr. President, I only wish to ask the senator|how long he intends to speak.
{31984}{32061}Was the senator planning to speak|for about 1 5 minutes?
{32065}{32100}Nice try, Robert.
{32104}{32223}Mr. Rresident, the esteemed majority leader|is trying to trap me into a time limit.
{32228}{32294}Well, since he has trotted out|this wheezy device...
{32298}{32371}...he must expect|the usual wheezy answer.
{32376}{32453}I certainly expect to speak|longer than 1 5 minutes.
{32457}{32535}-lndeed, I may speak 1 5 hours.|-Attaboy, Orrin.
{32540}{32630}I might also say that I do not need any|coaching from the sidelines...
{32634}{32702}...from the esteemed senator|from South Carolina.
{32706}{32805}I would like to make it plain|that my opinions are my own...
{32809}{32910}...and they do not reflect those|of the senator from South Carolina.
{32914}{33003}Now, if I might continue|without interruption.
{33007}{33102}This nomination is being handled|with an underhanded attempt...
{33107}{33210}...to press the senator into silence and|railroad this nomination through Senate.
{33214}{33296}Mr. President,|will the senator yield for a question?
{33300}{33402}I have no intention of yielding to|the majority leader or the majority whip.
{33406}{33480}They have no purpose but to block|criticism of Leffingwell.
{33484}{33572}Will my good friend and colleague,|the distinguished senior senator...
{33576}{33627}...from lllinois, yield the floor to me?
{33632}{33722}Under the circumstances, and because|we see eye to eye in this matter...
{33726}{33842}...I consider it a privilege to yield to the able|and respected senator from South Carolina.
{33846}{33993}Thank you, sir. Mr. Rresident, I must defend|my distinguished colleague from lllinois.
{33997}{34080}It appears that he is beset|on every side by snarling enemies.
{34084}{34207}Yet it was his intention only to give voice|to the simple complaint...
{34212}{34276}...many of us feel on both sides|of the aisle.
{34280}{34349}An honest revulsion...
{34353}{34429}...at this nomination the president|has thrown in our teeth.
{34433}{34488}Mr. President, will this senator yield?
{34492}{34578}I'll not yield, sir, but I will say for you|what you'd say anyway...
{34582}{34663}...that this is not the time|for personal imputations.
{34667}{34726}Will that satisfy the senator?
{34755}{34809}Was there no other man than this...
{34813}{34873}...this Robert A. Leffingwell?
{34877}{35006}Is our storehouse of brainpower|so impoverished, that for this office...
{35010}{35095}...which can affect the destiny|of our nation, of the world...
{35100}{35173}...there is no other man|but Robert A. Leffingwell?
{35177}{35254}I find that hard, indeed,|impossible to believe.
{35258}{35307}Will the distinguished senator yield?
{35311}{35341}Well, now...
{35345}{35419}...for my young, handsome...
{35424}{35492}...and plenipotent colleague,|I will gladly yield.
{35496}{35577}Looks like Seab's gonna have|roast Lafe Smith for lunch.
{35595}{35714}Does the senior senator from South Carolina|think he knows more than the president...
{35719}{35811}...about what or who is needed,|in these perilous times...
{35815}{35878}...in the office of secretary of state?
{35882}{35918}Yes, senator.
{35923}{36023}Even one so young and green as|the junior senator from Rhode lsland...
{36027}{36112}...would have chosen another man.|Wouldn't you say that's the truth?
{36116}{36236}The senator assumes an infallibility of|knowledge, which denotes a closed mind...
{36240}{36291}...and an aged crust of prejudice.
{36309}{36344}Who ate who?
{36348}{36392}Mr. President...
{36396}{36455}...we have here an example...
{36459}{36559}...of the commotion this man,|Leffingwell, can arouse.
{36563}{36682}Able, sensitive young senators,|taught courtesy at their mothers' knees...
{36686}{36771}...turn upon their elders and rend them|because of their passions...
{36776}{36862}...over this disturbing man,|Robert A. Leffingwell.
{36866}{37014}I beseech senators to contemplate|the spectacle we are making of ourselves.
{37018}{37058}Why?
{37074}{37175}What is causing this bitterness|of division in our party? Leffingwell.
{37180}{37332}Who is disrupting the cordial flow|of legislative interchange? Leffingwell.
{37336}{37384}Who is turning this Senate...
{37388}{37465}...into a cockpit of angry emotion?
{37469}{37499}Leffingwell.
{37503}{37622}I abominate this man Leffingwell.|He is an evil man.
{37635}{37753}He will pursue a policy of appeasements!
{37757}{37852}He will weaken the moral fiber|of our great nation.
{37856}{37948}He will bring destruction to our traditions.
{37952}{38029}And I beg you, senators, reject him.
{38033}{38084}Reject him!
{38191}{38288}-Barney, you look wonderful tonight.|-Thank you, Mrs. Harrison.
{38300}{38400}-Betty, do you know the senator?|-Yes, we've met.
{38404}{38471}Shall we have a spin around the floor?
{38576}{38612}Hi, Lafe.
{38721}{38800}-Having fun?|-Having a lovely time. Thanks.
{39072}{39116}-Can I get you a drink?|-No, thanks.
{39120}{39210}I will make my government's position|on Mr. Leffingwell very clear.
{39214}{39269}In some ways, he's excellent.
{39273}{39321}But in others, not so excellent.
{39325}{39378}In general, I would say we are for him.
{39382}{39449}Except when it comes to those|features of character...
{39453}{39528}...in which we might be disposed|to be against him.
{39532}{39631}On the whole, that is my government's|position. Yes, exactly.
{39635}{39755}Yes, the inscrutable East can always|be depended upon to be inscrutable.
{39766}{39854}-Enjoy your dance, darling?|-The senator dances beautifully.
{39858}{39939}Well, Lafe is not exactly|the log-cabin type.
{39944}{40016}Rowell, the senator is coming|to lunch tomorrow.
{40020}{40092}We'll be honored. You'll be|our first guest at the embassy.
{40096}{40167}-You're very kind.|-Bob, see you a minute?
{40176}{40219}Will you excuse me?
{40346}{40436}-Didn't see you at dinner, Fred.|-I just got here.
{40440}{40512}Why didn't you take my call|from New York this afternoon?
{40516}{40618}I didn't want to take your call.|Is that an honest enough answer?
{40622}{40684}You were reaching|for Brig Anderson all the time?
{40688}{40766}No. But we weren't reaching|for you, either.
{40770}{40822}-He's in the club, isn't he?|-What club?
{40826}{40903}Don't give me that.|The inner circle, the clique, the club.
{40907}{40999}Look, Fred, you forced me|to offend you. I'm sorry.
{41003}{41105}All right. I'm willing to forget it.|I'll still campaign for Leffingwell.
{41109}{41187}Fine, Fred, but let's not irritate|the situation.
{41191}{41305}Robert Leffingwell is the difference between|peace and war. I mean to fight for him.
{41839}{41952}-Being exclusive, Harley?|-Just escaping for a moment.
{41956}{41987}From the ladies?
{42047}{42139}Do you mind if I ask you a question|that a vice president shouldn't ask?
{42143}{42226}You mean like,|" How's the president's health? "
{42231}{42310}I haven't seen him in six weeks.|He never calls me in.
{42314}{42389}-I don't think he means to slight you.|-He probably does.
{42393}{42443}But that's not why I'm asking.
{42459}{42542}Look, I know I'm only Charming Harley,|the housewives' delight.
{42546}{42659}I know I was only a compromise candidate|for vice president or I wouldn't be here.
{42663}{42772}I never expected to be president, and I hope|to God I never will be, and I mean that.
{42776}{42841}But the town's boiling|with rumors about his health.
{42845}{42932}If they're true, I should at least be told.
{42936}{42966}All right.
{42970}{43032}But this is just my own opinion.
{43036}{43133}I don't think the surgery last year|was successful.
{43155}{43227}Well, I was once the happy governor|of Delaware...
{43232}{43330}...counting revenue from corporative setups|and having tea with the du Ronts.
{43334}{43427}-Now--|-lt hasn't happened yet. Maybe it won't.
{43432}{43505}Bob, I'm not sure I've got the stuff|to be president.
{43509}{43547}Has anybody?
{43552}{43614}Most presidents have to grow up|in the job anyway.
{43618}{43719}The country could go to hell before|I'd grow big enough to see over the desk.
{43723}{43814}Humility is not the worst attitude|you could have toward this job.
{43818}{43890}It's a nice word for the shakes, "humility."
{43894}{44011}In any case, you're the only vice president|we have, so the Constitution says.
{44018}{44126}Leffingwell is not only an appeaser,|but a spendthrift to boot.
{44130}{44209}He can throw more money out|of the back door with a teaspoon...
{44213}{44280}...than the government can bring in|with a shovel.
{44284}{44383}He'll stage a giveaway to the communists|that'll make Munich look like a clambake.
{44388}{44456}What do you pump-order politicians|think the world's like?
{44460}{44555}Wanna get us bombed out of existence|for some lousy, two-bit country...
{44560}{44599}...that can't even feed itself?
{44603}{44676}We have got to think of ourselves,|first and last.
{44680}{44754}Would the senator yield the floor?
{44761}{44824}This is no laughing matter to me,|Mrs. Harrison.
{44828}{44900}Then perhaps this isn't the place|to discuss it.
{44920}{44966}Excuse me.
{45019}{45102}-I'm terribly sorry, Dolly.|-Nonsense, Orrin.
{45112}{45218}Why, Mr. Leffingwell does cause|excitement, doesn't he?
{47376}{47442}-ls that you, darling?|-Hi.
{47593}{47659}How did it go tonight, darling?
{47663}{47755}Like any party you give. A smasher.
{47801}{47861}You're the best there is, pet.
{47865}{47956}Somebody said once,|a friend of mine, I'm sure...
{47960}{48083}...that any bitch with a million bucks,|and a big house and a good caterer...
{48087}{48167}...could be a social success in Washington.
{48212}{48257}Do you think I'm a bitch?
{48276}{48337}A perfectly nice one, if you are.
{48347}{48434}And I'm probably the first man in your life|since your husband died.
{48438}{48476}That's not a question.
{48495}{48552}Don't feel obliged to volunteer information.
{48556}{48597}You are.
{48632}{48723}How long do you think I'm going to keep up|this backstairs romance?
{48727}{48768}Front elevator.
{48772}{48830}Elevator is right. At my age, I need it.
{48834}{48913}Oh, your age. You're as virile|as a billy goat...
{48917}{49002}...and make noises|like a wounded spaniel.
{49014}{49101}-No marriage, huh?|-And spoil this convenient arrangement?
{49105}{49151}Don't be silly.
{49155}{49220}I think you're afraid|I won't get elected next time.
{49224}{49305}No girl wants to be married to a has-been.
{49313}{49397}-Well, we've got that established.|-And I'm sleepy.
{49401}{49448}Are you sleepy?
{49804}{49868}Will the committee come to order, please?
{49880}{49968}I'll ask the witness to take his place|at the witness table.
{50104}{50183}This hearing of the subcommittee of the|Senate Foreign Relations Committee...
{50188}{50294}...is being held to consider the president's|nomination of Robert A. Leffingwell...
{50298}{50351}...for secretary of state.
{50364}{50463}Mr. Leffingwell, I'm sure you know|all the members of the committee here.
{50467}{50534}Senator Cooley is not|a member of the subcommittee...
{50538}{50613}...but the full committee voted|him permission to join us...
{50617}{50668}...for the purposes of cross-examination.
{50672}{50743}I welcome Senator Cooley's|participation, Mr. Chairman.
{50747}{50842}If not wholeheartedly,|certainly without fear.
{50847}{50875}I commend your courage.
{50880}{50967}Frankly, the senator|scares the wits out of everybody else.
{50972}{51044}Would you please stand|and raise your right hand?
{51064}{51155}Do you swear that the statements|you are about to give this committee...
{51159}{51261}...will be the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
{51265}{51327}-Yes, sir, I do.|-Thank you.
{51467}{51514}-Sorry, Brig.|-Not at all, Fred.
{51518}{51574}I'm particularly interested in this hearing.
{51578}{51663}I hope Mr. Leffingwell obtains|swift approval from this committee.
{51675}{51751}I thank the senator for his comments.
{51771}{51842}Mr. Leffingwell, I'm sure you have|a statement to make...
{51846}{51896}...before the interrogation begins.
{51900}{52011}Mr. Chairman, I believe I might serve this|committee best by answering its questions.
{52015}{52055}As you wish.
{52061}{52118}Senator Knox, would you like to begin?
{52122}{52208}Don't you feel we're worth the effort|of an opening statement?
{52212}{52262}I'm only being practical, senator.
{52266}{52339}Well, then I too shall be practical,|Mr. Leffingwell.
{52344}{52391}Are you loyal to the United States?
{52396}{52475}I don't mind admitting|that I'm loyal to the United States.
{52512}{52593}But it wasn't an idle question,|Mr. Leffingwell.
{52597}{52701}I've had some complaints against things|you've said in some of your speeches...
{52705}{52760}...about our relations|with the communists.
{52764}{52818}Some go so far as to say|you're not loyal.
{52822}{52942}-There's no foundation for that, senator.|-I have a quote from one of your speeches.
{52955}{53064}"We must not bind ourselves|to outworn principles of the past...
{53068}{53213}...when we find those principles standing|in the way of affirmative action for peace."
{53223}{53298}-What does that mean?|-The past shouldn't lie too heavily...
{53302}{53372}...upon our present efforts|to achieve world stability.
{53376}{53457}You say "outworn principles of the past."
{53461}{53515}Well, what principles|did you have in mind?
{53520}{53601}I meant more a state of mind.|Perhaps the word "principle"...
{53605}{53703}-...was not a good choice.|-Orrin, is that speech you got there...
{53708}{53795}-...about defense mobilization?|-No, foreign policy.
{53800}{53911}Mr. Chairman, the witness is the director|of the Office of Defense Mobilization.
{53916}{53983}What's he doing making speeches|about foreign policy?
{53988}{54087}You reckon he was bucking|for the job of secretary of state?
{54111}{54200}I responded to an invitation|from the Chamber of Commerce of Chicago.
{54204}{54271}The topic they gave me|to speak on was foreign policy.
{54288}{54400}I've seen men angling|for high office, Mr. Chairman.
{54404}{54499}That's the way they do it. They make|speeches. They flaunt themselves.
{54504}{54581}-That's how they do it. Yes, sir.|-ln fact, Mr. Leffingwell...
{54585}{54681}...this was only one of a series of speeches|on foreign policy, wasn't it?
{54685}{54727}Yes, sir, that's true.
{54752}{54798}He made speeches. So what?
{54802}{54845}We all make speeches.
{54849}{54944}Mr. Leffingwell, you said you merely|meant to suggest a state of mind--
{54948}{54987}This is a cute committee here.
{54992}{55091}Do you think it's wrong to suspect|the good faith of the communists...
{55096}{55146}...after four decades of dishonor?
{55150}{55223}All things change.|It wouldn't hurt to assume at times...
{55228}{55281}...a desire for peace from the communists.
{55285}{55377}On what basis?|These pious, hopeful men, Mr. Chairman.
{55381}{55435}These wool-gathering optimists.
{55439}{55530}Mr. Chairman, can't we get along|without this kind of questioning?
{55534}{55643}At the risk of seeming discourteous to the|distinguished senator from South Carolina...
{55648}{55727}...I'll remind him he's here|at the sufferance of the committee.
{55740}{55875}I thank the esteemed chairman|for his courteous chastisement.
{55879}{56010}Mr. Leffingwell, do I understand|you wish to placate the communists?
{56014}{56119}Not placate. But neither do I want to kill|any chance of agreement before it starts.
{56124}{56201}In an agreement, what terms|do you think would be valid?
{56209}{56276}I can't answer that|without given circumstances.
{56287}{56382}-Will the senator yield?|-lf the senator will be brief.
{56387}{56445}The senator wouldn't want me|to be too brief...
{56449}{56509}...where the fate of my country|is concerned.
{56513}{56663}Why are you afraid to tell us what terms|you'd make with the communists?
{56668}{56756}-I just explained to Senator Knox--|-You're evading.
{56760}{56859}We want to know what you intend|to give away to the communists.
{56863}{56973}-I don't intend to give anything away.|-Why won't you tell us what your terms are?
{56977}{57049}Are you ashamed to disclose these terms?
{57053}{57115}I have nothing to be ashamed of,|and you know it.
{57119}{57196}He is not responding, Mr. Chairman.
{57200}{57274}This man is hiding something.
{57278}{57354}Senator Knox, reclaim the floor.|This is getting us nowhere.
{57358}{57475}I resent the chair's arbitrary attempt|to silence cross-examination...
{57480}{57535}...that'll show this man's true intent.
{57539}{57640}It is common knowledge that no one,|nowhere, and at no time...
{57644}{57743}...has been able to silence the distinguished|senator from South Carolina.
{57764}{57904}Well, sir, I might say the chairman's|doing a pretty good job of it right now.
{57938}{58043}If you feel the witness is hiding something,|would you care to make a formal charge?
{58057}{58138}Well, now, that'll just upset everybody.
{58142}{58213}I'll just turn the floor back|to Senator Knox.
{58217}{58260}No more right now, Mr. Chairman.
{58277}{58349}-Senator Velez?|-Mr. Leffingwell...
{58353}{58471}...what associations did you have when|teaching at the University of Chicago?
{58475}{58574}The usual campus associations.|Other teachers, students.
{58578}{58647}I have here a telegram|from someone named Gelman...
{58652}{58733}...who claims to have known you|at the university.
{58741}{58806}Do you recognize the name?
{58810}{58895}I don't think so, but that was quite|a few years ago, senator.
{58899}{59007}Well, he says you associated|with left-wingers and communists.
{59012}{59072}Is there anything to that, Mr. Leffingwell?
{59076}{59139}I'd like to know what|Mr. Gelman means by...
{59143}{59249}..."left-wingers" or "communists." Those|terms are used carelessly by some people.
{59253}{59303}Will Mr. Gelman be called to testify?
{59308}{59352}I'm unable to find Mr. Gelman.
{59356}{59451}Senator, I don't know what to say,|except the telegram is from some crank.
{59456}{59552}-Senator from Hawaii.|-Just a hypothetical question.
{59562}{59644}If the communists demand|we yield certain strategic positions...
{59648}{59722}-...what would you recommend?|-We reject any such demand.
{59726}{59762}Even if it meant war?
{59775}{59908}That's an unlikely hypothesis if we retain|our present power of retaliation.
{59912}{59953}Say it did happen.
{59957}{60010}Would you recommend|a preventive attack?
{60016}{60057}Hit the enemy before they hit us?
{60061}{60167}No, I wouldn't recommend a preventive|attack. I would first try to bargain...
{60171}{60263}...try to agree to some of their demands|if they'd agree to some of ours.
{60267}{60366}With the senator's permission, I'd like|to make a little speech to the witness.
{60370}{60493}Mr. Witness, I'd rather go out of this world|standing on my two hind legs...
{60497}{60622}...fighting like a man for things I believe in,|than to yield and concede and crawl...
{60626}{60708}...till there was nothing left|of our freedoms and way of life...
{60712}{60823}...but a handful of lost dreams|and a fistful of dry dust.
{60875}{60991}Mr. Chairman, it's mighty comforting|to know that all the folks out there...
{60996}{61060}...aren't being took in|by this appeasement talk.
{61084}{61192}Mr. Chairman, a little while ago,|Senator Knox asked me to define...
{61196}{61259}...what I meant by "outworn principles."
{61264}{61355}Senator Cooley has obliged|with a perfect illustration.
{61360}{61447}He speaks of standing on his hind legs,|fighting like a man...
{61452}{61573}...as if war were still some rousing charge|up San Juan Hill...
{61584}{61660}...with flags flying and bugles sounding.
{61675}{61759}It's this kind of 1 9th-century notion|I was talking about.
{61764}{61896}This "don't tread on me,"|"walk softly and carry a big stick"...
{61900}{61999}..."damn the torpedoes,"|"full speed ahead" state of mind.
{62003}{62070}Senator Cooley's state of mind.
{62285}{62384}It seems to me that the senator from|South Carolina was speaking out of pride.
{62388}{62500}Do you think we should discontinue pride|in our freedoms and our way of life?
{62504}{62647}I believe it's dangerous to negotiate survival|with pride determining our attitude.
{62652}{62731}I wonder if there isn't good sense|in what Senator Cooley said.
{62736}{62799}I wonder if we can't become too equivocal.
{62803}{62878}I wonder if we can't reason away,|in the name of survival...
{62882}{62930}...everything worth surviving for.
{62938}{63053}That's a hard line to walk, but we have|no choice but to try and walk it.
{63060}{63132}I'm sorry to say we can't always know|where we're going.
{63136}{63200}As long as we know|where we're not going.
{63214}{63274}Any questions, Senator Hendershot?
{63282}{63370}You're what they call an egghead,|aren't you, Mr. Witness?
{63397}{63509}I'm not only an egghead, senator,|I'm a premeditated egghead.
{63513}{63579}I set out to become an egghead,|and at this moment...
{63584}{63635}...I'm in full flower of eggheadedness.
{63639}{63695}I hope to shed pollen wherever I go.
{63740}{63837}If there are no objections, we can leave|them laughing while we have lunch.
{63841}{63913}We'll take it up again at 1 :30,|Mr. Leffingwell.
{64168}{64235}Do you think the committee's|trying to smear you?
{64239}{64295}They're asking what they feel|they should.
{64300}{64354}Some questions|have been smear questions.
{64358}{64423}Right now my main emphasis|is getting lunch.
{64428}{64479}If he won't answer that question, I will.
{64484}{64550}The committee is being used|to smear Mr. Leffingwell.
{64554}{64649}-What about that, Mr. Leffingwell?|-The senator is entitled to his opinion.
{64653}{64687}Will you excuse me, please?
{64692}{64765}You don't like how this hearing|is being conducted, do you?
{64769}{64839}The chairman should stop|these irresponsible questions.
{64843}{64928}He doesn't want to.|They're out to crucify Mr. Leffingwell.
{64932}{65034}Senator, Senator Van Ackerman is accusing|the committee of using smear tactics.
{65038}{65079}Would you comment on this?
{65084}{65195}If the senator has any complaints to make,|he should write a letter to his congressman.
{65199}{65279}-Will you give Seab Cooley a free hand?|-Oh, come on.
{65420}{65491}Do you believe war can be avoided,|Mr. Leffingwell?
{65495}{65622}I believe it must be avoided. But I don't|think we can avoid it by rattling sabers.
{65645}{65696}That's all, Mr. Chairman.
{65700}{65807}Now, Mr. Leffingwell, it becomes necessary|to turn you over to the tender mercies...
{65811}{65933}-...of the senator from South Carolina.|-I'm girded for the occasion, Mr. Chairman.
{65949}{66025}Thank you, Mr. Chairman.|I have no questions, Mr. Chairman.
{66029}{66108}Then I don't see any reason|why we can't adjourn the hearing.
{66112}{66148}If there are no objections.
{66188}{66311}Would the nominee mind staying with us|for just a smidgen longer?
{66324}{66431}I said I have no questions, Mr. Chairman.|But I have a witness I would like to call.
{66445}{66482}Call your witness, senator.
{66487}{66547}Herbert Gelman.
{66722}{66832}Will the photographers|withdraw to the sidelines, please?
{66989}{67064}-Are you Herbert Gelman?|-That's my name.
{67084}{67138}Raise your right hand, please.
{67171}{67254}Do you swear the testimony|you are about to give this committee...
{67259}{67362}...will be the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
{67366}{67437}-Yes, sir, I swear.|-Take a seat, please.
{67540}{67581}Where do you live, Mr. Gelman?
{67585}{67707}At 2221 Grove Rlace Northeast,|here in Washington.
{67712}{67804}-Your occupation?|-I'm a clerk in the Treasury Department.
{67808}{67896}Did you send this telegram|to Senator Velez?
{67959}{68062}And, Mr. Gelman, would you mind|speaking just a little bit louder, please?
{68087}{68143}Yes. Yes.
{68160}{68236}Why didn't you include your address|so he could contact you?
{68240}{68347}-That was Senator Cooley's idea.|-What did Senator Cooley have to do with it?
{68352}{68434}He suggested that I send|a telegram to Senator Velez.
{68453}{68519}-ls this true, Senator Cooley?|-lt is, Mr. Chairman.
{68523}{68606}Why didn't you tell us when|Senator Velez introduced the telegram?
{68610}{68682}I was just giving the nominee|enough rope to hang himself.
{68687}{68789}I resent being used as a cat's-paw|by the senator from South Carolina.
{68793}{68863}I apologize to the senator from New Mexico.
{68868}{68992}The senator will forgive me when he hears|what this new witness has to say.
{69020}{69084}Do you know Robert Leffingwell,|Mr. Gelman?
{69101}{69174}-Yes, sir.|-lntimately?
{69184}{69222}Well, not intimately.
{69226}{69283}Well, how? On sight or how?
{69288}{69355}Well, closer than that.
{69359}{69455}I worked for the Federal Power Commission|when he was chairman.
{69460}{69503}In his office?
{69507}{69572}No, sir, at a subsidiary agency.
{69576}{69646}But I knew him before then in Chicago.
{69650}{69716}I was in one of his classes|at the university.
{69720}{69774}I see. Does he know you?
{69782}{69811}He ought to.
{69816}{69887}He fired me from|the Federal Rower Agency.
{69891}{69979}-For what reason were you fired?|-He wanted me out of the agency.
{69994}{70058}-I knew too much.|-About what?
{70062}{70103}About him.
{70112}{70155}What do you know about him?
{70160}{70218}He's a communist.
{70228}{70283}The nominee has|a right to cross-examine.
{70287}{70383}I was about to ask, Mr. Leffingwell,|if you'd like to cross-examine as we go.
{70388}{70451}Thank you, but I'll wait till he's finished.
{70471}{70523}Senator Cooley, he's all yours.
{70584}{70688}Now, sir, Mr. Herbert Gelman.
{70692}{70795}Will you please tell the committee|how you happened to be here.
{70799}{70870}I came to you about Mr. Leffingwell.
{70875}{70977}Now I want you to tell the committee,|and the nation...
{70981}{71039}...what you told me in my office.
{71043}{71087}Yes, sir.
{71101}{71174}When I was going|to the University of Chicago...
{71178}{71262}...I lived at 271 4 Carpenter Street.
{71274}{71426}I got to know a man, who also had|a room there, named Max Bukowski.
{71430}{71526}-And he--|-How do you spell that name, Mr. Gelman?
{71583}{71659}B-U-K-O-W-S-K-l.
{71666}{71714}Would you continue, please?
{71749}{71798}Bukowski invited me...
{71802}{71912}...to sit in on|political discussions in his room.
{71916}{71975}I went to several of these discussions...
{71980}{72121}...before I realized I was getting involved|in a communist cell, and I dropped out.
{72125}{72210}Who was in this communist cell?
{72214}{72261}Bukowski was the leader.
{72265}{72323}There was a man named James Morton.
{72327}{72385}And then there was|Mr. Robert Leffingwell.
{72389}{72447}You knew Mr. Leffingwell.
{72451}{72550}Well, like I said, I was in one|of his classes at the university.
{72554}{72695}Now I'll ask you to tell the committee|what was discussed at these meetings...
{72700}{72803}...but I want to tell the committee|that I in no way coached this witness.
{72807}{72880}The words that he uses|are his own words.
{72884}{72919}Mr. Gelman.
{72924}{73002}Max Bukowski was a dogmatic Marxist.
{73006}{73157}He didn't feel that communism would come|to America without violent revolution.
{73161}{73253}But James Morton and Mr. Leffingwell|felt that communism...
{73257}{73351}...would come as a result of the erosion|of our form of government.
{73355}{73483}I remember James Morton saying|that our principles would become outworn.
{73492}{73570}Now, it seems to me we've heard|that from somebody else today.
{73574}{73625}Not mentioning any names, of course.
{73629}{73695}Brig, we'll want verification|of this man's story.
{73700}{73794}-I thank the senator for pointing that out.|-Someone's got to point it out.
{73799}{73864}I'd advise you to demand verification.
{73874}{73931}I thank the senator for his advice.
{73936}{74003}Would the senator care to sit|with the committee?
{74008}{74074}Are you trying to choke me off, Brig?
{74078}{74123}Not at all, Fred.
{74128}{74159}Continue, please.
{74164}{74287}Now, Mr. Gelman, you told me something|about names in this communist cell.
{74292}{74367}Yes. Nobody used their right name.
{74372}{74447}Mr. Leffingwell was called Walker.
{74452}{74515}Bukowski was called Fitzgerald.
{74519}{74607}I never learned|James Morton's real name.
{74611}{74686}And they tried to give me|the name of Andrews.
{74690}{74734}About that time, I quit.
{74738}{74801}What happened when you quit?
{74805}{74890}Mr. Leffingwell failed me in his class|on government administration.
{74895}{74987}Why didn't you report all this|to the university authorities?
{74992}{75067}-I was afraid.|-And you're not afraid now.
{75071}{75127}Yes, I'm afraid.
{75131}{75208}But I couldn't stand by|and see a man like Mr. Leffingwell...
{75212}{75283}...get into a position of power|as secretary of state.
{75288}{75404}-Can you corroborate this, Mr. Gelman?|-The man's an eyewitness, under oath.
{75412}{75527}-I'm not lying!|-I didn't say you were lying.
{75544}{75662}Where can we find Max Bukowski|and James Morton?
{75672}{75759}Bukowski's dead.|I never saw James Morton again.
{75772}{75895}Maybe Mr. Robert A. Leffingwell|can help us to locate this James Morton.
{75920}{76019}Would the committee grant me one hour|to prepare an answer to this testimony?
{76023}{76103}If he can defend himself,|let him do it right now.
{76136}{76219}The committee will extend|this courtesy to the nominee.
{76224}{76294}We'll stand recessed until 3:30.
{76440}{76543}Seab, you don't believe|that tale yourself. Come on.
{76547}{76593}Anyway, I'm rocking the boat.
{76597}{76659}He's going to cut Gelman up|four ways from Sunday.
{76663}{76750}And I'm going to pick off just enough votes|to push him into office.
{76754}{76797}What about that, you old buzzard?
{76801}{76919}Us old buzzards can see a mouse dying|from 1 0,000 feet up.
{76924}{76999}Us old buzzards have|the sharpest eyes in creation.
{77003}{77106}Right now, I'm studying the terrain.
{77970}{78002}Thank you.
{78088}{78184}Led by questions from Senator Brigham|Anderson, the witness flatly stated...
{78188}{78243}...that Robert Leffingwell|was a communist.
{78247}{78330}He claimed he had once been|in a communist cell with Leffingwell.
{78334}{78386}Leff, how are you? Come in.
{78390}{78440}Daddy, George is hiding my new record.
{78444}{78541}-I haven't even seen her old album.|-He has seen it. He's got it, Daddy.
{78545}{78612}Kids, go in there and behave|or I'm gonna tell Mother.
{78616}{78672}Leffingwell seemed to be|as flabbergasted....
{78676}{78762}Leff, I've been watching|the whole awful business on television.
{78805}{78860}-Sit down.|-Hardiman...
{78864}{78946}...when I go back to the hearing,|I'll tell them the whole story.
{78950}{79011}Chicago, Gelman, everything.
{79019}{79122}You're bound to come into it.|Might be better if you're there with me.
{79126}{79183}We can make them understand|how it really was.
{79188}{79238}Make who understand?
{79243}{79347}-Who would even want to understand?|-We've got nothing to lose by trying.
{79351}{79410}-Nothing to lose?|-I'm under oath, Hardiman.
{79414}{79488}I know you're under oath,|but wait a minute here.
{79509}{79562}I've got a family to feed.
{79566}{79683}Leff, look, if we do what you want,|we'll not only be through in government...
{79687}{79746}...we'll never even get|a job teaching again.
{79751}{79845}You know what happens when|these red-baiting newspapers get the scent.
{79856}{79957}-I know that, but what can I do?|-Withdraw. Don't go back to the hearing.
{79962}{80022}That would be the worst|admission of guilt.
{80027}{80117}There'd be a Senate investigation|in 24 hours. We'd be in the same spot.
{80167}{80200}All right.
{80204}{80275}Tell me this:|What do you owe these politicians?
{80279}{80311}Nothing.
{80315}{80433}They let that old megalomaniac Cooley bring|a half-witted clerk to testify against you.
{80437}{80558}I know you're a man of principle. I admire|you for it, but it's no time to go by the book.
{80562}{80619}-I don't know.|-You have to. You're putting...
{80624}{80686}...your head on a chopping block|and mine with it.
{80704}{80771}Look, you talk about being under oath.
{80775}{80871}What about Gelman?|His testimony was shot with lies.
{80875}{80961}He was never in one of your classes|at the university.
{81048}{81127}Destroy him. It's easy for you, Leff.
{81135}{81218}Will the chair please administer the oath|to Mr. Lewis Newborne...
{81223}{81270}...of the Federal Rower Commission.
{81275}{81343}Would you stand and raise|your right hand, please?
{81391}{81473}Do you swear the testimony|you're about to give this committee...
{81477}{81559}...will be the truth, the whole truth,|and nothing but the truth?
{81563}{81614}-I do.|-Thank you. You may be seated.
{81619}{81708}First, Mr. Chairman, let me say|that I do know Herbert Gelman.
{81726}{81810}Looks like we might've smoked us out|a possum, Mr. Chairman.
{81815}{81907}Afraid there'll be no possum stew|in the old Cooley pot tonight, senator.
{81911}{81996}I realized I knew Herbert Gelman|only after I'd heard his testimony.
{82000}{82052}-May I question Mr. Gelman?|-By all means.
{82056}{82092}Mr. Gelman.
{82096}{82163}Before being detached|from the Rower Commission...
{82167}{82279}-...you'd been ill a long while, correct?|-I was in a tuberculosis sanitarium.
{82283}{82360}-Tuberculosis sanitarium?|-You know that, Mr. Leffingwell.
{82375}{82434}You fired me when I tried|to come back to work.
{82438}{82518}Can you tell us the name|of this tuberculosis sanitarium?
{82527}{82610}-The name?|-Yes, the name. It had a name, didn't it?
{82631}{82697}The name. I can't think of the name.
{82701}{82758}It was in the country, in Maryland.
{82762}{82815}Mr. Newborne, do you know|Herbert Gelman?
{82819}{82914}Oh, yes. I was his immediate superior|in the Federal Rower Agency.
{82918}{82990}Tell the committee the true cause|of Mr. Gelman's illness.
{82995}{83143}It wasn't tuberculosis. Herbert--|Mr. Gelman had a mental breakdown.
{83147}{83243}And the sanitarium was the Elm Grove|Rest Home right outside of Baltimore.
{83247}{83297}What happened|when he came back to work?
{83301}{83408}He seemed, well, kind of shaky.|He couldn't seem to get a hold of the job.
{83412}{83506}I went to Mr. Leffingwell, and I told him|that I wanted to let Gelman go.
{83510}{83582}Mr. Leffingwell said he'd try|and find him another job.
{83587}{83711}A few days later, on Mr. Leffingwell's|instructions, I discharged Gelman...
{83715}{83802}...and recommended that he apply|to the Department of the Treasury.
{83806}{83890}He made an application,|and he went to work over there.
{83894}{83987}This, Mr. Chairman, is the sum total|of my knowledge of Herbert Gelman...
{83991}{84059}...except I telephoned|the University of Chicago...
{84063}{84127}...to find out if he'd ever been|a student of mine.
{84131}{84206}The registrar said Gelman|had been at the university...
{84210}{84283}...but there was no record|of his attending my classes.
{84287}{84380}This will be confirmed by telegram|from the registrar to the committee.
{84384}{84449}What do you have to say|to this, Mr. Gelman?
{84459}{84503}I thought--
{84513}{84648}I thought it was my duty as a citizen|to come here, expose Mr. Leffingwell.
{84652}{84771}You will receive another telegram. This one|from the city planning office of Chicago.
{84775}{84851}Seems this address,|271 4 Carpenter Street...
{84855}{84981}...where this communist cell practiced its|mumbo jumbo, according to Mr. Gelman....
{84985}{85064}This address has been a fire station|for more than 50 years.
{85164}{85242}Did you have a mental breakdown,|Mr. Gelman?
{85332}{85440}Do you still insist you were fired by Mr.|Leffingwell because you knew too much?
{85476}{85583}I didn't know that he got me the job|in the Treasury Department.
{85590}{85694}Could you have been mistaken about being|in his classes in the university?
{85709}{85755}I don't know.
{85771}{85863}And what about 271 4 Carpenter Street?
{85907}{86025}Well, it might not be the right number.
{86029}{86078}I may not remember for sure.
{86087}{86152}Rerhaps you don't remember|other things for sure.
{86183}{86275}Well, if I did, would anybody believe me?
{86370}{86426}I think we can let this witness go.
{86430}{86481}Thank you, Mr. Gelman.
{86509}{86575}I said you could go, Mr. Gelman.
{86758}{86831}This committee owes you an apology,|Mr. Leffingwell.
{86835}{86902}Perhaps Senator Cooley|would like to join us in that?
{86910}{86958}I'm not joining anybody in anything.
{86963}{87067}Senator Cooley wants a transcript of this|hearing at the earliest possible moment.
{87086}{87208}The committee owes me no apology, Mr.|Chairman, nor do they owe me approval.
{87212}{87343}Win, lose, or draw I shall continue to serve|my country when and wherever I can.
{88361}{88430}-Good afternoon.|-Yes, sir?
{88434}{88542}Why, I'd surely be obliged if I could see|the employment record...
{88546}{88583}...of Mr. Herbert Gelman.
{88587}{88670}I'm sorry, sir, but employment records|are privileged information.
{88675}{88767}You might say that I am privileged.|I'm Senator Cooley.
{88771}{88863}You're a mighty pretty gal,|yes, ma'am. Mighty pretty.
{88867}{88979}I'm not entirely sure in which section|of this building Mr. Gelman works.
{89016}{89066}Mr. Leffingwell.
{89070}{89133}Well, Leff.
{89140}{89202}-Congratulations.|-I appreciate your arranging...
{89206}{89267}...to see me so quickly.|I know how busy you are.
{89271}{89349}Glad you called.|I wanted to see you. Sit down.
{89360}{89431}Bobby thinks the committee|will go four-to-one in your favor.
{89435}{89507}He has enough votes sewed up|to get you through on the floor.
{89511}{89600}So it looks like you're in.|How'd you like a drink, Mr. Secretary?
{89604}{89680}Mr. Rresident, I'm not in,|and I'm not going to be in.
{89684}{89743}-Yes, sir.|-What are you talking about?
{89747}{89800}-Yes, sir.|-Nothing! Sorry.
{89804}{89911}Mr. Rresident, I want you|to withdraw my nomination.
{89932}{89980}I lied at the hearing.
{90415}{90478}I knew Herbert Gelman.|I knew him in Chicago.
{90482}{90540}I knew him at those meetings.
{90544}{90611}They were communist meetings,|Mr. Rresident.
{90615}{90706}I was never a party member,|but I was young, looking for a cause.
{90710}{90801}Didn't take long to discover|that wasn't it, and I dropped out.
{90812}{90897}Please believe that,|Mr. President. It's true.
{90988}{91062}But I am guilty of one bad error.
{91066}{91158}I gave Herbert Gelman a job|to keep him from talking.
{91171}{91290}When I saw Gelman in the courtroom, I knew|Cooley had me set up for the witch-hunters.
{91295}{91366}I wish I could tell you I'm sorry I lied.
{91371}{91441}I'm only sorry I had to lie.
{91467}{91527}Anybody else know you lied?
{91531}{91594}One person. Hardiman Fletcher.
{91609}{91695}-Fletcher of the Treasury Department?|-Yes.
{91841}{91882}Will he talk?
{91886}{91949}No. Fletcher was the third man|in Chicago.
{91953}{92012}He was James Morton.
{92702}{92771}-Hello, senator.|-Well, Mr. Fletcher...
{92775}{92884}...I surely do appreciate you keeping|this little rendezvous.
{92891}{92944}Who are we hiding from,|senator, and why?
{92948}{93075}I thought us meeting by this fine old|monument might have a salutary effect...
{93079}{93173}...on our conversation. It was George|Washington who couldn't tell a lie...
{93177}{93216}...wasn't it, Mr. Fletcher?
{93220}{93333}I sometimes forget my schoolboy history.|Shall we take a little walk?
{93399}{93505}A thought came to me, Mr. Fletcher.|Not like a bolt from the blue.
{93509}{93590}More insinuating,|like a soft breeze off the river.
{93594}{93739}I thought, "Why did Robert A. Leffingwell|have Herbert Gelman...
{93743}{93826}...apply to the Treasury Department|for a job?
{93830}{93907}Why didn't he send him|through civil service for a job? "
{93911}{93985}-Are you asking me a question?|-Not yet, Mr. Fletcher.
{93989}{94111}I gallivanted over to|the Treasury Department this afternoon...
{94115}{94183}...and I sort of looked up|Herbert Gelman's record.
{94187}{94282}And I discovered that you approved|Herbert's application.
{94286}{94327}Personally approved it.
{94332}{94426}-Senator, get to the point.|-The point is, I was gonna give you a break.
{94430}{94503}Looks like you see fit to turn down|my Southern generosity.
{94507}{94599}-Senator Cooley, I'm a loyal citizen. I--|-I didn't say you weren't.
{94603}{94743}But I might have to start an investigation|to prove you're loyal, Mr. Fletcher.
{94747}{94816}Mr. James Morton.
{95047}{95091}What is this...
{95095}{95158}-...break you were gonna give me?|-Simple.
{95162}{95294}Make a telephone call to Brigham Anderson,|offer him a small confession...
{95299}{95422}...not mentioning I had anything to do with|it, just made out of your own conscience.
{95426}{95464}What happens then?
{95468}{95561}Natural course will be followed|to protect the president and our party.
{95565}{95632}Your confidence won't be betrayed,|Mr. Fletcher.
{95636}{95726}And you'll have done a noble duty, sir.|Yes, sir, noble.
{95940}{96023}-Senator Knox?|-Oh, thank you.
{96105}{96209}Senators, looks like|we won't be voting today.
{96213}{96276}It's from Brig. He's postponed it.
{96280}{96323}For what reason?
{96336}{96372}He doesn't say.
{96390}{96445}Are you sure it was Fletcher|who called you?
{96449}{96485}I made sure.
{96489}{96534}I called him back at his home.
{96538}{96585}Has he told this to anyone but you?
{96589}{96626}He said not.
{96630}{96696}Why in hell did he open|up this can of beans?
{96700}{96751}He felt he should do the right thing.
{96755}{96818}Nuts. He's protecting himself.
{96870}{96935}Bess, get through to the|president at Camp David.
{96939}{96984}Tell his secretary I want him next.
{96988}{97055}I don't care who's ahead of me.|The queen of England.
{97079}{97203}And it is not enough that the subcommittee|has permitted a great man to be smeared.
{97207}{97338}Now the chairman of that subcommittee|is deliberately blocking the committee vote.
{97342}{97447}It's one more thing to add to the most|unfair hearing in the history of the Senate.
{97451}{97504}Sir, will the senator|yield for a question?
{97508}{97595}-Will the senator yield for a question?|-I'll yield to the senator.
{97599}{97683}Mr. Rresident, I admit I'm not|a supporter of Mr. Leffingwell...
{97687}{97779}...but I watched the hearing on TV,|and it seemed eminently fair to me.
{97783}{97911}Mr. Rresident, I'm sorry if the senator was|not perceptive enough to grasp the obvious.
{97915}{97975}I am telling the Senate|exactly what happened.
{97979}{98076}As much as I appreciate hearing about|the senator's particular view...
{98080}{98187}...I must say I will need more substantial|proof than the senator's own description.
{98191}{98243}Sir, is the senator calling me a liar?
{98247}{98302}The record must stand as is,|Mr. President.
{98306}{98381}How the senator interprets that|is his problem, not mine.
{98385}{98490}Mr. President, the senator from Kansas|is welcome to take advantage of her sex.
{98494}{98538}Oh, Fred, come off it.
{98557}{98600}You think it's funny?
{98604}{98664}You think the world thinks it's funny?
{98668}{98789}The world thinks it's funny that we're trying|to smear a man who believes in peace?
{98793}{98864}Do you think the people of this|country think it's funny?
{98868}{98935}Does the senator from Utah|think it's funny?
{98939}{99020}Will the senator from Utah tell us|why he is blocking the vote?
{99024}{99131}I'll tell you. He's assassinating the character|and reputation of Robert Leffingwell!
{99135}{99204}The senator asks me a question|and answers it himself.
{99208}{99286}I prefer to make my own|reply, Mr. President.
{99290}{99364}As chairman of the subcommittee,|I seek only to do my duty.
{99368}{99493}And that I will do despite the hysterical|tantrums of the senator from Wyoming.
{99497}{99598}The senator is frightening no one|except the children in the visitors' gallery.
{99602}{99679}I'm not too sure the senator|from Utah can't be frightened.
{99683}{99777}There are ways to frighten any man,|even the senator from Utah.
{99781}{99894}-Every man has his Achilles--|-The chair is tolerant, as everybody knows.
{99898}{99963}But there'll be no threats|made in this chamber.
{99967}{100038}-What happened to Harley?|-I don't know.
{100042}{100085}I apologize to the chair.
{100089}{100158}In my anxiety for a great cause,|I was carried away.
{100162}{100227}-Will the chair hear a motion?|-Make your motion.
{100235}{100315}I move that the Committee on|Foreign Relations be discharged...
{100319}{100399}...from consideration of the nominee|for secretary of state...
{100403}{100474}...and that the Senate vote on|Robert Leffingwell now.
{100491}{100559}-Did he clear this with you?|-He did not.
{100563}{100641}Bob, I can't let this pass.|I'm gonna have to open up.
{100645}{100693}I'll try and stop it.
{100700}{100791}Make Van Ackerman withdraw the motion.|Tell him we haven't enough votes.
{100795}{100883}-Mr. President.|-The senior senator from Michigan.
{100895}{100938}Mr. President...
{100942}{101042}...it would certainly be a dramatic|affirmation of the nominee...
{101046}{101115}...if we were to bypass|the regular procedures...
{101119}{101184}...of the Senate|and vote him into office now--
{101188}{101252}I won't withdraw.|He should make a motion himself.
{101256}{101366}The balance of power in our government,|as created by the Constitution...
{101371}{101488}...is the most brilliant device for the|protection of liberty conceived by free men....
{101492}{101582}We're not ready for this, Fred.|Don't you understand?
{101586}{101620}I'm ready for it.
{101624}{101753}--that none can become absolute has made|this government the miracle of the ages.
{101757}{101803}We must always guard this balance...
{101807}{101908}...so this great dream of liberty within|discipline, which is America, will die.
{101912}{101971}I tell you, we haven't got the votes.
{101975}{102046}You'll get him beat before we|get him out of committee.
{102050}{102131}--citizens of this republic|for almost two centuries.
{102135}{102277}Now Senator Van Ackerman's motion|proposes to ride over those procedures.
{102281}{102386}Though I hope for the eventual|confirmation of the nominee...
{102390}{102447}...I ask that this motion be defeated.
{102451}{102518}It won't hurt Mr. Leffingwell|if he isn't confirmed...
{102522}{102592}...by sundown today|or even sundown tomorrow.
{102596}{102706}But it might hurt us most grievously|if we do what suits us...
{102711}{102813}...in the heat and passion|of the passing moment.
{102847}{102900}Is there a request for the yeas and nays?
{102904}{102958}Squarehead Anderson can't block this.
{102962}{103060}Senators, do I hear a request for the|yeas and nays? A quorum, maybe?
{103064}{103143}What got your tongue today?|You're usually shaking the rafters.
{103147}{103299}It's my day for sunning myself, Mr. Majority|Leader, like an old bullfrog on a lily pad.
{103303}{103390}-You've got to withdraw.|-Does anybody want to say anything at all?
{103394}{103491}-Mr. Rresident.|-Saved by the senator from Wyoming.
{103501}{103649}Mr. Rresident, I have decided to heed the|wisdom of the esteemed majority leader...
{103653}{103724}...who has pointed out|the danger in my motion.
{103728}{103814}I would not wish to abuse|this citadel of freedom.
{103819}{103950}I will instead humble myself|before my peers and withdraw the--
{103954}{104034}This news about Leffingwell|hit the president pretty hard.
{104038}{104107}-He put a lot of faith in him.|-I'm sorry.
{104111}{104195}He's coming to the correspondents'|banquet tonight. You going?
{104199}{104229}I plan to.
{104233}{104326}He'd like to see you, Brig.|Would you come up to my place afterwards?
{104330}{104434}What can I tell him I haven't told you?|All he has to do is withdraw the man.
{104438}{104472}Did I eat crow nicely, Bob?
{104476}{104545}Yeah, you did fine, Fred.|Thanks for your cooperation.
{104549}{104601}Is Brig cooperating?
{104835}{104939}Any time old Brig isn't cooperating,|I might be able to change his mind.
{104943}{104980}Just let me know.
{104984}{105052}Get off my back, Fred.
{105365}{105420}Bob, see you a minute?
{105424}{105475}Okay for after the banquet, Brig?
{105479}{105529}Sure, all right.
{105563}{105625}I said you made a mistake|with him. He's trouble.
{105629}{105731}Fred, will you please butt out of this?|You're not doing Leffingwell any good.
{105735}{105839}Okay, but if you want Brig whipped|into line, I've got the whip on file.
{105843}{105921}I'm sure we can manage|without your file.
{105926}{106046}Gentlemen, tonight is the one night|in the year when we're honor-bound...
{106051}{106104}...not to be reporters.
{106108}{106152}Our guests may speak freely...
{106156}{106287}...and not have to read a hundred versions|of what they said in the morning papers.
{106291}{106434}So with that assurance, I give you|the president of the United States.
{106846}{106965}Fellow members of the White House|Correspondents' Association...
{106981}{107075}...the man says there are|no reporters present tonight...
{107079}{107187}...but I'm going to exercise the privilege|given me by my gold membership card...
{107191}{107248}...and reverse that traditional ruling.
{107262}{107340}Tonight, gentlemen,|there are reporters present.
{107347}{107419}So get out your pencils.|We'll write ourselves a story.
{107423}{107483}-This planned?|-Not by me.
{107487}{107615}I see down there at table number three|the senior senator from South Carolina.
{107631}{107681}Hello, Seab.
{107703}{107768}And over there at table seven...
{107772}{107865}...I see the senator from Utah,|Brigham Anderson.
{107869}{107915}Hi, Brigham.
{107932}{107976}I said, hi, Brigham.
{108076}{108151}Now, a few days ago,|the president of the United States...
{108155}{108222}...nominated a man|for secretary of state...
{108226}{108290}...who the president thinks|is a pretty good man...
{108294}{108376}...and he wants that man|confirmed by the Senate.
{108380}{108485}But the senior senator from|South Carolina, for reasons of his own...
{108489}{108594}...and those reasons are never|like anybody else's reasons...
{108623}{108679}...the senator's opposed to my nominee.
{108683}{108751}Well, everybody expected that.
{108755}{108838}We'd all be disappointed|if Seab hadn't reared back...
{108843}{108941}...and huffed and puffed,|and tried to blow the house down.
{108978}{109053}But now comes|Senator Brigham Anderson...
{109057}{109143}...who nobody suspected|of being a big, bad wolf.
{109158}{109272}And he goes Seab Cooley one better by|trying to dig a tunnel under the house.
{109315}{109451}This is your story, fellow members of the|White House Correspondents' Association.
{109458}{109546}The president is standing by his nominee.
{109554}{109678}Despite Seab Cooley's windstorms|and Brigham Anderson's tunneling...
{109683}{109836}...you can tell the readers the president|hasn't changed his mind about his nominee.
{109840}{109938}He's going to fight for that|confirmation no matter what.
{110411}{110450}What are you clapping for?
{110454}{110530}I can afford to be charitable, sir.
{111016}{111061}Mr. President.
{111134}{111189}Sore at me, Brigham?
{111193}{111258}Frankly, I'm puzzled, Mr. President.
{111262}{111358}There's coffee and brandy here if you want.|I'll go down to the banquet room.
{111363}{111483}-lf it's okay, I'd rather have you stay.|-What's the matter, Brigham?
{111487}{111533}You think you need a witness?
{111537}{111576}I'm not sure, Mr. President.
{111580}{111635}You'd better stay, Bobby.|Sit down.
{111646}{111726}I have a feeling I might need|some help with this young man.
{111737}{111832}Of course you know I'm grateful,|the way you put the lid on this matter.
{111847}{111899}I didn't get that impression tonight.
{111903}{112028}Well, a president has to stand up for a man|he sends down to Senate. You know that.
{112038}{112140}It seems to me, the sooner you withdraw|him, the sooner this will blow over.
{112144}{112183}I still want him, Brigham.
{112187}{112294}If we open this up, he won't be confirmed.|I'm sure Senator Munson told you that.
{112298}{112397}If we don't open it up, we've got enough|votes committed to put him through.
{112401}{112466}I've gone as far as I can|with this, Mr. Rresident.
{112495}{112582}I think the circumstances might|permit you to go a little further.
{112586}{112670}You don't seriously believe|Leffingwell's a communist, do you?
{112675}{112740}Whether he is or not, he lied under oath.
{112751}{112820}Aren't you interested in why he lied?
{112835}{112964}Well, I'm not completely unsympathetic,|but I just think that--
{112968}{113026}You think he should let himself|be ruined...
{113030}{113116}...just because he flirted with|communism a long time ago?
{113120}{113178}My point is he should've|told the committee...
{113182}{113248}...he had flirted with communism|instead of lying.
{113252}{113343}Well, maybe there's nothing in your|young life you'd like to conceal...
{113347}{113401}...but we're not all of us that fortunate.
{113405}{113518}We have to make the best of our mistakes.|That's all Leffingwell has done.
{113522}{113646}As the leader of our party, I'm asking you.|Let me judge the man.
{113655}{113759}Mr. Rresident, I don't want|to wreck his life.
{113763}{113847}I don't want to deprive you|of his services in some other office.
{113851}{113934}But in this case, his confirmation|as secretary of state...
{113939}{113996}...I am bound by my duty|to my committee.
{114000}{114056}You also owe a duty to your party.
{114060}{114130}I can't subvert the purpose|of a Senate committee.
{114141}{114222}You don't think Cooley subverted|the purpose of the committee?
{114226}{114305}He's used his little forum|in a personal vendetta.
{114309}{114408}Mr. Rresident, I'm sorry, but your|arguments won't wash with me.
{114453}{114533}My prestige is riding on this nomination.
{114537}{114651}Rrestige of this country, Senator Anderson.|By God, that ought to wash.
{114655}{114717}Or don't you know we're in trouble|in the world...
{114721}{114784}...outside that little|subcommittee of yours?
{114795}{114863}Yes, sir, I know our prestige will suffer...
{114867}{114990}...but it will suffer a lot more if I have to|show up your nominee as a barefaced liar.
{114994}{115094}If you won't withdraw him, I'll reopen|and call Hardiman Fletcher as a witness.
{115098}{115191}Then do it. Do what you like.|I won't withdraw.
{115327}{115402}-Good night, Bobby.|-Good night, Mr. Rresident.
{115496}{115548}He has a case, Brig.
{115560}{115649}You can't always cut it black or white.|Not in these times.
{115653}{115718}But this is black and white.
{115735}{115841}I just don't understand you. You make a|great speech about the balance of power...
{115845}{115903}...then you ignore your responsibility...
{115907}{116002}...and want me to rubber-stamp this|nomination just to please the president.
{116022}{116082}I guess it is inconsistent...
{116087}{116194}...but I've come a long way with him, ever|since we were green congressmen together.
{116198}{116285}He's pulled us through|six hard years of crisis.
{116292}{116362}He's tired, Brig, and he's ill.
{116366}{116408}I love the man.
{116423}{116498}I guess I can stretch|my responsibility a little.
{116503}{116542}Love to help him.
{116547}{116618}I'm sorry, but mine won't stretch.
{116638}{116765}All right. Give him a few days to save face,|and then we'll put up another nominee.
{116769}{116831}That isn't what the president said.
{116835}{116898}He'll bend if he has to.
{116903}{116966}And I guess he has to.
{119623}{119663}Brig?
{119706}{119766}Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
{119778}{119818}I was waiting for you.
{119822}{119882}This was a night, Mrs. Anderson.
{119887}{120027}Your husband had a knockdown-and-dragout|with the president of the United States.
{120031}{120118}-Oh, Brig.|-It's all right. I won.
{120136}{120196}I had a very strange phone call, Brig.
{120215}{120261}Strange? Well, who was it?
{120265}{120302}I don't know. A man.
{120306}{120382}He said that before you go on|with the Leffingwell matter...
{120386}{120449}...you ought to remember|what happened in Hawaii.
{120453}{120502}Then he hung up.
{120515}{120580}What happened in Hawaii, Brig?
{120614}{120660}What was the voice like?
{120664}{120786}It was crawly. He made it sound like|he knew some kind of nasty secret.
{120791}{120901}I've been on the front pages the past few|days. We're bound to get crackpot calls.
{120905}{120971}Just hang up if you get any more.
{120983}{121054}Are you sure you're doing|the right thing, Brig?
{121058}{121135}Yes, darling, I'm sure.|Don't worry about it.
{121151}{121211}What did he mean about Hawaii?
{121216}{121272}I was stationed there|when I was in the Army.
{121276}{121347}I don't see what that|has to do with Leffingwell.
{121351}{121424}Just some crackpot, darling, that's all.
{121714}{121790}-Hello?|-Did you speak to your husband?
{121794}{121866}-What do you want? Who are you?|-We're serious about this.
{121871}{121929}-You call here one--|-Hello!
{121933}{121970}Hello?
{122054}{122133}-I told you to hang up on those calls.|-Brig, I'm frightened.
{122137}{122234}Now, look, there is nothing to be|frightened of, Ellen. Nothing!
{122256}{122318}Come on, let's have some breakfast.
{122351}{122461}The senator handling the inland waterways|bill can't be present this afternoon.
{122465}{122519}If the senator from Michigan will agree...
{122523}{122622}...I would like to ask that nothing|be put ahead of this bill.
{122627}{122688}Since the afternoon is|an extremely busy one--
{122692}{122744}When is the president going to withdraw?
{122748}{122851}You can't hurry him, Brig. After all,|we don't run that end of the avenue.
{122857}{122935}I am very glad to accommodate|the senator, Mr. Rresident.
{122939}{123000}I move we stand in recess|until noon tomorrow.
{123004}{123074}Without objection, so ordered.
{123078}{123107}Have you seen him?
{123111}{123202}He's on a destroyer at Chesapeake Bay|for the naval boat race.
{123206}{123299}Come on, don't look so worried.|After all, you won your point last night.
{123303}{123348}Have a cup of coffee with me.
{123352}{123400}No, thanks.
{123760}{123835}Early recess, senator?
{123859}{123889}Hello, Seab.
{123893}{123970}A man can live like a mole|in the halls of that old capitol.
{123975}{124078}Me, I just sit out here for a while|most every day, winter or summer.
{124082}{124184}You look like you've got|the burden, son. Sit down.
{124307}{124416}You got them treed, haven't you? Look|out they don't shinny down on top of you.
{124420}{124511}You're dealing with devious|men, senator. Yes, sir.
{124515}{124619}Devious, powerful men.
{124626}{124746}Hardiman Fletcher took a plane|to Europe this afternoon.
{124751}{124812}A mission for the president.
{124816}{124926}Gonna make a study|of world currency problems.
{124970}{125007}You know that?
{125011}{125086}Well, it'll be in the papers|tomorrow morning.
{125132}{125222}-Where do you come into this, Seab?|-Well...
{125230}{125371}...Iet's just say you've got a friend.|A powerful, devious friend.
{125379}{125420}Thanks.
{125442}{125499}Thanks. I might need him.
{125749}{125798}-Bob.|-Hi, Brig.
{125803}{125878}-Change your mind?|-I just wanna verify something.
{125883}{125929}Something about Hardiman Fletcher.
{125933}{125996}Well, what about Hardiman Fletcher?
{126023}{126074}Is this an act?
{126111}{126197}-I don't know what you're talking about.|-Go now.
{126351}{126423}I give you my word,|I don't know anything about it.
{126427}{126504}I don't understand why|the president did this.
{126512}{126630}All I can think of is he's making sure|you won't jump the gun until he's ready.
{126863}{126903}Hello.
{126931}{126966}Oh, yes, he's here.
{126971}{127006}Who is this?
{127011}{127055}Just a minute, please.
{127120}{127162}Oh, Brig, there's a call for you.
{127166}{127223}-For me?|-Yeah. It's your clerk.
{127396}{127471}-Hello.|-Hello. Senator Anderson?
{127475}{127526}-Who is this?|-Well, it's not your clerk.
{127531}{127635}Don 't hang up, senator. You'll be interested|in this. We have the stuff on Hawaii.
{127639}{127724}If you don 't want us to use it,|you'll get out of Leffingwell's way.
{127728}{127791}This is no joke, senator. We'll use it.
{127795}{127857}Use what? What? I don ' t know what--
{127861}{127955}It's a photograph, senator. And a letter.
{128385}{128456}Listen, I won ' t be scared off. I mean it.
{128460}{128539}I won ' t carry this anymore.|I'll go to Senate and tell it all!
{128543}{128609}-Take it easy. What's the matter?|-He withdraws!
{128613}{128727}I don't mean tomorrow! I don't mean next|week! Today, you understand? Today!
{128746}{128782}Brig.
{128990}{129045}Will you come in, Miss Foster?
{129201}{129323}There was a man about five or six weeks|ago. His name was Raymond Shaff.
{129327}{129423}" Ray," he probably said. I didn't want to|talk to him. Do you remember?
{129427}{129517}Yes. He called several times.|He also came to the office.
{129521}{129591}-Did he leave a number?|-I think so.
{129988}{130026}Senator?
{130030}{130072}Yes, Miss Foster?
{130076}{130189}I have no telephone number, but l|have an address in New York City.
{130193}{130290}Thank you. Would you just|put it on my desk, please?
{131224}{131298}-Then why send Fletcher away?|-I had nothing to do with it.
{131302}{131366}I haven't talked to the president|since the hearing.
{131371}{131490}You expect me to believe you don't know|whether he's going to withdraw you or not?
{131494}{131623}Senator, I've put myself at his disposal.|I'm waiting for him to tell me what to do.
{131627}{131681}Well, I won't wait.|I don't need Fletcher.
{131685}{131763}I'll convene the hearing|and you won't lie this time.
{131777}{131816}You can't do that, senator.
{131820}{131851}I've got to do it!
{131855}{131938}Why? What does a day matter?|Or two? You have the whip hand.
{131951}{131983}I'm giving you a chance.
{131987}{132067}Call the press, announce your|withdrawal. Forget the president.
{132071}{132112}I've given the president my word.
{132116}{132194}Your word is not exactly|the coin of the realm.
{132223}{132341}No, maybe it isn't, thanks to your|committee. But I still place a value on it.
{132351}{132438}And there's nothing more to be said.|Good afternoon, senator.
{132877}{132934}Did you hear all of that, Johnny?
{132977}{133023}Did you understand it?
{133207}{133276}Well, I don't exactly know|how to explain it, Johnny.
{133280}{133357}-Okay.|-No. Wait a minute.
{133451}{133505}I could tell you the truth.
{133536}{133573}All right.
{133743}{133792}Sit down, Johnny.
{133908}{133938}Brig?
{133959}{134017}I'd like to talk to you, please.
{134236}{134272}I had another call, Brig.
{134276}{134332}Yes, I took the call.
{134339}{134458}When did I become the little woman who's|supposed to sit at home and know nothing?
{134465}{134558}Brig, I've campaigned with you.|I've worked for you.
{134562}{134614}I know politics isn't all...
{134619}{134667}...Iove thy neighbor and friendship.
{134671}{134719}I know how cruel it can be.
{134731}{134786}There's trouble. I want to know what it is.
{134790}{134878}Rlease, Daddy, you promised|to play with me.
{134891}{134922}In a minute, Pidge.
{134926}{134992}Do you know someone named Ray?
{135059}{135122}Please, Daddy.
{135131}{135189}Please, Pidge.
{135193}{135240}Go back in the garden.
{135244}{135301}Daddy will be there in a minute.
{135384}{135493}He said to tell you|that they had bought Ray.
{135507}{135558}What does that mean?
{135603}{135635}I don't know.
{135639}{135698}You must know.
{135728}{135810}Will you please just leave this to me?
{135814}{135897}But it's coming into my|home on that telephone.
{135901}{136003}They're calling me, Brig. They're trying to|force you to do something through me.
{136007}{136068}Now, you've got to tell me what it is.
{136072}{136147}You're getting all hysterical about nothing.
{136151}{136280}Now, I don't know what those phone calls|are about, but I'm trying to find out.
{136307}{136409}For the first time in our lives,|you're not telling me the truth.
{136427}{136490}That awful creature on the telephone.
{136495}{136583}He knows what he's talking about.|He's not making something up.
{136587}{136693}Something will happen if you don't do what|he wants, and you must prepare me for it.
{136697}{136770}Ellen, please, don't press me.
{136799}{136857}I've got to have time to work this out.
{136861}{136911}Why can't I help you?
{136915}{136964}What do you think I live for?
{136968}{137047}You're my whole life, you and Ridge.|There isn't anything else.
{137051}{137109}I know that. I know that.
{137138}{137250}If they're threatening you through me,|it can only mean one thing.
{137254}{137312}It's about a woman, isn't it?
{137325}{137390}Is that why you're afraid to tell me?
{137418}{137499}I know I'm not everything|a wife should be.
{137519}{137594}I know we haven't had|an exciting marriage.
{137607}{137658}It's my fault.
{137680}{137783}Darling, nothing in the whole world|is your fault.
{137789}{137916}This is something from a long time ago.|Before I even knew you.
{137968}{138018}If I could only--
{138051}{138158}-Tell me, Brig, tell me.|-I can't.
{138236}{138308}Then you'd better do|what these people want.
{138320}{138382}It doesn't seem so very much.
{138387}{138458}Not if it means that our whole....
{138465}{138547}If I do what they want,|everything that I have tried to be...
{138551}{138686}...everything that I have tried to stand for in|my life would be just thrown away. No.
{138728}{138817}Brig, I can't wait|for a mountain to fall on me.
{138821}{138881}I can't be that brave.
{138903}{138964}I'll take Pidge and leave.
{138991}{139073}Shall I do that?|Shall I take Ridge and go?
{139155}{139209}What do you expect me to do?
{139213}{139348}All I want to do is stand beside you,|and you give me no place to stand.
{139416}{139503}I want you to wait.|Wait for just a little while.
{139507}{139639}If I can't stop these people, then I'll|tell you all there is to tell, everything.
{139643}{139761}Then you can decide.|But wait. Please wait.
{139777}{139830}And if you do stop them?
{139850}{139926}I'll ask you to try and forget|this ever happened.
{139969}{140048}Oh, I couldn't leave you.
{140067}{140155}No matter what happens,|I couldn't leave you.
{140163}{140217}Hurry up, Daddy.
{140226}{140299}Hurry up, Daddy. It's getting dark.
{140388}{140475}Oh, go and help her with the silly fish.
{140531}{140594}I have to do something about dinner.
{140767}{140823}Where is Daddy going?
{140844}{140934}-Have you any luggage, senator?|-No. No luggage.
{140938}{141041}Hold flight 338. VlR.|Senator Anderson.
{141045}{141108}-Gate 1 1, sir.|-Thank you.
{141245}{141364}And Brig was more determined than ever the|president should withdraw Mr. Leffingwell.
{141384}{141462}Then these telephone calls|began to come.
{141467}{141551}I don't know what else to tell you, Lafe.|I know I'm meddling.
{141555}{141659}I know Brig will be angry and embarrassed|if he finds out I talked to you.
{141663}{141710}Maybe he won't have to know.
{141719}{141799}I said some things to him|I shouldn't have said.
{141803}{141879}He was desperate when he left.|Really desperate, Lafe.
{141883}{141962}He might be protecting someone else.|Had you thought of that?
{141976}{142087}Yes, that might be it.|That's like Brig.
{142091}{142133}I'll tell you what.
{142148}{142239}When he comes home, tell him|to call me at Dolly Harrison's.
{142243}{142323}I'll get around and find out|what it's all about.
{142327}{142373}Now, you stop worrying.
{142377}{142447}-I'm sorry to bother you, Lafe.|-I'm glad you did.
{142451}{142501}What's a friend for?
{142795}{142875}This must be Lafe. Excuse me.
{142971}{143037}Senator, we were just|about to begin without you.
{143041}{143096}I'm sorry, Dolly.|It was unavoidable.
{143100}{143147}I'm sure she must have been.
{143151}{143261}Oh, Dolly. Could you get Bob|to drift out here for a minute?
{143265}{143356}Oh, we are serious, aren't we? Of course.
{143501}{143549}Hello, lover.
{143571}{143668}Bob, I know about the argument|between Brig and the president.
{143672}{143712}-How?|-His wife.
{143716}{143818}-Now I know why I never married again.|-No, no. She's scared.
{143837}{143906}Bob. Brig's got a blackmailer on his tail.
{143910}{143943}Blackmailer?
{143947}{144010}-You know anything about it?|-Are you joking?
{144015}{144056}It's about Leffingwell.
{144060}{144102}Thought maybe you had some ideas.
{144106}{144148}Where is Brig?
{144163}{144226}I've been looking for him.|That's why I'm late.
{144230}{144323}Blackmail. Are you sure|his wife isn't exaggerating?
{144331}{144373}I don't believe so.
{144388}{144427}Well?
{144455}{144516}Yes, I might have some idea.
{144520}{144609}Why in the devil didn't he come to me|with this or to you? Somebody?
{144613}{144714}-Did you leave word for him to call here?|-His wife or office will tell him.
{145510}{145570}- Yes?|-Ray?
{145575}{145607}Who is it?
{145628}{145679}Is this Raymond Shaff?
{145735}{145774}Hello.
{146166}{146201}-You want Ray?|-Yes, please.
{146205}{146285}-He doesn't live here, you know.|-He left this apartment number.
{146289}{146369}-I'm a friend of Ray's. Are you a friend?|-Where can I find him?
{146373}{146409}Won't you sit down, please?
{146413}{146495}-Do you know where I can find Ray?|-Rlease, sit.
{146541}{146611}I'm making some tea.|Would you like some tea?
{146615}{146655}Thanks just the same.
{146707}{146806}-My name is Manuel. I didn't get your name.|-Do you know where I can reach Ray?
{146810}{146878}-I'd appreciate it.|-I said, I didn't get your name.
{146882}{146919}Anderson.
{146935}{146983}Where are you from, Mr. Anderson?
{146987}{147082}Well, if it's any help, I'm from out|of town. Utah. I knew Ray in the Army.
{147087}{147154}Oh, Utah. Way out West.
{147158}{147214}Mormons, and "This is the place"|and all that.
{147218}{147296}Mr. Manuel, if you don't mind,|I'm in kind of a hurry.
{147303}{147401}I have kind of a mail and answering service|here for friends like Ray.
{147405}{147444}Nothing big.
{147488}{147551}Confidential, you understand.
{147631}{147664}See?
{147668}{147743}Oh, yes. Yes, I see.
{147755}{147831}-Will this do?|-Oh, anything. Just put it there.
{147835}{147895}Would you like to meet Ray here?
{147899}{147961}Can't you give me his address|or phone number?
{147965}{148027}It's convenient here. It's quiet.
{148034}{148063}Cream or lemon?
{148067}{148143}Mr. Manuel, do you know|where Ray is or don't you?
{148147}{148198}Oh, it's like that.
{148202}{148271}Urgent, sudden, PDQ.
{148311}{148363}Won't you sit down, please?
{148395}{148447}Yes, it's urgent.
{148473}{148522}I think he'll be at 602.
{148543}{148606}-It's a big night at 602.|-602 what?
{148610}{148650}The club, 602.
{148670}{148714}I'll give you the address.
{148774}{148824}You can come back here with Ray.
{148846}{148886}I mean, you've paid.
{150117}{150171}Well, come on in.
{150175}{150226}Don't just stand there.
{150359}{150418}Hey, don't run off.
{150553}{150590}Ray?
{150600}{150646}Ray! You're with me.
{150722}{150755}Brig?
{150838}{150879}-Wait a moment, Brig.|-Taxi!

{150936}{150972}-Taxi!|-Brig....
{150983}{151046}I needed money, Brig.|Well, you wouldn't see me.
{151051}{151096}I kept calling. I was drunk.
{151100}{151141}Newark Airport!
{151146}{151193}Drive, will you? Drive!
{152029}{152088}Please fasten your seat belt, senator.
{152795}{152835}You mind, Brig?
{152867}{152936}Harley. Sure. I didn't see you.
{152940}{153034}-lf you'd rather sleep--|-No, no, no. Sit there.
{153073}{153148}-What time do we get to old Foggy Bottom?|-About midnight.
{153158}{153258}What? What were you doing|in New York, making a speech?
{153263}{153314}PTA convention. You?
{153319}{153378}Business. Just business.
{153420}{153462}Are you going to give in?
{153482}{153527}On Leffingwell, I mean.
{153538}{153590}I know what you mean.
{153594}{153677}-What do you know about it?|-Well, I can't say I know anything.
{153681}{153770}I'm not included in very much,|either by the senators or the president.
{153775}{153850}But that doesn't prevent me|from doing a little guesswork.
{153855}{153932}You're being pushed and pushed hard,|aren't you, Brig?
{153967}{154059}Why are you going it alone?|That's what I don't understand.
{154137}{154231}Some character once said that being|vice president isn't exactly a crime.
{154235}{154281}They can't put you in jail for it.
{154285}{154401}But it is a sort of a disgrace,|like living in a mansion with no furniture.
{154405}{154485}If you don't mind traveling|in such impoverished company...
{154489}{154548}...I might be able to help you.
{154552}{154657}I've suddenly gotten the feeling you're the|most underestimated man in Washington--
{154661}{154702}Anything I can do, Brig.
{154760}{154810}Maybe you're right. Maybe if....
{154815}{154850}Go ahead.
{154854}{154957}Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching|an area of possible turbulence.
{154961}{155034}Please fasten your seat belts. Thank you.
{155063}{155102}Brig?
{155117}{155158}Forget it, Harley.
{155163}{155226}Please forget it.
{155588}{155661}Well, looks like rain. I'll run you home.
{155665}{155746}-Come on, hop in.|-What? Oh, no. No, thanks, Harley.
{155750}{155798}I've got my car over here.
{155802}{155838}Brig?
{155849}{155897}Do you feel all right?
{155944}{155986}Good night, Harley.
{156421}{156465}Good evening, senator.
{156484}{156561}-Hi, Mike.|-Senator Smith was around looking for you.
{156565}{156631}He said you can get him|at Mrs. Harrison's.
{156678}{156715}Thanks.
{156743}{156809}But the elevators are running, senator.
{163722}{163762}Senator.
{163831}{163878}You in there, senator?
{163960}{164006}It's Mike, senator.
{164119}{164166}Ace queen bets three.
{164170}{164218}Dear me.|I may be forced to drop out.
{164223}{164291}Is that how the British|played their cards at Waterloo?
{164295}{164388}No, but it served us well at Dunkirk.|Different hands, of course.
{164408}{164447}-Out.|-No good.
{164451}{164489}Nope.
{164500}{164595}-Running a sandy, Seabright?|-No. I'm running a possum.
{164599}{164655}It looks like I've got him nearly treed.
{164659}{164717}Senator Smith,|you're wanted on the telephone.
{164721}{164775}Thank you. Excuse me.
{164779}{164832}-Closed.|-All right?
{164836}{164883}Wheel and deal, madam.
{164987}{165065}Still a possible flush. Rair of sevens.
{165069}{165106}Jack to me.
{165187}{165223}Is that Brig?
{165272}{165310}What's the matter?
{165351}{165394}He's dead.
{165411}{165446}Brig?
{165450}{165486}In his office.
{165491}{165520}He cut his throat.
{165524}{165610}Are you two at it again?|We're on the last hand.
{165817}{165857}Sorry, everyone.
{165862}{165932}-We just got word Brig Anderson's dead.|-What?
{165936}{165973}Oh, Bobby.
{165977}{166062}Stan, will you get Harley and meet Lafe|and me at the Anderson home?
{166067}{166121}-I know he'd like to be there.|-Of course.
{166125}{166166}How did it happen?
{166179}{166232}It looks like he killed himself.
{166546}{166593}No, I don't know.
{166617}{166694}He was good, and kind and honest.
{166715}{166794}I don't know what it was|they were trying to use against him.
{166814}{166889}But whatever it was,|they can't use it anymore.
{166900}{166954}So it doesn't matter, does it?
{166973}{167037}Did Brig have any idea about...
{167047}{167108}...who might be behind all this?
{167112}{167151}No.
{167176}{167214}No.
{167249}{167292}Excuse me.
{167304}{167359}Please excuse me!
{167408}{167472}I know Van Ackerman's behind it.
{167476}{167545}What I don't know, is he alone in it?
{167549}{167618}If he is alone in it,|it becomes a Senate matter...
{167622}{167686}...for the Senate to handle|in its own way.
{167691}{167747}And if Van Ackerman isn't alone?
{167964}{168064}Is that what they think of me on the Hill?|Is that what you think of me, Bobby?
{168068}{168166}No, I don't. But Harley here|might like a straighter answer than that.
{168179}{168262}As God is my witness, Harley,|I know nothing of it.
{168266}{168342}-What about Leffingwell?|-There will still be a suspicion...
{168347}{168458}...in some quarters that you're involved in|Brig's death. Better withdraw Leffingwell.
{168463}{168565}The president is always suspect by some|because people are suspicious of power.
{168569}{168621}I can't be guided by that.
{168639}{168712}I'm sorry about Brig Anderson.|Don't misunderstand me.
{168716}{168769}I wish he were alive and happy.
{168773}{168879}But he's dead, morning's coming,|and I still need a secretary of state.
{168883}{168936}The situation hasn't changed.
{168940}{169019}Except now you could bring|Leffingwell to the floor for a vote.
{169023}{169095}You've got the votes committed,|Bobby, use them.
{169119}{169188}Well, Harley, what are you looking|so shocked about?
{169192}{169289}You think in my place, you'd feel|any differently about this than I do?
{169293}{169353}I don't know, Mr. President.
{169357}{169466}But the last night I saw Brig Anderson,|I saw a man in terrible pain.
{169471}{169606}I wonder if Leffingwell|or any one man is worth all of this.
{169611}{169655}Wondering doesn't run a government.
{169659}{169703}Good night, Harley.
{169719}{169767}Good night, Mr. Rresident.
{169815}{169875}Good night, Mr. Rresident.
{169931}{169972}Bobby.
{169976}{170018}Yes, sir?
{170042}{170118}I do want to confirm|a suspicion to you.
{170126}{170217}Maybe it will help you understand|why I want Leffingwell so badly.
{170221}{170260}I understand.
{170264}{170384}I'm going fast. There's nothing left|inside here that's working anymore.
{170423}{170539}Leffingwell can take a firm grip on|everything I've built up in foreign policy.
{170543}{170611}Not let it all fall to pieces.
{170615}{170680}Harley can't. You know he can't.
{170684}{170784}No, I don't know that. Why don't you|bring him in and give him some help?
{170788}{170860}I haven't any time to run|a school for presidents.
{170865}{170921}I haven't any time for anything.
{171023}{171093}I guess I've been wrong|in many, many things.
{171097}{171180}I don't suppose history|will have much good to say of me.
{171184}{171232}I can't dwell on that.
{171236}{171292}I've done my best.
{171310}{171380}You're one of the great presidents, Russ.
{171434}{171522}Well, if you think so,|that's almost as good as history.
{171536}{171578}Bye, Bobby.
{171588}{171650}Good night, Mr. Rresident.
{172852}{172887}Thank you.
{173273}{173350}-Anything there?|-Yes, sir.
{173355}{173394}Thank you.
{173547}{173587}Don't you ever go to bed, Seab?
{173591}{173671}Sleep's a waste of precious time|for old folks.
{173695}{173750}I have a feeling|you've been waiting for me.
{173754}{173797}Mr. Majority Leader...
{173801}{173881}...tomorrow I'm gonna raise the dome...
{173885}{173973}...off the capitol building.|That old dome won't sit right again...
{173977}{174083}...when I get through speaking my piece.|I know all about James Morton.
{174196}{174251}How long have you known|about James Morton?
{174255}{174339}That's not important.|The important thing is, I know about him.
{174379}{174461}-I said, how long, Seab?|-There's nothing more to say.
{174489}{174590}-You forced Fletcher to call Brig.|-I was trying to do the best for everybody.
{174595}{174714}I'll tell you what you were doing. You were|amusing yourself watching us all squirm.
{174718}{174815}Laughing while a dying president|put up a fight for a man he believes in.
{174819}{174907}In the Senate, you kept quiet|while Brigham Anderson carried the load.
{174911}{174975}You were playing|for the right moment to rise up...
{174979}{175042}...and turn on the mighty wrath|of Seab Cooley.
{175047}{175110}All right, Seab, you've got it.
{175115}{175182}The biggest moment you'll ever have.
{175186}{175275}Brig Anderson gave it to you|with a dull razor blade.
{175326}{175369}Will you wait?
{175373}{175446}I'll make you a deal, Mr. Majority Leader.
{175450}{175539}Turn your votes loose,|and I'll keep my mouth shut.
{175543}{175627}Even if that man is confirmed,|I'll keep my mouth shut.
{175631}{175673}You call that a deal?
{175677}{175763}-I call it extortion.|-I meant it as a favor.
{175767}{175851}Thanks. I can do without your favors.
{175895}{175966}The subcommittee, under the|chairmanship of Senator Anderson...
{175970}{176030}...has reported favorably|to the full committee.
{176034}{176091}And the full committee vote|is as follows:
{176095}{176226}Eight votes for recommendation,|five votes opposed, one abstention.
{176230}{176294}By this vote, the Committee|on Foreign Relations...
{176298}{176414}...recommends that Robert A. Leffingwell|be confirmed for secretary of state.
{176418}{176478}I return the floor|to the senator from Michigan.
{176482}{176539}I move the Senate|now advise and consent...
{176543}{176632}...to the nomination of Robert A. Leffingwell|for secretary of state.
{176636}{176707}The question is, will the Senate|advise and consent...
{176711}{176803}...to the nomination of Robert A. Leffingwell|for secretary of state?
{176807}{176890}The senator from South Carolina|has apprised me of his intention...
{176895}{176930}...to speak on this motion.
{176935}{177040}The chair now recognizes the senior senator|from South Carolina.
{177135}{177246}Mr. President, there is some opinion|harbored here...
{177250}{177368}...that my opposition to Mr. Leffingwell|has been a matter of vindictiveness.
{177372}{177483}Mr. Rresident, I'm afraid|that's true to some degree...
{177487}{177609}...and for this, I humbly apologize...
{177613}{177648}...to this chamber...
{177665}{177768}...and to the man in the White House,|who, with good intentions for this nation...
{177772}{177832}...sent the nominee down to us.
{177856}{177963}I don't expect this apology|to wash away my sins...
{177979}{178067}...but I hope that it will,|in some way, reestablish me...
{178071}{178146}...as a senator in the eyes|of my colleagues...
{178150}{178250}...rather than as the flannel-mouthed|old curmudgeon...
{178255}{178357}...I seem to have become in my|waning years, and so much for that.
{178361}{178405}Mr. President...
{178429}{178521}...I shall still oppose Mr. Leffingwell...
{178525}{178586}...but without vindictiveness.
{178607}{178722}His voice is not the voice|I wanna hear speak for America.
{178736}{178833}It is, to me, an alien voice.
{178845}{178918}Rerhaps it's the new voice|of my country.
{178922}{179036}These old ears aren't tuned|to these new sounds, I know.
{179054}{179163}I don't understand much|that Mr. Leffingwell says.
{179181}{179319}I don't understand|how principles of dignity...
{179323}{179387}...can become outworn...
{179391}{179515}...or how this nation|can be represented without pride.
{179519}{179579}I don't understand these things.
{179583}{179706}Of course, I am what I am,|feel as I feel.
{179711}{179779}I'm gonna vote against confirmation...
{179783}{179820}...yet...
{179831}{179949}...I ask no man to follow me in this.
{180091}{180130}Mr. President.
{180135}{180213}Recognize the senior senator|from Michigan.
{180224}{180328}The senior senator from South Carolina...
{180332}{180443}...has just eaten|a rather large order of crow.
{180447}{180552}Strangely enough,|he makes the dish seem palatable.
{180556}{180651}He makes us all want to sit|at his table.
{180663}{180726}He calls himself a curmudgeon.
{180730}{180802}Well, I hope the day never comes...
{180807}{180882}...when there is not at least one|curmudgeon in this body...
{180886}{180979}...to goad us in the right direction.
{180983}{181064}I can't agree with him|about Mr. Leffingwell.
{181068}{181167}I don't interpret Mr. Leffingwell|in the same way. I don't hear an alien voice.
{181171}{181258}To me, it sounds realistic.|And more than that...
{181263}{181362}...I have great respect for the judgment|of our chief executive.
{181367}{181425}I'll vote for the nominee.
{181437}{181550}But there are tragic circumstances|surrounding this nomination...
{181554}{181640}...which takes it out of the usual business|and sets it deeply...
{181644}{181707}...into the conscience of each senator.
{181725}{181822}For this reason, I now wish|to release all pledges made to me.
{181831}{181896}-Mr. President, will the senator yield?|-I will not.
{181900}{181979}All pledges made to me|are free to vote as they will.
{181983}{182090}-What kind of a double-cross is this?|-The senator from Michigan has the floor.
{182094}{182154}-Mr. President, I ask for a quorum.|-I protest!
{182158}{182265}A quorum call precludes any speeches|from the floor until the call is finished.
{182269}{182304}Mr. Clerk?
{182309}{182378}-Mr. Abbott.|-Present.
{182382}{182455}-Mrs. Adams.|-Present.
{182459}{182538}-Mr. Andrews.|-Here.
{182543}{182597}-Well, Seab.|-Well, Bob.
{182601}{182698}-I'll beat you anyway.|-That, sir, is a question.
{182702}{182785}-Mr. Caulfield.|-Here.
{182796}{182894}It is impossible to predict the outcome|because there was no time to poll...
{182898}{182978}...the individual members of the Senate,|who will now decide...
{182982}{183078}...free of political commitments,|guided only by their own conviction...
{183083}{183171}...how to vote on the question|of Leffingwell's confirmation.
{183175}{183247}Senator Anderson 's|mysterious suicide will--
{183251}{183306}Wells, Simpson, Lansing.
{183310}{183346}Mr. Randall.
{183350}{183431}Kanaho abstained in the committee vote,|but he'll vote with Seab.
{183435}{183485}Strike him off.|Goodman, strike him off.
{183489}{183548}-Mr. Toland.|-Present.
{183573}{183629}-Mr. Topper.|-Here.
{183646}{183727}-Mr. Van Ackerman.|-Here and waiting!
{183731}{183802}-Mr. Young.|-Present.
{183807}{183854}-Mr. Zeffenbach.|-Here.
{183859}{183893}Call the absentees.
{183927}{183970}Mr. Courtney.
{183982}{184022}Mr. Fickett.
{184026}{184071}Mr. Fields.
{184093}{184137}Mr. Granville.
{184141}{184178}Mr. Larkins.
{184183}{184293}Thank you. From Strickland.|Seven minority votes for Leffingwell.
{184297}{184406}-A 42 majority, seven minority. Forty-nine.|-Well, we've still got a chance to win.
{184410}{184503}Rrior to the quorum, the Foreign Relations|Committee reported favorably...
{184507}{184593}...on the nomination of|Robert A. Leffingwell for secretary of state.
{184597}{184681}The senator from Michigan|moved the Senate advise and consent...
{184685}{184733}-...to that nomination.|-Mr. Rresident.
{184737}{184827}I did not relinquish the floor when I asked|for a quorum, Mr. Rresident.
{184831}{184898}The senior senator from Michigan|still has the floor.
{184902}{184964}The senator can't hold|the floor in silence.
{184968}{185033}With the chair's permission,|I shall be very brief.
{185037}{185099}The chair gladly gives permission|to be brief.
{185103}{185151}I ask for the yeas and nays.
{185155}{185255}Yeas and nays have been requested.|Is there a sufficient number?
{185259}{185316}I demand recognition, Mr. President!
{185331}{185381}You can't close to me!
{185385}{185434}-Question!|-Question!
{185456}{185538}Both sides of the aisle|are loudly demanding an immediate vote...
{185542}{185600}...on the question|whether or not to consent...
{185604}{185699}...to the president's nomination|of Leffingwell as secretary of state.
{185703}{185788}Plainly, both parties are repudiating|Van Ackerman 's tactics.
{185792}{185906}He is still putting up a fight to regain the|floor before the question is put to a vote.
{185931}{185984}This is conspiracy!
{185988}{186059}The chair is conspiring to stop debate!
{186063}{186162}The chair is violating the rules of the|Senate! I will not be bullied this way!
{186167}{186253}There is a sufficient show of hands.|Yeas and nays have been ordered.
{186257}{186336}-The clerk will call the roll.|-Mr. Abbott.
{186340}{186402}-Yes.|-Mrs. Adams.
{186407}{186512}What are you and Harley trying to pull?|You can't gag me. I'll get an investigation.
{186516}{186566}I don't think you'd want that.
{186570}{186679}-We're on to it, Fred.|-What are you talking about? On to what?
{186683}{186733}We tolerate about anything here.
{186737}{186834}Rrejudice, Atticism,|demagoguery, anything.
{186839}{186902}That's what the Senate's for,|to tolerate freedom.
{186923}{186966}But you've dishonored us.
{186971}{187037}Mr. Bender of California.
{187041}{187129}What I did was for the good|of the country.
{187133}{187270}Fortunately, our country always manages|to survive patriots like you.
{187274}{187346}We could introduce a resolution|to censure and expel you.
{187350}{187453}But we don't want Brig Anderson's|tired old sin made public.
{187457}{187499}Whatever it was.
{187503}{187602}-So we let you stay, if you want to.|-lf you want to.
{187607}{187650}Mr. Bronson.
{187671}{187709}No.
{187720}{187782}Mr. Caulfield.
