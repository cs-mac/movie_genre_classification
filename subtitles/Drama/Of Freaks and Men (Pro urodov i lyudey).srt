11
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:59,700
Johann passes through
Immigration Control

12
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,410
and enters the town.

13
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:49,583
Dr. Stasov adopts
the Siamese twins.

14
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:21,491
Engineer Radlov and his wife
photograph their daughter Leeza.

15
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,347
Years went by.

16
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,766
After the death
of his wife,

17
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,311
Radlov lived with his daughter
Leeza, and their maid, Grunya.

18
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,458
You can't bring
Mama back, Leeza.

19
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,017
They're leaving...

20
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,690
We'll go as well.

21
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,734
To the West?

22
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,070
I promised, didn't I?

23
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,447
Yes, Papa.

24
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,895
That'll be
the records.

25
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,753
Good day.

26
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,590
Have you come
to see Papa?

27
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,508
I'll call him.

28
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,764
Papa, there's someone
to see you.

29
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,568
Ah, Johann.

30
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,154
Have you brought it?

31
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,035
No.

32
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,666
But...then?

33
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:17,212
I've come
to see Grunya.

34
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,631
Grunya?

35
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,823
Grunya was
Johann's sister,

36
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,492
but she kept this
a secret.

37
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,995
She knew all about
her brother's occupation.

38
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,427
That's all.

39
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,392
Hello.

40
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:03,611
So that's what you do here,
Mr. Kohl.

41
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,446
You won't
fool me anymore!

42
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,073
I saw everything!

43
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,576
Everything!

44
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,245
I won't permit it!

45
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,081
I simply won't!

46
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:16,124
I didn't rent the studio
to you for that!

47
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:18,377
There are respectable
people living here!

48
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,379
There's no room
for your kind here!

49
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:35,602
Wait...

50
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,856
Putilov,

51
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,028
have you brought it?

52
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:46,905
What?

53
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,626
Leave the camera.

54
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,645
Viktor Ivanovich
sold the photographs

55
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:20,273
that were taken
in Johann's studio.

56
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,156
What do you want?

57
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,496
Don't come here.

58
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,167
What is it?

59
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,294
Who's in there?

60
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:27,049
Daria, who's there?

61
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:29,051
It's for me.

62
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,930
Go away.

63
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:36,141
What are you doing?

64
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,393
And the money?

65
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,852
Later.

66
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,063
You’ll get your money.

67
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,234
Go away!

68
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,747
Daria!

69
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:01,458
Yes.

70
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,419
Who was it?

71
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:06,255
It was for me, a relative
from my village...

72
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,549
But why come
to the front door?

73
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:12,094
Yekaterina Kirillovna,
it won't happen again.

74
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,973
Kolya, you sing the lead.

75
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,460
What's that?

76
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:45,587
A relative from
my village came.

77
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,137
Right, from the beginning,
with the introduction.

78
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:55,680
Kolya,
pay more attention,

79
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,766
you keep cutting in
on the Lead.

80
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:09,444
Boys, have you seen
my stethoscope?

81
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:12,238
Andrei, can't you see
that we're busy?

82
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,492
Katenka, forgive me,

83
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:19,371
but I have to go
on my rounds,

84
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:21,373
and I've no stethoscope.

85
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,382
You're going out?

86
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,217
I'll be back for supper.

87
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:33,511
Yekaterina Kirillovna
did not love her husband.

88
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,721
She carried on only
for the adopted twins.

89
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:39,642
Again,
from the beginning...

90
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,481
As the bell rings
monotonously

91
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,484
The road get dusty

92
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,570
and through the field

93
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,699
The coachman
sings his song

94
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:58,160
The coachman
sings his song

95
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,747
There is so much

96
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:04,333
feeling in his song

97
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,378
That my heart
burns up

98
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:11,132
in my cold chest...

99
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,189
Excuse me, have you
come to see us?

100
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,613
No.

101
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,650
Leeza.

102
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,671
Hello, Leeza.

103
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:07,667
Is papa home?

104
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,961
Yes, in the study.

105
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:13,214
Thank you.

106
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,535
Leeza,

107
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,371
Nikolai Nikolayevich
is waiting for you.

108
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,426
Leeza, meet Putilov.

109
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,397
Undoubtedly the cinema
is the thing,

110
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,441
no doubt about that,
my friend!

111
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:14,943
The cinema may become
a real art form,

112
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:19,156
an art form accessible to
the people of whom you speak.

113
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,076
Not painting, not literature,
not photography,

114
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,537
but the cinema will
reveal truth to the common folk.

115
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,122
You yourself
saw what effect

116
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:30,709
moving pictures have
on common people.

117
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:34,880
So your photography
will die out.

118
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,092
Shortly you'll see how
everything will change.

119
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:42,554
We're on the verge of
something major, something new.

120
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,642
The cinema is only
the beginning.

121
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:05,620
Excuse me.

122
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:23,346
It's all right, Grunya.

123
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:25,598
It won't be long now.

124
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:30,687
Leeza is already
grown up...

125
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:37,318
Grunya.

126
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,836
What was that?

127
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,380
They're fueling
the steam engines.

128
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:08,726
Do you like photography?

129
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,817
That must be the records.

130
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:50,351
Is that me?

131
00:18:56,525 --> 00:19:02,072
Ah, you've brought it.

132
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:05,075
It's my gift to you
on this special occasion.

133
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,745
It's turned out well.

134
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,918
It's a present.

135
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:17,170
Take it, take it.

136
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:37,441
It's me at age five.

137
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,282
To become a photographer,
Putilov got himself into debt.

138
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,451
So he became dependent
on Johann.

139
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,623
Putilov, you should be
on your way.

140
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:55,167
It's already late.

141
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,794
Yes, yes.

142
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,676
Could I, perhaps,
photograph you?

143
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,688
Leave me alone.

144
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:14,915
Take the boys
to the cinema.

145
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,587
Johann readied himself to make
a wedding proposal.

146
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:24,255
Is Leeza home?

147
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,923
Leeza?

148
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:29,176
Grunya,
who's there?

149
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,596
It's Johann.

150
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:35,057
But why through
the front door?

151
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:23,357
Hello.

152
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,695
Never, never set foot
in this house again...

153
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,531
Scum!

154
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:34,868
Don't let him in again!

155
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,286
Scum!

156
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,421
In this village...

157
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,767
In this village, my father
your grandfather, was born.

158
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:01,978
Whereas I was born
in a town...

159
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:05,107
right here.

160
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:08,443
Where was Mama born?

161
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:10,946
Mama?

162
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:13,031
Mama,

163
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,535
Mama,

164
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:19,497
Mama...

165
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:21,958
Andrei, it's for you.

166
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,584
Excuse me,
I won't be long.

167
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,847
Speaking.

168
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:36,973
Yes...

169
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,352
Yes, Grunya, of course.

170
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:46,274
When?

171
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:47,859
Take a look.

172
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:50,862
No, don't do anything.

173
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:53,823
Do you have any ice?

174
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:55,825
It's disgusting.

175
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,285
Order some ice.

176
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:59,037
Have you got any more?

177
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:01,664
There are more.

178
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:02,915
Yes, yes.

179
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,795
Where's Leeza?

180
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,715
Do you want to touch?

181
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,343
Go on.

182
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:48,754
So, Mama...

183
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,132
Mama was born here...

184
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:54,301
in this town.

185
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:04,395
Boys, engineer Radlov's
heart is acting up.

186
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,896
I must go.

187
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,969
Leeza! Wait!

188
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,529
Putilov, what an odor!

189
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,256
Thank you,
Semyon Markovich.

190
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:57,259
Excuse me
for having troubled you.

191
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:03,015
We'll have to clarify
certain points.

192
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:05,267
I'll phone you.

193
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:07,436
I'm sure you'll be able
to manage without me.

194
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:12,608
However, I disagree
with your decision.

195
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:41,054
Why did you get up?

196
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,932
The doctor said
you mustn't.

197
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:51,314
I've made a few changes
in my will.

198
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:55,277
It will be
a surprise for you.

199
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,238
It's a bit early for you
to be worrying about a will.

200
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:01,491
What'll you think of next!

201
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,077
I think you should
take a look at the photographs

202
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,955
I found in Leeza's things...

203
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,957
Photographs?

204
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,417
Come on then, come on.

205
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:22,095
Viktor Ivanovich couldn't get
the twins off his mind.

206
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:50,541
I told you not
to come here!

207
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,092
Quickly!

208
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,927
Is the master home?

209
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,471
He's not here.

210
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:07,183
But the mistress is home.

211
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:09,560
Go on, get out.

212
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:22,240
Where are you going?

213
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:27,537
Go away!

214
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:31,541
Go!

215
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,670
If she sees you...

216
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,422
I'll be punished.

217
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:44,638
What are you doing?

218
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,181
Go away, go away.

219
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:47,516
Where are the freaks?

220
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:50,060
What freaks?

221
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:51,331
Daria...

222
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,250
Have you run a bath?

223
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,972
Daria?

224
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:18,692
Who's here?

225
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:26,157
Viktor Ivanovich.

226
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:34,916
Viktor Ivanovich?

227
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:53,102
Viktor Ivanovich.

228
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:24,341
Turn around.

229
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,366
Mama?!

230
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:06,802
What do you want?

231
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,940
Viktor Ivanovich.

232
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:27,489
Yekaterina Kirillovna had fallen
in love for the first time.

233
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:17,120
The addition from
the 17th of May of this year.

234
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:19,873
The heretofore mentioned
Elizaveta NikoIayevna Radlova

235
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:23,209
will receive the benefits
of her inheritance

236
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:26,755
upon her entry into lawful
wedlock with such person as she,

237
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,884
Elizaveta Nikolayevna Radlova,
of her own free will

238
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,719
shall deem fit.

239
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:35,722
Until such time,
all heretofore mentioned assets,

240
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:39,517
monies, stocks and shares,
and the like,

241
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:42,187
will be administered
by an appointed trustee,

242
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:46,358
Gardena Spiridonovna Bosykh,
who shall act on my behalf

243
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,651
to safeguard the heretofore
mentioned properties.

244
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:52,030
Established on the 17th
of may of this year

245
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,824
in sound mind
and good health.

246
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:30,152
The engineer wanted Grunya to
replace Leeza's deceased mother.

247
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,962
Leeza, I will save you.

248
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:37,596
Putilov, you should be off.

249
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,389
It's already Late.

250
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:41,475
Yes, yes.

251
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:57,991
Leeza!

252
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:13,173
Hello.

253
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,149
Hello.

254
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,362
This way, that's it.

255
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:39,033
Nanny!

256
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:42,787
What? What do you want?

257
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,622
This is my nanny!

258
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:46,290
Leave me alone!

259
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,418
Go away!

260
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:52,088
Hello, Leeza.

261
00:41:55,925 --> 00:42:00,763
Putilov, you should be
on your way.

262
00:42:00,847 --> 00:42:02,640
Yes, yes.

263
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:15,820
Behind Johann's back,

264
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:18,322
Viktor Ivanovich
began his business.

265
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:34,776
Ready?

266
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,552
Hello.

267
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,315
A cinema!

268
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,373
May I use it
to photograph?

269
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:35,542
Some film.

270
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,879
I need a dark room.

271
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,384
What?

272
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,178
Yes, it's me.

273
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,084
We won't marry.

274
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,133
Grunya!

275
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,781
Make sure it's the same
as in the pictures.

276
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,493
Go on!

277
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:39,877
Nanny!

278
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:48,553
Why have you done such
naughty things?

279
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:51,347
Don't you know
that it's bad?

280
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:58,855
As it's your first time,
I won't punish you too severely.

281
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,953
There, my dear...

282
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:56,956
Let that be
a lesson to you.

283
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,421
Leeza...

284
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,340
I'll save you!

285
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:52,219
It's too late, Putilov.

286
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:04,024
Leeza, I'll save you.

287
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,696
And so Leeza became a woman
for the first time.

288
00:52:05,128 --> 00:52:06,921
Where are they?

289
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:09,257
Where are they?

290
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,220
Where are they?

291
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:19,642
Where are they?

292
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,439
Where are they?

293
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:26,941
Tell me! Tell me!

294
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:38,536
It's Dr. Stasov.

295
00:53:16,283 --> 00:53:18,660
Are you hiding something?

296
00:53:26,877 --> 00:53:31,423
Viktor Ivanovich hated
and feared Johann.

297
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:50,484
They sing.

298
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:05,541
Go on!

299
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:09,003
Make the bald one leave.

300
00:54:11,673 --> 00:54:14,300
What?

301
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:26,187
As the bell rings
monotonously

302
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:29,441
The road get dusty

303
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,736
and through the field

304
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:35,905
The coachman
sings his song

305
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,325
The coachman
sings his song

306
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:42,537
There is so much

307
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,749
Feeling in his song

308
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:48,918
That my heart
burns up

309
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:52,213
In my cold chest

310
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:56,134
In my cold chest

311
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,345
As I remember
those nights

312
00:54:59,471 --> 00:55:02,599
Those fields
and those forests

313
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:05,769
A tear comes to my eyes

314
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:08,897
That have been
dry for so long

315
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,151
That have been dry
for so long

316
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:15,738
As the bell rings
monotonously

317
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:18,699
I can hear it

318
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,786
from far away

319
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:25,164
My coachman
has stopped singing

320
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:30,461
My coachman has
stopped singing

321
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:44,058
My freaks will live here
for the time being.

322
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,312
Here?

323
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:29,896
What is it?

324
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:31,189
Drink it.

325
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:32,357
I won't.

326
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:34,443
Drink it, freak.

327
00:57:52,522 --> 00:57:54,607
Find Putilov.

328
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:23,094
Forgive us, please.

329
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:25,472
Tolya isn't like that really.

330
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:31,395
Tolya?

331
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:35,232
And who are you?

332
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:36,525
I'm Kolya.

333
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,362
What's your name?

334
00:58:40,487 --> 00:58:42,614
Leeza.

335
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:50,497
Nanny!

336
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,666
What's that?

337
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:23,072
The snow is shining

338
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:26,742
In the moonlight

339
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:30,497
A team of horses

340
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:33,666
Is rushing
through the night

341
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:37,087
Ding, ding, ding
ding, ding, ding

342
00:59:37,212 --> 00:59:40,715
A little bell rings

343
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:48,515
And talks to me

344
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:52,185
At early Spring

345
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,814
The moon is shining

346
00:59:55,897 --> 00:59:59,401
In the field

347
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:02,737
A friend will stop

348
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:06,116
Your young voice

349
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:09,703
That sounds
like a bell

350
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:13,415
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding

351
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,585
Sweetly sings
about love...

352
01:00:54,123 --> 01:00:56,876
I hate this town.

353
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:11,807
Months went by.

354
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:13,809
Leeza lived in one room
with the twins.

355
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:16,270
Kolya was hopelessly
in love with her.

356
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:17,980
Tolya drank on the sly.

357
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:30,159
If you keep traveling toward
the West, the sun never sets.

358
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:33,496
Must you travel fast?

359
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:35,539
We'll travel East.

360
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:38,043
That's where papa was born.

361
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:39,836
He'll find us.

362
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:49,679
Check.

363
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,907
I've brought you some wine.

364
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:17,165
Where's mama?

365
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:20,043
She left with the doctor.

366
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:22,379
That's not true!

367
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,385
Well, go on then!

368
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,678
Tolya, don't drink it.

369
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:31,388
Just a drop.

370
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,395
What?

371
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,275
Leeza.

372
01:03:24,692 --> 01:03:25,943
So, freaks!

373
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,403
Let's go.

374
01:03:53,722 --> 01:03:55,432
Nanny!

375
01:03:57,142 --> 01:04:00,229
Why have you done such
naughty things?

376
01:04:00,312 --> 01:04:02,898
Don't you know
that it's bad?

377
01:05:45,752 --> 01:05:47,128
Viktor Ivanovich?

378
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:48,713
Viktor Ivanovich,
Viktor Ivanovich...

379
01:05:48,797 --> 01:05:50,548
Let's go then.

380
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:08,442
Come on, come on.

381
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:57,659
Viktor Ivanovich?

382
01:07:03,707 --> 01:07:04,708
Let's go.

383
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,877
Where?

384
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:22,893
Who's here?

385
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:24,478
It's okay,
it won't take long.

386
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:29,900
That's it. Stand here.

387
01:07:43,205 --> 01:07:45,374
Viktor Ivanovich.

388
01:07:57,094 --> 01:07:58,595
Go on.

389
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:01,474
Get on your knees.

390
01:08:43,808 --> 01:08:45,393
Nanny!

391
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:01,159
I hate him.

392
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:04,787
I hate him.

393
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:10,044
I hate this dead town.

394
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,464
I hate carrots
with sour cream.

395
01:09:13,547 --> 01:09:15,591
Leeza!

396
01:09:19,303 --> 01:09:22,264
I'm sorry.

397
01:09:22,347 --> 01:09:24,475
Do you also
think I'm a freak?

398
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:25,601
Of course not!

399
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,227
You're very handsome.

400
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:28,812
I disgust you, I know.

401
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:32,441
It's because of Tolya,
isn't it?

402
01:09:34,693 --> 01:09:37,946
Because we're
always together.

403
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:41,116
But I'm normal.

404
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,701
I saw papa's books.

405
01:09:42,826 --> 01:09:44,661
It doesn't happen like that.

406
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:49,333
To love a woman,
you don't have to whip her.

407
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:52,378
I know how, I'll show you.

408
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:58,342
Leeza, try, please!

409
01:09:58,425 --> 01:09:59,343
Tolya's asleep.

410
01:09:59,426 --> 01:10:01,345
Just once!

411
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:06,558
He won't hear a thing.

412
01:10:06,683 --> 01:10:08,310
Try!

413
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:11,689
You may never
have another chance!

414
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,817
I love you.

415
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:31,543
And so Leeza became a woman
for the second time.

416
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,762
Putilov!

417
01:11:26,098 --> 01:11:27,933
Putilov!

418
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:17,733
Leeza.

419
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,726
My nanny's died.

420
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:55,564
Nanny!

421
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:07,553
So, freaks?

422
01:14:07,678 --> 01:14:10,098
It's all over.

423
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:37,292
The twins left
for the East.

424
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,896
Are you coming?

425
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,817
I'm heading toward the West.

426
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,988
Cast off.

427
01:15:08,407 --> 01:15:09,908
We'll come to see you.

428
01:15:10,034 --> 01:15:12,327
We'll find Papa
and then come.

429
01:15:27,718 --> 01:15:29,845
Forward.

430
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,973
I'll be waiting!

431
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:43,421
The famous doctor
and physician,

432
01:16:43,546 --> 01:16:47,299
Andrei Fyodorovich Stasov,
was born in this house.

433
01:16:47,425 --> 01:16:49,051
Papa.

434
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:00,688
Gentlemen!

435
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:03,941
After a short interval,
as promised,

436
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:07,903
the singing freaks
will appear before you.

437
01:17:08,696 --> 01:17:11,449
Tolya, just a little further.

438
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,960
What did you have to drink?

439
01:17:45,233 --> 01:17:47,110
Just a minute.

440
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:50,489
How are you?

441
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:51,656
Better?

442
01:17:51,782 --> 01:17:53,825
Can you sing?

443
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,834
Quickly, open up!

444
01:18:04,961 --> 01:18:08,215
Tolya, wake up.

445
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:13,011
Tolya, get up!

446
01:18:13,136 --> 01:18:17,682
Get up, Tolya.

447
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,477
We gotta go.

448
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,437
Get up, Tolya, come on.

449
01:18:22,562 --> 01:18:24,898
Open up now, freak!

450
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,900
Get up!

451
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:30,487
Tolya, get up!

452
01:18:56,889 --> 01:19:03,855
Tolya, get up!

453
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,065
Tolya!

454
01:19:10,486 --> 01:19:14,031
Leeza traveled to the West.

455
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:05,103
Would you like some music?

456
01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:07,063
I recommend it.

457
01:22:21,972 --> 01:22:24,141
Putilov!

458
01:22:24,266 --> 01:22:26,310
Look, it's Putilov!

459
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,164
Johann visited
the cinema.

460
01:23:35,839 --> 01:23:38,800
F. PUTILOV

461
01:23:38,884 --> 01:23:43,847
PUNISHMENT FOR A CRIME

462
01:23:43,972 --> 01:23:47,517
A REAL LIFE DRAMA

463
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:07,705
Why have you done
such naughty things?

464
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,916
Don't you know
that it's bad?

465
01:24:13,795 --> 01:24:17,048
As it's your first time,
I won't punish you too severely.

466
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,405
There, my dear...

467
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:42,740
Let that be a lesson to you.

468
01:24:48,121 --> 01:24:50,164
THE END

469
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:16,316
The snow
is shining

470
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:20,070
In the moonlight

471
01:25:20,154 --> 01:25:23,741
A team
of horses

472
01:25:23,824 --> 01:25:26,952
Is rushing
through the night

473
01:25:27,077 --> 01:25:31,040
Ding, ding, ding
ding, ding, ding

474
01:25:31,123 --> 01:25:34,126
A little
bell rings

475
01:25:34,251 --> 01:25:41,884
And talks to me

476
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:45,512
At early Spring

477
01:25:45,637 --> 01:25:49,224
The moon
is shining

478
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:52,770
In the field

479
01:25:52,853 --> 01:25:56,065
A friend will stop

480
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:59,485
Your young voice

481
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:03,113
That sounds
like a bell

482
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:07,451
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding

483
01:26:07,534 --> 01:26:11,163
Sweetly sings
about love

484
01:26:11,288 --> 01:26:14,667
The snow
is shining

485

Ding, ding, ding

489
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:35,855
A little bell rings

490
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:40,860
