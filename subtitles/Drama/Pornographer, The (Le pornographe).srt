1
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,656
THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY

2
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,778
Look! He's waking.
- Page Dr. Cocheton. Quickly.

3
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,864
Dr. Cocheton to room 119, please.

4
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:23,537
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

5
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,346
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes.

6
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:32,420
You've been asleep for a long time,
you're waking up now. Can you hear me?

7
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,940
<i>Yes, I'm hearing you.</i>

8
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:38,981
<i>What's happening?</i>

9
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,419
<i>Jesus, a hospital.</i>

10
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,021
Mr. Bauby, open your eyes wide.

11
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,498
Try to keep them open.

12
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:57,219
Yes, like that.
Follow this lamp with your eyes.

13
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,581
Alright.

14
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:09,942
Don't be alarmed.
You're in a hospital.

15
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,819
I'm a doctor. My name's Cocheton.
These are nurses.

16
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,897
We're here to take care of you.

17
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,137
Do you remember what happened?

18
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,657
Do you remember what happened?

19
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:30,576
<i>Just vague images</i>

20
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:41,379
You're in the Naval Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer.
On the coast. At Calais.

21
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:45,626
You were treated first in Paris,
and then brought here.

22
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,658
Do you remember that?

23
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,496
Jean-Dominique.

24
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,625
You've had a stroke.

25
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,819
You've been in a coma for
almost three weeks.

26
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,656
But now you're waking up and you'll be fine.

27
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,341
I promise you.

28
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:05,603
<i>Thank you</i>

29
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:07,979
- I have to give you some simple tests.

30
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,779
Keep your eyes on me.

31
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,306
Good.

32
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,464
Follow my finger.
Good.

33
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,256
When I say blink,
please blink.

34
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,456
Excellent.

35
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,376
Now, tell me your name.

36
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,236
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

37
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,656
- Come on, try

38
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,894
<i>I just did.</i>

39
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,462
- Try really hard, say your name.

40
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,736
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

41
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,701
Try saying your children's names.

42
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,618
<i>Théophile, Céleste, Hortense.</i>

43
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,822
Don't worry.

44
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,498
It's a slow process.
But your speech will come back.

45
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:13,303
<i>What? Can't you hear me, doctor?
Doctor?</i>

46
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,658
<i>What's happening? I can't speak.</i>

47
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,984
<i>They can't hear me.
Oh my God.</i>

48
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,979
<i>I can't speak.</i>

49
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,382
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

50
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,020
<i>My name is Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

51
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,182
<i>Doctor?</i>

52
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,659
<i>All right, all right.</i>

53
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:39,301
<i>I've had a stroke my speech'll
come back my memory will come back</i>

54
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,705
Everything will be alright, Mr. Bauby.
We are here to care for you.

55
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,619
<i>I'll be patient.</i>

56
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:48,666
<i>Ok.</i>

57
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,304
<i>Ok, I believe you.</i>

58
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,586
<i>Who brought these flowers?</i>

59
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>Roses.</i>

60
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,306
<i>Inès.</i>

61
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,697
Did you sleep well?

62
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,665
Let's see.

63
00:06:56,147 --> 00:07:00,504
You're going to have an important visitor.
Dr. Lepage, your neurologist.

64
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,345
So we want you at your very best.

65
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,979
Good morning.

66
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:35,257
I'm Alain Lepage, your neurologist.
You know Dr. Cocheton, of course.

67
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,379
Jean-Dominique...
no, no, your friends call you Jean-Do.

68
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:41,863
So that's what I'm going to call you.
Think of me as your friend.

69
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>Sure Doctor.</i>

70
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:48,223
As a friend I know how
difficult this is for you.

71
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:55,385
Nobody here has explained to
you the full extent of your condition.

72
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,696
You've had what we call a
cerebrovascular accident.

73
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,540
It's put your brain stem out of action.

74
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:11,504
The brain stem is an essential
component of our internal computer

75
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,665
the link between the brain
and the spinal cord.

76
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,629
In the past, we would have
said you'd had a massive stroke.

77
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,895
You would very
probably have died.

78
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:26,580
But now we have such improved
resuscitation techniques

79
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,903
that we're able to prolong life.

80
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,665
<i>Is this life?</i>

81
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,381
<i>Is this life?
- Yes, prolong life.</i>

82
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:42,137
I'm not going to mince words,
Jean-Do. You are completely paralyzed.

83
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:48,616
You have realised you are unable to speak.

84
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,577
You have what we call...

85
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,777
...'locked-in syndrome'.

86
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,607
<i>locked-in syndrome.</i>

87
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,218
- Locked-in syndrome.

88
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:11,505
It will be of no comfort to you but your
condition is extremely rare.

89
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,426
And we simply don't know the cause.

90
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,982
You don't smoke and you're
not a heavy drinker.

91
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,826
It just happened all of a sudden.

92
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:25,499
However, apart from being totally
paralysed...

93
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,505
...you are normal in every other respect.

94
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,292
<i>Normal?</i>

95
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,345
- There is hope.

96
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,217
Your brain is functioning.

97
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:39,022
You're able to understand us.
You follow our movements with your eyes.

98
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,946
Although I'm not entirely
happy with your right eye.

99
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,659
This muscle doesn't work, see?

100
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,546
The eye doesn't get moisturized.

101
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,504
I'm afraid we have to cover that.

102
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,600
Don't we?

103
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:58,345
<i>- Cover?</i>

104
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,853
<i>What does he want to cover?</i>

105
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,857
- but I'll take a second guess on that.

106
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:09,781
We want you to take it easy for a few days.

107
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,635
<i>What d'you think I'm doing now?</i>

108
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,378
- and then two beautiful
young women will visit you.

109
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:18,514
And when I say beautiful,
I mean beautiful.

110
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,183
<i>- Fine.</i>

111
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:24,415
They are great. Outstanding therapists and
miracle workers.

112
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,232
<i>No miracles please.</i>

113
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,859
- And so, as I say, there's hope..

114
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,385
<i>That's what you all showed me.</i>

115
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,181
You'll be well looked after, Jean-Do.
Really.

116
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:35,624
<i>That's a good start.</i>

117
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,345
- You'll be well looked after.

118
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:30,660
Good morning.

119
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,495
<i>Have I gone to heaven?</i>

120
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:40,581
- I'm Henriëtte.

121
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:45,019
And I'm Marie.
- You can blink your eyes, don't you?

122
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:48,617
So, I want you to blink once for yes,
twice for no.

123
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:52,657
<i>Fine! Two beauties and I'm helpless.</i>

124
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,298
- Can you read that?

125
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,622
<i>Where?</i>

126
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:59,866
H. Durand, logopediste.
- Can you see Durand?

127
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,023
<i>Good, Mr. Bauby.
- Mrs. or Miss?</i>

128
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,776
I'm your physical therapist.
First you have to learn again to swallow.

129
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,343
So I'll be working on your tongue and lips.

130
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,244
<i>Sounds fun.</i>

131
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,936
- And I'm your speech therapist.

132
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:17,016
Until you can actually speak again
I have to find a way for you to communicate.

133
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,397
Your condition is extremely rare.

134
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,060
<i>- I know.</i>

135
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:24,340
we're going to have to work very hard.
- So we'd better get started.

136
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:29,063
Exactly. I just came in to introduce myself.
See you.

137
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,899
<i>See you.</i>

138
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,064
I want you to know...

139
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,703
...that this is perhaps the most important
job I've ever been given.

140
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,139
and I'm determined to succeed.
With your help, of course.

141
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:59,336
I think you understand,
but I will ask you some questions.

142
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,780
Ok?

143
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,940
Remember, you answer
by blinking once for yes

144
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,179
or twice for no..

145
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,775
Am I a man?

146
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,386
Am I a woman?

147
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,104
Is the sun too bright for you?

148
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,261
Is it midnight now?

149
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:25,093
<i>What kinds of questions are this?</i>

150
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,263
- Are we in Paris?

151
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,101
Are we in Berck?

152
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:32,741
Does wood float?

153
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,503
<i>- I don't think so.</i>

154
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,736
Do you remember having your stroke?

155
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,906
Were you the editor of Elle magazine?

156
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,664
<i>Yes, I was the editor-in-chief of Elle.</i>

157
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,986
To Alaïa.

158
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,665
Your right eye isn't working properly.

159
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,744
Can you hear me?

160
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,383
Your right eye isn't working properly.,
I'm going to sew it up.

161
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:33,998
<i>Sew it up?</i>

162
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,416
- That happens...

163
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,301
...an ulcerated cornea.

164
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:45,900
I've been skiing in St. Moritz.
It's wonderful there now.

165
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,745
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

166
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,986
nothing like sailing down a slope
with the wind in your face..

167
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,745
<i>Keep away from me</i>

168
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:54,921
Don't worry

169
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,381
<i>- keep away from me</i>

170
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,609
You won't feel a thing.

171
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,465
<i>- Please.</i>

172
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,099
<i>No, please don't...</i>

173
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,899
- You won't feel
anything. Just be quiet.

174
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,261
<i>Don't</i>

175
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,821
I've done this dozens of times.

176
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,535
It will be fine.

177
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,425
Don't worry.

178
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,381
Almost done.
A few more pinpricks.

179
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:34,375
Perfect, even if I say so myself.

180
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,341
Done.

181
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,585
We're going to dress you to
cheer you up a bit.

182
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,022
Afterwards we have a surprise.

183
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,221
We're going to try
you in this wheelchair.

184
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,105
Ok.

185
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:31,424
Wheel him up and down, will you?

186
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:36,699
These are my students.
Pay no attention to them.

187
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,169
I want to be sure that
sitting like that won't

188
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,185
trigger uncontrollable muscular spasms.

189
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:43,945
He needs a cushion behind his head

190
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:49,016
Sorry we have to do this to you, Jean-Do.
Excellent. Excellent.

191
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,946
You can handle the wheelchair.

192
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,527
<i>You can handle the wheelchair.
What an honor.</i>

193
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:55,617
- That is good news.

194
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,704
And now for the surprise

195
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:14,385
<i>Oh my God, who's that? Me?</i>

196
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:20,460
<i>I look as if I've emerged from a vat
of formaldehyde.</i>

197
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>Horrible.</i>

198
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,384
<i>Is that my surprise?
To see myself?</i>

199
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,096
<i>Céline.</i>

200
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:54,377
How are you?
Ok, let me explain that.

201
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,505
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Jean-Do?
Your first visitor is your wife.

202
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,594
<i>No, she's the mother of my children.</i>

203
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,703
- He understands everything.
Everything.

204
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,621
If you ask a question,
make it a yes-or-no question. Ok?

205
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:14,820
He'll blink. One for yes, two for no.

206
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:16,340
Ok.

207
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:22,497
One more thing. Stay in front of him
when you talk to him. Ok?

208
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,620
If you stand here, he can't see you,
and here neither.

209
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,899
Talk to him like this.
Right, Jean-Do?

210
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:34,146
I'll leave you. I'm sure you have a lot
to say to each other...

211
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,175
They tell me you're doing...

212
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:02,736
Everyone sends their love.
And their prayers.

213
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,383
I didn't bring the children.

214
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,859
I thought I should see you first.

215
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,145
They're both well.
They miss you.

216
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,821
Celeste prays for you every night.

217
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,545
Do you want me to bring them?

218
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,106
Don't you want to see them?

219
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,140
Laurent wants to visit.
Do you want to see him?

220
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,706
Him you want to see.

221
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,019
I'll tell him.

222
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,903
Has she been to see you?

223
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,576
I've met the speech therapist.
I like her.

224
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,577
She thinks she can help you.

225
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,618
Please don't cry.

226
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:45,740
<i>I know Berck station. I can see her now.</i>

227
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:48,381
<i>It's the most depressing place in the world.</i>

228
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:52,978
<i>Well, it certainly was when I had my
holidays here as a child.</i>

229
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,860
<i>Berck. The end of summer.</i>

230
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,985
<i>Waiting with my father for the Paris train.</i>

231
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:03,419
<i>It was desolate then and it'll be
more desolate now.</i>

232
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,379
<i>I treated her so badly.
And the children, too.</i>

233
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:15,386
<i>And now I will never be able
to make amends.</i>

234
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,700
<i>Never.</i>

235
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,266
Look at this.

236
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:26,143
As you can see, it's not the alphabet
we learned at school.

237
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:29,532
These letters are presented
in order of usage frequency.

238
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:30,659
Do you understand?

239
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,343
E, S, A, R, I, N...

240
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,342
<i>Usage frequency?</i>

241
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,544
I've talked to a host of colleagues...

242
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,942
...and I think I've come up
with a viable system.

243
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:51,910
<i>Good for you.</i>

244
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,103
- This is how it works.

245
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:57,903
You think of something to say.
When you're ready, blink.

246
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:03,184
I'll recite this alphabet,
very slowly, letter by letter.

247
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,424
When I get to the first letter
of your word, blink.

248
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,417
I'll write it down, letter for letter,
and so on.

249
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,585
In that way we'll form words and sentences.

250
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:18,826
Two other things: blink twice
when the word is formed.

251
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:21,641
As if you're hitting the
space bar on a keyboard.

252
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,981
And blink rapidly if we make a mistake.

253
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,832
I know it sounds terribly arduous but,

254
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:29,026
believe me, we'll become
expert very quickly.

255
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:32,856
And your friends and family can use it, too.

256
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,343
Are you ready for this?
Look at me.

257
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:38,774
Do you want to try?

258
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,944
Have you thought of
something you want to say?

259
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,739
Good.

260
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,148
So, let's begin.

261
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,097
<i>- Wait, no...</i>

262
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:49,449
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

263
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:49,856
- E.

264
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,805
Is E the first letter?

265
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,616
<i>- No.</i>

266
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,903
E is not the first letter.

267
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:58,979
<i>- I don't know what to say.</i>

268
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:02,657
It's difficult, I know, so let's go slowly.

269
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,578
E, S, A...

270
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,745
<i>That's too slow.</i>

271
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:22,816
<i>I can't keep my eyelids open that long.
Get cracking!</i>

272
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,022
I...

273
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:29,509
I?

274
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,738
<i>- Good.</i>

275
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,464
Is I the first word?

276
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,137
<i>My first word is I.
I begin with myself.</i>

277
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:39,541
E, S...

278
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,655
S?

279
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:42,786
<i>No.</i>

280
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:43,858
- No?

281
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:44,650
Not S.

282
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,786
<i>- That was too fast.</i>

283
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:54,422
<i>It doesn't work. This is a nightmare.
It'll never work.</i>

284
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,185
Shall we go on?

285
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,858
<i>I've had enough.</i>

286
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,018
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

287
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,857
<i>Up, down, up.</i>

288
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:36,865
<i>Under my arms.</i>

289
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,377
<i>The back of my legs.</i>

290
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>I'm forty-two years old...</i>

291
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,340
<i>...and I'm being handled like a big baby.</i>

292
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:53,261
<i>my private parts wiped and swaddled.</i>

293
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,903
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

294
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,896
<i>But as the poet says:</i>

295
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,940
<i>only a fool laughs when
there's nothing to laugh at.</i>

296
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,583
Blow me a kiss.

297
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:09,982
Come on.

298
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,060
Try it.

299
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,421
Come on.

300
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:22,616
Try.

301
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,017
It's difficult.

302
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:25,943
<i>- No mirror.</i>

303
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,225
But that's what I want you to work at.

304
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,258
<i>- Not that face.</i>

305
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,925
When you're resting or
watching TV, or any time at all,

306
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,542
I want you to work at blowing me a kiss.

307
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,459
Okay?

308
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,260
<i>- Okay.</i>

309
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,945
And one other thing you have
to practise as much as possible.

310
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:45,300
And that's sliding your tongue
to the back of your palate.

311
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:50,499
That's how you'll learn to swallow again.
Watch.

312
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,020
<i>This just isn't fair. Not fair.</i>

313
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:07,930
You try it.

314
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,899
<i>- Put that mirror away.</i>

315
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,539
Open your mouth.

316
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,335
Good.

317
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:18,744
Try sliding your tongue backwards.

318
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,111
<i>I can't.</i>

319
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:24,535
- Try, go on.

320
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,743
<i>I can't.</i>

321
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:29,222
Good! You moved your tongue.

322
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:31,539
<i>Don't make a fool of me.</i>

323
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,181
- Very good. Again.

324
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,115
Unbelievable. Good.

325
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:40,019
<i>- Yes, but true.</i>

326
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,664
I'll help you to move your head on your own.
Like that.

327
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,400
<i>You're doing it all.</i>

328
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:54,219
- Left.

329
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,546
Good.

330
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,940
Right. Good.

331
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,819
Left again.

332
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,545
Can you feel my hands on your face?

333
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,305
<i>No.</i>

334
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,340
Never mind, you will, you will.

335
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,745
We're all very sorry for
what's happened to you.

336
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,816
I'm a regular reader of Elle.
I love it.

337
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,417
I just wish all the models
didn't look like boys.

338
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:44,464
<i>I don't think so.</i>

339
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,618
- They're getting thinner and thinner.

340
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,585
An odd fashion.

341
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,303
<i>How beautiful she is.</i>

342
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:59,260
I have a strong faith.
I pray for you every day.

343
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:06,385
He can only see with his right eye.
Look straight at him when you talk.

344
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:07,662
<i>Who is that?</i>

345
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,385
<i>Pierre Roussin.</i>

346
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,789
Do you remember me?

347
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,063
<i>- Of course.</i>

348
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,911
He blinks once for yes....

349
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,782
<i>- Damn, I didn't call him back.</i>

350
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:28,104
Do you want me to leave?
- No, please not.

351
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,980
<i>Why didn't I call him back?</i>

352
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,577
I heard what happened to you.
And I just wanted...

353
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:40,536
I was compelled to come and see you
because of what happened to me.

354
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:47,266
In a way, I know what you're going through

355
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:55,023
Being taken hostage is not so different
from what you're going through,

356
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:57,290
Am I right?

357
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,099
<i>- Hostage?</i>

358
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:04,377
Jean-Dominique was kind enough
to give me his seat on a flight

359
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:10,696
The plane was high-jacked and I remained
a hostage in Beirut for four years.

360
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,694
Four years, four months,
two weeks, five days

361
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,820
and seven hours.

362
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:21,462
They kept me in a cellar.
Very small. Dark.

363
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,544
It was hard to breathe.

364
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,097
I called it my tomb.

365
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:33,098
I know, a lot about wines.

366
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,944
<i>- What happened to his hand?</i>

367
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:42,302
I used to recite aloud the wines of the
Bordeaux classification of 1855.

368
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:48,536
Château Margaux, Margaux.
Château Lafite Rotschild, Pauillac.

369
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:56,100
That's what preserved my sanity.

370
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:06,546
Most times, I was in despair.
Suicidal. Angry.

371
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:13,140
The beatings, the filth, the cruelty.

372
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:16,464
But the worst was the waiting.

373
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,425
I survived.

374
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:26,143
I survived, because I held
fast to my own humanity.

375
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:33,822
That's all I could do
because that's all I had,

376
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:34,879
just like you.

377
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:45,176
Cling to your own humanity
and you'll survive.

378
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:47,505
<i>Humanity? Easy.</i>

379
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,823
- I just had to say
that to you in person.

380
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:56,383
<i>Why didn't I call him,
when he was back from Beirut?</i>

381
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,225
<i>I felt too guilty.</i>

382
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:00,004
It's ridiculous...

383
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,181
<i>- It's not. I feel ashamed.</i>

384
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,702
I?

385
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,540
W?

386
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:20,742
I want?

387
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:23,985
What do you want, Mr. Bauby?

388
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:35,861
D.

389
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:46,335
I.

390
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:57,296
E.

391
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,502
Die.

392
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,185
You want to die?

393
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,265
How dare you!

394
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:18,456
There are people who love you
and care for you.

395
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,943
I hardly know you and
yet I'm there for you.

396
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,900
And you're alive.
So, don't say you want to die.

397
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,223
It's offensive and obscene.

398
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,459
You want to continue?

399
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:37,865
Alright.

400
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,183
I'll come back another time and see
if you've changed your mind.

401
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,703
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,162
<i>Why?</i>

403
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,265
- I went too far.

404
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:23,939
Rest yourself.

405
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,901
Do you like it?
I didn't really know what to bring.

406
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,382
Look, I also brought this.

407
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,198
One moment.

408
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,860
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

409
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,058
<i>What is that?</i>

410
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:54,543
<i>That's not true.
This makes me look like a rabbit.</i>

411
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,943
I just read the letters and you blink,
is that ok?

412
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:01,182
<i>Let it be.</i>

413
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:01,739
- Ok?

414
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,518
S of A?

415
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,135
<i>- As you want it.</i>

416
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,279
<i>A.</i>

417
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,260
<i>- Good then A.</i>

418
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:21,102
N?

419
00:34:22,347 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>Good, N.</i>

420
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,066
<i>Anne.</i>

421
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,862
<i>You have to look at me, Laurent.</i>

422
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,982
Shit, I forgot to look at you.
Sorry, I'll start again and slow down.

423
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,297
<i>As you like it...</i>

424
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,066
<i>Funny.</i>

425
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,225
I've never been a good hospital visitor.

426
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,770
I'm the sort who brings
food and then eats it.

427
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,743
<i>- That's not true.</i>

428
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,579
Why did that have to happen to you?

429
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:01,177
Everybody's talking about it.
I was in Cafe de Flore last night...

430
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:06,705
...I heard someone say, 'Did you know that
Jean-Do Bauby is now a complete vegetable?'

431
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:07,676
<i>Vegetable.</i>

432
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:08,983
- He can't see you.

433
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,741
<i>Who said that?</i>

434
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:13,984
<i>And what sort of vegetable?</i>

435
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:16,822
A carrot, a potato, a pickled cucumber?

436
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:34,662
<i>Today it seems to me that my whole life
was nothing but a string of failures.</i>

437
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:41,422
<i>the women I was unable to love,
the chances I failed to seize...</i>

438
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,506
<i>...the moments of happiness
I allowed to drift away...</i>

439
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,386
<i>A race whose result you know
beforehand...</i>

440
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,459
<i>...but in which you fail to bet on
the winner.</i>

441
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,703
<i>Have I been blind or stupid?</i>

442
00:36:55,907 --> 00:37:00,139
<i>Or does it take the harsh light of disaster
to to show a person their true nature?</i>

443
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,859
I'm still here.

444
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,017
Would you like me to work with you today?

445
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,302
Good.

446
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,306
We're going to master this.

447
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,516
Do you agree?

448
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:30,697
<i>- Yes, mistress.</i>

449
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,266
Ok.

450
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:34,700
I'll begin.

451
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,702
T?

452
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:52,382
H?

453
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,895
A?

454
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,541
K? Thank you.

455
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,105
Thank you?

456
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,539
Thank you.

457
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:14,803
May I call you Jean-Do?

458
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,345
<i>- Women are not complicated.</i>

459
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,139
Thank you, Jean-Do.

460
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,066
I?

461
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,658
I have?

462
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:42,065
<i>I have decided not feel sorry
for myself again.</i>

463
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:50,465
<i>Apart from my eyes, there two more
things that aren't paralysed.</i>

464
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,345
<i>My imagination...</i>

465
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,426
<i>...and my memory.</i>

466
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:15,106
<i>My imagination and my memory are the
only way I can escape my diving bell.</i>

467
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:43,699
<i>I can imagine anything, anyone, anywhere</i>

468
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,745
<i>I let the sea wash over me
on the isle of Martinique.</i>

469
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:56,462
<i>Visit the women I love.</i>

470
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:10,897
<i>Bow before Ozym Andias, king of kings.</i>

471
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>I can imagine anything.</i>

472
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:24,945
<i>As a child I dreamed
of my abilities as an adult.</i>

473
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,786
<i>Now I want to remember myself as I was.</i>

474
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:32,503
<i>Handsome, debonair, glamorous.
And devilishly attractive</i>

475
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:35,646
<i>Yes, glamorous and
handsome, some people said.</i>

476
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:37,906
<i>That's not me, that's Marlon Brando.</i>

477
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:40,260
<i>That's me.</i>

478
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:16,220
Is this Betty Mialet?
- Yes, this is she.

479
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:21,421
My name is Henriëtte Durand. I'm a therapist
at Berck-sur-Mer Naval Hospital.

480
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:25,466
I'm calling on behalf of one of my patients,
Jean-Dominique Bauby.

481
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,386
Jean-Do? How is he?

482
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:32,383
Comfortable but...
- I heard he's completely paralyzed.

483
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:37,138
That he can't communicate with anybody.
- That's not absolutely accurate.

484
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,822
Come in.

485
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,305
He wants me to ask you for a favour.

486
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,662
Of course. Can you wait a minute?

487
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:48,906
Anything.

488
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,224
He says he has a contract
with you for a book.

489
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,146
He said that? He can speak, I thought he
couldn't speak.

490
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:59,579
He can. In a way. I'll explain later.

491
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:04,144
About this book...
- Yes, he's got a contract with us,

492
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,135
but now, given the circumstances...
- He wants to fulfill it.

493
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,977
He wants to write the book.
- You can't be serious?

494
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,981
Let me assure you, he can.

495
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:23,899
but do you think you can
find someone to take his dictation?

496
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,665
Someone who's patient.

497
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:32,339
Somebody with a lot of time.
Someone special.

498
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,505
Yes, I understand. I'll get back to you.

499
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,104
Betty Mialet said Claude Mendibil
was sent from heaven.

500
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,696
She said no one could be
more perfect for this.

501
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:46,502
Betty always exaggerates.
I will have to practise with Henriëtte.

502
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,823
Any time.

503
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,220
He wants to say something.

504
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,060
No?

505
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,178
No panic.

506
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:26,018
Claude has taken a room in a hotel.
Perhaps you ought to discuss a routine.

507
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:32,257
<i>The nurses wake me at five a.m.
I'll think of what I want to write.</i>

508
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:36,779
<i>You can come at eight
then I'll dictate it to you.</i>

509
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:40,626
Good. I'll do my best for you.

510
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,706
<i>- I know you will.</i>

511
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:45,036
<i>Can we begin tomorrow??</i>

512
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,183
- Of course.

513
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16,551
Through?

514
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:19,746
<i>- Through the frayed
curtain of my window...</i>

515
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,217
<i>...a wan glow announces the break of day.</i>

516
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,863
<i>My heels hurt, my head weighs a ton</i>

517
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:31,185
<i>my whole body is encased
in a kind of diving suit.</i>

518
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:34,902
<i>My task now is to write
the motionless travel notes...</i>

519
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:38,463
<i>...from a castaway
on the shores of loneliness.</i>

520
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:44,819
<i>This Naval Hospital has in its time been a
home to children with tuberculosis</i>

521
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:49,298
<i>In the hall, there's a white marble bust...</i>

522
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,943
<i>...of Empress Eugénie,
the wife of Napoleon III...</i>

523
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,100
<i>...the hospital's patroness.
She came here regularly.</i>

524
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:01,983
<i>There was a fat farm,
a school and a place where</i>

525
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:05,065
<i>...the great Diaghilev
rehearsed his Ballet Russe..</i>

526
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:11,058
<i>They say it was here that Nijinsky leapt
twelve feet into the air.</i>

527
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,335
<i>No one here now leaps into the air.</i>

528
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:23,066
<i>These days they are all elderly, enfeebled
or, like me, rigid and mute.</i>

529
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,297
<i>A battalion of cripples.</i>

530
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:32,056
<i>But I like being wheeled to the
place I call Cinecitta.</i>

531
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:33,981
<i>A perpetually deserted
terrace, a vast series</i>

532
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,577
of balconies that open
onto a landscape...

533
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:39,575
<i>...heavy with the poetic and offbeat
charm of a movie set.</i>

534
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:43,862
<i>A handful of buildings at
the foot of the sand dunes</i>

535
00:45:43,962 --> 00:45:46,657
<i>give the illusion of a
ghost town in a Western.</i>

536
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,739
<i>And I enjoy seeing the suburbs of Berck</i>

537
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:52,546
<i>that look like a model train lay-out..</i>

538
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:56,507
<i>The sea foams such an
incandescent white that it might</i>

539
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,737
<i>be the product of the
special-effects department.</i>

540
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,019
<i>But my favorite sight of all
is the lighthouse.</i>

541
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:06,539
<i>tall, robust, reassuring
in red and white stripes..</i>

542
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,619
<i>I place myself under the
protection of this brotherly symbol...</i>

543
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:14,302
<i>...guardian not just of sailors
but of the sick...</i>

544
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:17,265
<i>...whom fate has cast
to the far edge of life.</i>

545
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:23,064
The two highlights of this mini museum
are a white marble bust...

546
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:29,217
...which embodies the radiant youth

547
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:31,424
...of a princess who died with 94...

548
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:36,542
<i>Five hours of work. Doesn't sound bad.</i>

549
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:41,258
<i>It's not Balzac.</i>

550
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:44,380
Shall I continue?

551
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:50,378
- Read Balzac to me.

552
00:46:50,547 --> 00:46:53,744
<i>Or Graham Greene.</i>

553
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:56,501
[Laurent reading Graham Greene's
The Honorary Consul]

554
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:12,821
I'm 45 divorced,
and I want to speak the consul.

555
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,544
What's that?
- Is it a man or a woman?

556
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:56,462
A man. I think.
- He winked at you.

557
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:03,423
Excuse me,
but did you order a speaker phone?

558
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:11,302
Did you order a phone?

559
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,215
Let's get out of here.

560
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:20,744
Who let you in? What are you doing?

561
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:23,415
We're from Telecom France.

562
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:27,779
You should have gone to Reception first.
- There was no one there.

563
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,820
Just install it by the table,
please, thank you.

564
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:39,863
Be careful, please.

565
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:43,981
We'll let people know
you've got a phone now.

566
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:46,263
They'll have to book
a time for their calls.

567
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,822
We'll make sure someone's with you.

568
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,135
Excuse me, madame, can't he speak?

569
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:58,778
- Don't talk about him
as if he weren't here.

570
00:48:58,987 --> 00:49:01,057
Ask him.

571
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:05,146
Madame, excuse me, but, if he can't
speak what's he want a phone for?

572
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:07,542
Perhaps he's a heavy breather.

573
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:13,017
You think you're funny?

574
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:16,301
How dare you!

575
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:21,503
<i>You miss a sense of humor, Henriëtte.</i>

576
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:27,138
And three. Calm, four.

577
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,503
<i>A very black fly settles on my nose.</i>

578
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:51,818
<i>I waggle my head to unseat him. He digs in..</i>

579
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:54,018
<i>Olympic wrestling is child's play
compared to this.</i>

580
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:57,776
You moved your head.
When did you start doing that?

581
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:59,500
<i>Thank you.</i>

582
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,460
Just now?

583
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,420
A miracle! You can turn your head!

584
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:16,045
<i>Marie sees miracles everywhere.</i>

585
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,462
- Dr. Lepage, he moved his head.

586
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,389
Good morning.

587
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,465
<i>- A miracle! He only
said good morning once!</i>

588
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,162
Progress, progress.

589
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:24,386
<i>- That's better.</i>

590
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:30,142
How's the tongue?
- I'll open your mouth.

591
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:35,103
The tongue moves

592
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:37,112
Then we can go further with his speech.

593
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,977
- The movement of the tongue
is crucial so there's hope.

594
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:42,496
Great, that's awesome.

595
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:46,746
We're going to work really hard,
soon you'll be able to eat normally.

596
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:51,137
<i>A text is only real when it's read.</i>

597
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:56,375
<i>I shaved my father when I visited him
the last time before my accident.</i>

598
00:50:56,587 --> 00:51:01,263
<i>He was unwell and I stayed overnight
in his apartment in Paris.</i>

599
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:05,540
<i>The next morning I shaved his stubble.</i>

600
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:09,422
Who can see if I'm shaven?
- Me.

601
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:14,021
I'm terrified.
- Of what?

602
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:17,496
You shaving me.

603
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:22,622
You were always so damned clumsy.
- That runs in the family.

604
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:24,180
Sure.

605
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,543
Coffee?
- No.

606
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:33,903
Don't tire him. He's not well.
- How can a shave tire him?

607
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:44,417
Your mother was prettier.
- That wouldn't be difficult.

608
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,778
Do you remember your mother?
- Oh yeah.

609
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:53,384
You always ask me that and I always say
the same thing: not really.

610
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:59,897
What are you reading at the moment?

611
00:51:59,898 --> 00:52:02,626
- Re-reading.
The Count of Monte Cristo.

612
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,091
Why?

613
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:07,815
- Because I'm thinking of
writing a modern version.

614
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:09,938
Of the Count of Monte Cristo?
- Yes.

615
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:15,425
Vengeance will still be the driving force...

616
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:19,506
...but I'm setting it in today's world.
And Monte Cristo will be a woman.

617
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:25,824
The Countess of Monte Cristo..?
- Yes, a woman.

618
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:31,385
I don't want to read it.
- I haven't written it yet.

619
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:36,306
But I've got a contract
with a book publisher.

620
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:43,297
If you cut me, I'll sue.

621
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:52,496
The doctor came yesterday.
- And?

622
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:59,138
He says I'll live to be a hundred.
- Good. I'll give you a great party.

623
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:03,659
I won't attend.
Who wants to live to be a hundred?

624
00:53:04,987 --> 00:53:08,377
Jean-Do, don't tell a soul.

625
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:11,657
I still miss your mother.

626
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:18,103
I won't. It's our secret.

627
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:24,057
You should have married Céline.
- What difference would that have made?

628
00:53:25,227 --> 00:53:30,665
You wouldn't have left her so easily.
And your children.

629
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:35,258
Do we have to talk about this?
- I know what I'm talking about.

630
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:42,066
No one had more affairs than I did.
Well, maybe Casanova, but no one else.

631
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,331
Having an affair with
another woman is no reason

632
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,018
for leaving the mother of your children.

633
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:53,620
There are no standards anymore.
It's not funny, it's true.

634
00:53:56,747 --> 00:54:00,422
And bring your children to see me.
Sylvie brings them, too.

635
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:05,257
You should bring them as well.
- Ok, I haven't found time yet.

636
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,935
Here.
- What is that?

637
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:12,737
Orange blossom.
- Do I have to smell like a tart?

638
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,902
It's an aphrodisiac.

639
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:21,072
Good. That'll make
the girls come running.

640
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:25,057
- Sure, but give them a
chance to smell you.

641
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,946
Let me look at myself.

642
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:46,304
Not bad. My God, they don't make
them like me anymore.

643
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:04,422
I wanted to tell you something.

644
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:09,663
Can't remember.
- It'll come back.

645
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,186
I'm not so sure.

646
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:15,505
I remember less and less.
- Don't exaggerate.

647
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,977
Oh yes, I remember.

648
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:26,179
I'm very proud of you.
I really am.

649
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,099
And something else...

650
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,423
Can't remember.

651
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:44,666
<i>A father's approval.
I found it comforting then...</i>

652
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:49,179
<i>...and I find it even more comforting now.
We are all children.</i>

653
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,345
<i>We all need approval.</i>

654
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:55,457
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

655
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:58,304
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

656
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:05,585
Here we are. Father's Day.

657
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:08,056
Happy Father's Day!

658
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:24,903
<i>I guess that even a rough sketch, a shadow,
a tiny fragment of a dad is still a dad.</i>

659
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:52,341
<i>Father's Day. My son wiping the saliva
that escapes my closed lips.</i>

660
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:56,785
<i>We have never before fitted this made-up
holiday into our emotional calendar.</i>

661
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:04,822

662
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:14,860
Claude says the book's going well.
I can't believe you're writing it.

663
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,862
I still think you're the most
surprising man I've ever known.

664
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:21,298
Have you had lots of visitors?

665
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:27,418
Laurent, Anne-Marie...

666
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:30,941
...Michel...
