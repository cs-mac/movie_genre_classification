3
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,408
Awake already?

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,106
It’s so cold.

5
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,445
It’s too early to get up.

6
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,312
Let's sleep a little longer.

7
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:33,423
I couldn't sleep all night.

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,986
I know.

9
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:40,690
I had the same problem
when I started here.

10
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,833
You're so stylish and refined.

11
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,202
What are you doing
working as a serving girl?

12
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:54,941
I took a liking to you
as soon as i saw you yesterday.

13
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,874
Come on...

14
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,185
hold me tight.

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,684
That tickles.

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,326
You have such
a beautiful body.

17
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,398
Don't you like women?

18
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,404
In that case...

19
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,467
It’s the same every morning
before he goes to the fish market.

20
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,945
- Let's play that association game.
- I'll go first.

21
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,915
Hairy legs.

22
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,150
Crabs.

23
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,153
Chastity.

24
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,254
Men.

25
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,758
What are you kids up to?

26
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,424
Stop it!
Leave the poor man alone!

27
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,801
What are you doing here?

28
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,007
How awful!

29
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,924
What are you doing?

30
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,495
Get out of here,
you little brats!

31
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,733
It’s you!

32
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,433
- What's gotten into you?
- Osaka -

33
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,204
Let her go!

34
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,348
Keep your filthy hands off her!

35
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,582
I can't remember.
What was your name?

36
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,221
Was it in Osaka?

37
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,998
Nagoya? Tokyo?

38
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,132
You were so cheerful and kind.

39
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,671
I was your customer.

40
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,103
Don't you remember me?

41
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,302
I’ve never seen you before.

42
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,310
I want you now!

43
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,506
Look, I have money!

44
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,028
Please, just this once.

45
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,361
You just won't give up.

46
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,079
- You haven't changed at all.
- Hurry up.

47
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,443
You really don't remember me?

48
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,145
Nope.

49
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,227
What's wrong? It’s limp.

50
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,496
Are you cold?

51
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,830
If you just let me see your...

52
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,336
What a pain!

53
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,022
You'll catch cold.

54
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,190
You'd better just forget it.

55
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,232
Go on now.

56
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,204
Don't stand there singing!
Hurry up!

57
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,078
Where have you been?

58
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:31,046
Stop dawdling
and take this in right away.

59
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,176
You're working in a proper inn.
It’s not as easy as being a whore.

60
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,186
What are you staring at?

61
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,427
Stop it!

62
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,960
- Go to hell!
- Stop it!

63
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,155
I said stop!

64
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,830
- What's all this about?
- Once a whore, always a whore!

65
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,173
I’ll kill her!

66
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,206
Stop it!

67
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,539
So what if i was?
You think you're better than me?

68
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,112
Stop it!

69
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,975
You're to blame too.

70
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,710
Watch what you say!
We all have to work together.

71
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,047
I expect you both to apologize!

72
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,985
Out of my way!

73
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,094
What's going on?

74
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,494
It’s practically a brawl in here.

75
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,069
Who are you?

76
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,299
You new here?

77
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,371
What's your name?

78
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
Sada.

79
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,045
Sada Abe.

80
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,887
Lucky you came when you did.
Now i wonder just where you were.

81
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:53,197
You've got such pretty hands.

82
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,901
Why hold that knife when you
could be holding something else?

83
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,752
What a nice view.

84
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,860
No, don't stop.
Go on working.

85
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,200
<i>Don't play with fire</i>

86
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,937
I like the sway of your hips.

87
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,840
I bet you've broken
many a man's heart.

88
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,277
<i>I will pierce you through</i>

89
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,117
How many hearts
have you broken?

90
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,397
Master...

91
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,967
You're hurting my hand.

92
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,672
That hurts.

93
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,576
Master...

94
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,780
I’m a married woman -

95
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,579
I’ve heard all about it.

96
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,723
Your husband's business failed.

97
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,388
Now you both have to work.

98
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,155
That's right.

99
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,326
Must be hard.

100
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,199
You're...

101
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,940
a woman with a past,
aren't you?

102
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,704
I only came here because i heard
this was an upstanding house.

103
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,747
Is that so?
Well, as you see...

104
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,678
I’m an upstanding man.

105
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,891
Aren't you done yet?
Hurry up!

106
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:16,904
<i>Bonds</i>

107
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,337
<i>Between friends</i>

108
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:31,552
<i>Can never be broken</i>

109
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,826
Master,
are you alone tonight?

110
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,956
I stopped drinking out,

111
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,826
so tonight
I’ll be your customer.

112
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,491
Why did you stop drinking out?

113
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,128
So i can do this instead.

114
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:10,661
Madam sent me.
She said there was a customer.

115
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,023
That's me.

116
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,396
<i>What is this</i>

117
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,333
<i>Narrow path</i>

118
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,870
See how wet you are?

119
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,281
Let's not waste time.
Come on.

120
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,136
That feels so good.

121
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,376
If you go on, I’ll -

122
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,591
What if the geisha comes?

123
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,817
We'll get in trouble.

124
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,225
- You want me to stop?
- No!

125
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,694
It’s driving me mad.

126
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,769
How is it driving you mad?

127
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,997
How?

128
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,175
<i>Good evening.</i>

129
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,941
<i>Thank you for sending for me.</i>
<i>I’m your geisha, Yaeji.</i>

130
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,085
Just a moment, please.

131
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,950
I’m a bit busy right now.

132
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,214
<i>Please take your time.</i>

133
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,710
Come in, Yaeji.

134
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,383
Sorry i kept you waiting.

135
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,752
Good evening.

136
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,134
What a lovely young girl!

137
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:38,236
<i>In the white snow...</i>

138
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,151
Where are you going?

139
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,759
To the toilet.

140
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:03,959
I’ll be waiting.

141
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,105
I don't have to go
right this minute.

142
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,976
They say it feels better
with a full bladder.

143
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,782
Take your time.
There's no hurry.

144
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,222
But Master...

145
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,526
last night i -

146
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,999
It’s all right.

147
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,165
I want you to feel good.

148
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,329
Your pleasure is enough.

149
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,610
I’m holding back for you.

150
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,837
You're going to make love
to your wife later, aren't you?

151
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,544
What a slut,
having sex every morning.

152
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,321
So you've seen us?
Have you been watching?

153
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,021
I won't let you go
until you've come.

154
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,800
Don't worry about that.

155
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,900
Let's take our time
and enjoy it.

156
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:53,271
But It’s already dawn.

157
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,310
Who cares?

158
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,293
You're an unusual woman.

159
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,115
<i>My hair</i>

160
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,656
<i>Is out of place</i>

161
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,257
<i>Only because</i>

162
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,956
<i>Of my pillow</i>

163
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,167
<i>Yet i know</i>

164
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:08,342
<i>You don't believe me...</i>

165
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,911
Master, I can't play anymore.

166
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,753
You have to keep playing.

167
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:25,329
I told my wife you'd be playing
the shamisen for me tonight.

168
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,160
If you stop,
she'll get suspicious.

169
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,998
Why don't you sing instead?

170
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,334
Just a little longer.

171
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:45,508
<i>It’s my job</i>

172
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,153
<i>It’s a prostitute's life</i>

173
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,718
<i>Forgive me</i>

174
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,223
<i>The warbler in the tree</i>
<i>by the shed</i>

175
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,898
<i>On the second branch</i>
<i>from the top</i>

176
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,629
<i>Sprinkled vinegar</i>
<i>with grass held in her beak</i>

177
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:14,072
<i>And then laid 12 eggs</i>

178
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,309
<i>The first was a nightingale</i>

179
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,244
<i>The second was a kingfisher</i>

180
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,248
<i>The third was a wren</i>

181
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,114
<i>The fourth was a night crow</i>

182
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,278
<i>The fifth was a woodpecker</i>

183
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,185
<i>The sixth was a starling</i>

184
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,927
<i>The seventh was a plover</i>

185
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,790
<i>The eighth was a pheasant</i>

186
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,430
<i>The ninth was a robin</i>

187
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,536
<i>The tenth and eleventh...</i>

188
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,015
Excuse me, ma'am.

189
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,845
I’m sorry to disturb you.

190
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,850
Oh, hello. What is it?

191
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,653
I’m sorry
if this is very sudden,

192
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,956
but i request permission
to leave your employ.

193
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,931
Well, this is quite a surprise.

194
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,127
We can discuss it,
but for now please change this water.

195
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,821
I’m very happy with your work.

196
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,934
And you're very well-behaved.

197
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,676
There's no reason
for you to leave us.

198
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,747
- Oh no.
- What is it?

199
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,956
I just got my period.

200
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,030
I don't mind.

201
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,722
Good morning.
Your guests have arrived.

202
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,633
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>you'll see me completely naked.</i>

203
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,398
<i>Are you happy?</i>

204
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,402
<i>Yes...</i>

205
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,037
<i>but the man</i>
<i>should undress first.</i>

206
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,645
<i>No, let me undress you first.</i>

207
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,055
Your skin's so youthful.

208
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,758
It’s practically glowing.

209
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,624
You're utterly radiant.

210
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,773
Skin like this could suck
the blood right out of a man.

211
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,876
You can't be serious.

212
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,012
You're the one
who devours women.

213
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,014
I’m old. I want your youth
to rub off on me.

214
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,758
Your skin's so soft.

215
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,096
I feel like sucking on it.

216
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,936
Silly.

217
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,933
I’ve brought your sake, sir.

218
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,141
Master, didn't you say
you'd stopped drinking out?

219
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,010
This isn't out.

220
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,053
This is our home -
yours and mine.

221
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,148
I’m so happy
to hear you say that.

222
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,655
<i>How auspicious</i>

223
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,834
<i>How auspicious</i>

224
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:11,236
<i>Young pine</i>

225
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:16,203
<i>Show us tonight</i>

226
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,413
Congratulations!

227
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:29,124
<i>How your branches flourish</i>

228
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:35,458
<i>And your leaves grow thick</i>

229
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:41,003
<i>How auspicious</i>

230
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:48,008
<i>Your leaves grow thick</i>

231
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,214
What do i do with this?

232
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,716
Don't you know?

233
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,413
I never had
a proper wedding before.

234
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,084
If my bride had already
been properly wed,

235
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,422
that would be quite a letdown.

236
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,360
Indeed, tonight is our wedding.

237
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,402
So please rejoice with us,
all of you.

238
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,003
<i>Keep playing</i>

239
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,649
<i>Let the music play</i>

240
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,518
After the nuptial cups
comes the bridal bed.

241
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,023
Yes, they must consummate
their marriage.

242
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,218
It’s already been consummated.

243
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,329
That was underhanded!

244
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,933
You may have had her before,
but on your wedding night,

245
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,830
she'll be especially delicious.

246
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,493
Is that right?

247
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,900
Really?

248
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,970
Shall we?

249
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,007
Yes, Master.

250
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,311
Stop calling me ‘‘master.''

251
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,977
Call me Kichi-san from now on.

252
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,093
Of course... Kichi-san.

253
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,529
Sada.

254
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,269
<i>Have the plums blossomed</i>

255
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,043
What's this?
You're trembling.

256
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,044
What's the matter?

257
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,614
I don't know.
I’m shaking all over.

258
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,750
If you'll excuse us...

259
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,777
You seem awfully interested.

260
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,213
Come take a closer look.

261
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,478
No, let me go!

262
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,987
Come now.
Surely you've seen it before.

263
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,592
No, don't close your eyes.

264
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,352
Look!

265
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,826
Don't moan
with pleasure like that!

266
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,202
It’s not pleasure.
It’s pain.

267
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,310
Kosome, It’s your turn.

268
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,109
It hurts!

269
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:23,727
<i>In Kitahama</i>

270
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:33,032
<i>He came out</i>

271
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:40,201
<i>Into the cool of the evening</i>

272
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:50,412
<i>A breeze from the river</i>

273
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,681
<i>Suddenly blew</i>

274
00:29:54,959 --> 00:30:00,295
<i>Through the peonies</i>

275
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:09,003
<i>He's a wild</i>

276
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,505
<i>And untamed lover</i>

277
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:21,045
<i>Stay with us</i>

278
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:26,255
<i>Always</i>

279
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:31,492
<i>Kichi-san, where are you going</i>

280
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,391
<i>To harvest the rice</i>
<i>in the fields</i>

281
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:42,766
<i>Take me with you</i>

282
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,442
<i>You'll only get in my way</i>

283
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:57,621
<i>You wretched little monk!</i>

284
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,250
<i>May I make the bed now?</i>

285
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,226
Give us a little longer.

286
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,830
What time is it?

287
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,798
It’s already noon.

288
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,333
Really?

289
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,908
Kichi-san.

290
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,011
Kichi-san, It’s noon already.

291
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,612
Good morning.

292
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,721
Did you hold it all night?

293
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,033
Yes.

294
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,295
Couldn't you sleep?

295
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,331
I wasn't sleepy.

296
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,602
I was too happy.

297
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,243
Really?

298
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,210
You're so young.

299
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,372
How can you look
so fresh and lovely without sleep?

300
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,540
You're radiant!

301
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,788
I’m glad you're raring to go,
but give me a minute, okay?

302
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,893
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

303
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,427
Why not do it here?

304
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,596
Where?

305
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,202
Inside me.

306
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,627
You're crazy.

307
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,501
I can't do both
at the same time.

308
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,075
Let's try and see.

309
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,844
Can't you just wait
while i pee?

310
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:35,013
I’ve been waiting so long.

311
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,687
I see. Very well.

312
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,136
Are you ever not wet?

313
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,734
It’s not like
I’m sick or something.

314
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,307
I know.

315
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,675
You're adorable.

316
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,647
I was a little worried once,

317
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,987
so i went to see a doctor.

318
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,652
He said...

319
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,466
I’m acutely sensitive.

320
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,866
Acutely sensitive?

321
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,999
Those are big words.

322
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,535
In any case, I love the fact
you're acutely sensitive.

323
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,425
Kichi-san...

324
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,334
put it in me now.

325
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,135
Not yet.

326
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,940
I said put it in.

327
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,915
What's so funny?

328
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,078
I was thinking
that the only time

329
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:57,023
my dick can rest
is when i take a piss.

330
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,662
That's right.

331
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,912
But after you're done,

332
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,810
you sure get hard again fast.

333
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,554
See?

334
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,426
Just like i said.

335
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,835
You're right.
It practically belongs to you.

336
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,904
It does belong to me.

337
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,036
Tell me...

338
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:54,214
why does it get hard
so quickly?

339
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,412
Because...

340
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,187
it knows you want it.

341
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,532
I want it again now.

342
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,774
People can see us.

343
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,876
I don't care.

344
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,819
You sure are full of spunk,
granny.

345
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,725
I am with you two around!

346
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,304
Let's say good-bye here.

347
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,311
No. I’ll walk you home.

348
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,278
Leave it alone.
It hurts when i walk.

349
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,107
What if the servants see us?

350
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,717
It’s hard again.

351
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,552
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.

352
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,852
No, you have to take me
right here and now.

353
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,734
Pardon me,
but I’ve brought your sake.

354
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,639
<i>Come in.</i>

355
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,341
How unusual!
You're not in bed together.

356
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,014
I can't get my young girls
to come in here.

357
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,755
Why's that?

358
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,725
You're always
in the middle of -

359
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,460
Of what?

360
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,827
Of me sucking your pee-pee.

361
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:38,139
Ma'am, i have
to leave for a while,

362
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,580
but I’ll be back
tomorrow evening.

363
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:46,289
Please keep an eye on him
so he doesn't go out.

364
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,553
You can count on me.

365
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,957
But what about geisha
coming here?

366
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,425
That's fine.

367
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,759
Really? Why?

368
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,578
Well? Do I look pretty?

369
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,417
You've lost weight.
Makes you even lovelier.

370
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,984
Oh, dear!

371
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:34,701
Kichi-san, you're still not tired?

372
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,510
It’s cruel to tempt
a woman my age with such a sight.

373
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,823
I know we need the money,

374
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,621
but i get mad with jealousy
when I imagine you with another man.

375
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:04,293
Are you really jealous?
That makes me happy.

376
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:09,705
But he's just a school principal
and town alderman.

377
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,900
Very upstanding.

378
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,472
You like 'em upstanding,
don't you?

379
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,309
I really do.

380
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:56,077
Kichi-san, I’m taking
your kimono with me.

381
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,617
Why?

382
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,853
To make sure
you don't go home.

383
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,856
Am i supposed
to go around naked?

384
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,264
I’ll lend you my robe.

385
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,538
Try it on.

386
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,265
All right.

387
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,104
Well?

388
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,393
More sake, sir?

389
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,601
Shall i pour more, sir?

390
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:29,170
It isn't healthy
to eat so little.

391
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,076
The two of you never eat.

392
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:39,388
Sir, why don't you run away
before she gets back?

393
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,050
If you stay,
she'll end up killing you.

394
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,190
What are you doing?

395
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:18,287
Master, do you mind
hurrying it up?

396
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,795
It’s hard for me
in the afternoon.

397
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,161
I said we didn't have
to do this.

398
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,099
But i want to.

399
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,369
I was up all night
waiting for this.

400
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,203
I see you have yet
to mend your ways.

401
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,746
You promised to try
to sleep alone.

402
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,580
It’s different with you,

403
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:45,888
because i like
and respect you.

404
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,249
You understand, don't you?

405
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,360
Sir, beat me!

406
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,962
Slap me!

407
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,570
- Sada!
- Slap me!

408
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,240
Harder!

409
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,407
Harder!

410
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,512
Now pinch me!

411
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,709
Don't stop!

412
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,083
Harder!

413
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:23,125
Now pull my hair!

414
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,761
Harder!

415
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,496
Harder!

416
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,633
More!

417
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,867
Harder!

418
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,600
But Sada...

419
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,583
Kichi-san!

420
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,423
How have you been?

421
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,029
- I’ve got money.
- Really?

422
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,067
Let's go spend it.

423
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,207
I missed you so much.

424
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,615
I’ll never leave
your side again.

425
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:08,330
Kichi-san,
can I put it in me again?

426
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,489
If you want.

427
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,967
You're so restless -
putting it in, taking it out.

428
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,670
That's good.

429
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,074
Just like that.

430
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,315
Really?

431
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,420
You look so happy,

432
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,293
like a 16-year-old girl.

433
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:45,232
Watching your thing
go in and out of me

434
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,261
makes me feel so good.

435
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,772
It feels so good.

436
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,640
It feels so good.

437
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,354
It feels so good.

438
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,553
I feel like I’m drunk.

439
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,428
Kichi-san...

440
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,499
stay just like that.

441
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,378
Sada...

442
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,107
how was it
with your school principal?

443
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,613
Show me exactly
what you did.

444
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,221
That tickles.

445
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,861
Well, that's what i did.

446
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,058
To your principal?

447
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,140
‘‘Sada, I just want you to think
seriously about your future.''

448
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,255
What about in this department?

449
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,320
That?

450
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,062
He couldn't get hard at all.

451
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,388
So what did you do?

452
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,664
Don't get mad.

453
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:04,336
I suddenly thought of you
and went into hysterics.

454
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,806
I don't know why...

455
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,879
but i asked him to slap me.

456
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,618
And what did
your principal do?

457
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,059
Slap me.

458
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,997
I’m sorry.

459
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,992
Harder.

460
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,606
Harder.

461
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,634
Harder!

462
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,641
Harder!

463
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,514
Harder!

464
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:37,889
<i>Come and look</i>

465
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:43,101
<i>In the snow</i>

466
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:50,478
<i>Even the birds</i>

467
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:55,983
<i>Stay tucked in their nests</i>

468
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:11,499
They say true love means eating
food dipped in your lover's juices.

469
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,511
It’s delicious.

470
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,553
Sada...

471
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:41,591
I’ll do whatever it takes
to make you happy.

472
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,403
That's delicious too.

473
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,706
And now...

474
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,344
let's try this.

475
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:12,822
<i>A woman's pussy</i>
<i>is her capital city</i>

476
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:18,100
<i>Guarded by the pubic hair</i>
<i>lined up all around it</i>

477
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,093
Kichi-san, take it out!

478
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,099
Take it out! Hurry!

479
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,710
How can i
when you're sitting like that?

480
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,346
How does a hen lay an egg?

481
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,004
Like this?

482
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,683
That's right.

483
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,343
If you strain too hard, you'll crush it.
Slowly and gently.

484
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:44,192
<i>Fighting like cats and dogs...</i>

485
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,952
- That's it.
- That wasn't nice!

486
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,860
Sada, we're not alone.

487
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,798
I don't care.

488
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,470
- What's that for?
- To cut it off.

489
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,476
You're crazy.

490
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,574
So you can't use it at home.

491
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,082
I already told you
i wouldn't.

492
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,282
Well, you might.
That's why I’ll cut it off.

493
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,289
Then you won't be able
to use it either.

494
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:21,829
That's why
I’ll mount you like this

495
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,831
and cut it off inside me.

496
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,671
All right. Go ahead.

497
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,230
It feels good.

498
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:37,009
If i cut it off,
do you think you'd die?

499
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,514
Probably.

500
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,041
I don't want you to.

501
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,313
Don't worry. I won't.

502
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,085
I promised to stay with you
forever, didn't i?

503
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,628
I’ll set you up in a small inn.

504
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,392
I don't want
to be your mistress.

505
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,331
I don't want to share you
with your wife.

506
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,372
We have to be together
all the time.

507
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,436
Listen, Sada,
if we lived together,

508
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,240
I’d be reduced to a skeleton.

509
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,373
So you don't want
to live together, is that it?

510
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,185
Fine. I’ll live with you,
even if i become a skeleton.

511
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,956
You sure?
Even worn down to a skeleton?

512
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,099
I’m sure.

513
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,569
Now could you stop
threatening me with this?

514
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,229
It’s dangerous.

515
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,387
Now you'll grow a beard.

516
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:03,529
Are you going to make love
to your wife again?

517
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,491
No.

518
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,869
Say you'll never do it again.

519
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,866
I’ll never do it again.

520
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,939
‘‘You can kill me
if i ever make love to her.''

521
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,135
You can kill me
if i ever make love to her.

522
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,216
Kichi!

523
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,872
- Shall we scare her?
- All right.

524
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,880
I’m a ghost!

525
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,985
- I’m the haunted parasol!
- I have one eye!

526
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,281
And four legs!

527
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,855
Why don't you
make love to her?

528
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,590
She's not my type.

529
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,811
I’m sorry,
but It’s closing time.

530
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,750
Old man,
you want to do it?

531
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:42,157
You can have me
if you let us drink some more.

532
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,835
Mine's only good
for peeing these days.

533
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,412
Kichi,
don't ever leave me!

534
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,905
I caught a little goblin.

535
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,373
Now It’s your turn.
Come here.

536
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,272
No.

537
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,146
Then I’ll come get you.

538
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,541
Ouch! That hurts!

539
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,644
That hurts.

540
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,666
Could that have been
a burglar, dear?

541
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,772
Don't be silly.

542
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,274
A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.

543
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,147
Probably just some drunk.

544
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,249
We can clean it up tomorrow.

545
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,392
Do you think...

546
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,761
it could have been her?

547
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,862
Go to sleep.

548
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,277
Going back to her?

549
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:26,121
You startled me,
appearing out of nowhere like that.

550
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,233
It’s all right.

551
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:49,410
<i>Come and look</i>

552
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,817
<i>In this snow</i>

553
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:00,026
<i>Even the birds</i>

554
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:06,096
<i>Stay tucked in their nests</i>

555
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,907
<i>Lying in bed</i>

556
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,947
<i>I open the lattice window</i>

557
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:30,086
<i>With my pipe</i>

558
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:47,569
<i>Come and look</i>

559
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,328
Master, you're wanted
on the phone.

560
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,791
No!

561
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,489
Get off me!

562
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,346
Hello!

563
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:29,918
Welcome.

564
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,913
Damn you!

565
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,754
Damn you, Kichi!

566
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,924
Tell me the truth!
You fucked her, didn't you?

567
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,867
If you want a reverse grip,
you'll need a thicker blade.

568
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,302
You can't kill anyone like that.

569
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,204
I meant to buy
a thicker blade.

570
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,540
Then how'd you end up
with a carving knife?

571
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,414
There were people watching.

572
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,412
You're crazy!

573
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,788
How would anyone guess
what you wanted it for?

574
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,484
This is all
you ever think about.

575
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,561
Son of a bitch!

576
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,496
You think I’m crazy because
i can't stop thinking about you?

577
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,700
Take off your clothes!

578
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,199
Wearing a kimono like this!

579
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,504
Take it off or -

580
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,507
Wait a minute.

581
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:31,442
I can't take it off like this.

582
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,879
Help me, will you?

583
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,491
Tell me:

584
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,454
What did you do
in bed with your wife?

585
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:56,035
Look, he's shaking his head:
‘‘I didn't do anything.''

586
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,297
Apologize.

587
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,375
‘‘I have no reason
to apologize.''

588
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,112
See?
- Bastard.

589
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,511
He's a stubborn one.
I’ll teach him a lesson.

590
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,416
Please do.

591
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,644
Give him a good punishing.

592
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,391
Ouch!

593
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,386
- Does that hurt?
- It sure does.

594
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,294
- What about that?
- Yes.

595
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,132
Does it hurt
but feel good too?

596
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,333
It hurts
but feels good too.

597
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,496
Say, ‘‘Bite me harder.''

598
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,301
Bite me harder.

599
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,112
- Does this feel good too?
- Yes.

600
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:17,781
Fuck me harder!

601
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,759
You like this?

602
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,966
Yes.

603
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:36,698
I’ll do whatever you want.

604
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,900
Forgive me for leaving you alone
these past three days.

605
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,811
I thought I’d go mad!

606
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,573
I’m sorry.

607
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,183
Are you crying?

608
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,216
Only because I’m happy.

609
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,759
Look at me.

610
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,092
I’ve never seen you cry before.
Let me see.

611
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,530
- No!
- It’s all right.

612
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,798
Your tears are salty.

613
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,041
Damn you for making me
so happy.

614
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,004
You're awful!

615
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,653
- May i bring in your sake?
<i>- Yes.</i>

616
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:34,353
Bring it over here.
We're fused together.

617
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,091
- Don't you want anything to eat?
- No.

618
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,595
A full stomach
makes you sleepy.

619
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,275
Shall i clean up
the room a bit?

620
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,712
There's a strange smell.

621
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,280
We like that smell...

622
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,241
don't we?

623
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:08,390
Kichi,
don't fall asleep on me.

624
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,899
I’ve heard it feels good
to choke each other

625
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,040
when you're making love.

626
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,309
When you clutched
my throat the other day,

627
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,571
it felt really good.

628
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,376
Really?

629
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,947
Okay, then choke me.

630
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,588
All right.

631
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,857
Here goes.

632
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,333
As you tighten up here,
you'll tighten down there too.

633
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,168
Am i hurting you?
- I’m fine.

634
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,242
Squeeze tighter.

635
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,538
How's that?

636
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,259
What's wrong?

637
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,328
Your face is beet-red.

638
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,665
It’s nothing.

639
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,027
Squeeze harder.

640
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,296
You sure?
It’s gonna hurt.

641
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,599
Don't get mad, okay?

642
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:37,347
How's it feel?

643
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:41,986
Good?

644
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:50,261
I guess you have to approach death
to feel the height of ecstasy.

645
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,964
Did you enjoy it?
- Not at all.

646
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,100
You have to squeeze hard.

647
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:03,411
I’ve had enough.
I don't like watching you suffer.

648
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,080
Then let me try it on you.

649
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,792
Shall i?

650
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,185
Go ahead.

651
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,064
You're tickling me.

652
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,727
You scared?

653
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,463
Not at all.
Go ahead.

654
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:42,077
Your thing
just jerked inside me.

655
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:52,225
It keeps on twitching.

656
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,832
I can't breathe.

657
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,358
Go slow, okay?

658
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,473
All right.

659
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,380
It feels so good.

660
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,921
I can't stand it.
- Does it feel good?

661
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:32,491
- I feel it twitching.
- Feel good?

662
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,338
Yes.

663
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,682
I can't stand it...

664
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,430
It’s moving around.

665
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,408
I can't breathe.

666
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:34,121
- The geisha won't come in here.
- Why?

667
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:36,161
Because of your reputation.

668
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:39,665
What? What are they
saying about us?

669
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,303
- That you're perverts.
- What?

670
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,070
Who cares
what they say, Sada?

671
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:50,403
I care.
Why are we perverts?

672
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,137
You're constantly
sucking on his thing.

673
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,784
What's perverted about that?

674
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:01,013
Why shouldn't a woman
adore her lover's body?

675
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,151
Come back here!
- Let her be.

676
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:07,124
- Who's talking about us?
- Everyone.

677
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:10,754
Everyone?
You mean you, don't you?

678
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,670
What do you think about us?
Tell me, damn it!

679
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,642
Sada, stop it!

680
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,209
That's enough now.

681
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,354
Leave the poor girl alone.

682
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,626
Look, Sada...

683
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,219
who cares if people
call us perverts?

684
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,399
I want you to fuck her.

685
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,468
Master, please don't.
I’ll never be able to marry.

686
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:52,763
Get out.

687
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,501
He's too good for you anyway.

688
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,979
Good evening.
My name is Kikuryo.

689
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,812
- Your geisha has arrived.
- Thank you.

690
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:12,357
My, you certainly
are a virile gentleman!

691
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,487
What shall i play?

692
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,996
Anything.
Just play with spirit.

693
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:27,333
<i>You treat me</i>

694
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:36,514
<i>So hatefully</i>

695
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:42,980
<i>Yet i cannot help</i>
<i>loving you</i>

696
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:47,218
Do i seem like
a pervert to you?

697
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,023
Why do you ask?

698
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,965
I can't get enough
of his body.

699
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:58,004
That's natural for a woman.

700
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,298
How old are you?

701
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,240
I’m 68.

702
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:08,012
Do you find him attractive?

703
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:11,550
Oh yes, he's very charming.

704
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,883
So you don't mind
watching us do this?

705
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,851
It’s a feast for the eyes.

706
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,123
Would you...

707
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,826
like him to make love to you?

708
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,318
Ma'am, it feels so young.

709
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,487
What's that?

710
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,589
Granny pissed herself.

711
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,662
What a mess.

712
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,493
I hope she's not dead.

713
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,834
You look all pale...

714
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,565
like a corpse.

715
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,273
Don't say that.
It could bring bad luck.

716
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,173
It was awful.

717
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:00,577
I felt like i was having sex
with my dead mother.

718
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,442
Your mother died?

719
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,952
Yes, when i was a child.
Yours?

720
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,953
Three years ago.

721
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,149
I wasn't there when she died.

722
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,327
The next year,
I spent ten days

723
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:17,329
taking care of my father
as he was dying.

724
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,797
Once you're dead, that's it.

725
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,569
- Sada.
- What?

726
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,210
Let's be happy
together forever.

727
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,568
Let's say good-bye here.
I must say...

728
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:58,263
you don't smell
very good today.

729
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,102
Like a dead rat
or something.

730
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:10,442
Master, could we go away
to the hot springs for a week?

731
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:11,950
Impossible!

732
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,681
If anyone knew about us,
I’d have to shoot myself.

733
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:29,459
What's wrong?
Why are you back so soon?

734
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,259
Kichi, where did you go?

735
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:36,336
You weren't here,
so they cleaned the room!

736
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:41,702
I went for a haircut.
I didn't think you'd be back so soon.

737
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,846
What? You bastard!

738
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,571
How dare you go for a haircut

739
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,979
while I’m out
earning your keep!

740
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,551
Forgive me.

741
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:57,718
But you said you love
my neck when It’s shaved.

742
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:03,129
I love it so much
i want to slice it open.

743
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,961
Please don't.

744
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,467
Strangling me should suffice.

745
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,869
Perhaps that's just what I’ll do.

746
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,709
Sada, that's dangerous.

747
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:06,258
Want me to strangle you?

748
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,821
No, but if it
gives you pleasure -

749
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,430
Say, ‘‘I want you to strangle me.''

750
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,499
I want you to strangle me.

751
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,097
All right.

752
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,741
Don't pull too hard.

753
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,652
Are you afraid?

754
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,782
Yes.

755
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,151
You say that...

756
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:41,323
but you're actually happy,
aren't you?

757
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,325
I’m going to strangle you.

758
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,137
Pull tighter.

759
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,538
You can pull tighter.

760
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,350
Is it twitching?

761
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,859
Really?

762
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,564
Good.

763
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,132
Pull as hard as you can.

764
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,695
Harder.

765
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,629
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.

766
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:36,427
It was starting
to really feel good.

767
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:42,776
I know: I’ll tie you up.
Give me your hands.

768
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:07,097
Don't you like being choked?

769
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,428
I don't mind.

770
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,340
If you fight it,
I’ll pull even harder.

771
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:18,103
I said i didn't mind, didn't l?

772
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,744
My body is yours.
Do as you please with it.

773
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,683
Then I’ll start again.

774
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,288
Go as slow as you can.

775
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,244
Does it hurt?

776
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,057
Does it feel good?

777
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:19,890
Like I’m part of you.

778
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,962
All i see is red.

779
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:30,502
You're so quiet.

780
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,304
It’s a little scary.

781
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,443
Say something.

782
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,183
You idiot!

783
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:41,755
How can i talk
when you're choking me?

784
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:48,226
Don't worry about me.
Just enjoy yourself.

785
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,361
Even if i kill you?

786
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,697
All right.

787
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,877
I’ll kill you.

788
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,650
I’ll kill you.

789
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,756
It feels so good.

790
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,485
It feels so good.

791
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,936
I’ll kill you.

792
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:33,463
I’ll kill you.

793
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,341
I’ll kill you.

794
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,952
Was it good?

795
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,513
If you want it that badly,

796
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:24,641
get on top of me,
though I might not keep it up.

797
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:27,711
Are you sure?

798
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:58,803
Does it hurt?

799
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:04,205
Watch me while i sleep.

800
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:21,028
If i fall asleep,
you'll choke me again, won't you?

801
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,326
You want me to choke you?

802
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:33,774
If you strangle me...

803
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,235
don't stop midway.

804
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,876
It’s too painful afterward.

805
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,217
Kichi-san.

806
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,795
I’m starting now.

807
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:30,080
<i>Ready?</i>

808
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:32,048
Not yet.

809
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,645
Ready?

810
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:36,957
Not yet.

811
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:46,899
Ready?

812
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:50,332
Not yet.

813
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,437
Ready?

814
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,842
Not yet.

815
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,608
Ready?

816
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:25,704
Ready?

817
01:37:48,662 --> 01:37:51,995
Kichi-san!

818
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,801
Kichi-san.

819
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:03,352
SADA AND KlCHl
TOGETHER FOREVER

820
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:17,670
<i>For the next four days,</i>
<i>Sada carried</i>

821
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:21,303
<i>his severed organ</i>
<i>from one Tokyo inn to another.</i>

822
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:26,114
<i>She was still smiling radiantly</i>
<i>when she was arrested.</i>

823
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:29,478
<i>The story shocked</i>
<i>all of Japan.</i>

824
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:33,456
<i>The sympathy of the public</i>
<i>made her strangely popular.</i>

825
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:37,593
<i>These events</i>
<i>took place in 1936.</i>
