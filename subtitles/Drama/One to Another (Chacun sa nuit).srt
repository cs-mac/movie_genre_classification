1
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,312
ONE TO ANOTHER

2
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,997
Good! That's it!

3
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,282
Stop moving!
It's him!

4
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,073
Nico, stop!

5
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,955
Stay like that,
look at each other.

6
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,842
That's how it was
how youth must be...

7
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,115
No matter what, no matter how often...

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,180
The five of us... Pierre and me,

9
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,505
Nicolas and Sebastien Baptiste.

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,592
Pierre and me.

11
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,453
And Paul who kept his distance
because of his fragile nature.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,934
Instinct guided us.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,731
We were like magnets, I swear.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,265
It was like this for years.

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,002
We grew up together.
One of us always paved the way.

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
It started with Baptiste
and porn when we were ten years.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,872
He nicked them from his dad
who rented porn on the sly.

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,606
On my bulletin board
is a quote I copied from a book:

19
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,572
"Deprived of youth, man becomes
the accomplice to his own death."

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,208
It must have been a warning.

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,446
I don't like writing, Doctor.
I want to click on "trash".

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,239
Bring me there

23
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
Take me where

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,372
Endless tangled nights,
blackened lights.

25
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,858
And if you think about it.

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,280
We could really go far

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,212
We keep starting over again.
Stop thinking of the end

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,880
Wrap me up

29
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,379
Come on, tear me up

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,970
Your stockings are run
Can't resist it's too much fun

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
Isolated

32
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,014
We are stuck in our nights

33
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,360
Can I be a part of yours?

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,560
If not, your loss, life goes on

35
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
Isolated

36
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,720
Locked in your head

37
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
What I like

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,588
is not in a bed.

39
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,572
We said 500 for 1 1/2 hours,
Mr. Sylvaire.

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,682
I could only get 300.
Stop calling me Mr. Sylvaire.

41
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,383
You pay more when
I call you Vincent.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,138
Your check will be ready tomorrow.

43
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,288
We said cash, Vincent.

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,533
Come by my office tomorrow.

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,402
- How am I gonna take you home?
- I'll hold on to you.

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,612
- You can't even stand up!
- I'll hold on to you.

47
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,832
- You're hurting me!
- I have to vomit.

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,338
Come on, I'm exhausted!

49
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,079
I wanna ask you something...

50
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,584
What?

51
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,154
Come on, move it!

52
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,664
Nathalie...

53
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,760
She says you fuck better than me.

54
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,480
She is full of shit.
that's why I dumped her.

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,614
I warned you.

56
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,522
I would like to see you fuck
to understand.

57
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
This is what I wanted to ask.

58
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,108
Haven't we watched enough pornos?

59
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,084
C'mon!

60
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,079
It's not the same thing.

61
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,079
Promise me.

62
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,528
You're a pain in the ass, Baptiste.

63
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,203
I promise. Happy now?

64
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,560
Any gum?
My mouth tastes like shit.

65
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,648
No.

66
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
Wait a sec...

67
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,583
I have a strawberry flavored rubber.

68
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,404
It'll have to do.

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,288
I can't sleep.

70
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,863
Tell me how beautiful I am.

71
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,314
Again and forever.

72
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,760
You're as beautiful as a god.

73
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,226
You're as beautiful as a truck,
as a shiny new coin.

74
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,274
That's all?

75
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,298
As beautiful as a sunflower.

76
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,712
As beautiful as a fire engine ladder.

77
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,928
As beautiful as a squirrel.

78
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,952
As Holy Communion.

79
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,698
You're as beautiful as a ladybug.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,559
Mom?

81
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,738
What?

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,519
When d'you start to feel old?

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,247
The first time
you asked me this that question!

84
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,352
I don't want Pierre
to get a motorcycle.

85
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,358
Pierre didn't die in
a motorcycle accident?

86
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
No, Lucie.

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,303
I don't believe anymore, Doctor.

88
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,432
Last night,
I tried crying but couldn't.

89
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,320
- I felt better when I could cry.
- It'll come back.

90
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,432
You tried to write as I suggested?

91
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,697
Tell me the truth, Doctor...

92
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,223
Is Pierre dead?

93
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,047
All images I have
are from when we were grown.

94
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,448
I don't have any from before.

95
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,007
It must be part of my illness.

96
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,993
Our bodies and faces
as kids are gone.

97
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,360
Our dad died
in a motorcycle accident.

98
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,576
I was 8, Pierre was 7.
One year separates us.

99
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,289
Nicolas Saunier.

100
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,289
Date of birth?

101
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,013
February 6, 1984.

102
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,234
Profession?

103
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,411
Law student, first year.

104
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,743
Address?

105
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,682
My parents or
my apartment near the university?

106
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,439
Your parents'.

107
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,668
Around midnight, after rehearsal.

108
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,643
Did he say where he was going.

109
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,098
No. Home, I think.

110
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,536
And... have you noticed
anything recently?

111
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,218
Anything fishy about him?

112
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,484
Why all these questions?

113
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
You were the last to see him.
You're close: studies, the band...

114
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,712
Who else can I count on
to find him?

115
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,475
I'm doing my job.

116
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,643
Did you find his motorbike?

117
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,434
No.

118
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,211
It looks like a runaway,
but his mom and sister don't buy it.

119
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,613
So, I'm investigating

120
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,469
Well?

121
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,688
Tell me!

122
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,684
Go on, Nico, you start.

123
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,974
I'm lighting my cigarette.

124
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,308
What do you feel, Lucie?

125
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,080
He's not here, Mom.

126
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,294
Stop repeating the same thing!

127
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,760
You think he'd just disappear
without telling us?

128
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,928
Without telling you?

129
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,032
We have to be strong as he'd be.

130
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,888
Is he thinking of us at least?

131
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,719
Inevitably.

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,440
It's a good sign
the bike has not been found.

133
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,290
What does the inspector know?

134
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,057
He questioned the guys
and that's it!

135
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,213
They are idiots
for not having come.

136
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,520
You have a hard time
being alone with someone.

137
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Nico's the same.

138
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,444
Pierre can deal with it.

139
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,957
What?
It's often just the two of us.

140
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,720
It's like there's always
something missing.

141
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,319
I feel it.

142
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,640
His analyzing is so annoying.
Nicolas warned me.

143
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,319
So why do you love me?

144
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,449
I never said that.

145
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,734
I said "I like you a lot".

146
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,968
Drop it, you're such a liar.

147
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,373
So are you.

148
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,108
You're really
in love with Pierre.

149
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,048
Nico thinks...

150
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,584
Pierre and you...

151
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,684
What, Pierre and me?

152
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,708
He thinks you do it together.

153
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,029
Is this true?

154
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,233
Even if it was true,
you think I'd tell you?

155
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,507
Don't mind us,
We're just going for a dip.

156
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,548
We should write
something about this place.

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,667
Yeah, something really sappy.

158
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,478
What do you have against
sappy things?

159
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,928
You could have said hello.

160
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,152
I've seen you with an erection.

161
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,592
What's with your boner, Nicolas?

162
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,320
You never just got a hard-on
for no reason?

163
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,946
Yes, when you guys fought
or when I watch boxing.

164
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,823
I start getting hard for no reason.

165
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,773
Nico, what was the last thing
he said to you?

166
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,628
Why me? The three of us were together.

167
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,644
Don't be a dick.

168
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,738
The last time it was the two of you.

169
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,719
I don't remember.

170
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,320
Don't take it out on us.
We feel the same.

171
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,480
You're not doing anything!

172
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,614
And you?
What are you doing?

173
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,864
Paul!

174
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,307
- Mrs. Gambier!
- He isn't here.

175
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,320
- Use your gift!
- I don't know anything.

176
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,635
At least try!

177
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,200
I don't know...

178
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,760
Pierre and I never said anything
because we like you.

179
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,359
Pierre always said:

180
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
"Our images ease his headaches
His innocence protects us."

181
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,094
I'll tell your mother
you're a peeping tom.

182
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,738
- You're not mean!
- Tell me what you know.

183
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,039
No.

184
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,772
Does that mean you know?

185
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,458
You're hurting me.

186
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,920
That day, my professor read us this:

187
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,397
"Each man in his night
goes towards his light."

188
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,480
I convinced myself that if I could
imagine everyone's nights,

189
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,308
I could shine some light
onto their destinies.

190
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,232
- Why won't you admit it?
- Stop!

191
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,288
I'm gonna hurt you!

192
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,312
You're lying
and think I'm stupid!

193
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,167
I'm ready to understand.
This don't bother me.

194
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,167
What irritates me is
you denying it like a jerk.

195
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,520
I don't want to be a jerk!

196
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,167
You want to stop going out,
is that it?

197
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,119
What is that?

198
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,440
It's your strawberry...

199
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,400
the one I love to bite!

200
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,183
Pierre has exactly the same one.

201
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,559
You could have showered.

202
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,343
I like keeping his scent.

203
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,845
Smells like milk.
Don't you think?

204
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,290
Like a baby.

205
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,035
I prefer yours.

206
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,830
You better.

207
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,661
Do you think the others know?

208
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,811
Nicolas would do himself if they knew.

209
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,223
What are we going to become become?

210
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,958
Happy people.

211
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,423
Happy people are boring.

212
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,647
We'll be the first people
happy-not-boring.

213
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,200
We spent hours stuck to each other
like animals in their lair.

214
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,917
I went out with Nicolas
and then with Sebastien.

215
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,260
But never both at the same time.

216
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,815
Leave me alone. I'm exhausted.

217
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,253
Stop thinking about Pierre.

218
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,908
He'll come back.

219
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,536
We've never done it here.
It turns me on.

220
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,938
I said I'm totally out of it.

221
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,203
Everyone wants to connect to my brother.

222
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,199
People radiate towards him.

223
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,418
I knew it from when he was a baby.

224
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,803
When I saw him in his cradle,
I wanted to hold him.

225
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,077
I was too little.

226
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,716
I made up for lost time.

227
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,322
When hold him, I feel like
I'm proving eternity.

228
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,406
Please...

229
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,089
make Pierre appear.

230
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,661
He's my brother.

231
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,710
Please.

232
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,809
I'm ready to know today.

233
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,719
Pierre is dead.

234
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,681
The headline read:
"Body found near La Roquette."

235
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,705
Tomorrow, I can forget again.

236
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Fractured lower jaw,

237
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,895
nose and skull.

238
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,620
Several fractured ribs.
Burst spleen.

239
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,766
Internal hemorrhage.
Brain lesions.

240
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,952
I'm in the reality now.

241
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,884
I hope you're satisfied,
the treatment works.

242
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,533
Sporadically, but it works.

243
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,049
I'm telling as it comes...

244
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,801
Come on, Lucie, I'll get cold.

245
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,449
Don't you get fed up?

246
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
You know...

247
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,062
Drinking, eating, pissing, shitting...

248
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,403
Soaping up, rinsing of...

249
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,418
Drying, dressing, undressing...

250
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,552
Looking in the mirror, getting up...

251
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Itching, shaving...

252
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,008
All those repetitions.

253
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,427
Grow a beard! One less thing to do.

254
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,168
Pierre wanted to be burned.

255
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,978
My brother was burning.

256
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,966
The five of us were there
when Pierre went up in smoke.

257
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,918
It was unimaginable.

258
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,053
None of us had ever been to...

259
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,169
a cremation before.

260
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,658
Pierre keeps teaching me things.

261
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,596
It lasts 1 1/2 hours.
We recommend not staying the whole time.

262
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,691
The urn will be available
tomorrow at 9.

263
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,179
Thank you.

264
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,723
Do you know why you're crying?

265
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,839
Yes.

266
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,719
Why?

267
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,488
Because life separates us.

268
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,479
By imposing this sentence?

269
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,484
Life doesn't mean anything.

270
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,479
See, we're not separated.

271
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,479
You're an idiot.

272
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,512
No, I mean, you know the college and...

273
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,908
the band and the girls and guys.

274
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,672
- Before it was just you and me.
- It'll always be.

275
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,399
Really?

276
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,178
You're annoying 'cause you know it.

277
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
I just wanted to make sure.

278
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,688
It's beyond my control.

279
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,178
It's my life force.

280
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,012
We have one lead:
A sperm stain on his shirt.

281
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,643
Sperm that's not his.

282
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,643
You call that a lead?

283
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,680
Don't be aggressive,
It's hard enough as it is.

284
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,667
I bet it's Nicolas
and he's innocent.

285
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,594
And his jacket?

286
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,120
Not found.

287
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,232
Finding that would be a lead!

288
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,832
No one said he was wearing it.

289
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,018
It's like the motorbike...

290
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,837
You have no idea
and we we've been counting on you!

291
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,552
I'm going to verify the sperm.

292
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,754
We are here for a test.

293
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,680
Yes, I know.
It's on the third floor.

294
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,689
Thanks.

295
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,954
Here it is.

296
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,568
Can I stay with him?

297
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,333
It's against the rules.

298
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,514
It's okay.

299
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,928
Think of him.

300
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,952
- Think of us.
- It's fine, I'll manage.

301
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,789
It's just a jerk-off.

302
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,240
- You should know if it's yours.
- It's mine,

303
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,240
but that fucked cop
wants it tested.

304
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,943
There's other ways of getting DNA.
He must get off

305
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,323
imagining me wanking.

306
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,368
My brother was bisexual.

307
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,880
So is he.

308
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,607
- We had meetings for
That's what I... - I know the case...

309
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,949
And you?

310
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,223
- I'm fine.
- What do you mean "fine"?

311
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,208
I'm straight.

312
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,543
You're gonna tell me who did it.

313
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,013
You're scaring me, stop!

314
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,032
Did you know he was dead the other day?

315
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,994
Yes.

316
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,591
Come on, concentrate.
Tell me who killed him.

317
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,408
You want money?

318
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,399
How much?

319
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,432
My sadness prevents me from seeing.

320
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,154
You have to believe me.

321
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,178
I'll distract you then.

322
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,968
You're still a virgin?

323
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,176
Come on Paul, try to relax.

324
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
I don't know you anymore.

325
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,352
Leave me alone. My head aches!

326
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,727
I'm sorry.

327
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,448
You know what the cops say?

328
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,023
My brother's case is almost closed.

329
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,047
In a month his case will be closed.

330
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,032
"Probably someone from out of town"
That's it.

331
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,103
But I don't believe it.

332
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,103
I thought you could help me.

333
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,554
I don't know anything.

334
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,808
I swear.

335
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,032
- Not another step!
- You scare me.

336
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,480
They don't want us to play.

337
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,079
What's wrong?

338
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,108
We don't like Arab loving fags.

339
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,025
And if you play?

340
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,107
We'll destroy you goddamn snobs!

341
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,480
What's with him?

342
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Forget it.
They're known around here.

343
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,074
Know what I mean?

344
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,573
We could've become just like them.

345
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,828
I bet we all look the same naked.

346
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,588
- Shut up, fag.
- No more fag than you!

347
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,000
Get the hell out!

348
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Next time we come we'll be 50
against these fags.

349
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,122
And that fag
better stay out of my way!

350
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,098
All you can bark is "fag"?

351
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,152
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

352
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,147
For you to open and tell all

353
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,147
Same old bullshit over and over

354
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,147
And your desire for me
always so strong

355
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:02,147
You take me for a prick

356
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,608
You take me for a prick

357
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
Who gives a shit

358
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,572
We should have put
music on at the cremation.

359
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,359
Some of his favorite songs.

360
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,688
Can't you think of anything else?

361
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,559
Thanks for coming with me.

362
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,524
It is normal

363
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,178
We also want to know.

364
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,543
If I'm not back in an hour
come get me.

365
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,624
Are you sure it's there?

366
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,634
Absolutely.

367
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,440
Hi Romain.
- Hi...

368
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,483
How do you know my name?

369
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,797
Want a drink?

370
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,528
No, I'm fine.

371
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,248
And what do you want?

372
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,280
See if you're a fag.

373
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,360
You like me?

374
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,858
More without this Nazi costume.

375
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,834
You don't know me.

376
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,042
You have a twin inside of you,
and you're lost.

377
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,538
Are you gonna bite my lip again?

378
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,208
Why are you doing this?

379
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,592
You may not be a fag
but you're not hot-to trot.

380
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,392
Would you feel better
in your costume?

381
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,512
No, I'd like to see you again to talk...

382
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,672
I heard about your friend.
- How?

383
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,348
I heard it on the local news.
- You watch the news?

384
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,023
You came to see I was involved.

385
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,849
Where's your fucking violence?

386
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,522
Where does Mr. Nice Guy
hide his hatred?

387
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,513
I saw the hate in your eyes!

388
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,298
He was my brother.

389
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,884
He's clean.

390
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,044
Are you sure?
- Yes, be quiet!

391
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,863
I should have taken
more pictures of him.

392
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm missing so many.

393
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,729
What are you talking about?

394
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,938
Lots of his expressions...

395
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,119
I can't stand it, Mom.

396
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,201
It's because you lock yourself up
in your room or in his room.

397
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,898
I need to know what happened.

398
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,588
You must return to life.

399
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,738
What are you hanging on to, Mom?

400
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,008
To you, Lucie.

401
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,440
What are you doing?
- I'm collecting you.

402
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,632
What?
- I'm looking at you, recording you.

403
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,315
And?

404
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,218
It's rare to see you in a state.

405
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,120
It's difficult to capture that.

406
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,743
You get uptight when you clean...

407
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,520
What's the point?

408
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,120
I hate it when you get snotty!

409
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,560
So do it even if you annoy me!

410
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,672
I decide what I collect from you.

411
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,768
Pierre told me everything.

412
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,234
Everything.

413
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,098
I miss Pierre's voice terribly.

414
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,712
His tone was always constant.

415
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,223
He talked about his life.

416
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,023
I just had to imagine...

417
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Will I see you again?

418
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,128
Do you do these this often?

419
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,839
Once a month.

420
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,261
But I meant...
I'd like to see you alone.

421
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,524
Same price?

422
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,694
You name the price.

423
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,178
That should be possible.

424
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,898
I miss your brother very much.

425
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,788
He often spoke of you.

426
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,643
Did you replace him?

427
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,489
Not yet.

428
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,368
You loved him?

429
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,173
I think I DID.

430
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,488
Your love had a price.

431
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,720
That's true.

432
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,367
Pierre wasn't cheap
if that's what you mean.

433
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,592
What he gave me
was totally worth it.

434
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,613
You're not here
to talk about money?

435
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,088
You know, I was married for 5 years.

436
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,080
And my wife surprised me
here with a younger boy.

437
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,089
She asked for a divorce.

438
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,573
It cost me a lot of money.

439
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,672
A few months later,
she moved in with him.

440
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,208
You were tricked?

441
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,722
Actually I was never able
to admit it.

442
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,338
I never knew who was
victim of whom.

443
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,658
What exactly did you come for?

444
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,528
To get to know you better.

445
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,288
You're looking for the killer.

446
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,167
I'd never massacre
such a beautiful young man.

447
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,328
Have an idea?

448
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,680
Pierre told me everything
and nothing.

449
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,439
Mostly nothing.

450
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,920
The body must always be engaged.

451
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,920
You mean desire?
- I'm talking about my body.

452
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,080
To feel alive,
I need to engage it sexually.

453
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,942
Some use it politically
and burst.

454
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,840
They eliminate themselves physically.

455
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,463
Their bodies are their sole power.

456
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,760
No more ideas and words.

457
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,053
They're naive, like our songs.

458
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,560
You like sex, that's all.

459
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,308
It gives me the certainty of living.

460
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,840
Like a kamikaze with a cause...

461
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,008
I'd engage my body.

462
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,959
Yeah...

463
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,688
How's it with Sebastien?

464
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,274
Not bad.

465
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,763
Better than with me?

466
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,783
Never better than with you.

467
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,458
Only a body can know another body.

468
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,168
You come with us.

469
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,127
Julie, do you mind if he joins us?
- No.

470
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,898
Are you turned on at least?

471
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,880
A little, yes.

472
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,559
That's already a lot.

473
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,554
Get undressed.

474
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,752
Pierre, I prefer watching, I swear.

475
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,848
I'm sorry for being late.

476
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,096
I went home to change,
I didn't realize it was so far.

477
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,328
It was to not be seen together.

478
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,709
It's not a problem.

479
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,434
Are you okay?

480
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,159
Call me Damien.

481
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,658
I liked you right when I saw you.

482
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,863
Glad you called back.

483
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,920
I usually don't like normal guys.

484
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,269
Good evening.

485
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,272
What would you like?
- A coffee, please.

486
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,423
You wanna talk about your brother?

487
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,640
I'm not supposed to mix work and...

488
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,364
I said I like you.

489
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,503
I know I don't last long.

490
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,520
But if you would just stay still
like that...

491
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,000
I mean... if we could
keep that intimacy,

492
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,623
we can start again.

493
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,973
Give me a cigarette.

494
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,178
You're really cool.

495
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,000
Most girls don't understand.

496
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,578
They get pissed because I'm quick.

497
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,554
I need your help.

498
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,943
His case was closed too soon.

499
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,359
I swear, we have nothing.

500
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,898
Something could've escaped you.

501
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,968
Reopen the case.

502
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,204
Read it again.

503
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,680
There're lots of unresolved cases.

504
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,680
More than you think.

505
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,720
We're within national stats.

506
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,423
I don't give a shit about stats.

507
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,640
I want to find
my brother's murderer.

508
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,728
Do you understand?

509
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,488
I like when you stroke me.

510
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,847
There must've been
at least two people.

511
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,528
What does your boss say?

512
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,751
First he thought theft:
The bike and jacket are gone.

513
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,173
Out-of-towners who followed him.

514
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,622
It might've been to muddle things up.

515
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,918
Then he thought
it was sex related...

516
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,498
Your brother got around a lot.

517
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,517
Perhaps it was revenge
or some jealous guy...

518
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,823
who got back at him.

519
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,832
I questioned some
gay guys, but no...

520
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,832
Look, I'm getting hard again.

521
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,018
Can I lick you?

522
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,698
I was engaging my body.

523
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,120
Pierre would've been proud of me.

524
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,437
He knew I was going to find
his deranged murderer.

525
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,568
That was my logic.

526
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,223
I wasn't deranged yet...

527
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,638
A girl came to see me after class.

528
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,603
She was Algerian. Pretty.

529
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,302
I thought she was hitting on me...

530
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,005
but she wasn't.

531
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,760
She asked me about Pierre.

532
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,053
That's why she came to see me.

533
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,528
She seemed to be in love.

534
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,400
She saw us at one of our concerts,
but...

535
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,103
she didn't dare talk to him.

536
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,982
This seems very complicated...

537
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,679
What are you saying?

538
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,312
She was with her two brothers
at the concert.

539
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,463
When they saw she fancied Pierre,

540
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,513
they forbid her to ever see him again.

541
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,037
That's why she came to me,
to try to see him.

542
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
What's her name?

543
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,544
Where does she live?

544
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,520
I don't know. I told her to piss off
and I never saw her again.

545
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,372
What's the use if I can't
get my hands on her.

546
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,792
Who cares if her brothers
were protecting her?

547
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,320
What are you trying to say?

548
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,880
That he died because
some cultural thing?

549
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,800
Calm down, Lucie!

550
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,093
You always over-react!

551
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
No one dares talk to you!

552
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,124
Are you finished?

553
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,320
I'm sorry.

554
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,408
What else?

555
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,943
Hurry! I don't like this moment!

556
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,840
I can't...

557
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,612
Don't look at me!

558
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,568
I miss Pierre.

559
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,640
Will you sing me Dad's song?

560
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,760
No, it'll make you sad.

561
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,564
It's a good sadness.

562
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,680
I do as she says,
I never answer back.

563
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,792
She'd think it treason

564
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,800
Her jealousy gets her out of whack

565
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,277
Beyond good reason

566
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,287
A pretty flower caught my eye,
lovely and fresh.

567
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,432
Prettier than she

568
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,280
A pretty little flower,
one day, was threshed

569
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,880
From her umbrella

570
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,243
I'm like a child
around this doll

571
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,552
That shuts her eyes
when you put her to sleep

572
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,277
I'm like a child
around this little doll

573
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,111
That cries Mama
and then she weeps

574
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,247
Palm readers, gypsies
and magic stones

575
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,752
Make predictions

576
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,482
Her arms will be the cross
of my very own

577
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,200
Crucifixion.

578
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,720
There's always better,
there is always the worse,

579
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,320
But you have to face the drop

580
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,760
Hanging here or there
it's the same old curse.

581
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,360
But you have to face the drop

582
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,400
I'm like a child
around this little doll

583
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,047
That shuts her eyes
when you put her to sleep

584
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,520
I'm like a child
around this little doll

585
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:22,010
That cries Mama
and then she weeps

586
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,778
I wrote everything down..

587
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,763
It's a bit of a mess..

588
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,703
You were right, it helped.

589
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,434
I haven't finished.

590
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,440
It helps me understand
even if there's nothing to understand,

591
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,240
even if I haven't understand.

592
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,376
You haven't helped me with that.
You don't help me...

593
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:12,840
I regret not having been able
to clean him at the morgue.

594
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,728
They wouldn't let me.

595
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,503
"That's not done, miss."

596
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,592
Hold me tight, I feel so alone.

597
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,583
You always find a good excuse.

598
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,927
I'm sure you want to know,
Doctor...

599
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,136
What we did with our bodies
was extremely subtle.

600
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,472
We didn't need to make love.

601
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,463
Only a body can know another body.

602
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,938
Only his really knew mine.

603
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,743
We have something to say.

604
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,888
Go on, Sebastien.

605
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,927
We think we know
what happened to Pierre.

606
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,720
A group of gypsies live near Aix.
They steal and resell motorbikes.

607
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,960
I pretended I was interested
in buying one...

608
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,080
- I saw his motorbike.
- When?

609
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,602
Yesterday.
They just changed the plates.

610
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,404
Did you tell the cops?

611
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,915
Cops don't do shit.

612
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,840
They can't be bothered.

613
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,720
After two months,
they should have found this out.

614
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,298
- He's right.
- He's wrong.

615
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,351
It's risky. Especially if you
think they killed him for his bike.

616
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,240
You want to play
cowboys and Indians?

617
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,068
Maybe they just
found the bike.

618
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,048
I'll call the inspector.

619
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,499
So,

620
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,280
what should we do?

621
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,858
Nothing, my mom's is right.

622
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,898
Let's do as planned.
It'll do us good.

623
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,813
What do you want to show me?

624
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,538
I got a strawberry tattoo!

625
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,594
Asshole!

626
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
I said no.

627
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,324
He won't even touch you.

628
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,319
He just wants to watch.

629
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,319
How can he ask that?

630
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,480
- Did you fuck him?
- Your jealousy is annoying.

631
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,058
You fuck girls to prove you're a man!

632
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,560
It's different.

633
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,520
I don't care about girls.

634
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,483
He pays well.

635
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,272
- really well...
- I said no.

636
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,623
You know what he wants?

637
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,280
To experience
what he never had before.

638
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,368
I think it's touching.

639
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,407
He wants to see two young
passionate bodies.

640
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,954
That's is what we are.

641
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,783
You're disgusting. It's sick.

642
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,277
It's not sick at all.
It's reality TV at home!

643
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,472
You're ready to sell
our intimacy like that?

644
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,997
I'm selling because he's buying.
It's business.

645
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,239
It's fucked up.

646
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,536
Our bundle is growing, sis.
Over 350.

647
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,648
We should invest it.

648
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,508
And to prove where it came from?
Think!

649
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,768
So when do we spend it?

650
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,560
I've spent some on the band.

651
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,513
The losers are always broke.

652
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,524
You know what?

653
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,402
Some orgy planner
offered me a great gig...

654
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,303
He just wants to watch me have sex.

655
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,864
I talked to Nicolas. He refused.

656
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,134
And he took it badly.

657
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,088
I'm gonna buy a motorbike.

658
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,919
No, Pierre, no motorbikes.

659
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,080
If Dad had died in a train crash,
would you stop taking the train?

660
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,990
I always chased away the image
of you on a motorbike. It's horrible.

661
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,178
I'll be so beautiful.

662
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,712
Traveling on the wings of the wind.

663
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,480
We should get away from here.

664
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,960
If we're gonna live together,
we need a change

665
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,960
I don't want to live with you.

666
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,048
Why not?

667
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,568
They look so young.

668
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,600
You're selfish like your brother,
always using people.

669
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,257
What you did together
was so twisted.

670
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,840
You've been punished.

671
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,612
Don't you ever speak
of Pierre like that!

672
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,112
I'm sorry.
It's all this tension.

673
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,709
Okay, go over there.

674
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,629
Well?

675
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,439
Nothing.

676
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,472
They found
the bike in the countryside.

677
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,072
We questioned them
according to procedure.

678
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,472
They have nothing to do
with the murder.

679
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,973
Gonna sulk all night?

680
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,738
I'm sorry it wasn't them.

681
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,738
It could've raised the statistics.

682
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,098
Can I leave you now?

683
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,039
No, you can't.

684
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,952
As long as we don't have the killer,

685
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,018
you have to do what I want.

686
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,448
I'm joking.

687
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,688
I'm sorry.

688
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,808
I'm an asshole.

689
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,727
Sorry, Lucie.
I really like you.

690
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,168
What can I do for you?

691
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,880
Like shoot your wad in 10 seconds?

692
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,684
You're an asshole.

693
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,568
What are you doing?

694
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,368
You're losing your mind!

695
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,024
- Where are the others?
- Baptiste is coming.

696
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,999
Sebastien is sick.

697
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,004
What's wrong?

698
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,509
Heartbreak.

699
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,018
You dumped him, remember?

700
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,576
- Call him, I have to talk to you all.
- Why here?

701
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,008
You'll understand later.

702
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,168
You have to come.

703
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,569
Lucie insists.

704
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,053
She has something to tell us.

705
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,128
I don't know! Move your ass!

706
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,319
Baptiste is also sick.

707
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,313
What's wrong?

708
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,648
Are you smashed?

709
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,448
What do you want?

710
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,544
I'm waiting for Sebastien.

711
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,013
Why'd you make us come here?

712
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,288
It's sado-maso.

713
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,322
It's like an exorcism,
you'll understand.

714
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,976
- Pierre saw this before he died.
- Enough, Lucie!

715
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,454
Where the hell is he?

716
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,624
It's freaky meeting here.

717
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,507
We're here where Pierre
lost his life...

718
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,058
I've an announcement to make,

719
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,568
I'm pregnant.

720
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,607
It's a boy
and it will be a boy.

721
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,728
I'll call him Pierre.

722
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,872
We're here to ward bad fate.

723
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,618
I wanted to share this with you.

724
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,173
It's yours, Sebastien.

725
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,512
I'm keeping it it even
if we're not together

726
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,298
The baby will belong to all of us.

727
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,418
Even if life separates us...

728
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,428
like Pierre's death is doing.

729
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,987
Life lacks rituals, don't you think?

730
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,149
I write.

731
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,899
My shrink thinks it's healing.

732
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,317
That it puts me into reality.

733
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,218
At first I didn't say anything.

734
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,343
Selective mutism.

735
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,213
And of course, the pills...

736
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,600
I've been here 8 months.
Crazy, huh?

737
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,178
You're in danger here.

738
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,072
I can't live and I can't seem to die.

739
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,168
Know what I was thinking?

740
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,783
That you bring me a knife,

741
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,258
a pretty big knife.

742
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,978
You're the only one I can ask.

743
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,992
You have to live.
You're going to live.

744
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,368
If you say it, Paul.

745
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,688
Who are you watching now?

746
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,559
You, Lucie.

747
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,608
No, I mean outside.

748
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,448
Like you did with us.

749
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,968
No one.

750
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,352
You're mad!
It makes no sense to have this baby!

751
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,498
I don't want to talk about it.

752
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,018
What do you want to talk about?

753
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,994
Hello, Lucie.

754
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,903
They don't know what came over them.

755
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,674
They?

756
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,674
My son...

757
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,248
Sebastien and Baptiste.

758
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,167
I wanted to tell you
before the police.

759
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,647
I caught Nicolas
wearing this jacket.

760
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,448
He confessed everything.

761
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,434
Sorry.

762
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,458
I don't understand.

763
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,458
His mother stayed with him.

764
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,007
I'm going to the police
to deliver the jacket.

765
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,853
I don't know what to do...

766
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,728
He stayed with his mother.

767
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,618
I haven't called...

768
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,256
Baptiste and Sebastien's parents.
The police should.

769
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,656
As soon as I leave here,
I'm going to the police.

770
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,637
I don't know what else to say.

771
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,248
I don't know anything else.

772
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,504
Nothing.

773
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,528
I want to see them!

774
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,783
I keep imaging cop shows!
What'd they say?

775
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,480
Don't be an asshole!

776
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,034
There's nothing to know.

777
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,373
They're being transferred!

778
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,968
Thanks.

779
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,338
I want to talk to you.

780
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,098
Leave us alone, Lucie.

781
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,912
I told you everything last night.

782
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,080
You've been alone with Nicolas.

783
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,578
He must've said something?

784
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,433
Nothing.

785
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,378
We also want to understand!

786
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,368
And the others...

787
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,583
did you speak to their parents?

788
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,564
Briefly...

789
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,072
They're like us, devastated.

790
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,583
Baptiste wasn't involved.

791
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,768
He just watched.

792
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,832
Leave us alone!
It's unbearable!

793
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,639
We're sorry.

794
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,048
You have to understand.

795
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,312
I had an intense dream last night.

796
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,680
Those dreams that seem real.

797
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,313
What was it?

798
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,808
Do you want to tell me?

799
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,749
No.

800
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,053
It was about the abortion.

801
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,026
I think I went mad
to be locked up like them.

802
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
Dear Lucie,

803
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:07,176
This isn't my first letter,
but the first I'll send.

804
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,152
Time passes slowly here.
It's trite.

805
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,112
I have a homosexual buddy.
"By default"

806
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,084
that's what he says.

807
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,578
I'm coming to terms with it...

808
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,400
I call out for Pierre at night.
He doesn't mind.

809
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,079
It's just sexual.

810
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,103
I'm fulfilled without love.

811
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,240
I have to take part
in another reenactment.

812
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,600
Baptiste's lawyer is asking for it.

813
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,400
We'll get to see each other,

814
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,693
and get some air...

815
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,160
I have to play my role like an actor.

816
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,908
I'm not the same.
I've changed. I think.

817
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,293
I feel better about myself...

818
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,543
Barehanded. I swear.

819
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,994
Pierre...

820
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,360
whoever it was,
don't fight back.

821
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,880
Shut up!

822
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:36,271
Suddenly I thought Pierre
found a way to be a Kamikaze.

823
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,736
Must be the pills
giving me these thoughts.

824
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,352
I never told you what I was doing...

825
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,488
while they were killing Pierre.

826
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,143
I was folding laundry.

827
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,608
Absurd, isn't it?

828
01:26:56,080 --> 01:27:01,200
I was humming, you know,
one of those repetitive songs.

829
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,120
No intuition, no premonition.

830
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,600
No weird feeling.

831
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,233
Nothing.

832
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,098
How cute am I today?

833
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,608
Like a heart.

834
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,023
It's my new shirt for good luck.

835
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,948
- We brought the house down!
- You screwed up...

836
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,214
Fuck, we really did it!

837
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,709
Two encores! Fantastic!

838
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,718
We ran out of songs like jerks.

839
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,748
- We should've repeated one.
- We didn't think of it!

840
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,720
Not bad!
There's lots of fans waiting for you.

841
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,194
What do they want?

842
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,722
I'm condemned to searching
for the unanswerable.

843
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,223
People kill
and we don't know why.

844
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,712
I need to understand that.

845
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,138
You really scared me!

846
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,152
You said that I'd live,
did you forget?

847
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,418
When did you get out?

848
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,159
Yesterday.

849
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,008
What are you doing?

850
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,538
Learning how to die without him.

851
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,528
Don't worry.

852
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,096
Don't worry.

853
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,305
Nicolas and Sebastien were sentenced
to 18 years for murder.

854
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,824
Baptiste was sentenced to 5 years:

855
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,073
"Non assistance to a person in danger
and passive complicity."

856
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,432
During the entire hearing,

857
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,946
none expressed their
motives for the murder.

858
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,228
This film was based on

859
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,461
a true story
that took place in France.
