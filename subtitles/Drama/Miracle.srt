The only way we can compete
with the Eastern Bloc teams

change what?

What kind of scheduling changes
are we talking about?

I think we need to
make it longer.

Much more competitive.

98
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,279
Longer?
You gonna pay for that?

We also need to change the way
we play the game.

What exactly does that mean?

My plan is to adopt a new style.

102
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,057
A hybrid of the Soviet school
and the canadian school.

103
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,621
A combination that requires the
highest level of conditioning,

104
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,965
speed, creativity,
and most of all, team chemistry.

105
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,733
Is this what you've been using
at the University of Minnesota?

Walter, we don't have years.
We have months.

109
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,208
You think you can take kids
who've never played together

110
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,718
and teach them a new style
of play in the time we have?

111
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,276
Here's the North American style.

112
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,686
What if these kids can't
pick it up fast enough?

113
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,453
We all know we're
a long shot for a medal,

114
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,187
but we don't want to
get embarrassed.

115

-That's right.
-That's right.

116

Bob, four years ago,

00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,468
I think it was 15-1.

119
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,868
In all due respect, I don't
think we can embarrass ourselves

120
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,599
any more than that.

121
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,107
That's assuming
they don't go pro.

122
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,372
I don't know about you, but l'd
have a hard time giving up money

00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,743
to finish sixth at Lake Placid.

124
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,442
It's a tough draw, Herb.
Tough draw.

125
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,610
It's a tough draw even if
we don't play the Soviets.

126
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,313
What the hell happens if we do?

127
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,753
We put our best on the ice
with them last year.

128
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,314
Professional all-stars.
They still beat us.

129
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,225
It wasn't because
you weren't good enough.

130
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,431
All-star teams fail

131
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,596
because they rely solely
on the individual's talent.

132
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,573
The Soviets win because
they take that talent

133
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,802
and use it inside a system

134
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,344
that's designed for
the betterment of the team.

135
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,371
My goal is to beat them
at their own game.

136
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,315
Beat the best team in the world?

137

Gold medalists in
'64, '68, '72, '76?

138
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,489
That's a pretty lofty goal,
Herb.

139
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,789
Lou, that's why I want to
pursue it.

140
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,061
Well, fellas,
any more questions?

141
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,999
-I'm good.
-No?

142

Ah, I'm not their guy.

152
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,971
The only reason
they had me come out there

153
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,939
was because two other coaches
already said no.

322
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,496
Whoo!

323
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,395
Herb!

324
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,168
Herb.

325
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,936
Hold on a minute.

326
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,937
Hey, Walter.
How we doing?

327
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,709
I think we got
a problem here, Herb.

328
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,771
What's that?

329
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,647
I got a roomful
of people up there

330
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,619
who want to have a say
in this process,

331
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,450
and you've already
picked the team.

332
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,012
-Look, Walter.
-No, no.

333
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,389
There's a right way to do
this kind of thing,

334
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,087
and this is not it.

335
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,526
I know you got a job to do.

336
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,292
If I was in your shoes,
I'd be saying the same thing.

337
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,833
All right, then.

338
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,595
Let's go upstairs.

339
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,637
We'll help piece together
a hockey team.

340
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,262
All of us.
Together.

341
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,206
Walter, that's just
not gonna happen.

342
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,869
Do you realize
what the A.H.A. went through

343
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,572
to put this thing together?

344
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,740
The best amateur players in the
country on the ice for a week?

345
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,113
-Yeah.
-Not just a day.

346
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,914
I didn't ask for that,
because I already know my team.

347
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,477
How do you know your team?

348
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,524
Those kids haven't been on the
ice for maybe a couple of hours.

349
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,686
Every one of those boys was
chosen for a specific reason.

350
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,094
I've studied film
on each one of those boys.

351
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,724
I've watched them,
and I've coached a lot of them.

352
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,030
The ones I haven't,
I've spoken with their coaches

353
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,228
and scouts in the area.

354
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,464
Now, I know best
what I need to compete.

355
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,406
And the team I've chosen is it.

356
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,103
What am I supposed to say
to the advisory board?

357
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,270
Tell them the truth.

358
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,110
This puts me
in a hell of a spot, Herb.

359
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,240
A hell of a spot!

360
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,080
Well, they hired me to do a job.
I'm trying to do it.

361
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,290
All right.

362
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,596
I'm gonna back you on this.

363
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,994
But I sure as hell hope
you know what you're doing.

364
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,168
Hey, Phillie, what are you on?

365
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,768
My test is done.

366
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,938
Jesus!

367
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,174
Me and Jannie are done.

368
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,376
Verchota, you're done?
I'm on page four.

369
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,680
"71.

370
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,654
You get stopped by a policeman,
but you're not at fault.

371
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,384
Do you state
your disagreement right away?"

372
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,224
He's got 300 of these things.

373
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,729
It's just a test, Silky.

374
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,458
You've taken one or two before.

375
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,193
Not to play hockey, I haven't.

376
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,461
can you even read, Silky?

377
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,298
I try.

378
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,196
Hey, Rizzo!

379
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,171
-What's going on?
-Mac.

380
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,281
Easy, big guy.

381
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,514
I don't know how you can sit in
the same room with that clown.

382
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,581
Let it go. It's over.
Let it go.

383
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,250
What's going on here?

384
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,558
O.c.'s got a little
unfinished business over there.

385
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,758
Not for long I don't.

386
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,027
What did I tell you, man?

387
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,093
Mcclanahan?

388
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,265
You're not still going on about
the '76 playoffs, are you?

389
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,742
come on, O.c., that was,
like, three years ago.

390
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,075
You know what, coxie,
let me ask you a question.

391
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,172
Why did you want to
play college hockey?

392
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,240
Isn't it obvious?
For the girls.

393
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,114
I'm serious, coxie.

394
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,450
Why did you want to
play college hockey?

395
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,281
'cause I love to play hockey.

396
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,883
I want to go to the NHL
just like everybody does.

397
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,087
I wanted to win
a National championship.

398
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,927
That pansy over there
cheap-shots me.

399
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,933
I get tossed out of the game.

400
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,299
He steals the ring
right off my finger?

401
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,804
How would you feel?

402
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,136
Everyone was throwing
cheap shots that night.

403
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,335
Rizzo, it's funny you say that.

404
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,378
I was just wondering
what side you're on.

405
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,742
I'm on your side.

406
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,838
You know,
it really seems that way.

407
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,384
All right, just relax, okay?
Jeez.

408
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,316
I'm not doing this right now.

409
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,945
I'm outta here.

410
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,251
Where you going?

411
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,252
To my room. Is that
all right with you, Mother?

412
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,862
cOX:
Just let him go.

413
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,460
Well, no wonder the guy
gets so many penalty minutes.

414
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,130
SlLK: He gets a little
carried away sometimes.

415
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,374
HERB: That's it.
Pick it up.

416
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,412
-That's it.
-Kick it out!

417
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,004
Look for the pass.
come on, hit him with a pass.

418
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,277
-Go, Johnson!
-Outside!

419
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,013
All right, Johnson,
hit him on the other side.

420
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,317
-Get them up!
-Look for him!

421
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,749
Move and hit him, Johnson.
He's open.

422
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,453
-center, center!
-come on, Johnson!

423
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,920
[ Whistle blows ]

424
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,090
Johnson!

425
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,159
That stuff may work here,

426
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,830
but it won't against
the teams we'll be playing.

427
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,033
Next line up.
Let's go. Let's run it again.

428
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,844
Morrow.

429
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,245
Let me take this one.

430
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,846
Don't worry about it.
Keep your head up.

431
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,082
HERB: This is
a breakout play, gentlemen.

432
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,716
So, please, let's get rid
of the puck early.

433
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,987
All right, let's go!

434
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,862
Hey, hey!

435
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,340
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

436
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,569
-What's O.c. doing?
-That was cheap.

437
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,176
He didn't have the puck.

438
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,077
What are you hitting
like that for?

439
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,638
That's bush league, O.c.

440
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,206
Nice hit, O.c.

441
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,550
Tell your boy to keep his head
up, and he won't have to worry.

442
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,418
You all right, man?

443
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,718
Let's go!

444
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,124
craig, let them go.

445
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,630
You got him?

446
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,530
-Hey, stay on him!
-Stay out of it, Buzzy!

447
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,233
Get him.
come on, give it to him.

448
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,640
-What are you doing?
-Stay out of it, Baker!

449
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,405
come on, give it to him!

450
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,740
All right, Mac.

451
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,212
come on, Mac.
Take him down!

452
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,681
come on, O.c.!
Let him have it!

453
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,741
-Put him on the ice!
-come on, O.c.

454
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,844
There you go.
Beat him, O.c.

455
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,853
-Oh!
-Oh, man!

456
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,685
Whoa!

457
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,190
That's it.

458
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,292
HERB:
Well, how about it, boys?

459
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,353
Look like hockey to you?

460
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,192
Looks like a couple of monkeys
trying to hump a football to me.

461
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,031
What do you think, craig?

462
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,331
Yeah.

463
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,569
You want to settle old scores,
you're on the wrong team.

464
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,075
We move forward
starting right now.

465
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,583
We start becoming a team
right now!

466
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,750
Skating.

467
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,651
Passing.

468
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,058
Flow.

469
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,355
creativity.

470
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,192
That is what this team
is all about, gentlemen.

471
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,722
Not old rivalries.

472
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,097
Why don't we start
with some introductions?

473
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,606
You know, get to know
each other a little bit.

474
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,574
Where you're from, who you are.
Go ahead.

475
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,510
Rob Mcclanahan.

476
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,952
St. Paul, Minnesota.

477
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,114
Who you play for?

478
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,954
For you, here at the U.

479
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,124
Jack?

480
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,590
Jack O'callahan.

481
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,693
charlestown, Mass.

482
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,262
Boston University.

483
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,332
Over here.

484
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,736
I'm Ralph cox.

485
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,882
I'm from wherever's
not gonna get me hit.

486
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,212
Very good.

487
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,018
Everybody on the line.
Let's go.

488
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,297
& Must of got lost &

489
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,992
& Must of got lost &

490
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,533
-Hey, Jim.
-Hey, coach.

491
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,627
Been wondering why
you wouldn't take this test.

492
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,366
Yeah. Well...

493
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,707
It's nothing against you
or anything.

494
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,575
I just don't see what it has to
do with stopping a puck.

495
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,213
Well, that's all right.
You just took it anyway.

496
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,844
& Honey, I don't know &

497
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,554
Hey, coach.

498
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,566
So, if I took it...

499
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,123
You know, I meant to ask you.

500
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,033
How's your family doing?

501
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,829
Doing all right.

502
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,240
And you?

503
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,209
I'm okay.

504
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,713
You know, I got 26 guys
trying to make this team, Jim.

505
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,478
Only 20 are gonna go
to Lake Placid.

506
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,679
So I gotta know how committed
you are to being here.

507
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:54,157
Because if you're not,
you're just wasting our time.

508
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,921
Look, coach.

509
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,991
My dad's going through
a rough time right now.

510
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,403
He's got nothing.

511
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,874
He lost his job, and with
Atlanta trying to sign me...

512
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,644
Bottom line is,
my mom wanted this.

513
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,144
Me playing on this team.

514
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,954
Hard to say no to someone who
drove you to practice every day.

515
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,790
You didn't answer
my question, Jim.

516
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,930
I'm here, aren't l?

517
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,402
I'll see you in the morning.

518
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,139
Don't forget to bring your game.

519
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,089
MAN ON RADlO: The Soviets
performed a nuclear test,

520
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:03,526
setting off a 75-kiloton bomb
in eastern Kazakhstan.

521
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,894
So much hate and fear.

522
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,398
-What's that?
-The Soviets and the West.

523
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,593
They have nuclear weapons
pointed at each other.

524
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,466
It's bound to end in disaster.

525
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,062
Oh, come on. They'll figure
something out, Doc.

526
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,801
Don't got any other choice,
right?

527
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,899
Well, yeah, hope so.

528
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,742
But it seems to me there are
some people who never get along.

529
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,777
Yeah.

530
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,844
Like hockey players
from Boston and Minnesota.

531
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,184
Our own private cold War.

532
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,324
Hey, Doc, let me ask you
a question, all right?

533
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,488
You've worked with Herb
for a long time, right?

534
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,156
I've known Herb
for quite some time.

535
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,221
So tell me something.

536
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,531
Does he always treat
his players like this?

537
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,567
No. No, no.
This I have never seen.

538
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,109
But, craig, believe me.

539
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:55,908
Herb has a reason
for everything he does.

540
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,009
Well, he's ending up with
20 players who hate his guts.

541
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,381
Maybe if they hate him,

542
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,719
they won't have time
to hate each other.

543
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,590
& Out on Thunder Island &

544
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,288
& Doo doo doo &

545
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,990
& Doo doo doo doo-doo &

546
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,581
Hey, honey.

547
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,083
How much longer you gonna be?

548
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,016
I still got a few more.

549
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,557
Well, I'm going to bed, okay?

550
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,057
-Okay.
-Okay.

551
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,618
Oh, you know, Kelly has ballet
at 4:00 tomorrow

552
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,426
and Danny's done with hockey
camp at about the same time.

553
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,433
Which one do you want to get?

554
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,960
-Herb?
-Yeah.

555
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,766
can you pick up Danny at 4:00?

556
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,238
We got team meetings
after practice tomorrow.

557
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,070
I can't be in two places
at one time.

558
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,202
-What about Margie?
-They're on vacation.

559
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,247
Well, I don't know, honey.
You'll figure it out.

560
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,276
can you turn that off, please?

561
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,316
Please.

562
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,818
Herb, this is what happens
over the summer.

563
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,760
The kids are off
doing a zillion things,

564
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,128
and once in a while,
your meetings have to wait.

565
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,293
come on, Patti.
I'm coaching a hockey team here.

566
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,462
I mean, we already
talked about this.

567
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,596
Oh, really?

568
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,936
When exactly
did we have this talk?

569
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,171
Because I don't recall being
a part of the conversation.

570
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,768
What did I say?

571
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,780
Was it interesting?

572
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,907
We never had this talk.

573
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,348
Never.

574
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,678
Okay, what's on your mind?

575
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,814
Nothing.

576
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,916
No, you're obviously mad
about something.

577
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,120
First you're upset
because we didn't talk.

578
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,131
And then when I try to talk
about whatever it is,

579
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,257
you don't want to.

580
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,891
Patti,
if you're not willing to...

581
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,459
It's not because we didn't talk.

582
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,404
It's because
you never even asked.

583
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,542
I know what this is about.

584
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,375
I know it, and you know it.

585
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,880
What? Know what?

586
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,110
This.
What you're doing.

587
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,243
chasing after something
you didn't get,

588
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,413
that you may never get.

589
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,089
What if it doesn't
work out, Herb?

590
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,256
Are we gonna do this
every four years?

591
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,797
It's okay.

592
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,362
Go finish your work.
Go, go.

593
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,679
Hey.

594
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,085
Hey.

595
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,589
You know...

596
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:41,154
Ever since I stopped playing,
I wanted to coach this team.

597
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,726
And this is the only way
I know how to do it.

598
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,202
It's not the easiest way,
I know, for you.

599
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,072
Or the kids.
But...

600
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,278
Patti, I have to do this.

601
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,951
I know you do.

602
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,693
I'm sorry we didn't talk.

603
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,735
And I was wrong not to ask.

604
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:28,071
So I'm asking now if you
can be with me on this,

605
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:32,515
because it won't mean anything
if you're not.

606
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,536
Blue line, back.
Red line, back.

607
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,299
Far blue line, back.
Far red line, back.

608
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,001
And you have 45 seconds
to do it.

609
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,308
Get used to this drill.
We'll be doing it a lot.

610
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,211
Why?

611
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,579
Because the legs feed
the wolf, gentlemen.

612
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,453
I can't promise you
we'll be the best team

613
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,118
at Lake Placid next February.

614
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,423
But we will be
the best-conditioned.

615
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,194
That I can promise you.

616

[ Whistle blows ]

617
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,163
Be prepared to grow
through pain, gentlemen.

618
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,107
You're gonna skate harder
than you've skated in your lives

619
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,804
every minute of every day
you're on the ice with me.

620
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,244
Stretch things out
north and south,

621
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,611
you open things up
east and west.

622
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,013
center's gonna fill in here.

623
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,052
This far-side winger is gonna
come in, take the center spot.

624
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,587
-What's your name?
-Mark Johnson.

625
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,678
Where you from, Mark?

626
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,223
Madison, Wisconsin.

627
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,485
-Who you play for?
-University of Wisconsin.

[ Whistle blows ]

629
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,020
come on, go, boys.
Go, boys!

630
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,868
The fastest way to make
this team is by being fast!

631
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,635
No, no!

632
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,940
Stop.
Look at you.

Three men being covered
by one guy.

for weaving's sake.

635

Spread out!
Use the ice!

-Right there.
-There? Okay.

637
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,108
come on, Jimmy.

638
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,652
challenge them!

639

You're getting beat
on the side here.

640
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,183
challenge them.

641
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,088
Yeah, I don't blame you.

642
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,924
How you holding up?

643
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,691
-Oh, no.
-Not good, not good.

644
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,527
-How about you?
-Name's christian.

645
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,464
-Who do you play for?
-University of North Dakota.

646
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,196
Pass it! come on!
No!

647
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,328
No, no, no!

648
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,701
Get him to a point!

649
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,603
You're quarterbacking this play!

650
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,801
come on, Rizzo,
I got you running this play!

651
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,104
You're gonna run the bench.

652
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,475
Mac, get out here!

653
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,515
Boom, he can hit him.
Boom. Boom. Boom.

654
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,243
We're opening up options, see?

655
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,785
We've got four options
off one play, guys.

656
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,378
You guys got that?
Anybody have any questions?

657
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,755
Okay, let's go.

658
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,057
-What is he talking about?
-No clue.

659
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,594
20 of you are going
to Lake Placid.

660
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,099
6 are going home.

661
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,499
Who that is, believe it or not,
is up to you.

662
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,162
-How about you?
-Mark Pavelich.

663
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,069
-Who do you play for?
-U.M.D. Bulldogs.

664
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,508
Let's go!
Next line up!

665
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,204
All right, turn it up, boys.

666
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,768
Let's move it, Bah.

667
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,980
Get it up, get it up!

668
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,744
Eric, it's open!

669
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,513
Here you go, here you go!

670
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,418
They can't stop us yet.

671
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,514
Attaway, Buzzy.
Nice pass.

672
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,922
That was a good shot.

673
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,926
You three.

674
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,395
-Run that again.
-Again?

675
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,953
-All right.
-Let's go.

676
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,733
christ, we don't have a chance
in hell of winning.

677
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,497
So I understand how you feel.

678
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,935
Don't let them know that.

679
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,494
Yeah.

680
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,472
-All right.
-Thanks, coach.

681
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,870
The coneheads are coming in.

682
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,172
Who?

683
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,804
That's what the guys
have been calling them

684
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,611
'cause, well, they're
a little...[ whistles ]

685
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,514
You know, like the coneheads.

686
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,075
What's that?

687
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,588
Dan Akroyd, Jane curtin.

688
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,286
I guess it's off your radar.

689
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,360
come on in, boys.

690
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,022
Wanted to see us, coach?

691
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,896
Yeah, I'm thinking about

692
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,868
keeping the three of you
together on the same line.

693
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,970
Everybody okay with that?

694
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,904
-Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah.

695
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,738
How about you, Buzzy? You think
this works with Bah and Pav?

696
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,335
Yeah, it's going good.
Moving the puck well.

697
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,210
It's different
playing with them.

698
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,341
We just seem to always
find each other

699
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,977
at the other end of the ice
and make things happen.

700
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,213
Pass, shoot, score.

701
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,119
-Pass, shoot, and...
-Score.

702
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,651
Well, all right.

703
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,126
We'll see how she goes.

704
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,221
-All right.
-Thanks, coach.

705
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,890
Take it easy.

706
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,900
Rest up.

707
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,504
Well, looks like we're taking
a line of coneheads to Europe.

708
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:55,342
Yeah, if they can keep
their legs under them.

709
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,048
All right, Herb,
I'll see you next week.

710
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,846
Something on your mind, craig?

711
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,555
Or is that just
too far off my radar?

712
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,557
I don't think
you can push them this hard.

713
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,431
Not for six months.
It's too long.

714
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,993
-They're doing all right.
-Well, whole team's tired.

715
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,870
I know how hard
to push them, craig.

716
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,841
You sure about that?

717
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,707
You know why I had them
take that test?

718
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,110
Make sure I could
push them this hard.

719
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,671
I'll see you Monday.

720
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,650
All right.

721
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,714
Oh, wow. Dynamite.

722
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,057
Look over here, Phillie.
Section two, about four rows up.

723
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,756
Two girls. Blond.

724
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,162
Man, they're gorgeous.

725
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,698
What row?

726
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,206
About the seventh row up.
To the right.

727
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,504
Lovely blond girls.

728
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,009
Maybe we can take a few home.

729
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,103
Must be something in the water.

730
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,193
Get a whistle.

731
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,402
Good game.

732
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,198
-Good game.
-Good game.

733
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,546
Hold up, there.
Hold up, hold up.

734
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,587
Gotta get back on the ice.
Let's go.

735
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,418
-What for?
-You'll find out soon enough.

736
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,980
Let's go.
Back on the ice.

737
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,922
What for?

738
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,017
We'll find out in a minute,
won't we?

739
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,653
come on,
let's see what he wants.

740
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,027
Get a picture or something?

741
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,531
What's going on?

742
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,435
You guys don't want to
work during the game?

743
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,808
No problem.
We'll work now.

744
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,312
Goal line.

745
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,610
That one!

746
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,205
[ Whistle blows ]

747
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,424
Hustle!

748
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,073
Think you can win
on talent alone?

749
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:48,509
Gentlemen, you don't have enough
talent to win on talent alone.

750
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,910
Again.

751
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,743
[ Whistle blows ]

752
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,097
If you think you can come here

753
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,726
and play the Norwegian
National team and tie them

754
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,600
and then go to the Olympics
and win...

755
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,769
You got another thing coming.

756
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,950
You better think about
something else,

757
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,749
each and every one of you.

758
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,120
When you pull on that jersey,

759
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,853
you represent yourself
and your teammates.

760
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,794
And the name on the front is
a hell of a lot more important

761
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,229
than the one on the back!

762
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,425
Get that through your head!

763
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,695
Again!

764
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,196
[ Whistle blows ]

765
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,257
Win, lose, or tie, you're
gonna play like champions!

766
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,314
Again!

767
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,597
Kick it in the ass, Verchota!

768
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,466
You want to go home early?

769
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,766
Keep it going, Suter.

770
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,399
All the way to the line
and all the way back.

771
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,136
It's not that difficult.

772
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,609
Again!

773
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,774
Again.

774
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,345
Again!

775
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,347
Herb.

776
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,052
What?

777
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,497
The rink manager wants to clean
the ice and then go home.

778
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,660
Tell him to leave me the keys.
I'll lock up.

779
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,929
Again.

780
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,933
Again.

781
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,855
You keep playing this way,

782
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,726
you won't beat anybody who's
even good, let alone great.

783
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,355
You want to make this team,

784
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,559
then you better start playing
at a level

785
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,831
that's gonna force me
to keep you here.

786
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,337
Again!

787
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,005
Thank God.

788
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,076
Think we're getting out of here?

789
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,851
Hey.

790
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,785
Where you going?

791
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,982
Back on the line.

792
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,893
Again.

793
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,830
Send them.

794
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,876
Again.

795
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,371
Again.

796
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,915
How about it, Silky? You gonna
be the first one to quit on me?

797
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,548
How about you, O.c.?
You ready to go down?

798
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,854
Oh, I think I got
my money on you, Verchota.

799
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,587
You got a hot date
in about an hour,

800
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,859
but you're not looking too good
for that right about now.

801
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,623

00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,159
Hundreds of lranians finally
overran the embassy compound,

962
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,261
seizing about 90 people,
mostly Americans.

963
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,102
The hostages, men and women,
were blindfolded

964
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,142
and herded into
the embassy's basement.

965
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,509
Earlier today, the
Ayatollah Khomeini publicly...

966
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,517
We gave those guys at Harvard
a good schooling.

967
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,984
Hey!

968
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,183
How about Johnson
and Mcclanahan now?

969
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,692
come on, that works.
Doesn't it?

970
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,820
They're starting to
come together.

971
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,594
Thanks for coming out.

972
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,360
I wouldn't have missed it.

973
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,129
-Hey, you beat Harvard.
-Yeah.

974
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,700
Well, I should
probably get going.

975
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,242
Yeah. Yeah.

976
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,775
I love you, Pop.

977
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,175
You too, son.

978
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,248
-Jimmy.
-Yeah?

979
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,188
You keep that glove up.

980
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,782
You got it.

981
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,529
Switch.

982
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,971
Rizzo's making dinner, boys.

983
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,633
You know there's gonna
be meatballs.

984
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,611
You boys keep eating them,
I'll keep making them.

985
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,239
I think you guys
are insane to eat that stuff.

986
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,613
No offense, Rizzo.

987
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,778
I wonder how it's gonna affect
the chemistry of the boys.

988
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,414
I don't know.
We'll see.

989
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,821
Timmy.

990
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:10,931
Who the hell is that?

991
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,729
What's he doing here?

992
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,168
How you doing, Tim?
Good to see you.

993
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,037
Thanks, coach.

994
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,076
Hey, Bah.

995
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,474
-Yeah?
-Who's that guy?

996
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,808
Timmy Harrer.
Plays for the Gophers.

997
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,780
Having a big year.

998
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,750
-What the hell's he doing here?
-No idea.

999
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:30,880
Why is he here?

1000
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,286
Hey, you guys know
he was coming?

1001
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,620
So, listen, why don't you
warm up, stretch out,

1002
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,626
jump on Johnson's line
for the day, okay?

1003
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,127
Good to have you here.

1004
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,375
-See you, boys.
-See you.

1005
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,547
This is ridiculous.

1006
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,355
Don't worry about it, Rammer.
It'll be all right.

1007
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,089
Right, O.c.?

1008
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,030
Herb's not gonna do
a damn thing, boys.

1009
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,431
He's just messing
with our minds.

1010
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,997
Oh, you think so, Jack?

1011
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,403
Yeah, I do.

1012
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,876
Well, we all know Herb made
the Olympic team back in '60.

1013
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,468
So?

1014
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,070
So, a week before the games,

1015
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,844
coach Riley calls him into
his office and sends him home.

1016
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,317
What's your point?

1017
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,048
My point, Jack,
is that one week later,

1018
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,885
Herb's on his couch
with his old man,

1019
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,551
watching his team win
the gold medal.

1020
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,117
come that close and get nothing?

1021
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,460
He'll do whatever it takes.

1022
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,160
That's my point.

1023
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,537
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Walter.

1024
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah.

1025
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,007
Yeah, well, you've talked to
everybody else then, all right.

1026
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,947
Nothing else we can do, then.
Thank you, Walter.

1027
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,477
Is everything okay?

1028
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,656
Walter says that there's talk
carter may boycott

1029
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,193
the Moscow games next summer.

1030
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,790
So if we don't go there,
they might not come here, right?

1031
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,165
Right.

1032
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,305
Don't do this to yourself, Herb.

1033
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:37,044
There are things you can control
and things you can't.

1034
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,705
No milk.

1035
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,611
Herb.

1036
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,843
Yeah, I heard you, honey.

1037
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,527
You'll still have everything
you won here.

1038
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,961
Don't tell me
what I'll have, Patti.

1039
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,625
You don't know this enough
to tell me that.

1040
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,969
You know, I understand
you being upset with me

1041
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,769
when I say you work too hard
teaching a simple game.

1042
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,902
But don't ever criticize me
for caring about you.

1043

[ Whistle blows ]

HERB: That's it.
come on, boys, push it.

1045
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:20,756
Here we go! Push it!
Go now! Move!

1046
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:22,822
Damn it!

1047
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,088
come on, Rizzo.

1048
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:26,425
I know, coach.

1049
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:28,362
-I know.
-You know?

1050
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:31,993
If you knew,
then why did you do it again?

1051
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,634
You start putting
the puck in the net,

1052
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,866
or you're not going anywhere.

1053
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,199
And don't think I won't do it.

1054
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,336
Johnson, line up!
Let's go!

1055
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,540
come on!
Shoot it!

-Now move it up!
-Go, Mike, go!

1060
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,593
Drop it back.

1061
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,356
Go to the net, Timmy!
Go to the net!

1062
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,454
Go, go, go!

-Whoo!

1064
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,292
Yeah!

1065
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,563
Nice play, boys.
Nice play.

1066

ANNOUNcER: Goal scored
by number 18, Tim Harrer.

1067
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,199

Let's go.

1068
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,074
come on, boys.

1069
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,579
Let's go, boys!

1070
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,314
Timmy.

1071
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:27,351
You keep driving the net.
That's all I care about, okay?

1072
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,450
That puck goes across the
blue line, you drive to the net.

1073
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:31,619
Okay.

1074
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:32,992
All right.

1075
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:02,286
Herb.

1076
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,589
Some of the boys
want to have a word.

1077
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,253
What about?

1078
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,458
I think you ought to
hear them out.

1079
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,405
This had better take
about two minutes.

1080
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,318
This is crazy, Herb.
Bringing him in this late.

1081
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,982
Hey, we got parents buying
tickets, getting rooms.

1082
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,753
What are we
supposed to tell them?

1083
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:37,657
And with one of us
going home as it is?

1084
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,663
I don't have to ask where
you stand on this, huh, Rizzo?

1085
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,528
This wasn't Rizzo's idea.

1086
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,761
You want me to say
I'm scared of getting cut?

1087
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,430
I'm scared of getting cut.
Everybody is.

1088
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,597
We just want it to be fair.

1089
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:52,073
Don't even try telling me that.
He was in colorado.

1090
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,302
That was 6 months ago.

1091
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,072
You don't think he's been
playing for the last 6 months?

1092
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,806
-Not with us, he hasn't.
-So?

1093
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,677
-So there's a difference.
-Like hell there is!

1094
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:01,149
All I know is that kid
can flat-out play.

1095
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:01,843
We can't?

1096
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:04,979
He moves the puck, he's got
great vision on the ice.

1097
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,955
That's not the point!

1098
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,821
I'll tell you
something else he's got.

1099
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,690
He's got the attitude I want
on and off the ice,

1100
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:13,389
so somebody better explain to me

1101
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:15,295
why I shouldn't be
giving him a look.

1102
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,265
Because we're a family.

1103
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:19,728
What?

1104
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,532
We're a family.

1105
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,438
A family?

1106
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,301
Yeah.

1107
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,307
Yeah.

1108
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,979
And this is the family you want
to go to Lake Placid with?

1109
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:39,147
Definitely.

1110
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,123
-Yeah, without a doubt.
-Absolutely.

1111
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,783
Wouldn't have it any other way.

1112
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,993
Timmy Harrer can help us, boys.

1113
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,989
And I'm gonna send him home.

1114
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,828
We got one more
to get down to 20.

1115
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,337
You understand.

1116
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:56,429
Yep.

1117
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:01,535
Looks like you got
yourself a team.

1118
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,977

PRESlDENT cARTER: The erosion
of our confidence in the future

1171
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:29,458
is threatening to destroy

1172
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:34,589
the social and the political
fabric of America.

1173
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:38,328
The confidence that we have
always had as a people

1174
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,633
is not simply
some romantic dream

1175
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,367
or a proverb in a dusty book

1176
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,706
that we read
just on the Fourth of July.

1177
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:50,172
It is the idea
which founded our nation

1178
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,239
and has guided
our development as a people.

1179
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:56,980
confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

1180
01:05:57,054 --> 01:06:01,115
We've always believed in
something called "progress."

1181
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04,991
We've always had a faith
that the days of our children

1182
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:08,657
will be better than our own.

1183
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:12,896
Our people are losing
that faith.

1184
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,232
For the first time
in the history of our country,

1185
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:21,437
a majority of our people believe
that the next five years

1186
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:25,208
will be worse than
the past five years.

1187
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:31,378
We were taught that our armies
were always invincible,

1188
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:34,856
and our causes were always just,

1189
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:38,759
only to suffer
the agony of Vietnam.

1190
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:45,534
We respected the presidency
as a place of honor

1191
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,503
until the shock of Watergate.

1192
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:55,043
We've got to stop crying
and start sweating.

1193
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,979
Stop talking and start walking.

01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,517
Finally Team USA
gets its stick on the puck

1278
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,490
as Ramsey brings it up
to the blue line.

1279
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:52,960
He's absolutely flattened there
by Kasatonov.

1280
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,394
HERB:
Two-on-one!

1281
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:56,796
Team Soviet Union turning it
into a two-on-one.

1282
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,163
Back door, O.c., look out!

1283
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,464
Get the puck!

1284
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:03,802
Moving in to the boards,
shoots and scores.

1285
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,676
come on!

1286
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,306
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

1287
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:14,816
That's it.
Let's go.

1288
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,011
That's a nice expression
on your face.

1289
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,713
Let's get it back, boys.

1290
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,415
Get it back!

1291
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,920
HERB:
Jack, you gotta listen to me!

1292
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,552
You gotta listen to me!

1293
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:29,079
The Soviets breaking out
of their own zone now,

1294
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:30,420
up the ice to center.

1295
01:14:30,492 --> 01:14:32,517
Krutov goes in
over the U.S. blue line.

1296
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,061
Shoots and scores.

1297
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:36,529
He's in front and scores.

1298
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:37,997
Shoots. He scores.

1299
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:39,397
He shoots.
He scores!

1300
01:14:39,468 --> 01:14:44,906
The Soviet Union
drubbing Team USA 10-3.

1301
01:14:44,973 --> 01:14:46,873
There's always things
you can work on.

1302
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:48,933
This club's
no exception to that.

1303
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:51,172
You know, I think
we're gonna be all right.

1304
01:14:51,246 --> 01:14:53,578
This Soviet team has been
together for 10 years.

1305
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:56,345
We got college kids still
getting to know each other.

1306
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:58,716
They could have
won this thing 30-0.

1307
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,652
Herb, Herb!
Herb Brooks!

1308
01:15:00,722 --> 01:15:02,383
Sorry.
How is he?

1309
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,483
Well, I'm not sure
if he needs surgery yet.

1310
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,688
I'm hoping it's just a ligament
pull, but it could be a tear.

1311
01:15:07,763 --> 01:15:10,095
Look, Herb, we got
three days until Sweden.

1312
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:12,599
You give him a roster spot,
it's a waste of money.

1313
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:13,896
Give me a "best case."

1314
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:16,233
He'll miss three
or four games minimum.

1315
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,034
That's the whole
qualifying round.

1316
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:20,472
Kid's made the team,
he's busted his ass for me,

1317
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:22,840
and now I gotta send
him home, that the deal?

1318
01:15:52,774 --> 01:15:54,207
What'd Doc say?

1319
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:55,971
Oh, he doesn't know yet, O.c.

1320
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:58,706
He's gonna go
with you to the hospital

1321
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:00,839
and get a picture
of your knee taken.

1322
01:16:03,986 --> 01:16:05,749
Then we'll see.

1323
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,863
Thinking about
sitting you down, Jim.

1324
01:16:53,936 --> 01:16:57,337
-What are you talking about?
-Nah, it's not your fault.

1325
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:59,772
I played you way too much,
and you're too tired.

1326
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:02,071
Oh, I think it's time
I gave Jannie a look.

1327
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:04,339
-He's been waiting.
-You're kidding me.

1328
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:06,278
-Now?
-Yeah, of course I mean now.

1329
01:17:06,348 --> 01:17:09,283
-That's my net, man.
-They just scored 10 goals.

1330
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:11,478
Right now it's everybody's net.

1331
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:15,384
Whoa, wait a second.

1332
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:18,153
I've given you
everything I've got.

1333
01:17:18,226 --> 01:17:21,093
Have you?
Given me your very best?

1334
01:17:21,163 --> 01:17:23,188
'cause I know
there's a lot more in you.

1335
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:27,031
A whole other level that
you just don't want to go to.

1336
01:17:27,102 --> 01:17:30,003
Oh, what the hell.
You don't even understand.

1337
01:17:30,072 --> 01:17:32,870
Oh, no, I'll tell you
what I don't understand, Herb.

1338
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,135
I don't understand you.

1339
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:35,767
Nobody on this team
understands you

1340
01:17:35,844 --> 01:17:38,335
and your ridiculous sayings
and your drills

1341
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:42,213
and those stupid psychology
tests you had everybody take.

1342
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,081
Everybody?

1343
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,684
What?
So that's what this is about?

1344
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:50,088
Because I didn't take your test?

1345
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:52,820
Fine!
I'll take your test.

1346
01:17:52,894 --> 01:17:53,986
Is that what you want?

1347
01:17:54,062 --> 01:17:55,222
No.

1348
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:58,789
I want to see that kid in the
net who wouldn't take the test.

1349
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:08,308
You gotta be kidding me.
What did he do?

1350
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:10,777
PATTl:
Well, he did something amazing.

1351
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:13,542
He started to laugh.

1352
01:18:13,615 --> 01:18:17,551
And then everybody in the whole
audience started to laugh.

1353
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:20,813
It sounds funny,
but I was so proud of him.

1354
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:24,017
I was starting to think
that our son takes after you.

1355
01:18:24,092 --> 01:18:26,583
Well, that's
all part of my plan.

1356
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:29,722
My, you're a very smart woman.

1357
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:33,362
I miss you.

1358
01:18:33,435 --> 01:18:36,370
Oh, the Games are only
a couple of days away now.

1359
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:37,905
You got your airplane tickets?

1360
01:18:37,973 --> 01:18:39,838
Oh, yeah.
Walter had them sent over.

1361
01:18:39,908 --> 01:18:41,068
Yeah.

1362
01:18:42,678 --> 01:18:44,976
-I guess I'll see you then.
-You sound tired.

1363
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:46,776
You should try
and get some sleep.

1364
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,110
Yeah, well...

1365
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:49,207
All right.

1366
01:18:49,284 --> 01:18:50,911
-I'll talk to you.
-Hey, Patti.

1367
01:18:50,986 --> 01:18:52,248
Yeah?

1368
01:18:53,722 --> 01:18:55,690
I miss you, too.

1369
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,525
Good night.

1370
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:00,458
Good night.

1371
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:41,763
Okay, I'll check on O.c.
Take care of these guys here.

1372
01:19:41,837 --> 01:19:43,964
come on, guys.
Stick with me.

1373
01:19:44,973 --> 01:19:46,497
MAN:
Next.

1374
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:48,702
MAN #2:
This is your room key.

1375
01:19:48,777 --> 01:19:51,041
And this is your l.D. badge

1376
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:54,105
that you'll need
for just about everything.

1377
01:19:54,182 --> 01:19:56,116
Don't lose it.

1378
01:19:57,185 --> 01:19:59,050
Herb.
Herb.

1379
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,653
Herb, it'll be fine.

1380
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:06,353
I can fight through it.

1381
01:20:07,028 --> 01:20:09,963
Okay, why don't you join
the boys over there, O.c.?

1382
01:20:10,532 --> 01:20:12,796
It's good to see you, kid.

1383
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:15,792
Attaboy.

1384
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:19,666
-Well?
-It's not a tear.

1385
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:22,369
It's a stretched ligament,
so he won't need surgery.

1386
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,572
But there is no way he can play
before the medal round.

1387
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:27,171
Forget about the medal round.

1388
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:30,707
You keep O'callahan,
and you lose one more skater,

1389
01:20:30,786 --> 01:20:32,253
you're gonna have a tough time

1390
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,413
putting a decent hockey team
on the ice.

1391
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:36,650
It's that simple, Herb.

1392
01:20:40,095 --> 01:20:42,495
I asked Herb.
He's keeping me in the dark.

1393
01:20:42,564 --> 01:20:45,089
Oh, boy.

1394
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:47,397
So if he gets shaky, it's you.

1395
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:49,096
Stay loose, Jannie.

1396
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:50,866
All right.

1397
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:53,965
You're in there tomorrow, Jimmy.
Let's bring it up, now.

1398
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:56,510
Okay.
Thanks a lot, man.

1399
01:20:56,578 --> 01:20:58,739
Attaboy, Jimmy.
Go get them.

1400
01:21:02,684 --> 01:21:04,174
I'll see you on the bus.

1401
01:21:04,252 --> 01:21:05,549
All right.

1402
01:21:28,076 --> 01:21:30,306
Doc said no, right?

1403
01:21:32,714 --> 01:21:35,581
He said you might
be able to go in a week.

1404
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,447
Maybe two.

1405
01:21:38,386 --> 01:21:39,876
What if it's two?

1406
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:42,423
That puts me in a tight spot,
doesn't it?

1407
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,718
Jack, I got 20 guys
to think about here,

1408
01:21:45,794 --> 01:21:48,729
and they're all looking at me
to do what's best.

1409
01:21:48,797 --> 01:21:50,424
I understand, coach.

1410
01:21:50,498 --> 01:21:53,592
Which is why
I'm hanging on to you.

1411
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:01,642
I swear to God, Herb, if you're
not being serious right now.

1412
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,575
I'm only saying this
if you promise

1413
01:22:03,645 --> 01:22:05,442
you won't even think
about asking me to play.

1414
01:22:05,513 --> 01:22:06,912
I won't.

1415
01:22:06,982 --> 01:22:08,973
I mean, I will,
I promise you, coach.

1416
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,883
'cause if you do, Jack, I'll
stick your ass on an airplane

1417
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:14,046
and you're headed
back to Boston.

1418
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:19,793
All right,
Doc's waiting for you.

1419
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:21,920
Thank you, Herb.

1420
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:33,907
Whoo!

1421
01:22:33,975 --> 01:22:36,170
O.c. is playing, baby!

1422
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,213
Boys, move your feet!

1423
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:15,306
MlcHAELS: Ramsey with the puck,
passes to Eruzione.

1424
01:23:15,383 --> 01:23:17,578
Eruzione carrying the puck
up the boards.

1425
01:23:17,652 --> 01:23:18,983
Drops the pass for Broten.

1426
01:23:19,054 --> 01:23:21,318
He shoots.
Kicked away by Lindbergh.

1427
01:23:21,389 --> 01:23:23,380
Boys, hit that one-timer now.
come on!

1428
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,358
Al Michaels with Ken Dryden.

1429
01:23:25,427 --> 01:23:26,860
With 4:10 to go
in the first period,

1430
01:23:26,928 --> 01:23:30,989
it's Sweden leading
the United States 1-0.

1431
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,096
Ahlberg to Eriksson.

1432
01:23:33,168 --> 01:23:35,227
And a big hit by Dave christian.

1433
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:36,827
Eriksson picks up
the loose puck,

1434
01:23:36,905 --> 01:23:39,066
passes to Lundqvist,
Lundqvist to Ahlberg.

1435
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,266
Mike, where is it?

1436
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:41,775
-Up. This way.
-Okay. Okay.

1437
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:43,538
-Yeah, yeah, that.
-That's it.

1438
01:23:43,611 --> 01:23:46,671
MlcHAELS: Ahlberg shoots.
Save by craig.

1439
01:23:47,682 --> 01:23:49,445
Eruzione fighting for it.

1440
01:23:49,517 --> 01:23:51,712
Mike Eruzione
recently named team captain

1441
01:23:51,786 --> 01:23:54,118
by coach Herb Brooks
for his firm footing,

1442
01:23:54,189 --> 01:23:57,022
his leadership qualities
on and off the ice.

1443
01:23:57,092 --> 01:23:58,719
Hey, I'm taking him out.

1444
01:23:58,793 --> 01:24:01,762
DRYDEN: The U.S. team is playing
tentative hockey tonight, Al.

1445
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,354
Tough draw having to
face Sweden,

1446
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:05,729
third-best team in the world.

1447
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,529
-You know what I mean?
-No, I got you.

1448
01:24:07,602 --> 01:24:09,092
Look, I think it's worth a try.

1449
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,694
Okay.

1450
01:24:10,772 --> 01:24:12,137
What's the deal with Mac?

1451
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:13,401
Upper-leg contusion.

1452
01:24:13,475 --> 01:24:15,170
I think he's done for the night.

1453
01:24:15,243 --> 01:24:17,609
-What if he plays?
-I don't understand, Herb.

1454
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,342
If he plays on it,
can he hurt it any worse?

1455
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,884
Well, no, but it will be
very painful for him,

1456
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:26,318
and he won't be able to
do very much.

1457
01:24:34,162 --> 01:24:36,289
This is unbelievable!

1458
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:38,889
You guys are playing
like this is some throwaway game

1459
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:40,935
up in Rochester.

1460
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:44,065
-Who we playing, Rammer?
-Sweden.

1461
01:24:44,139 --> 01:24:46,630
Yeah, you're damn right!
Sweden!

1462
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,642
In the Olympics!

1463
01:24:54,015 --> 01:24:58,008
What the hell's wrong with you?
Put your gear on.

1464
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,415
I said, "Put your gear on."

1465
01:25:00,488 --> 01:25:02,513
-Doc told me I can't play.
-Yeah, I know.

1466
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,148
You got a bad bruise.

1467
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,287
You know what?
Put your street clothes on.

1468
01:25:07,362 --> 01:25:09,023
'cause I got no time
for quitters.

1469
01:25:09,097 --> 01:25:12,123
come on, Herb.
Nobody's quitting here.

1470
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,159
You worry about your own game.
Plenty there to keep you busy.

1471
01:25:17,772 --> 01:25:18,761
A bruise on the leg

1472
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,139
is a hell of a long way
from the heart, you candy-ass.

1473
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:25,270
-What'd you call me?
-You heard me.

1474
01:25:26,347 --> 01:25:28,611
You want me to play?
Is that what you want?

1475
01:25:28,683 --> 01:25:29,809
I want you to be
a hockey player!

1476
01:25:29,884 --> 01:25:31,613
I am a hockey player!

1477
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:33,483
You want me to play
on one leg, huh?

1478
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:34,954
I'll play on one leg!

1479
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:37,218
-That'll get them going.
-Oh, yeah.

1480
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:39,624
-Will that make you happy?
-I'll clean up.

1481
01:25:39,694 --> 01:25:41,685
I am a hockey player!

1482
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:43,492
MlcHAELS:
2:49 remaining in the game.

1483
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:45,726
Sweden leading 2-1.

1484
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,927
DRYDEN:
The U.S. team has fought hard,

1485
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:49,970
but they've still got
nothing to show for it.

1486
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:51,130
MlcHAELS:
This is a crucial game.

1487
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,696
If they don't beat
or tie the Swedes,

1488
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:56,210
it'll be very difficult to
advance to the medal round.

1489
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:59,038
Mcclanahan after the loose puck.

1490
01:25:59,114 --> 01:26:00,672
He's hit hard by Soderstrom.

1491
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:02,477
-Go, go, go, Mac!
-come on, Mac!

1492
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,713
Mcclanahan gutting it out
despite being injured.

1493
01:26:05,787 --> 01:26:07,015
Silky!
Silky!

1494
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:09,181
Silk to Johnson.
Back to Silk.

1495
01:26:09,257 --> 01:26:11,987
-Through the neutral zone.
-Attaboy, Mac!

1496
01:26:12,994 --> 01:26:14,484
Dumped into the Swedish zone

1497
01:26:14,562 --> 01:26:17,463
and stopped behind the net
by Lindbergh.

1498
01:26:17,532 --> 01:26:20,057
Johnson fighting Eriksson
for it now.

1499
01:26:20,135 --> 01:26:21,602
It goes out to Waltin.

1500
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:24,331
Ooh, he's hit hard
by Mcclanahan.

1501
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:26,703
-All right, Mac!
-Baker, you're up next.

1502
01:26:26,774 --> 01:26:28,105
-What?
-Take the right side.

1503
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:32,010
The Swedes regain control.
1 :40 remaining in the game.

1504
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,207
coneheads, you're up next.

1505
01:26:34,282 --> 01:26:38,616
Mats Waltin moving it out
to Jan Eriksson.

1506
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:41,780
Jan Eriksson
out to Hakan Eriksson.

1507
01:26:41,856 --> 01:26:44,381
-Across the U.S. blue line.
-Take it back, boys!

1508
01:26:44,459 --> 01:26:45,790
Into the corner.

1509
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,259
Stay with him, Ramsey.

1510
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:49,421
-Watch the slot!
-Passes across to Ahlberg.

1511
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:52,261
Wrist shot. Knocked out
of the air by craig.

1512
01:26:54,602 --> 01:26:57,969
Puck picked up by Suter,
moved ahead to Johnson.

1513
01:26:58,039 --> 01:26:59,438
Switch them up!
Go, go!

1514
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:01,441
Johnson gets rid of it
and heads to the bench

1515
01:27:01,509 --> 01:27:04,376
with just over a minute
and a half left to play.

1516
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:07,710
Precious seconds ticking away
for this U.S. team.

1517
01:27:08,616 --> 01:27:09,981
What are you doing
with Baker out there?

1518
01:27:10,051 --> 01:27:11,075
1 :20, Herb.

1519
01:27:11,152 --> 01:27:12,949
Herb Brooks has molded
this unit.

1520
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,318
Seven months of training.

1521
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:17,586
Points to the net, just
a little over a minute left

1522
01:27:17,659 --> 01:27:20,492
to avoid a very damaging loss.

1523
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:23,429
Ahlberg up the wing
to Hakan Eriksson in the slot.

1524
01:27:23,498 --> 01:27:27,434
Stopped by craig.
Rebound picked up by Schneider.

1525
01:27:28,002 --> 01:27:30,800
Schneider flying up the wing,
over the blue line,

1526
01:27:30,872 --> 01:27:32,134
and into the corner.

1527
01:27:32,207 --> 01:27:33,469
Jimmy, come on now!

1528
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:36,738
And Brooks is pulling goalie
Jim craig for an extra skater.

1529
01:27:36,811 --> 01:27:38,608
Go, go, go!

1530
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,238
45 seconds left to play.

1531
01:27:40,315 --> 01:27:42,977
Sweden leading
the U.S. team 2-1.

1532
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,485
Across to Silk.
He moves in.

1533
01:27:45,553 --> 01:27:48,488
His backhander is
stopped by Lindbergh.

1534
01:27:48,556 --> 01:27:50,319
39 seconds remaining.

1535
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:52,086
Let's go, Baker!

1536
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,492
Schneider to Ramsey,
across to Baker.

1537
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,860
He wraps it around the boards.

1538
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,358
Baker fighting for the puck
with Naslund.

1539
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:02,096
Back to Ramsey at the point.

1540
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,798
To Johnson in front.
Broken up by Holmgren.

1541
01:28:04,872 --> 01:28:07,136
Kept in by Baker
and fired behind the net.

1542
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,436
Get a shot, get a shot!

1543
01:28:08,509 --> 01:28:11,205
Loose puck. Schneider
and Waltin fighting for it.

1544
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:13,179
Schneider holds him off.

1545
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:14,840
Kicks it loose.

1546
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,076
Pavelich has it.

1547
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:18,175
He makes a move
around Hakan Eriksson.

1548
01:28:18,253 --> 01:28:20,380
Hits across to Baker.

1549
01:28:20,455 --> 01:28:22,548
He scores!

1550
01:28:22,624 --> 01:28:24,785
The United States has tied it.

1551
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:27,384
Bill Baker scores in
the final minute of the game!

1552
01:28:27,462 --> 01:28:29,623
And the U.S. team
is still very much alive

1553
01:28:29,697 --> 01:28:30,994
in the opening round.

1554
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:34,296
It was a hell of a move.
I didn't see him out there.

1555
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,671
I'm Jim McKay,

1556
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:44,371
and we're back again live
in Lake Placid, New York.

1557
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:48,381
What an amazing start for these
13th Olympic Winter Games.

1558
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:50,679
After a remarkable
last-minute tie

1559
01:28:50,752 --> 01:28:52,982
against Sweden two nights ago,

1560
01:28:53,054 --> 01:28:55,784
the U.S. hockey team,
huge underdogs,

1561
01:28:55,857 --> 01:28:58,189
pulled off a tremendous upset
last night,

1562
01:28:58,259 --> 01:28:59,988
defeating czechoslovakia,

1563
01:29:00,061 --> 01:29:04,191
considered the second-best team
behind the Soviet Union.

1564
01:29:04,265 --> 01:29:06,995
The final score, 7-3.

1565
01:29:07,068 --> 01:29:10,003
"Why so many reporters?"
Are you serious?

1566
01:29:10,071 --> 01:29:12,767
Well, we won two games.
We got a ways to go here.

1567
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,308
Think of what
they've had to write about.

1568
01:29:15,376 --> 01:29:17,867
Hostages, Afghanistan.

1569
01:29:17,945 --> 01:29:19,708
Transportation chaos.

1570
01:29:19,781 --> 01:29:22,944
Patti probably has
talked to you about that.

1571
01:29:23,017 --> 01:29:27,545
Listen, Herb, the bottom line
is that your young guys

1572
01:29:27,622 --> 01:29:30,853
just kicked the crap
out of czechoslovakia,

1573
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:34,258
and this is something that
this country is ready for.

1574
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:35,887
Now, you want to see reporters?

1575
01:29:35,963 --> 01:29:37,863
Win a couple of more games.

1576
01:29:37,932 --> 01:29:39,229
They are just kids, Walter,

1577
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,564
so let's not turn this
into something more, okay?

1578
01:29:41,636 --> 01:29:43,934
I'm not sure we got
any control over it.

1579
01:29:44,005 --> 01:29:45,597
[ Speaking Russian ]

1580
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:47,505
Victor.

1581
01:29:52,747 --> 01:29:56,080
Somebody's gonna beat
those guys.

1582
01:29:57,251 --> 01:29:59,913
MlcHAELS: Buzz Schneider
flying up the right wing.

1583
01:29:59,987 --> 01:30:01,818
Takes a long pass from Ramsey.

1584
01:30:01,889 --> 01:30:03,584
Now he's all alone
on the breakaway.

1585

He shoots!
He scores!

Herb!

1591
01:30:17,405 --> 01:30:20,033
Herb, now that Norway
is behind you,

1592
01:30:20,108 --> 01:30:23,043
what do you look for
out of Romania?

1593
01:30:23,111 --> 01:30:24,476
It should be a tough test.

1594

We're sure not
gonna overlook them.

All right, Jimmy craig's
been great between the pipes.

1598
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,579
Is there any chance
we could talk to him?

1599
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:37,249
Well, as I said the other night,
Mike, you know,

1600
01:30:37,325 --> 01:30:39,691
this isn't an individual
effort going on here.

1601
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:41,126
It's about a team.

1602
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:44,221
We're a team on the ice,
and we're gonna be one off it.

Slams it.

Shot.
Glove save by Jim craig.

1608

The U.S. up 7-2
here late in the third.

1609

Well, making it
to the medal round

1610
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,517
was always our goal
from day one,

1611
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:07,679
so we feel real good about
what we've accomplished so far.

1612
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:09,484
Herb!

1613
01:31:13,628 --> 01:31:16,324
Still no chance we can talk
with any of your players?

1614
01:31:16,397 --> 01:31:18,160
-Still no chance.
-Okay.

1615
01:31:18,232 --> 01:31:20,257
How do you respond to those
who feel you're doing this

1616
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:23,303
to keep the spotlight
on yourself?

1617

MlcHAELS: Luzbach.
Esom across to Krutzman.

1618
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:36,406
Ooh! He's hit hard
into the boards by Strobel.

1619
01:31:36,484 --> 01:31:38,179
Huge hit.

1620
01:31:38,252 --> 01:31:41,153
Ramsey has it,
moves it up to Verchota.

1621
01:31:41,222 --> 01:31:43,383
Verchota across the blue line.

1623
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:47,827
He scores!

1624
01:31:47,895 --> 01:31:52,161
Verchota puts it past Sutner
to put the U.S. up 4-2

1625
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:55,862
with 15:43 remaining to play
here in the third period.

1626
01:31:55,937 --> 01:31:58,701

Sweden and Finland

The face-off for the U.S.-Soviet
game is 1 700 hours.

1632
01:32:14,455 --> 01:32:16,150
Now, if you have any questions,

1633
01:32:16,224 --> 01:32:20,126
we have the U.S.

-What?
-What?

1648
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:31,096
I got a telegram
from a lady in Texas today.

1649
01:33:31,165 --> 01:33:32,860
You know what it said?

1650
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:35,967
"Beat those commie bastards."

1651
01:33:36,971 --> 01:33:37,903
Wow.

1652
01:33:37,972 --> 01:33:41,237
We're playing against
the greatest team in the world,

1653
01:33:41,309 --> 01:33:43,402
maybe the best
that's ever played this game.

1654
01:33:43,477 --> 01:33:45,172
Why can't we just
leave it at that?

1655
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:48,079
Because this is more than a
hockey game to a lot of people.

1656
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:49,980
Yeah, I keep running
through them all.

Broten on Petrov.

We don't match up, Patti.

1661

You might want to skip that when
you talk to the boys tomorrow.

There's no disgrace
in losing to this team.

I know.

1666

The important thing is
you got this far.

1667
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:38,698
The important thing is those
20 boys knowing in 20 years,

1668
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:41,394
they didn't leave anything
on the table.

1669
01:34:42,436 --> 01:34:44,961
That they played
their hearts out.

1670
01:34:47,074 --> 01:34:49,508
That's the important thing.

1671

Any chance we can
wish the boys luck?

Oh, I'm sorry, Bob.
You know Herb.

All right?

-Hey, craig, whoa, hold up.
-I can't.

1680

Herb doesn't want
any distractions.

1681
01:35:48,636 --> 01:35:49,568
It's understandable.

1682

We just wanted
to wish them luck.

1683

Okay, that's...

And that's what you have here
tonight, boys.

That's what you've earned
here tonight.

1690
01:38:41,174 --> 01:38:42,732
One game.

1691

If we played them ten times,
they might win nine.

1692

But not this game.

Tonight we stay with them.

And we shut them down
because we can.

1697

01:42:51,758 --> 01:42:53,726
Ken, some of your thoughts
before the game.

1741
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:56,319
Well, for the U.S. team,
it's really discovery time.

1742
01:42:56,396 --> 01:42:58,523
It's one thing
to be young and promising.

1743
01:42:58,598 --> 01:43:00,498
And it's quite another
to be good.

1744
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:03,434
And in the next 2 1/2 hours,
the U.S. players will go through

1745
01:43:03,503 --> 01:43:05,494
perhaps the most difficult
and demanding

1746
01:43:05,572 --> 01:43:07,836
yet exhilarating time
of their lives.

1747
01:43:07,908 --> 01:43:11,139
They will be playing against
the best team in the world,

1748
01:43:11,211 --> 01:43:13,145
a team that's far better
than they are,

1749
01:43:13,213 --> 01:43:15,272
a team that's dominated
world hockey

1750
01:43:15,348 --> 01:43:17,782
for the last 15 years.

1751
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:21,917
In the crowd, Jim craig's
father, Donald craig.

1752
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:24,286
It's been a difficult time
for the craig family

1753
01:43:24,357 --> 01:43:26,120
with the passing of Jimmy's mom.

1754
01:43:26,193 --> 01:43:29,162
One of her dreams was to have
her son play on this team.

1755
01:43:29,229 --> 01:43:32,721
So this has to be an emotional
night for the two of them.

1756
01:43:37,804 --> 01:43:40,398
They don't look too nervous
down there.

1757
01:43:40,473 --> 01:43:44,375
The U.S. team very young.
Average age, 21 years old.

1758
01:43:44,444 --> 01:43:46,002
The Soviets much more seasoned.

1759
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,310
Some of them have been playing
together for the last 15 years.

1760
01:43:49,382 --> 01:43:50,872
Let's go, here, boys.

1761
01:43:52,452 --> 01:43:54,443
And this game is about to
get underway.

1762
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:04,424
All right.
On three, boys.

1763
01:44:05,832 --> 01:44:07,129
One, two, three!

1764
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,031
TOGETHER:
USA!

1765
01:44:10,203 --> 01:44:12,797
MlcHAELS: Jim craig in goal
for the United States.

1766
01:44:12,873 --> 01:44:16,070
Vladislav Tretiak, considered
the best goalie in the world,

1767
01:44:16,142 --> 01:44:18,133
in the nets
for the Soviet Union.

1768
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:21,009
The U.S. team in white,
skating up to center ice.

1769
01:44:21,081 --> 01:44:24,539
The Soviet Union in red,
all business.

1770
01:44:24,618 --> 01:44:26,711
And here we go.

1771
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:31,214
Face-off is won by Mikhailov.

1772
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:32,690
Back to Kasatonov.

1773
01:44:32,759 --> 01:44:34,192
Move on him!
Move on him!

1774
01:44:34,261 --> 01:44:37,287
carried up ice by Kasatonov.
The pass is to Petrov.

1775
01:44:37,364 --> 01:44:39,662
Puck picked up by Morrow.

1776
01:44:39,733 --> 01:44:41,860
Pressured by Mikhailov.

1777
01:44:41,935 --> 01:44:43,368
The pass in front
of the U.S. net.

1778
01:44:43,436 --> 01:44:46,030
-And a shot deflected by craig.
-Watch the middle!

1779
01:44:46,106 --> 01:44:48,006
come on, Jimmy.
Keep it out of the middle, boys!

1780
01:44:48,074 --> 01:44:50,338
Jim craig tested
for the first time.

1781
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,878
Dave Silk with the puck
along the boards.

1782
01:44:52,946 --> 01:44:54,538
Taken away by Kasatonov.

1783
01:44:54,614 --> 01:44:56,013
Up ahead to Petrov.

1784
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:58,915
Petrov streaking up the boards.

1785
01:44:58,985 --> 01:45:01,647
Powering past Ramsey.
A centering pass to Kharlamov.

1786
01:45:01,721 --> 01:45:04,155
He shoots.
Saved by Jim craig!

1787
01:45:04,724 --> 01:45:06,851
Puck cleared
out of the U.S. zone.

1788
01:45:06,927 --> 01:45:08,292
Big hit on Mcclanahan

1789
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:10,556
by the Soviet captain,
Boris Mikhailov.

1790
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,894
Krutov with a hard shot
from the high slot.

1791
01:45:12,966 --> 01:45:14,228
craig with the save!

1792
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:16,235
Golikov across to Petrov.

1793
01:45:16,303 --> 01:45:17,634
Again craig is equal
to the task.

1794
01:45:17,704 --> 01:45:20,332
come on, boys.
Use those boards!

1795
01:45:20,407 --> 01:45:22,841
Screen! Screen! Screen!

1796
01:45:22,909 --> 01:45:25,343
Pass is across to Kharlamov.
Shot. Stopped!

1797
01:45:25,412 --> 01:45:27,972
-Petrov tries to lead now.
-Watch point!

1798
01:45:28,048 --> 01:45:30,812
To Makarov at the point.
He fires it along the boards.

1799
01:45:30,884 --> 01:45:34,251
Picked up behind the net
by Buzz Schneider.

1800
01:45:34,321 --> 01:45:35,845
-come on!
-That's a slash!

1801
01:45:35,922 --> 01:45:37,321
Schneider losing it.

1802
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:38,322
Out to the point.
Slap shot!

1803
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:40,882
Deflected in!

1804
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:42,223
That was a slash!

1805
01:45:42,295 --> 01:45:44,923
The Soviet Union takes
a 1-0 lead.

1806
01:45:44,998 --> 01:45:48,399
Kasatonov's slap shot
was deflected in past craig.

1807
01:45:48,468 --> 01:45:52,700
So the Soviet Union leads, 1-0,
early in the first period.

1808
01:45:52,772 --> 01:45:54,205
Forget about it now.

1809
01:45:54,274 --> 01:45:55,571
come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

1810
01:45:55,642 --> 01:45:59,373
Mikhailov and christoff
facing off at center ice.

1811
01:45:59,446 --> 01:46:02,381
Here we go, boys.
Move it!

1812
01:46:02,449 --> 01:46:04,713
-Kharlamov to Mikhailov.
-Pick it up!

1813
01:46:04,784 --> 01:46:07,116
Mikhailov up the boards
and into the corner.

1814
01:46:07,187 --> 01:46:08,779
To Kharlamov for a quick shot.

1815
01:46:08,855 --> 01:46:11,119
Big save by Jim craig.

1816
01:46:11,191 --> 01:46:14,126
Makarov with the puck now.
craig gets his stick on it.

1817
01:46:14,194 --> 01:46:15,286
Hey, Jimmy!

1818
01:46:15,362 --> 01:46:19,025
The U.S. in possession now.
Ramsey moving it up to Johnson.

1819
01:46:19,099 --> 01:46:21,192
Johnson is hung up
by Bilyaletdinov,

1820
01:46:21,267 --> 01:46:25,260
who feeds it around the boards,
where it's picked up by Krutov.

1821
01:46:26,139 --> 01:46:27,731
Golikov crossing the blue line.

1822
01:46:27,807 --> 01:46:30,139
He's hit hard by Ken Morrow!

1823
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,838
The puck is picked up
by Eruzione.

1824
01:46:32,912 --> 01:46:35,540
And he's sent hard
into the boards by Krutov.

1825
01:46:35,615 --> 01:46:38,914
Johnson with it now.
Flying up the boards.

1826
01:46:38,985 --> 01:46:40,452
You got time.
You got time.

1827
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,454
-O.c., go!
-Avoids the hit from Golikov.

1828
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:44,422
O.c., get in there!

1829
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,922
The Soviets control it.

1830
01:46:47,994 --> 01:46:49,291
Kasatonov.

1831
01:46:49,362 --> 01:46:50,886
Let's see the "D"!

1832
01:46:50,964 --> 01:46:53,159
Krutov with the puck now.

1833
01:46:54,234 --> 01:46:56,930
A big hit by Jack O'callahan.

1834
01:46:57,003 --> 01:46:59,403
Pavelich up ahead to Schneider.

1835
01:47:00,874 --> 01:47:01,932
Slap shot.

1836
01:47:04,077 --> 01:47:05,442
Whoo!

1837
01:47:05,512 --> 01:47:06,911
Yeah!

1838
01:47:09,315 --> 01:47:10,646
That's the type of goal

1839
01:47:10,717 --> 01:47:13,686
you don't expect someone
like Tretiak to give up.

1840
01:47:13,753 --> 01:47:16,449
The United States ties
the game at one.

1841
01:47:16,523 --> 01:47:17,683
Jack O'callahan returning

1842
01:47:17,757 --> 01:47:20,590
after a serious knee injury
at Madison Square Garden,

1843
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:23,424
making a big contribution
with that hit on Krutov.

1844
01:47:23,496 --> 01:47:25,430
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Number 16, Pavelich.

1845
01:47:25,498 --> 01:47:28,194
Time, 14:03.

1846
01:47:30,737 --> 01:47:32,637
MlcHAELS:
Petrov to Kharlamov.

1847
01:47:32,705 --> 01:47:36,038
Skating into the U.S. zone.
Tying up O'callahan.

1848
01:47:36,109 --> 01:47:38,270
Golikov.
cross-ice pass to Petrov.

1849
01:47:38,344 --> 01:47:40,869
He shoots.
And craig is right there!

1850
01:47:40,947 --> 01:47:44,508
Picked up by O'callahan.
Moves up to Pavelich.

1851
01:47:44,584 --> 01:47:47,075
Through the middle.
crossing the Soviet blue line.

1852
01:47:47,153 --> 01:47:49,747
centering pass.
cleared by Fetisov.

1853
01:47:49,823 --> 01:47:51,381
Talk to each other out there.

1854
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:52,789
Play your position!

1855
01:47:52,859 --> 01:47:55,350
Krutov with the puck.
Through the neutral zone.

1856
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:58,955
Knifes through the defense.
Right in front.

1857
01:48:01,034 --> 01:48:02,934
Picked up by Mark Johnson.

1858
01:48:03,002 --> 01:48:04,663
Nice move to get around
Bilyaletdinov

1859
01:48:04,737 --> 01:48:06,329
as he moves up the ice.

1860
01:48:06,406 --> 01:48:09,375
Another great move around
Makarov, charging for the net.

1861
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:13,879
Hit by Golikov
and sent flying into the boards.

1862
01:48:13,947 --> 01:48:15,574
The Soviets now working
out of their own zone.

1863
01:48:15,648 --> 01:48:16,979
come on, now.
Pick him up.

1864
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,642
Don't let him
through the middle.

1865
01:48:18,718 --> 01:48:21,516
Golikov crossing center ice.
Leaves it for Makarov.

1866
01:48:21,588 --> 01:48:22,987
Makarov around Morrow.

1867
01:48:23,056 --> 01:48:25,650
And he scores.

1868
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,886
-[ crowd booing ]
-Oh!

1869
01:48:28,962 --> 01:48:31,692
Makarov put the puck
right between Morrow's legs,

1870
01:48:31,764 --> 01:48:33,231
skated in, and scored.

1871
01:48:33,299 --> 01:48:35,699
DRYDEN: That was a textbook
Soviet passing play.

1872
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:36,700
Beautifully done.

1873
01:48:36,769 --> 01:48:38,396
Once this team gets rolling,

1874
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:39,836
it's almost impossible
to stop them.

1875
01:48:39,906 --> 01:48:42,340
24 gets the goal.
Give 25 the assist, boys.

1876
01:48:42,408 --> 01:48:44,137
MlcHAELS: And with
the Soviets leading, 2-1, Ken,

1877
01:48:44,210 --> 01:48:46,303
the U.S. teams knows that
all too well

1878
01:48:46,379 --> 01:48:48,370
after what happened
with these two teams

1879
01:48:48,448 --> 01:48:50,746
at Madison Square Garden
13 days ago.

1880
01:48:50,817 --> 01:48:52,216
cROWD:
[ chanting ] USA!

1881
01:48:52,285 --> 01:48:54,014
Now tonight's referee,
carl Keisler,

1882
01:48:54,087 --> 01:48:55,987
calling the players over
for the face-off.

1883
01:48:56,055 --> 01:48:58,785
And you can hear the crowd
trying to reinvigorate

1884
01:48:58,858 --> 01:49:00,621
this U.S. team.

1885
01:49:00,693 --> 01:49:02,354
Face-off won by the Soviets.

1886
01:49:02,428 --> 01:49:04,555
Fetisov across to Kasatonov.

1887
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:07,293
He circles behind his own net.
Leaves it for Fetisov.

1888
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:11,098
Get the pressure on them
in there! come on!

1889
01:49:11,171 --> 01:49:13,469
-Pick him up!
-Watch the pass!

1890
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:15,030
To Maltsev.
Over to Makarov.

1891
01:49:15,108 --> 01:49:16,939
Shot stopped by craig.

1892

01:56:45,891 --> 01:56:48,052
DRYDEN: This is
a big opportunity for the U.S.

2056
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:50,061
They haven't been able to go
on the offense

2057
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:53,189

Silky! Silky!
I'm with you!

2081
01:57:49,155 --> 01:57:51,020
He's checked.
Loose puck.

Picked up by Johnson.

2083
01:57:52,458 --> 01:57:54,153
He scores!

2084
01:57:54,226 --> 01:57:58,094

2089
01:58:11,844 --> 01:58:13,004
MlcHAELS:
Ken, a couple months ago,

2090
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:15,673
did you think this was
remotely possible?

2091
01:58:15,748 --> 01:58:17,682
DRYDEN:
No. Absolutely not.

2092
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:20,514
But the thing with the U.S. team
is they're very young,

2093
01:58:20,586 --> 01:58:21,951
very talented.

2094
01:58:22,021 --> 01:58:24,114
And now they're beginning
to believe.

2095
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:26,021
There's my boy!

2096
01:58:27,059 --> 01:58:29,823
Way to work!

01:58:44,376 --> 01:58:46,708
And the Americans with the puck.

2104
01:58:46,779 --> 01:58:48,178

2105
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:51,239

-Thataway, Jimmy!

2110
01:58:58,124 --> 01:58:59,113
Thataway, Jimmy!

2111

2113
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:07,861

2114
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:10,401
Schneider gets rid of it
and heads to the bench.

2115
01:59:10,469 --> 01:59:12,198
All right, Buzzy.

Over to Eruzione.

2121
01:59:27,419 --> 01:59:28,750
He shoots.

Whoo! Whoo!

2125
01:59:36,629 --> 01:59:39,359
Right now we've got bedlam!

2126
01:59:40,132 --> 01:59:42,123
DRYDEN: Anyone who was at
Madison Square Garden

2127
01:59:42,201 --> 01:59:44,669
two weeks ago who's
watching this game tonight

2128
01:59:44,737 --> 01:59:47,137
has got to be shocked.

2129
01:59:47,706 --> 01:59:50,573
MlcHAELS:
Oh, I love Brooks' reaction.

2130
01:59:57,516 --> 01:59:59,416
Thataway, Rizzo!

2131
01:59:59,485 --> 02:00:02,283
Yes! Yes! Yes!

2132
02:00:02,354 --> 02:00:05,118

And the chant resumes.

2134
02:00:09,028 --> 02:00:11,519
Mike Eruzione
out of Boston University,

2135
02:00:11,597 --> 02:00:13,087
the captain of this U.S. team,

2136
02:00:13,165 --> 02:00:15,759
has just put the U.S. ahead
for the first time

2137
02:00:15,835 --> 02:00:18,633
exactly halfway through
the third period.

WOMAN ON P.A.: USA goal scored
by number 21, Eruzione.

2139
02:00:23,209 --> 02:00:26,303
DRYDEN: This U.S. team was
demoralized by the Soviets.

2140
02:00:26,378 --> 02:00:28,039
Very tentative.
Very nervous.

2141
02:00:28,113 --> 02:00:30,741
Very much in awe
of the Soviet team.

2142
02:00:30,816 --> 02:00:33,512
And this is a U.S. team
that is not in awe of anyone.

2143
02:00:33,586 --> 02:00:35,554
Keep it going, now, boys!

2144
02:00:35,621 --> 02:00:37,088
Whoo!

2145
02:00:37,156 --> 02:00:39,886

2157
02:01:05,651 --> 02:01:06,345
Take him wide!

2158

2167
02:01:26,672 --> 02:01:28,162
Great play!

2168
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:30,800
Mcclanahan dives
