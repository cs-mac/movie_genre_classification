JUNE 1944
A TOWN IN SOUTHWEST FRANCE...

3
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:13,373
<i>A French national broadcast</i>
<i>from Vichy.</i>

4
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:17,809
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, a talk</i>
<i>by Monsieur Philippe Henriot</i>

5
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,275
<i>on "History's Revenge."</i>

6
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,453
<i>It's amazing,</i>

7
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,784
<i>listening to Gaullist broadcasts...</i>

8
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>how serenely consistent these partisans</i>
<i>of Moscow are in their treachery.</i>

9
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:35,458
<i>There is no difference</i>
<i>between broadcasts</i>

10
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,828
<i>from London, Algeria, or Brazzaville.</i>

11
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:43,632
<i>The tone, style and vocabulary</i>
<i>have long been familiar,</i>

12
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:48,242
<i>each emission bearing</i>
<i>the same distinctive stamp.</i>

13
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:53,647
<i>The shallow veneer of nationalism</i>
<i>and religion is always evident,</i>

14
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:57,888
<i>despite their best attempts</i>
<i>to conceal it.</i>

15
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,824
<i>You would hope propaganda</i>
<i>would at least refrain</i>

16
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:06,553
<i>from constantly insulting</i>
<i>one's common sense.</i>

17
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:10,360
<i>But never mind.</i>
<i>No one expects logic from them.</i>

18
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:13,169
<i>Let them go on repeating endlessly</i>

19
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,966
<i>that Laval is a traitor</i>
<i>and Darlan a Gestapo agent,</i>

20
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:19,871
<i>and that I serve</i>
<i>German propaganda...</i>

21
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,711
What are you doing here?

22
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,680
Are you Lucien, Thérèse's son?

23
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,920
That's not yours!
Those dishes are my father's!

24
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,956
Maybe so.

25
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,493
Go see the boss.
He'll explain.

26
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,635
Is that you, Lucien?

27
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,717
You get up late.

28
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:34,753
It's Sunday.

29
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:44,197
Why did you take your father's gun?

30
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:49,166
You know guns aren't allowed.

31
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:06,247
Here.
I got a raise of 20 francs.

32
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,064
Good.

33
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,961
- Morning, Lucien.
- Hello, Monsieur Laborit.

34
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,730
Your son could let us know
when he's coming.

35
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,136
You staying long?

36
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,547
I have five days off.

37
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,235
What are those other people
doing in our house?

38
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,274
They're helping Monsieur Laborit.

39
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,816
I let them have the house.

40
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,883
Things have changed around here.

41
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,647
The work has to be done.

42
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,991
Your father's a prisoner
and Joseph's gone.

43
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,794
- Really?
- Joined the underground, the bum!

44
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,832
My son's a patriot - so there!

45
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,161
Lucien, lift his head.

46
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,086
It's coming.

47
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,434
Come on, let's have a drink.

48
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:48,811
He was a good horse.
I'll never find another like him.

49
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,910
<i>'A nd the thunder...</i>

50
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,043
rolled...

51
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,082
in muffled avalanches..."

52
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:43,489
Well, well.
Come in, Lucien.

53
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,155
'...in the distance."

54
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:55,600
Maurice, really!

55
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,274
You're hopeless.

56
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:03,645
You spelled ' stormy"
starting with S-T-A-U.

57
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:10,785
But I guess you don't need to know
how to spell to herd sheep.

58
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,857
Dismissed!

59
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,699
What do you want?

60
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,304
This is for you.

61
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,720
Thanks.

62
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,914
You came to give me that?

63
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,285
I want to join the underground.

64
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,091
What's that got to do with me?

65
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,334
You're the one who decides.
Joseph told me so.

66
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,172
You're too young.

67
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,047
And we have enough like you.

68
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:20,884
The underground isn't like poaching.

69
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,487
It's like the army.

70
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:29,783
I don't want to go back
to the nursing home.

71
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,528
You're lucky to have a job.

72
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:41,029
You can't stay here, Lucien.

73
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,933
Laborit won't let you.

74
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,434
When your father returns -

75
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,306
When he returns,
there'll be hell to pay.

76
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:57,976
Shit!

77
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,722
Are you crazy?
Where'd you come from?

78
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,953
Spying, you little punk?

79
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,493
Get moving. You've got some
explaining to do.

80
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,665
- Any news from Paris?
- The phone isn't working.

81
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,011
Kid, come here!

82
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,968
Curiosity is a nasty habit.

83
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,602
Who is he?

84
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:42,795
I caught him spying in the garden.

85
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:46,874
I was not.
I was going back to the nursing home.

86
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:51,541
Don't you know
there's a 10:00 curfew?

87
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,648
What's the matter?

88
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:59,514
Aren't you Henri Aubert,
the bicycle champ?

89
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,050
- You've seen me race, kid?
- Yes, in '39, at Caussade.

90
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:07,924
I was with my father.
You won.

91
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,165
I remember.

92
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,703
You from town?
- No, from Souleillac.

93
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:16,031
Wait. I know people in Souleillac.

94
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,073
The grocery woman - what's her name?

95
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:20,440
Madame Cabessut.

96
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:23,675
That's it.
Dark hair, right?

97
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:33,255
How about a drink?

98
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:36,626
Marie, two Suzes.

99
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,863
- So, you're from Souleillac.
- You been there?

100
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,899
Beautiful country.
Very wild.

101
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,661
I bet there's underground there.

102
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,238
You don't see much of them.

103
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:55,036
And how is Madame Cabessut?

104
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,648
Have another.

105
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,058
And what's this teacher's name?

106
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:14,796
Peyssac, Robert.

107
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,797
They say he's a Freemason.

108
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,298
What's a Freemason?

109
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,234
You're sure he's in command?

110
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,932
Yes, under another name.

111
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,578
- What name?
- Hold on.

112
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,614
Voltaire.
They call him Lieutenant Voltaire.

113
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,325
Wake up!

114
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,492
Time to get up.
Mademoiselle Chauvelot is on her way.

115
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:56,469
Oh, my head!

116
00:23:56,673 --> 00:24:00,074
Poor boy.
You drank too much last night.

117
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,704
Want an aspirin?

118
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,779
Good morning, young man.

119
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:15,553
Forgive me.
There wasn't a room for him.

120
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,226
Very well.

121
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,604
- How are you today?
- Fine, thanks.

122
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,541
I'm almost finished.

123
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:41,278
- What a beautiful day.
- You mean what heat.

124
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,521
These are for Herr Müller.

125
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:02,162
They're so polite...

126
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,165
and punctual.

127
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:08,745
If we'd been like them,
we'd have won the war.

128
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:12,443
Darn! I broke a nail.

129
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:19,949
What did you say, Mama?

130
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,954
I broke a nail.

131
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:28,658
You've been drinking, Pierre.
It's so early.

132
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,226
Just a little Suze.

133
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,696
Does one good, what with this heat.

134
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,510
You'd think you were in Saigon.

135
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:44,840
How are you, my boy?
- All right, Monsieur Tonin.

136
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,648
Doesn't he look like Paul?

137
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:52,419
A little.

138
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:54,950
Paul was thinner.

139
00:25:58,595 --> 00:26:01,086
Read me the mail, Mama.

140
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:07,435
'Dear Gentlemen of the Gestapo:
As a farmer, with WWI medals,

141
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:13,542
I must inform you of the shady doings
of a certain Etienne Louvel -"

142
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,507
<i>Hurry up!</i>

143
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:17,270
Move it.

144
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:21,783
Here's Lieutenant Voltaire for you.
We found him in bed,

145
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:23,475
sleeping like an angel.

146
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:27,488
These leaflets
were on his night table.

147
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:31,560
'German troops
are retreating on all fronts.

148
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:34,560
You will soon be free
in a Free France."

149
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:37,461
They could at least ask people.

150
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:41,135
I don't want to be freed
by the Rothschild Bank.

151
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:43,098
That's my right, isn't it?

152
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:46,169
Shut up, you bastard!

153
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,300
Welcome, Monsieur Peyssac.

154
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,571
Take him upstairs.
I'll be right there.

155
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:57,512
- Shall I start on him?
- No, wait for me.

156
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,481
It's funny,
but I've never liked teachers.

157
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,954
If you don't need me,
I'll go take a shower.

158
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:11,561
I don't know why they're all socialists.
Are you a socialist?

159
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,363
What will happen to him?

160
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,872
Don't worry.
We'll just have a chat.

161
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,741
We should find this young man
something to do.

162
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,315
He can open the mail.

163
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:28,180
Here.

164
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:35,218
Just do like this.

165
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,886
Go on, Mama.

166
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:43,295
'I must call to your attention

167
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,025
that the milliner,
Solange Leboeuf, of Lubsac,

168
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:50,673
is often visited by her two sons,
both outlaws and communists."

169
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:52,973
That's enough.

170
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:07,746
'Monsieur, as a practicing Catholic
who finds the black market unworthy

171
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,721
of Frenchmen and Christians,
I'd like to inform you -"

172
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:12,087
Nothing serious this morning?

173
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:14,794
Yes.

174
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:16,961
A complaint from the prefecture

175
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:20,000
concerning the disappearance
of Dr. Pradines.

176
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,841
Forget it, Mama.

177
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:31,714
They're not about to find
Dr. Pradines.

178
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,079
I'll go take care of Voltaire.

179
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,693
Are you Monsieur Tonin's mother?

180
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,625
Of course not!

181
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,709
Are there many more like this?

182
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:11,777
We get about two hundred a day.

183
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,781
One man even writes
to inform on himself.

184
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:18,523
It's like a disease.

185
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:31,869
- You'd like to work for the police?
- I don't know.

186
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,102
You're young.

187
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:40,175
I think Inspector Lanciaga likes you.

188
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,174
Monsieur Tonin is an inspector?

189
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:44,544
He was...

190
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:48,782
an exceptional policeman.

191
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,218
He isn't anymore?

192
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:55,896
They dismissed him in '36
as an undesirable!

193
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:17,616
Run along, kids.

194
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:38,305
Tell me, Jean-B.

195
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:40,132
What, my dear?

196
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:43,335
Is there a gypsy restaurant
in Toulouse?

197
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:46,640
No, my dear.
There's nothing in Toulouse.

198
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:50,416
When are we going
to San Sebastián?

199
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,144
The end of the month.

200
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:56,117
- What's it like?
- You'll see.

201
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:59,487
There's a great hotel,
and everything you like.

202
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,526
Ever shot with one of these?

203
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:08,065
Come here.

204
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:14,336
Grasp it firmly.

205
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:18,144
Raise your arm, loose and relaxed,

206
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,282
and hold your breath.

207
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:28,318
Aim at his left nostril.

208
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,960
His left nostril, not his necktie!
Try again.

209
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:47,302
- He's better than you.
- That's not saying much.

210
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,796
Where are we going?

211
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,400
To see Albert Horn.

212
00:32:13,136 --> 00:32:14,831
Know who he is?

213
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:18,165
A top tailor from Paris.

214
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:40,760
You coming?

215
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:01,906
- He lives here?
- He's lying low.

216
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,250
He works exclusively for me.

217
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:07,283
What a surprise
finding him in this hole.

218
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,655
I was going to school nearby
in Sorèze. You know it?

219
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:13,556
They kicked me out.

220
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,606
Oh, it's you.

221
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,953
Am I disturbing you?

222
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,482
Never.

223
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:43,853
I brought you a customer.

224
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:54,398
It's his first suit.

225
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:58,001
An important step in a man's life.

226
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,337
Take off your jacket.

227
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:14,919
Does the young man
want the plaid or the blue flannel,

228
00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:17,524
like the one I made for you?

229
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,922
The plaid.
Do you agree, Lucien?

230
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,756
I don't give a damn.

231
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,580
Remember when Papa
first brought me to your place?

232
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:46,512
I was twelve.

233
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,526
You were on the rue Marbeuf
back then.

234
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:23,450
Your mother's a strange one.

235
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,964
Nice materials.

236
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,459
I got them for nothing.

237
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:37,032
A few gas coupons.

238
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,141
I never told you
where they came from.

239
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:48,073
From Cassels.

240
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,284
Their liquidated stock.

241
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:53,412
Whatever happened to Cassels?

242
00:35:54,023 --> 00:35:56,992
There's a camp at St. Denis
for the English.

243
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,530
The Jews are in Drancy.

244
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:03,729
I know.

245
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:06,926
Thank you.

246
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,334
It will be ready in five days.

247
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:19,875
Listen.

248
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,077
There's news about Spain.

249
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:29,191
But it will cost you.

250
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:33,026
You think it hasn't already?

251
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:38,924
They're coming down harder
on people like you.

252
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:42,330
What I gave you isn't enough?

253
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,902
That was for the forged papers.

254
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:49,640
The gentleman
is a rich and stingy Jew.

255
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,818
Stop that playing.
The music is bothering us.

256
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:18,463
You must miss Paris.

257
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:24,713
The number of nightclubs
has doubled since '39.

258
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,673
War has its good sides too.

259
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:40,622
<i>The German general staff announces</i>
<i>that yesterday its troops took</i>

260
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,298
<i>hundreds of American prisoners,</i>

261
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:47,902

00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:51,540

263
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:56,535

266

267

269
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:18,156
<i>The Americans suffered</i>
<i>heavy losses in street fighting.</i>

270
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,734
That's not a real Pink Lady!

271
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:24,566
Please, sweetheart.
She tried.

272
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:28,710
The best Pink Ladys I ever drank
were at Rudy Hiden's bar.

273
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,038
The best English bar in Paris.

274
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,143
How about putting on some music?

275
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:41,684
There's a war going on,
Miss Beaulieu.

276
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:50,828
Do you know I'm in the movies?

277
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:52,792
Really?

278
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:56,930
Last year I had a good part
in <i>Night Raid,</i>

279
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:59,099
with Yvon Nevers.

280
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:01,342
People could see you
in the movies?

281
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:03,937
In Paris you could.

282
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:08,812
In this hole
they only show old films.

283
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,521
Like I thought:
The Americans aren't soldiers.

284
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,991
Seems they put their Negroes
in the front lines.

285
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:23,062
You're biased.

286
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,567
Who says the news is accurate?

287
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,599
- Are you joking?
- Not at all.

288
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,298
You have to listen to Radio London

289
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,364
and split the difference.

290
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:37,980
Aren't you warm with that on?

291
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:52,727
'To Lucien, on a June evening,

292
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:57,423
with my best wishes
for happiness, poetry and success."

293
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,172
You understand English, Stéphane?

294
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:10,743
No. Why should I?

295
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:13,778
I'm not a turncoat.

296
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,615
Know what I think of the English?

297
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:20,649
They make me sick.

298
00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:23,391
They're better-Iooking
than the French.

299
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:26,124
I love Leslie Howard.

300
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,125
Even stupidity has its limits,
don't you think?

301
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:31,900
What was that?

302
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:34,797
Repeat what you said!
You want me to smack you?

303
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,666
You two fighting again?

304
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:41,472
Henri, a cognac.

305
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:47,241
- Still wheeling and dealing?
- I have no choice.

306
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:52,648
You're a boor and a fool, Monsieur Faure.
You don't know who you're speaking to.

307
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:56,618
You've got a job waiting upstairs.

308
00:40:58,427 --> 00:40:59,724
Let's go.

309
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,954
- I'm coming too.
- There's no point, darling.

310
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,290
If it amuses her -

311
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:05,524
Yes, it amuses me.

312
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,269
I don't give a damn
which side wins the war.

313
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,965
I only know I'm wasting my time here...

314
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,337
surrounded by these nobodies.

315
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:19,510
If they were at least good-Iooking.

316
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:25,683
Do you ever think about my career?

317
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:41,300
This is Henri.

318
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:46,870
What's he saying?

319
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,907
Two loads of shoes
on the Spanish border.

320
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,409
Shoes? And the entry permit?

321
00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:53,809
He'll get it from Max
in exchange for the tungsten.

322
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:56,314
Okay, tell him it's a deal.

323
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:03,883
A cup of tea?

324
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:11,090
You're not going to sleep
in the office again tonight.

325
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,335
I'm going upstairs now.

326
00:42:19,342 --> 00:42:21,173
Wait a little.

327
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:28,375
It's the fifth door on the right
at the end of the hall.

328
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:40,955
- Will you be much longer, Henri?
- I'm coming.

329
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:44,365
Did you talk to Wiroth?
- Yes.

330
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:48,162
He's giving me a kickback
on the chamois skins.

331
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:52,501
- The Krauts want them?
- Chamois skins? You have no idea.

332
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:57,273
Madame Georges,

333
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,311
you're one hell of a businesswoman!

334
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:03,379
What about tanned leather?
- There's only untanned.

335
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:06,453
But at a very good price.
- A good price?

336
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:49,229
Watch your trousers, Jean-B!

337
00:43:56,806 --> 00:43:58,239
Well, Monsieur Peyssac?

338
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,833
You gonna talk, you bastard?

339
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:29,461
Damn, he seems to like it!

340
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,389
Stay away from those people.

341
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:54,858
They're not like us.

342
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,898
First of all...

343
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:01,595
the Americans are going
to win the war.

344
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:03,169
Everyone says so.

345
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,577
You hear me?

346
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:12,576
The Germans are finished.

347
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:18,609
The Americans will win, I tell you.

348
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,205
I'll do the talking.

349
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,402
I should have been an actor.

350
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:47,941
I'd have been better than Betty.

351
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:52,781
Dr. Vaugeois?

352
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:56,315
Speaking.

353
00:45:57,526 --> 00:45:59,551
I'm from the underground at Lorsac.

354
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:02,460
The Germans attacked.
I've got a bullet in my thigh.

355
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:07,359
I'm on vacation,
and I have nothing with me.

356
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,666
All right. Come in.

357
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:32,856
Patrick, get my bag.
And some bandages and alcohol.

358
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:35,661
That's my son.

359
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,512
Lie down.

360
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:03,684
Some buddies told me about you.

361
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:06,223
Commandant Méry in particular.

362
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,163
Is that so?

363
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:10,893
You know Méry?

364
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,533
Very well.

365
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:14,259
He's a friend.

366
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:16,969
He sends one of his boys
this way now and then.

367
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:25,138
I'm sorry. German police.

368
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,086
I'm sorry.

369
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:34,246
Keep an eye on him.

370
00:47:35,424 --> 00:47:36,982
Put your hands up.

371
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,132
Move it.

372
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:51,966
Paul, what's going on?

373
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:54,039
Don't be frightened, dear.

374
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,250
Exquisite.

375
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:19,800
Are you related to Philippe Vaugeois?

376
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:22,966
I met him at La Baule.

377
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:25,538
That was September of '38.

378
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:26,935
Is that so?

379
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:31,470
A charming boy, Philippe.
An excellent tennis player.

380
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:33,906
He always beat me.

381
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,122
- Who's that?
- My great-grandmother.

382
00:49:16,024 --> 00:49:19,653
- Well?
- Just as we thought. He works with Méry.

383
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:22,930
Paul, do something!
Call the mayor!

384
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:24,963
Don't worry.

385
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:46,011
You wish to speak to Dr. Vaugeois?
Just a moment.

386
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:49,622
It's his brother.
What shall I say?

387
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:51,952
That we're going to shoot him.

388
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,425
We're going to shoot him, monsieur.

389
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,222
That's right - shoot him.

390
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:58,058
And send him all our love.

391
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:00,030
We send all our love, sir.

392
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:03,437
He hung up.

393
00:50:08,343 --> 00:50:12,746
Now, what can you tell us
about Commandant Méry?

394
00:50:13,816 --> 00:50:16,546
A man like you working with terrorists -
I don't get it.

395
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:19,986
You want bolshevism in France?
- I'm a Gaullist.

396
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:22,885
De Gaulle's surrounded
by Jews and commies.

397
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:25,787
You want names?
Does Schumann sound French to you?

398
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:27,985
Save the politics for later.

399
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:31,857
Come on, Doctor.

400
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:35,261
Tell us about Commandant Méry.

401
00:50:39,341 --> 00:50:40,933
Come on, start talking.

402
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,340
- What's this?
- The <i>Wandera.</i>

403
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,441
I built it.

404
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:24,817
It took me a year.

405
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:30,286
It's almost done.

406
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:32,555
Is it a lot of work?

407
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,461
Especially the portholes.

408
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:44,263
What about you?
Are you like your father?

409
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,137
You know nothing
about the underground either?

410
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,589
Your suit is ready.

411
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:19,890
I made you golf trousers.
They're more elegant on a young man.

412
00:53:29,344 --> 00:53:31,369
Do you like golf trousers?

413
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:41,787
I could make straight-legged pants,

414
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:48,862
but I think golf trousers
are more... more -

415
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:51,630
What are golf trousers?

416
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:57,503
They're like these.

417
00:54:06,348 --> 00:54:09,146
We must have a fitting.

418
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:08,639
These are golf trousers?

419
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,422
Are you from here in town?

420
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:23,552
No, I'm from Souleillac.

421
00:55:27,362 --> 00:55:30,695
And you're a friend
of Jean-Bernard de Voisins?

422
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,767
Are you a student?

423
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:42,270
Are you on vacation?

424
00:55:42,544 --> 00:55:45,012
No, I'm with the German police.

425
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:06,733
I knew Jean-Bernard's father,
Count de Voisins.

426
00:56:08,036 --> 00:56:09,435
A charming man.

427
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,738
He worried a great deal
about his son.

428
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:24,083
So you're a Jew.

429
00:56:30,225 --> 00:56:32,921
Monsieur Faure says
Jews are the enemies of France.

430
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:38,258
Not me.

431
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:53,680
Are you from Paris?

432
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,610
I was good at my work.

433
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,854
I had a good clientele.

434
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,792
Friends.

435
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,258
What do you want?

436
00:57:13,468 --> 00:57:15,993
I'm going shopping.
Let me have some money.

437
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,384
Aren't you going to introduce me?

438
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:34,018
My daughter, France.

439
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:37,123
Lacombe, Lucien.

440
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:39,721
Hurry up now.

441
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:42,885
See you later.

442
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:59,937
Monsieur Jean-Bernard told me
to collect the money you owe.

443
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:32,411
Tell Monsieur Jean-Bernard
that his father would be very sad

444
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:34,443
if he knew.

445
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,948
He was a real gentleman.

446
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:42,013
But what do I care?

447
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:43,407
Come with me.

448
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:56,193
- Stand in line like everyone else!
- Who do they think they are?

449
00:59:56,398 --> 00:59:59,128
Who does she think she is?

450
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:06,162
Kids today think
they can get away with anything!

451
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:10,834
Cutting in line, eh?
Aren't you going to say anything?

452
01:00:14,582 --> 01:00:17,050
I've been waiting an hour!
You think I'll stand for this?

453
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:18,913
German police!

454
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,281
To hell with the German police.

455
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,354
Aren't you going a bit far?

456
01:00:24,526 --> 01:00:26,153
What's going on here?

457
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,523
German police.

458
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,299
You work with Monsieur Tonin?

459
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:43,407
Sorry. I didn't know.

460
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:30,814
<i>Why do you keep talking about it?</i>
<i>I forgot it long ago.</i>

461
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:33,752
<i>It was only a year ago, my dear.</i>

462
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,556
<i>I've never understood why you did it.</i>

463
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:39,124
<i>You never tried to understand.</i>

464
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,758
<i>I loved him. It's very simple.</i>

465
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:46,566
<i>- And did he love you?</i>
<i>- Why not? What would you know?</i>

466
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:50,201
<i>After what he did?</i>

467
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,174
<i>You can't tell me he was a decent boy.</i>

468
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,177
<i>Papa, stop it, please!</i>
<i>You're getting on my nerves!</i>

469
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:09,520
Is Monsieur Horn in?

470
01:02:16,938 --> 01:02:18,997
What is it?
What do you want?

471
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:21,505
I've come to see your daughter.

472
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,886
Sit down, Monsieur Horn.

473
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,175
I suppose you'll be
joining us for dinner?

474
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:11,483
It's nice in here.
Not like outside.

475
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:02,004
I brought you a present.

476
01:04:05,947 --> 01:04:07,505
Champagne from Lossy.

477
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:10,110
Monsieur Jean-Bernard
says it's the best.

478
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:23,523
You like champagne, mademoiselle?

479
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:26,530
No, not tonight.

480
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:30,396
But of course you like champagne.

481
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,878
Bottoms up, granny.

482
01:05:30,098 --> 01:05:31,929
A toast, Monsieur Horn?

483
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,571
You should have some.

484
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:52,752
Your champagne is warm...

485
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:56,218
and it's a bad year, besides.

486
01:05:56,424 --> 01:05:59,086
France, this young man is a customer.

487
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,390
Forgive me,
but I've forgotten your name.

488
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:13,104
A nice name.

489
01:06:14,142 --> 01:06:17,339
And your name is Albert.

490
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:29,955
To your health...

491
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,292
my dear.

492
01:06:34,162 --> 01:06:35,595
My dear?

493
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:49,306
Are you happy
with your golf trousers?

494
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:54,815
Not really, Monsieur Horn.

495
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,130
Do you know Betty Beaulieu?

496
01:07:16,637 --> 01:07:18,434
Monsieur Jean-Bernard's friend.

497
01:07:23,578 --> 01:07:25,546
She was in <i>Night Raid.</i>

498
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,674
I don't know her.

499
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:37,223
More champagne?
Let's celebrate.

500
01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:38,892
No, really.

501
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:41,186
Come on, Albert.
It won't hurt you.

502
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:45,188
What are we celebrating exactly?

503
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,799
France, you should go to bed.

504
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:52,102
I forbid you to go to bed... my dear.

505
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:55,275
Why do you call me ' my dear"?

506
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:57,476
I don't know.

507
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:18,562
What did you do
before joining the police?

508
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,698
- I was studying.
- Studying what?

509
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,640
I could have you all arrested!

510
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:33,814
France, be quiet.

511
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:36,148
Are you afraid of him?

512
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:38,844
Yes, and he's right to be.

513
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,358
I'll get it.

514
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:56,870
<i>I'd like a word with you,</i>
<i>Monsieur Horn.</i>

515
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:58,398
Certainly.

516
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:26,891
You have funny hands.

517
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:32,033
<i>I might need the apartment.</i>

518
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,173
<i>Why should I do you a favor?</i>

519
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:36,172
But it's not fair.

520
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:41,178
Yes, it is.
I have every right to raise the rent.

521
01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:45,179
I'm taking quite a risk
having you here as it is.

522
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,151
Besides,
no one's forcing you to stay.

523
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,652
France isn't one big waiting room.

524
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:54,423
Very well, Monsieur Raverdy.

525
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:57,527
You know what Marshal Pétain says?

526
01:09:58,366 --> 01:09:59,890
Marshal Pétain?

527
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:02,832
Mr. Tonin calls him the Old Asshole!

528
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:05,571
- The Old Asshole?
- Very funny.

529
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:08,633
Is this gentleman your guest?

530
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:15,572
German police.

531
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,281
What's all this about?

532
01:10:22,823 --> 01:10:25,815
This young man is indeed
with the German police.

533
01:10:27,495 --> 01:10:28,985
Your papers.

534
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,958
Get out!

535
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:18,033
You entertain people
from the Gestapo now? Bravo!

536
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:15,694
Is that where your daughter sleeps?

537
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:19,402
Yes, it is.

538
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:23,008
Then we'd better whisper
so we don't wake her.

539
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:42,785
By the way, Albert...

540
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,723
your daughter's pretty.

541
01:12:49,803 --> 01:12:51,771
Why do you two fight?

542
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:55,633
We get along very well.

543
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,355
I didn't want to mention it
in front of her,

544
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,321
but I shot a guy the other day.

545
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:24,503
You know, you shouldn't always
believe Monsieur Jean-Bernard.

546
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,067
It isn't true
what he said about Spain.

547
01:13:29,043 --> 01:13:31,011
All he wants is your money.

548
01:13:32,846 --> 01:13:35,178
You think I don't know that?

549
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:12,815
Shit!

550
01:14:14,355 --> 01:14:16,346
They got the boss!

551
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,585
Christ, just my damn luck!

552
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:24,662
- You're not in too much pain?
- I hope it's not my lung.

553
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:26,298
Don't worry.

554
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:29,258
You got a drink?

555
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:35,308
I told you we should have left it
to the militia.

556
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:37,067
Hold on, boss.

557
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:57,427
- See you, guys!
- Good luck, kid!

558
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:23,019
What do you want?

559
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:44,042
They got my boss.

560
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:45,477
What?

561
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,476
Your friends shot my boss.

562
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:50,573
- What friends?
- The Bolsheviks!

563
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:01,489
May I see France?

564
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:07,386
Look, Albert.

565
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,519
War loot.

566
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,461
You should go to bed.

567
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:17,124
Long live France.

568
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:07,703
This is for you.

569
01:19:47,654 --> 01:19:49,952
Sad music, isn't it?

570
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:57,855
It's as if my whole life's been lived
in time to that music.

571
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,031
Papa, don't start again.

572
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:08,939
France is a gifted pianist.

573
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:15,408
She should have gone
to the conservatory. But then -

574
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,083
Please.

575
01:20:21,054 --> 01:20:22,919
I brought you some flowers.

576
01:20:30,197 --> 01:20:32,791
I've come to get your daughter.

577
01:20:35,535 --> 01:20:38,595
It's a going-away party
for Jean-Bernard and Betty.

578
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,835
I'd like to take France.

579
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:44,539
Are you crazy?

580
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:47,605
France is very tired.

581
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:56,579
If she doesn't come,
I'll take you to see my friends.

582
01:21:02,562 --> 01:21:05,827
And some of them
aren't too fond of Jews.

583
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:11,129
- I'm going.
- Stay here.

584
01:21:11,505 --> 01:21:13,234
I forbid you to go.

585
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,032
Come now, Papa.

586
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,913
Hurry up.
We're going to be late.

587
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,079
Come dance, Lucien.

588
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,749
I don't know how.

589
01:21:57,984 --> 01:21:59,542
You have to learn!

590
01:22:24,277 --> 01:22:25,869
That's very tiring.

591
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:33,949
I'm thirsty.

592
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,680
You dance very well.

593
01:22:40,861 --> 01:22:43,227
It's late.
I have to take you home.

594
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:57,976
You look bored.

595
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:00,542
May I have this dance?

596
01:23:14,227 --> 01:23:15,660
She's beautiful.

597
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:21,200
Say good-bye to Horn for me.

598
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:25,565
As for Spain,

599
01:23:25,939 --> 01:23:28,203
tell him I'm going in his place.

600
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:34,371
I'm not pleased about it.

601
01:23:50,497 --> 01:23:52,658
Some Jewish girls
are so very beautiful.

602
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,468
They make other women
look like old nags.

603
01:24:08,782 --> 01:24:10,943
I had a Jewish fiancée once.

604
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,515
Incredibly stacked and very rich.

605
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:17,583
What are you telling him?

606
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:20,182
Nothing, my dear.

607
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:05,328
You broke my heel.

608
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:34,228
You've had too much to drink.

609
01:25:35,835 --> 01:25:37,234
I'll take you home.

610
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,568
It's a shame you can't dance.

611
01:25:47,547 --> 01:25:49,105
I'll teach you.

612
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,598
Relax.

613
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:12,037
See? It's easy.

614
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:40,030
Bastard.

615
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:43,997
You bastard!

616
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:52,300
Aubert says she's a Jew.
She has no right coming here.

617
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,670
Filthy Jew!

618
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:07,925
So you're sleeping with a Jew.

619
01:27:09,162 --> 01:27:11,221
You think you'll get away with this?

620
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:15,064
I'm going to get the Germans
this minute!

621
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:17,932
Take it easy, Marie.
It's nothing.

622
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:21,306
Filthy Jew!
They all have syphilis!

623
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,972
You hear me?
She'll give it to you!

624
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:28,876
Let me go! I want to talk
to the filthy bitch!

625
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:31,812
She has no right!
Let me go!

626
01:28:36,216 --> 01:28:38,150
Marie is usually nice.

627
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:11,746
I can't stand it anymore.

628
01:29:12,652 --> 01:29:14,745
I'm tired of being a Jew.

629
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:37,694
<i>One last drink, Betty!</i>

630
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:40,161
<i>For the road!</i>

631
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:53,714
See you soon!

632
01:30:57,624 --> 01:31:00,559
To my friends! For the road!

633
01:31:01,227 --> 01:31:03,752
We'll send you some postcards.

634
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:43,798
My father has to get to Spain.

635
01:33:18,998 --> 01:33:20,329
You know...

636
01:33:21,634 --> 01:33:25,297
Italians are great on a bike,

637
01:33:26,038 --> 01:33:27,767
but I was never afraid of 'em.

638
01:33:28,741 --> 01:33:32,677
Even a champion like Bartali
didn't scare me.

639
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:39,585
You know the guys
who really shook me?

640
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:41,609
The Flemish!

641
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:47,659
You never saw Sylvère Maes race.

642
01:33:50,163 --> 01:33:52,427
<i>South of Caen,</i>

643
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:58,195
<i>numerous Anglo-Canadian attacks</i>
<i>have gained them some terrain.</i>

644
01:33:58,938 --> 01:34:03,204
<i>German troops</i>
<i>are putting up fierce resistance.</i>

645
01:34:41,447 --> 01:34:43,039
Get moving.

646
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,900
It's funny you can sew.

647
01:35:10,009 --> 01:35:12,034
It's usually women who sew.

648
01:35:21,487 --> 01:35:23,216
You won't talk to me?

649
01:36:21,847 --> 01:36:24,213
What would you say
if I married France?

650
01:36:32,058 --> 01:36:33,548
It's very strange.

651
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,227
Somehow I can't bring myself
to completely despise you.

652
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:51,668
There's someone
to see Monsieur Lacombe.

653
01:36:52,578 --> 01:36:54,307
His mother.

654
01:36:58,150 --> 01:36:59,913
She came to the hotel.

655
01:37:00,953 --> 01:37:02,818
I thought it best
to bring her here.

656
01:37:10,096 --> 01:37:11,791
He's very kind.

657
01:37:17,436 --> 01:37:18,733
Have a seat.

658
01:37:24,143 --> 01:37:26,805
Forgive me
for receiving you like this.

659
01:37:28,147 --> 01:37:30,945
Have you come a long way?
- From Souleillac.

660
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:34,208
Our village.

661
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:39,182
I came to town with Laborit
for the fair.

662
01:38:02,148 --> 01:38:03,979
Did you get the money orders?

663
01:38:11,624 --> 01:38:13,592
I brought you a chicken.

664
01:38:24,203 --> 01:38:25,727
Are you eating well?

665
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:41,746
This is Lucien's mother.

666
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:45,521
My daughter.

667
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:47,888
She's very pretty.

668
01:38:56,268 --> 01:38:59,669
I came to thank you for the money.

669
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,866
I don't want to bother anyone.

670
01:39:02,074 --> 01:39:05,043
But you're not.
Please sit down.

671
01:39:09,014 --> 01:39:10,777
You're not from around here?

672
01:39:13,252 --> 01:39:14,742
We're from Paris.

673
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:19,081
But life in Paris
is very difficult right now.

674
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,125
There's nothing to eat there.

675
01:39:26,532 --> 01:39:28,193
You're not French.

676
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,027
More or less.

677
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,568
My daughter is really French.

678
01:39:37,076 --> 01:39:39,067
Is she happy here?

679
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:41,839
Ask her.

680
01:39:44,517 --> 01:39:46,815
Lucien will have to show her around.

681
01:39:50,089 --> 01:39:52,057
Only he can't return to his village.

682
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:57,124
You know, Lucien worries me.

683
01:39:58,097 --> 01:39:59,462
And me too.

684
01:40:00,199 --> 01:40:02,258
But he's not a bad boy.

685
01:40:05,237 --> 01:40:08,502
You're a friend of Lucien's.
Perhaps you could reason with him.

686
01:40:09,308 --> 01:40:11,173
I'm not a friend of Lucien's.

687
01:40:17,249 --> 01:40:21,618
My daughter worries me too.
Very much.

688
01:40:24,557 --> 01:40:28,186
Don't you think we were better off
before the war?

689
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:47,004
- I'll see you off.
- No need.

690
01:40:48,314 --> 01:40:50,248
It's better if Laborit
doesn't see you.

691
01:40:52,484 --> 01:40:54,281
Look what I got.

692
01:41:07,933 --> 01:41:10,493
It's nothing.
We get them every day.

693
01:41:14,673 --> 01:41:16,368
They're going to kill you.

694
01:41:17,176 --> 01:41:18,643
Laborit says so.

695
01:41:19,712 --> 01:41:21,646
Why don't you get away from here?

696
01:41:25,251 --> 01:41:26,741
I like it here.

697
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,851
I'll miss my bus.

698
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,962
Wait.

699
01:42:32,952 --> 01:42:34,852
You should eat something, Papa.

700
01:42:36,588 --> 01:42:40,285
It's hard to have an appetite
when I have a whore for a daughter.

701
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:00,878
That wasn't nice, what you said.

702
01:43:06,685 --> 01:43:10,416
I think it's very rude
to call your daughter a whore.

703
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:14,085
You deserve a good thrashing.

704
01:43:14,893 --> 01:43:17,919
I don't need you to tell me
how to treat my daughter!

705
01:43:22,901 --> 01:43:25,301
France and I are very much alike.

706
01:43:28,574 --> 01:43:30,735
We're very fragile creatures.

707
01:43:59,538 --> 01:44:01,267
Forgive me, my dear.

708
01:44:09,815 --> 01:44:10,907
Leave me alone!

709
01:45:14,113 --> 01:45:16,809
<i>They let Monsieur Zweig's mother die.</i>

710
01:45:17,116 --> 01:45:19,016
<i>Fröhlich told me.</i>

711
01:45:19,518 --> 01:45:23,284
<i>Don't worry, Papa.</i>
<i>We'll get to Spain.</i>

712
01:45:23,489 --> 01:45:25,013
<i>Spain.</i>

713
01:45:25,224 --> 01:45:27,021
Spain doesn't exist.

714
01:45:27,226 --> 01:45:29,251
Be reasonable, Papa.

715
01:45:47,379 --> 01:45:48,744
Feeling better?

716
01:46:01,793 --> 01:46:03,624
You know, Monsieur Horn...

717
01:46:04,897 --> 01:46:06,728
I like you a lot.

718
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:17,370
- I'm sure we can get to Spain.
- Have they closed the borders?

719
01:46:17,576 --> 01:46:20,204
There are still some
unguarded spots.

720
01:46:23,081 --> 01:46:24,912
I'm going to bed.

721
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:26,640
Good night, my friends.

722
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:34,887
You know
your grandmother can't manage.

723
01:46:35,494 --> 01:46:37,724
There's no point
even talking about it.

724
01:46:38,964 --> 01:46:40,522
You're right.

725
01:46:40,966 --> 01:46:42,934
Besides, the war
will be over soon anyway.

726
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:48,297
It's true.
The Americans are already in Rouen.

727
01:47:47,065 --> 01:47:48,123
You went out?

728
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:50,392
I took a little walk.

729
01:47:51,703 --> 01:47:54,297
I haven't been out for so long.

730
01:47:57,576 --> 01:47:59,441
I feel like my old self.

731
01:48:06,718 --> 01:48:10,119
France says you could get us
across the border to Spain.

732
01:48:12,524 --> 01:48:13,582
Really?

733
01:48:19,164 --> 01:48:24,158
Lucien, I'd like to talk to you
man to man.

734
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:26,837
We've never talked.

735
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:29,007
What do you want to talk about?

736
01:48:29,308 --> 01:48:30,741
France.

737
01:48:31,743 --> 01:48:34,576
I don't have time.
I have to get to work.

738
01:48:59,604 --> 01:49:01,196
They really got him.

739
01:49:03,942 --> 01:49:06,206
I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a shower.

740
01:49:14,052 --> 01:49:17,215
Lucien, this gentleman
is here to see you.

741
01:49:17,422 --> 01:49:19,652
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

742
01:49:19,858 --> 01:49:23,021
I've been chatting with your friend.
He's very nice.

743
01:49:23,929 --> 01:49:25,226
Another round?

744
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:26,897
You're crazy!

745
01:49:27,265 --> 01:49:29,495
I came to talk to you.

746
01:49:29,968 --> 01:49:31,697
Things can't go on like this.

747
01:49:31,903 --> 01:49:34,963
You just can't help
acting like an ass!

748
01:49:35,741 --> 01:49:37,766
Come on.
I'm taking you home.

749
01:49:41,646 --> 01:49:43,807
- Who's this?
- A friend.

750
01:49:47,753 --> 01:49:49,516
Horn? Isn't he the Jew?

751
01:49:50,922 --> 01:49:53,254
You bring Jews
to the hotel bar now?

752
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:56,188
Forgive him.
He's young.

753
01:49:58,363 --> 01:50:00,558
I'll see you in my office.

754
01:50:08,273 --> 01:50:10,104
Show me your papers.

755
01:50:23,889 --> 01:50:28,383
What's this? ' Jean-François Rivière.
Born in Paris, July 30, 1892."

756
01:50:29,895 --> 01:50:31,988
De Voisins got this for you.

757
01:50:32,497 --> 01:50:33,896
Precisely.

758
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:39,166
I want to see an ID
with ' Jew" written on it.

759
01:50:45,977 --> 01:50:48,411
All I have is a calling card.

760
01:50:57,989 --> 01:50:59,718
Last name: Horn.

761
01:51:02,694 --> 01:51:05,527
First name: Albert.

762
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:13,970
Place of birth?

763
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:17,170
- Szekesfehervar.
- What?

764
01:51:19,244 --> 01:51:22,111
Why don't you just put Toulouse?

765
01:51:24,683 --> 01:51:25,809
Address?

766
01:51:26,785 --> 01:51:30,186
52 rue Pierre Premier
de Serbie, Paris.

767
01:51:35,961 --> 01:51:37,485
Nationality?

768
01:51:38,363 --> 01:51:39,955
French.

769
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,792
Didn't anyone ever tell you
yids can't be French?

770
01:51:46,137 --> 01:51:47,570
On occasion.

771
01:51:48,473 --> 01:51:52,034
To me a Jew is like a rat.
No more, no less.

772
01:51:53,044 --> 01:51:54,306
Really?

773
01:51:55,347 --> 01:51:56,780
They breed like crazy.

774
01:51:57,516 --> 01:51:59,006
There's more and more of 'em.

775
01:51:59,651 --> 01:52:01,846
- I can leave, if you like.
- Stay there.

776
01:52:02,187 --> 01:52:05,384
I'm calling the <i>Kommandantur.</i>
You can explain to them.

777
01:52:07,325 --> 01:52:09,759
Why do you speak to me
in that tone?

778
01:52:22,374 --> 01:52:25,036
We didn't get to talk about France.

779
01:52:26,444 --> 01:52:28,412
She was asleep when I left.

780
01:52:30,515 --> 01:52:32,380
What I wanted to tell you -

781
01:52:32,584 --> 01:52:36,611
Guess what, my friend.
I have a Jew in my office.

782
01:52:53,872 --> 01:52:55,499
Open up!

783
01:53:00,745 --> 01:53:02,269
Old witch!

784
01:53:33,278 --> 01:53:35,906
They put him on a train to Toulouse.

785
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:41,047
I don't know
where they're taking them.

786
01:53:47,192 --> 01:53:48,420
It's his own fault.

787
01:53:48,627 --> 01:53:50,254
Shut up!

788
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,670
You bastard!

789
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:17,470
<i>I'm a soldier like you,</i>
<i>fighting for my country!</i>

790
01:55:17,682 --> 01:55:20,116
<i>I demand to be treated</i>
<i>like a soldier!</i>

791
01:55:40,438 --> 01:55:42,201
Go up and guard that guy.

792
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,369
I'll be with those gentlemen.

793
01:55:44,576 --> 01:55:47,101
You still have the strength to work?

794
01:55:47,545 --> 01:55:48,876
More than ever.

795
01:55:54,419 --> 01:55:55,977
Bear up, kid.

796
01:57:16,968 --> 01:57:18,629
How old are you, kid?

797
01:57:24,042 --> 01:57:26,033
So you're working for the Germans?

798
01:57:28,279 --> 01:57:30,179
A young Frenchman like you.

799
01:57:33,585 --> 01:57:34,950
Aren't you ashamed?

800
01:57:42,193 --> 01:57:44,218
I don't like people
talking down to me.

801
01:58:06,417 --> 01:58:09,511
Stop acting smart, kid!
You know they're gonna shoot you?

802
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,669
You don't look like a thug.

803
01:58:38,783 --> 01:58:40,011
Listen.

804
01:58:43,554 --> 01:58:45,215
I'll give you a chance.

805
01:58:46,457 --> 01:58:49,017
Take off these handcuffs
and I'll take you with me.

806
01:58:49,861 --> 01:58:51,158
Understand?

807
01:59:06,711 --> 01:59:08,702
I don't like people
talking down to me.

808
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:58,620
<i>Hurry up!</i>

809
02:00:38,169 --> 02:00:41,104
Get me the <i>Kommandantur.</i>

810
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:38,192
You may take a small suitcase
or knapsack.

811
02:01:38,396 --> 02:01:40,296
Only personal effects.

812
02:01:40,832 --> 02:01:44,893
No food, no books, no money.

813
02:01:45,837 --> 02:01:47,031
Hurry up.

814
02:01:47,338 --> 02:01:48,566
- But -
- Hurry up.

815
02:01:48,773 --> 02:01:52,641
You're not alone.
I still have lots of names on my list.

816
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:59,111
There's been a serious incident.

817
02:02:12,396 --> 02:02:13,863
Hurry up.

818
02:02:56,207 --> 02:02:57,834
Monsieur Lacombe,

819
02:02:58,709 --> 02:03:00,700
you work for the German police.

820
02:03:01,045 --> 02:03:03,809
There are no thieves
in the German police.

821
02:03:04,148 --> 02:03:06,116
Give me that watch.

822
02:04:06,377 --> 02:04:08,106
I'm staying with her.

823
02:04:47,618 --> 02:04:49,245
Where are we going?

824
02:04:50,054 --> 02:04:51,248
I don't know.

825
02:04:52,923 --> 02:04:53,821
Spain.

826
02:05:05,903 --> 02:05:07,165
Damn it!

827
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:48,765
- What did she say?
- There's a card missing.

828
02:16:28,585 --> 02:16:33,249
Lucien Lacombe was arrested
on October 12, 1944.

829
02:16:33,857 --> 02:16:36,519
He was tried
by a military court of the Resistance,

830
02:16:36,827 --> 02:16:40,763
sentenced to death and executed.

831
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,086
