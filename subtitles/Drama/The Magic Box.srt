18
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.950
Bai Ze!

19
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.540
- Hey!
- Hey! Bai Ze!
- Bai Ze!

20
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.290
One's body, hair, and skin were given by one's parents.

21
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.650
You want us to kill ourselves.

22
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.790
I can't do it!

23
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.980
If you are able, kill me!

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.100
What did you say?

25
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.440
I said for you to kill me!

26
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.990
Bai Ze!

27
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.820
- Bai...
- It's fine.

28
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.580
Don't worry. It will be fine. I can control the situation.

29
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.770
This is what you asked for.

30
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.670
I gave you a chance to kill yourself but you refused it.

31
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.280
Then don't blame me if you will be in heart rendering pain under my sickle.

32
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.380
I have grown to this age but never really felt heart rendering pain.

33
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.510
Just let me feel it then.

34
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.320
Die!

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.920
Bring it on.

36
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.290
I'm fine.

37
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.280
Huh?

38
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.190
Eh?

39
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620
- You are fine, right? 
 - I'm fine.

40
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.600
He is just a hallucination.

41
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.810
That's why he really can't kill us.

42
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.980
Only we can kill ourselves.

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.340
Then was I almost tricked by him earlier in committing suicide?

44
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.100
And also, only a person like you will get scared like that.

45
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.780
So embarrassing.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.360
Hmp! You all actually saw through it.

47
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.060
You are Bai Ze, right?

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.850
I have a letter here that your father, Bai De Ming, left before he died.

49
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.450
I'll give it to you then.

50
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.610
Don't take it!

51
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.790
Could it be that you don't want to see

52
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.230
what words your father left you?

53
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.590
Don't believe him, Bai Ze.

54
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.530
Have you forgotten? When we were in the Royal Tomb,

55
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.230
Luan Jia exactly used this kind of trick to lure everyone to release her.

56
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.060
In here, the trap she loves to use the most is to let people unable to resist temptations

57
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.600
and take the initiative to release her.

58
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.900
That's right.

59
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.760
You rascal, just you wait!

60
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.340
- He's gone.
- Hey, if Bai Ze touched that letter, what would have happened?

61
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.520
I don't know, either.

62
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.310
Maybe his soul would have gotten stolen by him and gotten locked up.

63
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.280
It is also possible that nothing would've happened.

64
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.380
Zhan Xiong Fei, how did you know that this was a trap?

65
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.870
I don't know, either. Maybe an intuition.

66
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.240
Enough already. Stop feeling so happy about it.

67
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.100
If you ask me, it must be because you are so used to tricking and swindling others

68
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.890
that you give no attention to these little tricks.

69
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.540
You are the one who tricks and swindles. I was just able to see through it.

70
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.860
How come you are like this?

71
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.350
I am just like this, so what?

72
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.440
You are even answering back? If you are able, then hit me.

73
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.350
- Hmp!
- How can I dare to hit you?

74
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.110
You haven't even accepted my request yet.

75
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.310
- Accept what? 
 - Accept what?

76
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.270
Accept to be my--

77
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.610
I'll tell you guys later.

78
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.590
Oh...

79
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.630
Let's go.

80
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.120
- I can't walk anymore. I want to drink some water. 
 - Hold on for a little while longer.

81
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.680
- We will be there soon. 
 - I don't even have the energy to talk anymore.

82
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.670
Maybe there is something to eat in front.

83
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.330
It won't help either if we keep sitting here.

84
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.400
- Hurry and move. 
 - Let's go. Hold on for a little while more.

85
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.970
So tired.

86
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.980
- I can't move anymore.
 - Hold on.

87
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.390
Can't move anymore!

88
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.610
I don't want to walk anymore.

89
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.010
Zi Su...

90
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.320
Just sleep.

91
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.550
Once you are asleep, you won't be able to wake up again.

92
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.480
Stop right there!

93
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.940
Laughing Netherworld?

94
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.900
How come it's you again?

95
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.310
You... How come you are awake again?

96
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.570
Could it be that you are a descendant of Master Luan Jia?

97
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.690
Hey, Zhan Xiong Fei, hurry and wake up!

98
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.560
We were tricked by Laughter Netherworld!

99
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.720
Bai Ze, wake up. Bai Ze!

100
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.640
Yuan Shuai. Yuan Shua! Wake up!

101
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.780
Wake up, Zi Su! Zi Su!

102
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.400
Are you very anxious right now?

103
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.620
If anything bad happens to them, I will...

104
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.590
Stop wasting your energy.

105
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.690
Just you? You will never be able to hit me.

106
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.020
But I will also show you some mercy.

107
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.130
I'll give you one chance to change fate.

108
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.660
This way, you don't need to fall

109
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.750
into an endless void like them.

110
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.470
The method is also very easy.

111
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.200
You change it by yourself.

112
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.530
Can you see this?

113
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.280
This book is all inclusive.

114
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.810
Everyone's fates are inside it.

115
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.110
Right now, no need for money or your life.

116
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.160
I'll let you change it for free.

117
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.100
Just once.

118
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.280
Look at it.

119
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.370
After looking at it, you will know your fate just like them.

120
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.700
Look at it.

121
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.210
After looking at it, you will know your fate just like them.

122
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.970
You actually want to bewitch me.

123
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.640
Hey... This... How come this didn't work on you?

124
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.330
This book has no effect on me.

125
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.750
But it seems to be very useful to you.

126
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.770
Hey, Miss!  You... don't touch it.

127
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.410
This book is quite dangerous.

128
00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.650
It can suddenly explode. Put it down first.

129
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.690
It was you who threw this to me.

130
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.030
Just put it down first. We can amicably discuss things.

131
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.910
There's nothing to discuss.

132
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.500
Hurry and let my friends wake up from their dreams!

133
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.340
They can't immediately wake up just because I let them wake up.

134
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.130
Put it down first. Let's talk about other things first.

135
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.260
Do you have dreams?

136
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.550
Dreams?

137
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.940
Stop your nonsense.

138
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.490
If you won't change it for me, I'll change it by myself.

139
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.000
Don't. Don't. Don't. Those were just things made up by me.

140
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.960
If I really can change them, then how come I didn't change mine first?

141
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.830
Just put it down first.

142
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.770
We can discuss things amicably.

143
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.260
If you won't change it, then I'll tear it.

144
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.890
Don't!

145
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.000
Ha? Ha!

146
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.150
Don't...

147
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.910
Don't...

148
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.370
Don't stop? Sure.

149
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.570
Not don't stop.

150
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.670
Stop! Stop!

151
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.090
When did I become Ting*?
(* means stop in Chinese.)

152
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.580
Don't! I know that your name isn't Ting Ting.

153
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.310
Don't tear! Don't tear it anymore!

154
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.000
Don't tear it anymore!

155
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.510
M-My life is already this hard.

156
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.180
How come you are still bullying me?

157
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.150
What I said is all true.

158
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.650
Hundreds of years ago, I was also like you all; a sincere youth.

159
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.710
The me that time was very optimistic, worked hard to learn,

160
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.190
focused on getting achievements and fame.

161
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.440
I only wished that one day, I can top the civil examination

162
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.370
and do some achievements for my family and the country.

163
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.170
But I never thought that corrupt officials were rampant and oppressive.

164
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.130
They switched my exam answers

165
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.380
and gave it to a descendant of the Prime Minister.

166
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.250
So pitiful.

167
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.800
Telling a story?

168
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.580
Don't tear.

169
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.720
I am talking about myself.

170
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.470
Afterwards, I hid inside the mountains.

171
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.130
I thought about this from all angles and read books as my companion every day.

172
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:11.090
I read the Book of Changes and the Chinese Prophecy Book to research on the truth of the world

173
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.490
and these philosophies.

174
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.550
Do you really think I am illiterate?

175
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.300
Don't tear!

176
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.980
I subsequently spent several days thinking from all angles.

177
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.690
Finally one day, I reached enlightenment.

178
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.690
Hence, I took up my pen and paper

179
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.470
then predicted and wrote the destiny of the citizens of the world.

180
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.810
At this time, a monster suddenly appeared in front of me.

181
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.960
He had a very fierce and ugly appearance and he took me away

182
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.810
to write books of praises for him to be distributed to the world.

183
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.230
My conscience made me refuse him.

184
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.560
He then took me away and placed me in a bitter cold hell

185
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.490
until Master Luan Jia came to save me.

186
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.420
You say, isn't my... my life very hard?

187
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.420
Enough already. Stop talking.

188
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.030
Can you make my friends wake up or not?

189
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.780
Why is my life this hard?!

190
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.020
How come a distinguished Death Deity is crying now?

191
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.660
Wh-Why can't I cry?

192
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.180
I am also human.

193
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.530
Oh, right. I am not human.

194
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.140
Even if I am not human, I also have feelings and desires. I can also cry!

195
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.950
Don't cry now.

196
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.980
Are you saving my friends or not?

197
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.590
Yes. Yes. Okay. I have a solution. I have a solution.

198
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.120
You have to return the book to me first.

199
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.940
Give it to me. Give it to me.

200
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.230
Return it to me first before I can save them.

201
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.300
- Give it to me...
 - What are you doing? Let go.

202
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.410
- Give it to me...
- What are you doing?!

203
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.610
- Let go.
 - Give...You give it to me...

204
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800
- Laughing Netherworld.
 - Huh?

205
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.400
Look at what this is.

206
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.900
<i>[Laughing Netherworld]</i>

207
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.300
Miss, are you really going to make all of us perish?

208
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.800
- A Ji Ya!
- A Ji Ya!

209
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.000
- Are you alright? 
 - Are you all alright?

210
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.800
What happened?

211
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.000
We all got bewitched by Laughing Netherworld.

212
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.400
- It's him again.
 - Where is he then?

213
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.000
It's a long story. I'll tell you all about it later.

214
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.700
Look. What is that?

215
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.000
Let's go inside and take a look. Let's go.

216
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:21.000
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Magic Stars Team @ Viki.com</i>

217
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.600
Welcome to the Icy Snow Castle.

218
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.200
I never thought that you were able to get through all four levels.

219
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.900
You really are good.

220
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.410
Stop pretending to be good.

221
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.970
Whether true or not is fine.

222
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.900
What can you all do to me?

223
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.600
That was just a test given to you by an imaginary world

224
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.800
while the real me is in front of you all.

225
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.700
What can you really do to me?

226
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.000
The Icy Babel Tower will soon be fixed.

227
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.400
By that time, I can go defend myself to Supreme God.

228
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.400
Let him know the crimes of you humans

229
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.000
and give me back justice. When that time comes,

230
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.500
all three worlds will walk into destruction with me.

231
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.800
Luan Jia,

232
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.400
to tell you the truth, I sincerely pity you.

233
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.000
I won't fall for that trick of yours. Just drop it.

234
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.800
How about this instead? If you can make me laugh,

235
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.900
I will let you all go.

236
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.160
I think that even the funniest joke

237
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.900
will not be able to make the corner of your mouth go up.

238
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.200
The reason that I pity you is because you can only see the weakness of humans.

239
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.600
You cannot see the good thing about being human.

240
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.400
Shut up.

241
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.000
Humans all know that deities should love them.

242
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.230
I really don't understand.

243
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.200
An individual like you who destroys the world and plunges people into misery,

244
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200
what right do you have to call yourself a deity?

245
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.400
I told you to shut up!

246
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.700
- Zi Su! 
 - Older Bro Fei!

247
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.000
If my guess is right, you also loved this land once.

248
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.600
You also loved a man before, Emperor You Ran.

249
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.200
Don't say it anymore!

250
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.800
In the past, you and Emperor You Ran were so in love.

251
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.400
I never thought that just because of the Magic Stars, you made a grave mistake

252
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600
and suffered punishment from Heaven.

253
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.600
That's why the legends were all true?

254
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.000
The Emperor told me that the 9-winter disorder of the royal descendants is this kind of symptom.

255
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
It was contracted because of this skeleton

256
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.800
and unable to be cured for thousands of years.

257
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.400
These were all what Emperor You Ran deserved.

258
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.000
That time, I went through hardships to steal the Magic Stars for him.

259
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But in the end, what? Just because of individual selfish interest,

260
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.200
he used the power of the Magic Stars to bring disaster to the world.

261
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.200
Aren't these all grudges thousands of years ago?

262
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.300
Haven't you thought that since so many years have passed,

263
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.560
why not letting yourself off and just forget about him?

264
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.920
I also wanted to forget him.

265
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.500
But he is like a spirit that's always by my side.

266
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.400
As time goes by, the torment lasts longer.

267
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.400
Even if you can't forget him, you should have at least forgiven him.

268
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.300
Forgive?

269
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.670
He never even said sorry.

270
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.230
How am I supposed to forgive?

271
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.700
Tell me, how can I forgive him?

272
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.200
Okay. I will bear the consequences.

273
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.100
- A Ji Ya! 
 - A Ji Ya! 
 - Don't.

274
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Since I am the descendant of Emperor You Ran and you can't forgive him,

275
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.700
just let me die for my ancestor to pay for his crimes.

276
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.600
What are you doing?!

277
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.100
Little Jia.

278
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.000
Emperor You Ran.

279
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.080
Little Jia,

280
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.930
sorry.

281
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.900
It's really you.

282
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.000
Forgive my betrayal one thousand years ago.

283
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.640
I continued to be punished by Heaven and sealed inside the skeleton.

284
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.700
I have been repenting for a thousand years.

285
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.300
I pray to get Heaven's forgiveness.

286
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.800
But the thing I want to get the most is your forgiveness.

287
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.800
After all, a thousand years have passed.

288
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.800
All of these are debts I made, I should be the one to pay for them.

289
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.600
It's really you.

290
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.400
You left just because you wanted to.

291
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.700
You betrayed me just like that.

292
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.100
And now, you even want to beg for my forgiveness.

293
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.800
Very soon... I will use the divine power of the five Magic Stars

294
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.200
to destroy that so called Heaven and Earth,

295
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.500
and you will witness all of these things.

296
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.000
I will let you admit that I am right.

297
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.000
Little Jia, why must you do this?

298
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.600
Why must you decide for everyone's fate on behalf of Heaven?

299
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.000
You will be punished for this.

300
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.300
I already have been punished.

301
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.600
I had enough.

302
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.300
Today, I will decide everything.

303
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.150
Previously, I, Luan Jia, was so in love with you

304
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.580
but your heart was with the world.

305
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.200
In the end, you got what you wanted; obtained the world and

306
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.400
became the human's emperor. But what about now?

307
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.590
Look at now. Won't the world soon still be plunged into chaos?

308
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600
I know that I was wrong.

309
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.640
But when I self examined my fault,

310
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.000
everything was already too late.

311
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.600
Little Jia, stop now.

312
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.600
I don't want you to become like me in the future;

313
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.400
regretting, suffering, being in non-stop anxiety.

314
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.010
You're wrong.

315
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.510
I don't plan to live to begin with.

316
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.200
After I destroy this world,

317
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.300
I, Luan Jia, will also cease to exist.

318
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.290
Then just let those people go.

319
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.800
Could it be that you really are this heartless?

320
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.550
Put it down.

321
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.000
Until now, you are still helping them.

322
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.400
While you haven't made a grave mistake yet, hurry and stop this.

323
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.200
Never.

324
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.100
If you dare to stop me again,

325
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.000
I won't spare you, either.

326
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.240
Must you really do this?

327
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.100
Weren't you this resolute in refusing me back then?

328
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.760
Little Jia, if you give up in destroying the world,

329
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.940
I will stay by your side forever. Never betraying you.

330
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.600
At this step,

331
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.500
can we still... still continue our past love?

332
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.990
Little Jia...

333
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.200
Luan Jia!

334
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.600
You devil! You actually used ice and snow to seal the whole capital.

335
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.800
And then next, you used the Snow Spots Disease to cause trouble.

336
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.900
I will let your body shatter!

337
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.000
Qian Yi Shou, I am going to kill you!

338
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.170
Little Jia.

339
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.400
Emperor You Ran!

340
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.000
Emperor You Ran.

341
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.140
Little Jia,

342
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.000
I know that you have forgiven me.

343
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.050
Yes.

344
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.530
Don't talk anymore.

345
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.600
I won't let you leave me.

346
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.900
What should I do?

347
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.400
If I can be allowed to return

348
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.800
to the time I saw you for the first time,

349
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.800
I will re-choose

350
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.800
to give up fighting for the Magic Stars, and

351
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.200
give up in battling to rule the world.

352
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.100
I just want to stay by your side.

353
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.400
Ma Da Dao! Wake up! Are you crazy now?! It's me!

354
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.200
After 1,000 years,

355
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.430
I thought I had already let everything go.

356
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200
Right now, what I can be sure of is...

357
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.700
I want to be with you.

358
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.300
Magic Stars?

359
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Thank you, Teen Heaven Strategy Envoys.

360
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.300
Zhan Xiong Fei, I'm leaving the Magic Stars to you to protect the Emperor.

361
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.700
This is also my main reason for stealing the Magic Stars from the start.

362
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.300
- A Ji Ya! 
 - A Ji Ya!

363
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.600
A Ji Ya, are you alright?

364
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.140
Where is this?

365
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.400
- Why am I here? 
 - Why am I here?

366
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.200
- Why did you hit me? 
 <i>- What happened?</i>

367
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.400
Why did you hit me?

368
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.000
You are conscious now.

369
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.600
I still find it a bit unbelievable. This Luan Jia still wanted to destroy the world a while ago.

370
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.100
Right now, she just suddenly disappeared.

371
00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.000
I think that maybe she can now be with Emperor You Ran forever like she always wanted.

372
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.580
She finally was able to find her faith back.

373
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.300
That's way more important than living.

374
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.500
Did I... see love earlier?

375
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.090
I'll go get the Magic Stars.

376
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.400
- Xiong Fei! 
 - Zhan Xiong Fei!

377
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.800
- Xiong Fei!
 - Older Bro Fei!

378
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.900
Xiong Fei, are you alright?

379
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.400
Fellow Heaven Strategy Envoys, I'm going to pick this ready-made treasure now.

380
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.600
And also, I'm going to do another good thing. That is to send you all to your death!

381
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.800
Lord!

382
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800
This place will be collapsing soon! Hurry and escape!

383
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.000
Don't run!

384
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.400
Lord, here!

385
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.200
Hurry!

386
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.500
Buddy... Buddy...

387
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.200
Buddy, come out.

388
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.200
Go. Go.

389
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.400
Go...

390
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.700
I can't leave anymore.

391
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.200
Qian Xun is a good woman,

392
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.900
but I don't have that fate.

393
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.600
You must treat her well.

394
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.300
The person she is waiting for is you.

395
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.400
You never were a chivalrous person.

396
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.400
I really want to hit you!

397
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.600
Go!

398
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.300
- Ma Da Dao...
 - Leave...

399
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.400
Qian Xun is still waiting for us to go back and drink wine with her.

400
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Being able to meet her in this lifetime is a blessing I earned from my past life.

401
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.900
You must treat her well.

402
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.300
Or else...

403
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.100
I will not let you go even as a ghost.

404
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.400
What are you saying?!

405
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.580
Let's go.

406
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.000
- I won't leave! I can't leave him! 
 - Ma Da Dao!

407
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.500
- Ma Da Dao!
 - No!
 - It will collapse soon!

408
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.000
Ma Da Dao!

409
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.800
- I don't want to! 
 - If we still don't leave, it will be too late!

410
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.900
- Go now! Ma Da Dao! 
 - Leave.

411
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.200
- Go! 
 - I can't leave!

412
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.700
- Qian Yi Shou! 
 - Hurry and go, Ma Da Dao!

413
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.800
<i>Qian Yi Shou! I'm not leaving!</i>

414
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.200
<i>I'm not leaving! I want to die with him!</i>

415
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:31.900
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Magic Stars Team @ Viki.com</i>

416
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.910
- Zha Bu Ha! 
 - Gu Li!

417
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.100
Gu Li!

418
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.200
You are finally back.

419
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.960
How are you? Are you doing well?

420
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.400
How were you able to return?

421
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.000
Good thing A Ji Ya and her friends destroyed the Icy Snow Castle.

422
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.800
I then had a chance to escape.

423
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.800
- Gu Li! 
 - Let's not separate anymore forever.

424
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.600
We will not separate forever.

425
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.200
Eunuch Cao, it's really great.

426
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.900
It must be that the Heaven Strategy Envoys were able to eliminate that cold devil Luan Jia.

427
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.830
Congratulations, Your Majesty! Heaven really was watching.

428
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.600
The citizens can be saved.

429
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.600
Once Bai Ze and the others return, I must really reward them.

430
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.000
Your Majesty,

431
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.600
this demon youth Zhan Xiong Fei...

432
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.000
Eunuch Cao,

433
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.200
stop gossiping in front of me next time.

434
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.800
One must be straightforward and upright.

435
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.200
I dare not.

436
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.200
The sealing of the capital previously by ice snow really woke me up.

437
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.600
Zhan Xiong Fei detests evil and dares to take responsibility just like Bai Ze.

438
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.100
Just to get the Magic Stars, he almost died numerous times.

439
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.800
Then tell me, is Zhan Xiong Fei being from the demon or human clan still important?

440
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.720
That's right. Since time immemorial, heroes comes from the youth.

441
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.400
One doesn't need to ask their whereabouts.

442
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.600
Their background is naturally not important, not important.

443
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.640
- Don't move! 
 - What are you doing?

444
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.800
Are you trying to revolt?

445
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.400
How dare you all!

446
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400
Men!

447
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.200
Stop shouting already!

448
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.200
Old thing, hello.

449
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.300
Just those measly imperial guards of yours, they all have been bribed by my Lord.

450
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.400
Ding Song, you... you are publicly revolting?

451
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.000
You are making it sound so bad.

452
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.100
I just want Emperor to cooperate with me in completing a huge endeavor.

453
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.600
Do what endeavor?

454
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.720
Actually, very easy. I just want to see your head.

455
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.800
Ding Song, you old traitor!! I'll fight with you!

456
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.700
Eunuch Cao! Eunuch Cao!

457
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.800
Let an old thing like you taste how it feels to be frozen, too.

458
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.000
Lord, I think this damn Emperor will surely be unwilling to submit to you.

459
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.700
I so want to see how a distinguished Emperor dies.

460
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.000
Lord, I have 100 ways to kill him.

461
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.800
Emperor, do you still have any questions?

462
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.190
Don't be too happy yet.

463
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.000
The Heaven Strategy Envoys will come to save me.

464
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.800
Or course.

465
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.000
How can I not let those teens accompany Your Majesty

466
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.300
to go to the afterlife?

467
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.300
- Take him! 
 - Tie him!

468
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.500
Your Majesty, look.

469
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.400
Does this imperial robe suit me?

470
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.330
Traitor, just you?

471
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.000
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at by the world?

472
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.820
I'll give you some advice.

473
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.100
You won't be able to stably occupy this kingdom.

474
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.000
What you said is quite reasonable.

475
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.510
Forget it.

476
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.740
If you ask me, it's fine not to sit on this throne.

477
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.330
Do you think I really want to compete with you for this emperor's throne?

478
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.180
You said that the world will laugh at me?

479
00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.600
Let me tell. I am here to conquer them.

480
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.060
I am going to use the power of the magic stars to open the gates to the demon world.

481
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.600
By that time, the mortal world will become a huge slave world

482
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.000
and I will be this world's master.

483
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.100
Don't be rash.

484
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.250
If you go out like this, it will also not provide any help.

485
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.800
Leave with me first and then let's think of a way.

486
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.600
Let's go.

487
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.170
You're wrong.

488
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.200
The world has chivalrous and just people.

489
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.350
No one will submit to you.

490
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.600
Someone will naturally stand out to resist you until the end!

491
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.900
That's why, I don't mind killing half of the people in this world.

492
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.600
Traitor!!

493
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.380
The hearts of people are confused and dirty anyway.

494
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.700
It should be cleansed already.

495
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.400
My Emperor,

496
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.600
just lessen your words.

497
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.800
I'll have to trouble you to bask in the sun and get blown by the wind here.

498
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.200
Suffer hunger and cold, and suffer pain

499
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.700
until your Heaven Strategy Envoys come to save you.

500
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.600
You will then be released from your suffering.

501
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.800
You two... are you trying to make me your bait?

502
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.200
I already told you that I surely will let that group of Teen Heaven Strategy Envoy

503
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.000
accompany you to the afterlife.

504
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.700
Traitor!

505
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.700
Your Majesty, hurry and use this chance to look at this wonderful scenery.

506
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.000
After three days, by noontime, I will send you to your death.

507
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.200
Zhan Xiong Fei! Yuan Shuai!

508
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.800
Thirteenth Older Sis!

509
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.220
You guys are back.

510
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.400
Something huge has happened to the capital.

511
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.000
Ding Song is back.

512
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.030
Ding Song is back, isn't he?

513
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.000
What really happened in the capital?

514
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.100
Ding Song arrested His Majesty and placed him in the public square.

515
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.800
He wants to execute him.

516
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.300
Huh?

517
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Oh, right. Where is Zhan Xiong Fei and Zi Su?

518
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.600
They are both inside.

519
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.600
Don't say so much anymore. Let's hurry and discuss how to save His Majesty.

520
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.200
Let's go.

521
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.300
Oh, right.

522
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.610
Where is Qian Yi Shou?

523
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.140
How come I didn't see Qian Yi Shou?

524
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.670
You will never see him again.

525
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.640
He pushed me away and saved me.

526
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.600
But he instead got toppled over by an ice post and suffered grave injuries.

527
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.600
My life was given by him,

528
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.600
but he himself didn't survive at the end.

529
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.800
He's dead.

530
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.800
Are you saying he's dead? Are you saying he's dead?!

531
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.200
What else did he say?

532
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.700
Did he mention me?

533
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.800
He said that in this life time, he only loved you.

534
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.200
And also,

535
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.690
he asked me to take care of you.

536
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.800
Hey, isn't it not good for us to be here?

537
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.400
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

538
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.400
- Do you have an idea already? 
 - No.

539
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.800
But I feel that we can find something here.

540
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.300
My older bro has already been tied in the public square for one whole day.

541
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.600
Let's just make our move during the night.

542
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.000
No. Ding Song is very scheming.

543
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
He surely placed ambushes in the public square.

544
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.800
No matter if we go during daytime or nighttime,

545
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.400
as long as we go, we surely will just be walking into his trap.

546
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.200
Then... Then what should we do?

547
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.720
Ding Song has controlled the whole capital.

548
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.400
He surely has assigned guards around the public square.

549
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.880
How could that be?

550
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.800
Those imperial guards used to be very loyal subjects.

551
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.000
How could they be following Ding Song's orders now?

552
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.400
Right now, there are only a few people left in this world who has faith.

553
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.410
They only listen to the strong one.

554
00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.300
Ding Song has already obtained the five Magic Stars. He is already unrivaled.

555
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.410
Zi Su, we cannot face him head on.

556
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.300
Bai Ze, can this wooden bird fly?

557
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.200
Of course, it can.

558
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.550
Can you make a huge one overnight?

559
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.610
You were thinking in the same direction as me.

560
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.200
I'll go look for materials.

561
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.600
I'll go, too.

562
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.200
I'll go, too.

563
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.800
Lord, it's already noon time.

564
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.400
Ma Shun, let me make a bet with you.

565
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.800
Guess from what direction those kids will come from.

566
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.190
Lord, I dare not make this bet with you.

567
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.800
Because if I do, you surely will lose.

568
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.600
I am guessing that those rascals Zhan Xiong Fei and his friends have died inside the Ice Bound Valley.

569
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.400
Or else, how come after leaking the news for three days, we haven't seen even their shadow?

570
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.600
Even if they are still alive, they surely have gone home to drink milk.

571
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.800
Your Majesty, did you hear that?

572
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.800
I am afraid that the Teen  Heaven Strategy Envoys that you are putting too much of your hopes on

573
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.700
have forgotten you, their master.

574
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.500
Lord, the prisoner is gone.

575
