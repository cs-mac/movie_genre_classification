Ellen!

2
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,207
Yes, Miss Fiske.
- Is there any mail for me?

3
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,449
No, just this one letter.

4
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,580
No sign of Bates yet?
- Not yet.

5
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,585
Oh dear, I do hope you
won't miss your train.

6
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:29,684
Oh, I must ..

7
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,632
Oh Lucy, hurry with that bag.
- Just coming, Miss.

8
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,375
Oh Ellen, about that business I want
you to see to for me in London.

9
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,281
This is for Mr Scott at the bank.

10
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,797
It's about those Brazilian
bonds of mine.

11
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,463
The way the market is this week,
I think they ought to be ..

12
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:54,172
Now you get outside and keep your
eyes open for Bates.       - Yes, Miss.

13
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,365
And this address is
just off Berkeley Square.

14
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,745
Go to the servant's entrance and
ask for Mr Blake. He's the butler.

15
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,248
Say that you've come from me with
a message for Lord Cardington.

16
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,365
And will he give it to his
Lordship .. privately.

17
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,726
Ellen, you are not paying attention.

18
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:14,130
Oh but I am, Miss Fiske.

19
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,862
What would be the best time to call?

20
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,515
Harry always used to dine around eight.

21

You call about half past seven.
- Yes, very well.

Why, you seem upset .. bad news?

23

Oh .. I don't want to bother
you with my troubles.

24
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,845
It isn't a question of bothering
me with your troubles.

25
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,249
Why, you've become
almost like my daughter.

26
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,033
The letter is from my sisters,
Emily and Louisa.

27
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,666
They are very unhappy back
in London without me.

28
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:46,159
After all, I've only seen them once since
I came to work for you, Miss Fiske.

29
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:50,075
Well you'll see them today, won't you.
And everything will be alright, surely.

30
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:53,230
Oh, Miss Fiske .. Bates is coming.

31
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:55,172
Well, tell him to hurry himself.

32
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:00,083
My kind regards to your sisters, Ellen.
- Thank you, Miss Fiske.

33
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,945
I've written them so much about you.

34
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,041
How kind you've been.

35
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:13,760
Oh, stuff and nonsense.
I'm fond of you. You shouldn't ..

36

Oh, a lovely juicy one.

37
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,722
Perhaps you'll .. you might allow
them down for a little visit one day?

38
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,174
Oh dear, look what the damp has done.

39

Why certainly, yes.
By all means. At any time.

40

- Yes?

42
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,236
It's occurred to me that ..

43
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:40,426
Since they've been so wretched lately,
and you may allow them to visit one day.

44
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,677
Oh that? Yes, indeed. You tell them.

45
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,776
Perhaps in the Spring when
it is warm and sunny.

46
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:01,788
Well .. what I was going to ask was ..

47
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:06,019
Might I bring them back
with me this time? Now?

48
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:08,160
Well now, Ellen.
- They won't be a bother.

49
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,100
I promise Miss Fiske .. and it
will mean so much to them.

50
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,056
Very well my dear. You bring with
you by all means. For a day or two.

- About time. The good-for-nothing.

Ellen, have you got everything?
- Yes, Miss Fiske.

56
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,156
Bates, you might have been more prompt.
What on earth made you so late?

57
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,233
Her. You can't gallop over the roads
with a lady in her delicate condition.

58
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,985
She's going to throw a calf, she be.

And I'm taking her to the vets, I am.

Kindly let her not to throw any calves
until you get Miss Ellen to the station.

- Goodbye, Lucy.

from you-know-who.

I hardly like to tell you.

Oh I see .. what's the amount?

Twelve pounds.
- How much?

her out to supper ..

00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,778
I shouldn't think with eyes like them
there would be any difficulty.

153
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,569
Oh, go on ..

154
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,288
What's your name?
- Lucy.

155
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,390
What's yours?
- Albert. I'm Miss Creel's nephew.

156
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,195
Funny .. I never heard about you.

157
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,550
Oh, that must be remedied.

158
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:12,253
How about making the most of a male
fish now one has been washed up, eh?

159
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,043
What about a smacker?
- No, you mustn't.

160
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,276
I don't know you.

161
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,253
You don't have to know people
to kiss them.                 - I do.

162
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,703
Alright my girl. It's your loss.

163
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:25,689
You think a lot of yourself, don't you?

164
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:39,581
Has Lucy been entertaining you, Albert?
- Eh?

165
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,869
Oh, she came in. We had a word or two.

166
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,728
Nice looker, isn't she?
- I didn't notice.

167
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:50,508
Oh come now, Albert. Don't
lose your sense of humour.

168
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,346
I hope you are not one of those people
who won't benefit from experience.

169
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:57,232
Otherwise my twelve pounds
will be rather wasted, won't it.

170
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,937
Don't you worry Miss Fiske.
I've had my lesson.

171
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,631
I hope so.

172
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,912
Now .. this is where we
keep our little hoard.

173
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,055
It's an old bake-oven really.

174
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:15,838
A proper tomb, isn't it?
- Yes.         - What's that?

175
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:19,045
This is what they used to
pull the loaves out with.

176
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,941
Of course, we don't use it as a
bake-oven. Hasn't been used in years.

177
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,880
Now then.

178
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,726
Twelve pounds, I think you said.

179
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,557
I suppose you couldn't make if fifteen?
- No, I couldn't.        - You couldn't?

180
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:44,018
Do I give you an I.O.U. ?
- No thank you.

181
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:45,721
This isn't a loan.

182
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:49,548
I shouldn't like you to incur the
remorse of not paying it back.

183
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,267
You are a daisy!

184
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:56,054
Oh .. very prettily done, Albert.

185
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,327
Now, let's forget all about it.

186
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:07,062
If you'd have come next week, you'd
have found three of your aunts here.

187
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,049
Ellen is bringing her
sisters back from London.

188
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,629
What, the potty ones?
- Potty?

189
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,188
Queer as mice in a cage.

190
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,775
Oh .. they are quite harmless.
Especially when aunt Ellen is around.

191
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,141
For comfort, they are coming
to stay here for a few days.

192
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:23,042
They seem to mean quite a
great deal to your aunt Ellen.

193
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,573
Oh, they would.

194
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,164
She's looked after them
since she was a kid.

195
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,676
She's watched over them like they were
a couple of perishing babes-in-arms.

196
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:34,292
I think that is very commendable of her.
- Perhaps, but ..

197
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,355
Think of all the fun she is missing.

198
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:40,282
What, for example?
- You know.

199
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,582
I see.

200
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:46,094
Well, I've got to be toddling along.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

201
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,864
Oh ..

202
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:54,244
I'd appreciate if you didn't mention
our little transaction to aunt Ellen.

203
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,709
Very well. If you like.

204
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,446
How about .. whatsername?

205
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,728
Lucy? Oh she won't say anything.
I'll take care of that.      - Thanks.

206
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,220
So long my lady.

207
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,428
And again from the heart. I'll never
forget your kindness as long as I live.

208
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:12,887
I hope you live a great
deal longer than that.

209
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,882
Isn't it funny, Ellen? You can't see
the wind and you can't touch it.

210
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,202
But it is there.

211
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,549
I think you'd better have this round
you, dear. It's getting quite chilly.

212
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,061
Listen .. what's that?

213
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:56,492
Those are The Priory bells, dear.
From over the marshes.

214
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh .. I shan't like that.

215
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,269
She hates bells.
- Especially church bells.

216
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,415
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.

217
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,452
Aren't the marshes pretty.

218
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,378
The grass is too long and untidy.

219
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,566
If I had a knife and a bit of string,
I'd cut it and tie it up in bundles.

220
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:21,809
Are there any sheep here on the marshes?
- Yes, Miss.

221
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,040
I think sheep are so clever to
chew their cud the way they do.

222
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,918
It's very difficult.

223
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,030
I've tried.

224
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:34,749
You ought to be a sailor, Miss.
They are always chewing tobacco.

225
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,415
The man I was to marry was a sailor.

226
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,482
He gave me this.

227
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,105
It's all I have to remember him by.

228
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,631
He was wrecked at sea.

229
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,692
They were all drowned.

230
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,781
It must have been a bit of
sadness for you, Missy.

231
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,617
Oh no. I've quite forgotten
what he looked like.

232
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:58,114
I saw a drowned man once. They took
him out of the Thames. He was green.

233
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,800
Frogs.

234
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,598
There must be lots of frogs.

235
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:07,194
We used to have such
fun with them at home.

236
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:11,767
We used to put them on the dining-table
and make them jump in the marmalade pot.

237
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,124
Oh look! There's a bird's nest.
- So there is.

238
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,585
It must be last summer's.
- I should like to have that.

239
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:30,956
Bates, stop please.

240
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,709
Oh .. I have it!

241
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:40,244
Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh dear, it's all cobwebby.

242
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:43,437
And it has a horrid smell.
- It mustn't be wasted.

243
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:46,676
I shall save it until next year
and then I'll put it back again.

244
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,568
Who knows where we'll be next year?

245
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,493
Not in London anyway.
You promised that.

246
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,807
Yes, I promised that.
- Look.

247
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:02,019
Louisa .. how did that happen?

248
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,108
She did it.             - Who?
- That woman in London.

249
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,769
She didn't give us enough food, either.
- "Discipline" she said.

250
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,196
Louisa used to cry all night.

251
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,863
I didn't. She couldn't discipline me.

252
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,953
We'll be alright here though, won't we
with Miss Fiske .. she won't beat us.

253
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:22,285
No darling, she won't beat you.

254
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,774
No one will again, ever.

255
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:38,138
Now remember what I told you both.
You are not to talk too much.

256
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,259
Wait until Miss Fiske
gets to know you better.

257
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,748
But how can she get to know
us better if we don't talk?

258
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,071
Come along dear. Bates,
get the luggage, will you?

259
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,147
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,441
Why, they look harmless.
- What, Miss?

261
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,190
Oh never mind. Go and put the kettle on.
- Yes, Miss.

262
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,332
Well, here we are.
- I'm glad.

263
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,750
Miss Fiske .. my sister
Emily, my sister Louisa.

264
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,614
How do you do, Emily?
- We're very glad to be here.

265
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,625
Louisa.
- I don't like people to touch me.

266
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,203
Oh, I'm afraid, Miss Fiske
will think you're very rude.

267
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,893
They are rather tired, poor dears.
- I never get tired.

268
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,424
I sometimes walk about
the house all night.

269
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,358
Do you indeed?
- No, of course she doesn't, Miss Fiske.

270
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,090
Oh, what beautiful furniture.

271
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:40,401
Just like we used to have
before we lost all our money.

272
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:44,104
Some of these <i>are </i>our things, dear.
Miss Fiske bought them at my Curio Shop.

273
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,716
I want my tea.

274
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:49,687
Emily, see .. here's the
grand champ himself.

275
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,303
Remember when father bought him for us?

276
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,913
I wonder if his head still nods.

277
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,850
Ding-dong, ding-dong ..
- Louisa, dear.

278
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,094
Bates, be careful.
You'll scratch the furniture.

279
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,719
Very good, ma'am.

280
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,201
I must say you've brought
enough luggage with you.

281
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,220
Oh, we've brought everything.
- Everything?

282
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,760
We had to.
- Why?

283
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,683
Well, when they sent for the Police ..

284
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:17,755
Now my dears .. I'm sure all this
can't possibly interest Miss Fiske.

285
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:19,913
I think we'd better go up
and rest a bit before tea.

286
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,056
Whatever you say, Ellen.
- Come along, Emily.

287
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,948
That smelly train was very dirty.

288
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:28,723
She's always fussing about the dirt.
I hope you keep things tidy here.

289
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:32,483
Cleanliness is next to
Godliness .. don't you agree?

290
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,985
Well .. I'm quite clean, I believe.

291
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,103
But I don't know that
I'm particularly Godly.

292
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:42,703
Oh, I thought you were
a Roman. Isn't that yours?

293
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,558
Miss Fiske is a Roman, dear.
But a very devoted one.

294
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,614
Come along Louisa, Emily.

295
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,102
Father, didn't approve of Romans.

296
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,290
And neither do I.

297
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,228
Oh, I expect it's one of those boobies.

298
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,710
Miss Emily was drawing cat's faces on
brown paper yesterday when you were out.

299
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,357
I can't stand it. I can't stand it.

300
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,634
My lovely paisley shawl. It is ruined.

301
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:31,189
You'd better get some vinegar and see
if you can do something about this spot.

302
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,256
Yes, Miss.

303
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm utterly exhausted clearing
up after their messes.

304
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,204
I don't wonder, Miss. So am I.

305
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,030
And you should see their
bedroom. It's like a goat's-pen.

306
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,783
I know it. If it isn't one
thing, it's another.

307
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:49,633
For the last six weeks I might have been
living in the middle of Piccadilly Circus.

308
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,478
My heart won't stand it.

309
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,144
Go and get my smelling salts.

310
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:59,720
Where are they, Miss?
- In the usual place, of course.

311
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,928
Nothing is in the usual
place these days.

312
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:02,822
No.

313
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,532
Well then, get me a cold compress.

314
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:09,597
I shall lie down and
take a nap while I can.

315
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:14,627
Miss Fiske.

316
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,862
Yes, what is it? What is it?
- Will they be staying much longer?

317
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:23,049
They'll have my invitation
to go this evening.

318
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,273
Oh dear, I wonder where Emily has
gone to. She ought to be back by now.

319
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,331
I can't see her anywhere.

320
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:37,997
I wish I were brave like Emily.
I should like to take long walks too.

321
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,016
And pick up things.

322
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,248
Perhaps I shall be able to
after we've stayed here longer.

323
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,145
I'm sure you will, dear.

324
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,530
I shall be staying here, shan't I?

325
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,354
You are not planning to
send us away? Are you, Ellen?

326
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:54,739
No dear. Of course I'm not.

327
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,189
This is what you've always promised us.

328
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,885
A little place in the country
where we can always be safe.

329
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,604
Yes .. it's the one thing
I've been working for.

330
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,236
Ever since we had to
give up the old house.

331
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:10,567
Naturally, Estuary House
could never be like that.

332
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:12,511
But it's nice enough.

333
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:14,774
Yes, and Miss Fiske has
been very kind to us.

334
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:18,924
Miss Fiske .. may I tell
you something, Ellen?

335
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:22,473
Just is one of my secrets.
- Of course you may.

336
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,589
I don't like Miss Fiske.

337
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:30,951
Couldn't we send her away? Then it
would <i>really</i> be just the three of us.

338
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,656
But I keep telling you,
Louisa. It's <i>her</i> house.

339
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:38,631
Oh no. You'll never make me believe
that. All out lovely things are there.

340
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:43,336
We'll never have to go away, will we?
- No, darling. I promised you.

341
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:44,998
Never.

342
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,323
I think Miss Fiske wants us to go.

343
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,341
Both of us.

344
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,961
Well, I'm sure I can persuade
her to let you stay.

345
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,349
Oh dear, I do wish Emily would come.

346
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,912
Maybe we'd better get along
home in case she is waiting there.

347
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:00,838
Come along, dear.

348
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,810
I don't want her upsetting Miss Fiske
again. She can be very tactless.

349
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,220
Here girl, take this.

350
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:27,267
Thanks a lot. What are we to do with it?

351
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:29,709
Put it in the woodshed,
where it belongs.

352
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:33,393
The woodshed is full, and I won't have
you cluttering up my kitchen with it.

353
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,093
Very well then.

354
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,788
Oh dear ..

355
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:50,225
Oh .. what is it now.

356
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,535
Wait until Miss Fiske sees this.

357
00:24:56,855 --> 00:25:00,629
Oh, what's the matter now?
My goodness, more wood?

358
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:02,277
Yes. Miss Emily dumped it.

359
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:04,012
Never mind. You get out of here.

360
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,446
I got a nice lot today.

361
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,421
What are you thinking of? Making a
mess with it all over my clean floor.

362
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,480
That girl wouldn't let
me put it in the kitchen.

363
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,824
And she's quite right. I told you to stop
bringing in wood. We've more than enough.

364
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,501
I must tidy up the river
banks. I hate waste.

365
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:18,995
And I hate litter. Now you
clear it away immediately.

366
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,201
I won't be ordered to do things!

367
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:26,106
Oh, this is too much!
My best polished table.

368
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,933
Look how these shells have scratched it.

369
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:33,637
What is this? Wet seaweed
and a horrid .. dead bird.

370
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:36,698
Leave my bird alone! And my shells!

371
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,248
They are my treasures.

372
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,515
We don't understand expensive things.
It is so long since we had any.

373
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:44,160
I know it is very simple of me.
But I am simple.

374
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,087
Emily .. what's wrong?

375
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:49,111
I hate her. She threw my
bird into the fireplace.

376
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:50,623
Emily, control yourself.

377
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,679
Look what she's done
with her ridiculous shells.

378
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,932
It will take a month's hard
polishing to put this right.

379
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:56,708
I'm sorry Miss Fiske, I'll put it right.

380
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:00,425
No Ellen, you shan't. I'll do it.
Let me do it. I'll polish it.

381
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,434
Every day, all through the Winter.

382
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:05,605
That's sweet of you Louisa, but I don't
think you'll be here through the Winter.

383
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:07,753
Oh, but we shall. Ellen said so.

384
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,056
You're mistaken, Louisa.
I said nothing of the kind.

385
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:12,701
But you did. You promised.
- Louisa, will you be quiet.

386
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:18,507
Oh my heavens, this is the last straw.

387
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,424
You will drive me as
crazy as yourselves.

388
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,868
Oh, Ellen.

389
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:28,535
Miss Fiske.

390
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,588
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to say that, but ..

391
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:34,890
I've had about as much as I can endure.

392
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:39,219
Emily .. take Louisa upstairs.

393
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,482
Now, stop your crying, Louisa.

394
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:44,045
There is nothing to cry about.

395
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,254
Well, do you hear?

396
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,817
Go upstairs. Both of you.

397
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,380
And close the door behind you.

398
00:26:58,271 --> 00:27:00,113
That was a cruel thing to say.

399
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:01,944
But it's true.

400
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:06,123
One with her telescope and the other
with her mania for collecting things.

401
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,149
They are insane, both of them.

402
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,479
Please don't use that word again.

403
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:12,310
Emily was right.

404
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,664
But then people who
have all they want ..

405
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,979
Never understand how much the smallest
things mean to those who haven't.

406
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,612
Oh really? I don't think
this calls for a sermon.

407
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,398
I've been more than generous
to you and your sisters.

408
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,866
People have always been very
generous to you, Miss Fiske.

409
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:29,279
My sisters and I have never had
any friends to send <i>us</i> money.

410
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,480
That's hardly my fault, is it.
- No.

411
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:35,189
Don't you feel you have a responsibility
to those less fortunate than you?

412
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,615
I don't know what you are talking about.

413
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,476
Life hasn't been very
kind to us, Miss Fiske.

414
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,826
Every penny we've ever
had, I've had to work for.

415
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:45,706
Every penny! But at least
we have our self-respect.

416
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,654
How dare you!

417
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,866
How dare you criticize my life.

418
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:55,632
Do you think I don't envy women who
have respectability? Who have families?

419
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:59,179
Who aren't just forgotten and pensioned
off when they lose their stock-in-trade.

420
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,312
Then you can't blame me
for fighting for my family.

421
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:05,005
That is admirable, but it is your family
and not mine. And let me tell you this.

422
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,935
Your sisters, insane or not,
have overstayed their welcome.

423
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,727
I invite them here for two days
and they've stayed six weeks.

424
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:13,450
Or perhaps you were planning
to keep them here forever?

425
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,701
Well .. I had thought that ..

426
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:19,622
That I might pay something out
of my wages for their keep.

427
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,261
Ellen, you're a hypocrite.
You're worse, you're a cheat!

428
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:26,279
You meant to foist your wretched
brood on me and bleed me white.

429
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:30,814
And when I saw through your scheme, you
had the insolence to turn and abuse me.

430
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:32,701
But you've chosen the wrong woman.

431
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,255
You get those sisters of yours
out of this house at once!

432
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,800
And you take a month's
wages and go with them!

433
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:40,815
Miss Fiske.

434
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,039
Ellen .. why aren't you in bed?

435
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,179
Why are you prowling about at this hour?

436
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:16,786
Miss Fiske, may I come in?
I must talk with you, please.

437
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,516
Well, mind your tongue.

438
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:20,987
We don't want any more of
this afternoon's unpleasantness.

439
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:24,936
I'm sorry about that.

440
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:27,833
I was wrong. I shouldn't
have spoken to you as I did.

441
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,462
No .. you shouldn't.

442
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:38,744
Miss Fiske.

443
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:42,303
Do you remember the letter that arrived
the day I went away to London?

444
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:46,058
Yes .. what about it?
- It was from their landlady.

445
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:51,045
Emily and Louisa had been .. a little
difficult. She had sent for the Police.

446
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:54,369
They were going to be
put away in an institution.

447
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,034
The landlady was quite right.
That's where they belong.

448
00:29:57,393 --> 00:30:00,433
But Miss Fiske, you don't
understand. They're my sisters.

449
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,744
You don't know what I've
gone through for them.

450
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:05,036
They've no-one else in the
world to turn to but me.

451
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,948
I pleaded with the Police to release
them. They agreed on one condition.

452
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,458
That they were to remain
in my personal care.

453
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,336
That I was to be responsible for them.

454
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,440
And if there were any more complaints.

455
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,522
That they were to be put away forever.
That's why I can't send them away.

456
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,889
All this devotion is
very admirable, Ellen.

457
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,471
But I fail to see how I can
help in any way at all.

458
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,903
Oh but you can. You can, Miss Fiske.

459
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,823
I thought perhaps they
might use the attic upstairs.

460
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,616
They could stay there out of the
way where you'll never see them.

461
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,876
They could use the back stairs
when they come in and out.

462
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:37,074
Ellen, what are you talking about?

463
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:40,267
I promise they'll never come near you.
You'll never know they are in the house.

464
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:43,797
I'll look after them myself.
I'll cook their meals for them.

465
00:30:44,387 --> 00:30:46,340
Oh, I promise they won't
be any more trouble.

466
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,120
Miss Fiske, they must
be with me, they must.

467
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,590
I'll pay for their keep.
I'll work for nothing.

468
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,509
Please .. oh, please Miss Fiske.

469
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,720
Ellen, have you quite
gone out of your mind?

470
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,138
You must be blind if you can't realise
they'd always be getting in my way.

471
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,728
No, you pack them off tomorrow.
- But Miss Fiske, won't you ..?

472
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,369
No Ellen, my mind is made up.

473
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:09,239
If you want to, you can stay here a few
days until you've found a new situation.

474
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,814
Now run along to bed. And make
certain they leave tomorrow.

475
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:16,592
You wouldn't want me to be sending
for the Police, would you?

476
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:20,329
Goodnight Ellen. I'm tired.

477
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,186
Goodnight.

478
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,908
But you told her you were
going to send us away.

479
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:54,344
I'm not going to send you away.

480
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,620
We heard you. We were listening.

481
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,386
Isn't she terrible, Ellen?

482
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:01,536
She's wicked.

483
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,907
I'm not going to send you away.

484
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:07,678
Never.

485
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:11,509
If you're not going to send us away,
what are you going to do?

486
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,293
I don't know.

487
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,831
I must think.

488
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,550
I've always wanted
to explore an old castle.

489
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:36,935
Will it have a dungeon do you think?
- They all have dungeons .. with bats.

490
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:39,255
Oh no dear. Bats are in belfries.

491
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,180
There is sure to be secret passageways
and places where they'd hide things.

492
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:46,346
Like that.

493
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,399
Yes .. I'm sure Miss Fiske has lots
of exciting things hidden in there.

494
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:00,212
Her jewels, I'm sure.

495
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,181
I've looked in all her boxes and
haven't been able to find them.

496
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,167
Are you both ready?
- Oh yes. Quite.

497
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,004
I managed to pack all
the lunch into one bag.

498
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,630
Mine.

499
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,600
Come here and sit down.
I want to talk to you both.

500
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:25,808
Now.

501
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:28,868
I haven't told you the real reason why
you're being sent away for a whole day.

502
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,650
The truth is I want to be entirely
alone with Miss Fiske for a few hours.

503
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,960
Is that why you got rid of Lucy too?

504
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,293
I didn't get rid of Lucy, Emily.
She had a toothache.

505
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:40,293
Oh Ellen dear, you know that's
not true. She didn't want to go at all.

506
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,833
I said she had a toothache, Louisa.

507
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:45,628
Now listen.

508
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,408
Last night, while you were both asleep,
I had a long talk with Miss Fiske.

509
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,867
She's tired of the marshes
and wants to travel for a bit.

510
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,656
I've persuaded her to
sell this house to me.

511
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:58,210
Not really Ellen?
- We haven't discussed price yet.

512
00:33:58,976 --> 00:34:02,422
That's why I must be alone with her, so
we can talk with nothing to distract us.

513
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,355
She may want more than
you are prepared to pay.

514
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,142
I'm prepared to pay
quite a big price, Emily.

515
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,442
Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely.

516
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,491
Oh Emily, aren't you excited?
- Louisa, be quiet.

517
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,415
Now, there is one more thing.

518
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,716
The most important.

519
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:36,722
You see this bible, both of you?

520
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,020
Well, I want you to swear
on it, by father's memory.

521
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,550
That you will never repeat a word of my
buying this house, as long as you live.

522
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,069
What do I say?
- Just say "I swear".

523
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,343
Oh .. I swear.
- You too, Emily.

524
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:54,972
I won't swear on the bible. It's wicked.

525
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:56,571
If you don't Emily ..

526
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:59,326
I shan't buy the house and I shall
send you both back to London.

527
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:01,058
Oh Emily, be sensible.

528
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,984
I don't like being made
to do things .. I promise.

529
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,759
Now, remember.

530
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,016
That's a sacred oath.

531
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,162
Here's Bates. Hurry now.
There is no time to waste.

532
00:35:35,582 --> 00:35:38,805
Drive slowly Bates.
Please don't let them get cold.

533
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:42,412
You can take your time. I shan't be
expecting you back before dusk.

534
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:43,999
Very good, ma'am.

535
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,698
Goodbye Ellen. I wish you could come.
- I wish you were coming, too.

536
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,581
Goodbye Ellen.      - Goodbye.
- Goodbye, dears.

537
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,519
Have a good time.
- Thank you.

538
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,246
Oh, I'm out of practice.

539
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:14,210
To dear Louisa and dear Emily.

540
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,359
May we never meet again.

541
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,335
That is so good.

542
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,013
[ door knocks ]

543
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:22,634
May we come in?
- Yes.

544
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,536
I'd like to speak to Miss Ellen.
Unless Miss Fiske is back?

545
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,096
No, she's still away. I'll fetch Ellen.

546
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,292
We're making jam.

547
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:45,883
Good evening.

548
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:48,418
It isn't a very good one, is it?

549
00:39:48,747 --> 00:39:52,681
No, as a matter of fact it's not.
Cats and dogs.

550
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,766
Good evening, Sisters.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

551
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,060
But we're just in the middle
of putting up our quince jam.

552
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,087
Please don't apologise. I'm afraid
we've come on a begging errand.

553
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,781
Our supplier of oil hasn't
arrived from Rochester.

554
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,245
And the Reverend Mother wondered
if we might borrow a can until Sunday.

555
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,324
Why, of course .. Lucy.

556
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:17,179
Yes, Miss?

557
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:19,874
Will you run out to the shed
and bring in a can of paraffin.

558
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:22,653
Yes, Miss Ellen.

559
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,588
Won't you sit down, Sisters?

560
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,986
Hey! Shush ..

561
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:56,483
You, again.
- Bad pennies always turn up you know.

562
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:59,178
What are you doing here,
hanging about with the storm and all?

563
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:02,060
I've a little business inside. I wanted
to make sure the coast was clear.

564
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,901
What business?
- Listen, Lucky.

565
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:05,963
Is Miss Fiske about?
- No, she's away.

566
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,242
And my aunt Ellen?
- She's here right enough.

567
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:11,306
And them two crazy sisters of hers.
- Does she know I've been here before?

568
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:14,618
No, Mistress said not to say.
- Good. Get on with your work.

569
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:17,096
I'll come in the front door
like a proper gentleman.

570
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,067
Remember .. we don't know each other.

571
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:24,318
Not that we shan't .. later.
- I'm very particular who I know.

572
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:33,410
For a moment, when I saw the candles
burning, I thought Miss Fiske was back.

573
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,194
Ellen's taken to lighting them lately.

574
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:38,777
She thinks Miss Fiske would like her to.
She says it keeps her memory burning.

575
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:44,209
Oh, when are you expecting her back?
- Well, I really couldn't say, Sister.

576
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:46,293
She hasn't written for over a fortnight.

577
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,509
We were so surprised
to learn she'd gone.

578
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:51,374
She hadn't mentioned she was
planning a journey anywhere.

579
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,242
No. It was quite unexpected.

580
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:56,143
She had a letter from some old
friends inviting her on a trip.

581
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,529
And, as they were sailing
the very next morning.

582
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:01,326
The Reverend Mother has been wondering
what she will do about the rent.

583
00:42:01,426 --> 00:42:03,908
From the little 3-acre field
we hire from Miss Fiske.

584
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,476
Well, I'm managing all her
affairs while she's away, Sister.

585
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,527
If you send it to me, I will forward
it when I get her next address.

586
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,143
Here, Miss Ellen.

587
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,481
Good evening, Sisters.
- Thank you.

588
00:42:14,676 --> 00:42:17,484
That seems rather heavy. Run along with
the Sisters, Lucy and give them a hand.

589
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,237
That's very kind of you, Miss Ellen.
- We've been bother enough.

590
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:23,279
I'll be glad to go. I'll get my cloak.

591
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:27,025
I think you are so brave
going out into the dark. I ..

592
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,983
I hate the dark .. it frightens me.

593
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:35,608
It shouldn't my dear. Don't you
believe we're watched over?

594
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,978
Oh yes .. but I'm never quite
sure who is watching us.

595
00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:42,753
I'm quite ready.
- Well, we'd better be going.

596
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,775
Goodnight and thank you very much.
- Goodnight Sisters.

597
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,278
Goodnight.

598
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,399
There dear, you carry the oil.

599
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,833
And I'll hold the umbrella over us both.

600
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:56,885
Goodnight again.
- Goodnight.

601
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:58,265
Goodnight.

602
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:04,002
Well, I must get back to the jam.

603
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,622
Ellen was unusually nice to
Sister Theresa wasn't she.

604
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:15,467
They were quite chatty together.
- Louisa.             - Yes.

605
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,073
I think Ellen is changing.

606
00:43:17,815 --> 00:43:21,149
I hope she's not going to get in
league with the nuns .. against us.

607
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:24,857
Oh, Ellen would never do that.
- She's taken to lighting those candles.

608
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,299
I think I'll blow them out.
- Ellen wouldn't like that.

609
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,018
Why should she have
everything her own way?

610
00:43:45,983 --> 00:43:47,147
Emily.

611
00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:50,640
What have you done?
- Something I wanted to do.

612
00:43:53,975 --> 00:43:55,167
[ door knocks ]

613
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,446
Louisa .. answer the door dear. Sister
Theresa's probably forgotten something.

614
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,069
[ door knocks ]

615
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:12,462
Ah!

616
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,936
Alright .. don't be like
that. I won't eat you.

617
00:44:20,998 --> 00:44:22,181
Who are you?

618
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:25,637
And what do you want?

619
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:29,447
Dear aunt Ellen.

620
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:31,460
After all these years.

621
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:35,753
What a family reunion. I'm Albert.
Don't you remember me?

622
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:36,876
Albert.

623
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,363
Of course! Rose's boy.
- So it is!

624
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,402
Fancy Albert being here.
- Where on earth did you come from?

625
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,815
Gravesend .. on a duck's back.

626
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,923
It is Albert right enough.
Always saying funny things.

627
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:51,064
He's soaked through.
- Yes, so I see.

628
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,311
Don't stand there dripping
all over my best rug.

629
00:44:53,411 --> 00:44:55,149
Go to the kitchen fire
with your wet feet.

630
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:58,190
That's more like my loving auntie.
My very distant auntie.

631
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:03,139
Now we'll have fun with Albert here.
I'll go and fetch him a dressing gown.

632
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:06,231
And I'll get him a towel.
So he can dry himself.

633
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:17,967
Blimey, if that don't half
make me mouth water.

634
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:21,154
Some nice, tasty grub and something
warm to chase it down the hatchway.

635
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,690
That's what I need.

636
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:25,422
Albert, tell me.
Why have you come here?

637
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:28,530
That can wait until I'm dry outside.
And not so dry, in.

638
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:30,060
There you are, Albert.

639
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,975
Thanks me old cup of tea.

640
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:34,816
Emily, slice off some beef,
and put out the bread and cheese.

641
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,187
A pint of half-and-half would
be the proper ticket with that.

642
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:39,680
This isn't a Tavern, Albert.

643
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:43,220
And .. how about a spot of brandy to
take the damp out of my throat, eh?

644
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:45,344
I'm not sure there's any
left in the decanter.

645
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:46,791
There is some in the cellar.

646
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,999
Oh, a cellar, eh? Your Ladyship,
allow me to lead you to it.

647
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:52,705
No .. I'll go myself.

648
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,499
Make way for the Duchess.

649
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,640
Blimey. The view from here
is the best on the marshes.

650
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,481
I say auntie, is this all yours?
- No, of course not.

651
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,166
It belongs to the woman
I work for. Miss Fiske.

652
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,510
Where is she, might I ask?
- Away.

653
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:44,148
Five years, auntie old girl.
- What of it?

654
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,646
You've changed.
- You've not.

655
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,373
The same big blue eyes though.
You are still Lady-touch-me-not.

656
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:53,265
Let go of me. I'm in no
mood for your foolishness.

657
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,739
The way you seem to be all keyed up.

658
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,072
A little of my foolishness
just might do you no harm.

659
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:02,961
Here's your food, Albert.

660
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,242
Run up to bed, both of you.
I want to talk with Albert.

661
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:10,580
But we don't want to go to bed.
- No, we want to stay to talk to Albert.

662
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:13,857
Go on, do as aunt Ellen says. Toddle off
to bye-byes like good little girls.

663
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,821
Here, wait. Why don't you wet your
whistles. It will make you sleep tight.

664
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,176
Sleep tight! Oh, Albert you are silly.

665
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:22,004
I don't think they'd better, Albert.
- What's the harm?

666
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:24,708
You don't have a long-lost
nephew every night of the week.

667
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:26,485
Fetch some glasses, Emily.

668
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:29,797
Very well, but not too much, now.
- Just a tiny thimbleful for me, Albert.

669
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:32,688
How about you, aunt Ellen?

670
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:34,716
Nothing for me, thank you.

671
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:40,330
Now then, my Siamese twins,
what about a toast, eh?

672
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,905
I don't know any.

673
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,008
In that case, here's to absent friends.

674
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,464
Absent friends.

675
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:48,543
Ellen, I suppose we
should think of Miss Fiske.

676
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:03,604
Who put out those candles?
- What candles?

677
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,445
Oh those.
- It must have been the wind.

678
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,998
Goodnight, Albert.
- Goodnight my lady.

679
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,204
Goodnight, Albert.
- Goodnight.

680
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,379
It wasn't the wind, Ellen.

681
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:41,109
I say auntie, you've not
turned Roman have you?

682
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:42,763
I do this for a friend.

683
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:52,313
Now Albert. Let's stop all this "auntie"
nonsense and let's get down to cases.

684
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,748
Why have you come here,
and what do you want?

685
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:56,918
Well auntie .. I mean, Ellen.

686
00:48:57,692 --> 00:49:02,208
To cut it fine, I'm taking a compulsory
holiday from my bank over in Gravesend.

687
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:05,107
In other words, you've lost your job.
- I've given it up.

688
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:07,522
You haven't done anything
wrong, have you?

689
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:11,736
Well, I sort of helped myself to
a little salary I wasn't entitled to.

690
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:14,393
You mean, you've stolen money.

691
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,181
This is rattling good brandy.
- Answer me, Albert.

692
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,848
You've got it.
- How much?

693
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,402
A small matter of a hundred pounds.
- I'll see.

694
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,271
I suppose you want me to give you the
hundred pounds so you can put it back?

695
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:36,477
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
They found out, the Police.

696
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,164
The Police?

697
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:42,016
A friend passed me the tip they were
coming. So I .. I took French leave.

698
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:44,956
But .. they'll follow you.
They'll come here.

699
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,774
Don't worry .. no-one knows I've got
relations out here on the marshes.

700
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,699
I'll be safe here for a lifetime.

701
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:55,319
Well, you're certainly not going
to stay here for a lifetime.

702
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,130
Surely you don't mind me staying
for a little while, do you?

703
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,442
Until it all blows over.

704
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,994
Then what do you propose to do?

705
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,725
Clear out of the country.
America, Australia. Any old where.

706
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,552
I'm .. counting on you to help me.

707
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,188
I need money for my passage.

708
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,630
I'm .. I'm stony.

709
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:13,246
It won't cost much. Steerage.

710
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,882
I don't see why I should concern
myself with your affairs.

711
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:17,870
I'll land in prison if you don't.

712
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,420
You're not the sort to turn anybody down
who was in trouble and needed your help.

713
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:25,085
You wouldn't fail your
own flesh and blood.

714
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:27,020
I'm no flesh and blood of yours, Albert.

715
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:29,315
Won't you give me a
chance to start again?

716
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:30,734
I promise. Cross my heart.

717
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,485
I'll never do anything wrong
again for the rest of my natural.

718
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:35,143
Let me go.

719
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:44,030
Very well. I'll do it.
- Bless you, Ellen.

720
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,973
You're a daisy, you are.
- We'll talk about it in the morning.

721
00:50:47,927 --> 00:50:50,296
You can sleep on the sofa tonight.
- I don't mind where I sleep.

722
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:51,419
But mind you ..

723
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,255
You can only stay until I've
arranged your passage on the boat.

724
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:57,466
Anything you say,
Ellen old girl .. what's that?

725
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,945
That's just the maid.
She's been out on an errand.

726
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,550
Lucy.
- Yes, Miss?

727
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:06,220
They'll be a gentleman
staying the night.

728
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:07,819
A gentleman staying?

729
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,776
A relation. He'll sleep in here.

730
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:12,795
Now go to your room and change your
wet clothes before you start sneezing.

731
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:15,206
Yes, Miss .. goodnight.
- Goodnight.

732
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,573
Goodnight .. "Lucy" isn't it?

733
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:20,785
Yes .. Lucy.

734
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,687
I fancy that's all for
tonight, aunt Ellen.

735
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:29,180
I'll just have a weed before
I turn in. The last of the day.

736
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,729
You seem to be taking this
all very lightly, Albert.

737
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,166
You have told me the worst, haven't you?

738
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:38,110
I mean, there isn't anything else?
- What else?

739
00:51:40,653 --> 00:51:43,922
There are worst things than stealing.
- As for instance?

740
00:51:45,828 --> 00:51:47,359
Oh no, there's no blood on my hands.

741
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:49,703
Putting people out calls
for <i>real </i>nerve, you know.

742
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,303
Yes.

743
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,321
Goodnight, Albert.
- Nighty night.

744
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:15,145
Did you enjoy the sermon, Mr Bates?

745
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:18,798
Mighty powerful, Miss.
- Yes, it was wasn't it.

746
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:23,073
But there was a lot of it I didn't
understand.            - Uhuh.

747
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:26,694
That part that went .. how was it?

748
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,096
The wicked flee.

749
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:32,985
When no man .. pursueth.

750
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:36,575
But .. but ..

751
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:41,233
The righteous are as bold as a lion.

752
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,297
Well.

753
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:12,479
What do you think you're doing?

754
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,940
Well, I was fooling around with this
padlock last night and it .. came off.

755
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:18,967
Oh, you shouldn't have.

756
00:54:19,344 --> 00:54:21,297
That's where Miss Fiske
keeps her valuables.

757
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,794
How does she get at them?
With a pickaxe? Look.

758
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:28,667
Well I never. All bricked up.

759
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:31,248
I wonder why that was done.

760
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,342
It wasn't that way the
last time I was here.

761
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:35,868
So you've had your nose
in there before, have you?

762
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:39,184
Funny what nasty thoughts
people have sometimes, isn't it.

763
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,597
Funny how they're right
sometimes, isn't it.

764
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,443
I wonder why anyone would want
to brick up a place like that?

765
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,171
Maybe Miss Fiske put her jewels
in there before she went away.

766
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,980
You know .. she's not one to take
any chances leaving them about.

767
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:10,530
Even with your aunt Ellen.

768
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:15,523
If there are any sparkles in there,
I wouldn't mind having a peep at them.

769
00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:18,262
I'm sure you wouldn't.
- And neither would you, I dare say.

770
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:24,037
In fact .. I'm sure you'd like the feel
of some around your swan-like neck.

771
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,629
A pretty pink ear like
that calls for diamonds.

772
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:31,473
A wandering hand like yours
calls for a slap in the face.

773
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:33,675
It's wicked to slap a
man's face on a Sunday.

774
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:37,436
The better the day, the better the deed.
- Well, that leaves my conscience clear.

775
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:43,680
I'll scream.

776
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:46,140
What's that?

777
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,550
What do you think I'm made of?
- Sugar and spice.

778
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,131
And everything nice.

779
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:03,164
Blimey, you're strong!

780
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,586
It's a wig. Whose is it?

781
00:56:08,854 --> 00:56:10,150
It is Miss Fiske's.

782
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:12,470
Oh, it's her best one.

783
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:15,258
She's as bald as a coot.
- Ah.

784
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,042
A wonder she didn't take it with her.

785
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,267
Hello.

786
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:22,290
Ah, she left a lot of
her fancy dresses, too.

787
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:25,236
Perhaps she's going to buy
some new ones up in London?

788
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:26,938
These are new. Most of them.

789
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,059
You'd better put that back up.
- Alright.

790
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:31,783
Get up on this chair.

791
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:41,554
You know, it is odd
she only took one wig.

792
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,357
On a trip, anything might happen.
A fire or a gust of wind.

793
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:46,409
Oh.

794
00:56:47,395 --> 00:56:49,310
Here's that Emily coming up the path.

795
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:51,329
You'd better be off.

796
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,794
Hello my old cup of tea.

797
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,634
What are you doing with those
bull-rushes? Looking for Moses?

798
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,371
You are making fun of me .. naughty boy.

799
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:31,405
Hello Ducky .. I'm glad you're
back before the others.

800
00:57:32,024 --> 00:57:34,784
It isn't often I have the chance of
a tête-à-tête with the family's fairest.

801
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,788
You are never serious
about anything, Albert.

802
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,846
I was never more serious in my life.

803
00:57:40,212 --> 00:57:42,518
The storm did an enormous
amount of damage.

804
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,494
Roads into Rochester and Gravesend
were completely flooded.

805
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:48,836
The Postman told me.
- I hope they stay that way.

806
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:51,558
Allow me, Empress.

807
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:54,681
There is only one letter today.
It is for Miss Fiske.

808
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:55,967
Oh, is it?

809
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,226
It's a cosy nest you got here.

810
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,661
What's will happen to you
when Miss Fiske gets back?

811
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,596
Will she let you stay on, do you think?

812
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,122
She isn't coming back.
- Oh, why not?

813
00:58:15,336 --> 00:58:16,995
Ellen's bought the house.

814
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:21,352
Oh, go on.
- Oh yes. It's quite true.

815
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,266
It's a secret though.

816
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,001
Ellen made us swear on the bible
that we wouldn't tell anyone.

817
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:28,300
But you are one of
the family, so it's alright.

818
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:31,777
Why should she want
to keep it a secret, eh?

819
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:33,668
I don't know. It was
done in a great hurry.

820
00:58:33,768 --> 00:58:35,540
Louisa and I were sent off to Rochester.

821
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,669
Then when we came back that night,
Miss Fiske was gone and it was all over.

822
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:43,818
Oh dear .. you won't tell Ellen I told
you, will you, Albert?          - No.

823
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:46,996
We'll make that our
little secret, shall we?

824
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:48,000
Alright.

825
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:52,623
It will be rather fun,
having a secret from Ellen.

826
00:58:53,147 --> 00:58:55,628
She thinks she's the
clever one .. but she isn't.

827
00:58:57,112 --> 00:58:58,443
Not always.

828
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:01,826
No .. not always.

829
00:59:17,517 --> 00:59:19,294
Albert.
- What?

830
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:26,418
Good morning.

831
00:59:28,974 --> 00:59:30,054
May we come in?

832
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,261
Who's that?
- A couple of nuns from The Priory.

833
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:36,099
You talk to them, Albert.
I've got to tidy up the orchard.

834
00:59:47,032 --> 00:59:51,087
Oh .. I didn't know there was
a young man staying here.

835
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:52,853
Is Miss Ellen about?

836
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,027
I'm sorry, she's gone over to church at
Cawley. I'm her nephew, can I help you?

837
00:59:56,487 --> 01:00:00,357
We came to return this. She lent us
a little oil last night. We ran short.

838
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:02,365
Thanks.
- Oh yes, and this.

839
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:05,041
It's the rent for the little field.
Your aunt will understand.

840
01:00:05,141 --> 01:00:06,213
I'll give it to her.

841
01:00:06,313 --> 01:00:08,788
We are so looking forward
to Miss Fiske's return.

842
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:10,864
She's a dear friend of ours.

843
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,646
Oh .. have you .. heard from her lately?

844
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:16,218
No, not a word.

845
01:00:16,752 --> 01:00:19,335
I think the Reverend Mother is
a trifle hurt she hasn't written.

846
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:22,281
In fact, she didn't even tell
us she was going away.

847
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:25,295
Not very chummy, was it.
- No, it wasn't.

848
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,232
Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

849
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:07,671
Now what are you up to?
- Fetch me a knife, Ducky.

850
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:17,171
What's that?
- A letter for Miss Fiske.

851
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:19,943
You're not going to open it?
- Oh, no. Wouldn't think of it.

852
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,431
What's it say?

853
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:28,530
"Dear Madam .. regarding
your instructions .."

854
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,591
"To forward the amount of the
enclosed cheque in five-pound notes."

855
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,889
"Your signature appears to differ from
that with which we are acquainted."

856
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:41,444
"We should be obliged if you
could kindly confirm same .."

857
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:44,354
"By signing it afresh.
In your usual manner."

858
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:49,634
Fifty pounds.

859
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,037
Here. Notice the day.
- October 14th.

860
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,258
That's three days ago.
She's been gone longer than that.

861
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:59,484
Since the beginning of September.

862
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,329
She probably made it
out from wherever she is.

863
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,986
Yes, she could have. Hey, wait a minute.

864
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,765
In that case, why did they
send the reply to her, here?

865
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:11,666
You see who it is made payable to?

866
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,680
Ellen Creed.

867
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:17,785
What of it? I expect it is
the housekeeping money.

868
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,504
Maybe. Where's the glue-pot?
- Over there.

869
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,015
Get it for me.

870
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,107
Dip your finger in it.

871
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:31,817
I should say not.
I've had no hand in this.

872
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,014
Haven't you?

873
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:37,470
You are a filthy pig.
- Now go on. Seal it up.

874
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:39,930
Go on.

875
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:46,450
Don't forget. You're in
this as deep as I am now.

876
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,124
I wish you'd never come here.

877
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,488
I don't know what comes over
me when you're around.

878
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:54,599
You won't give me away
to Ellen, will you?

879
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:56,230
I won't if you keep your mouth shut.

880
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:06,241
Here come the performing seals.
Not a word, mind you.

881
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:18,397
Albert.

882
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:20,252
Hello, aunts .. had a nice pray?

883
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,114
You should have been at church, Albert.

884
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:24,609
The minister told us all about Hell.

885
01:03:25,016 --> 01:03:27,336
You'd have enjoyed the
bit about the lost souls ..

886
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:29,251
Sizzling in the bottomless pit.

887
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:31,970
Would I now? Sounds frightening.

888
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,859
Ellen .. where is Hell?

889
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:39,443
Hell is like the Kingdom of Heaven.

890
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:42,765
It is within.

891
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:45,771
That reminds me .. one of
your religious friends was here.

892
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:49,076
She left you this. It is the
rent for some field or other.

893
01:03:50,587 --> 01:03:52,684
She didn't see you, did she?
- I couldn't avoid it.

894
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:54,258
That was Sister Theresa.

895
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:59,138
She's Miss Fiske's friend. She doesn't
like us any more than Miss Fiske did.

896
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,509
Oh, didn't Miss Fiske like you?

897
01:04:02,068 --> 01:04:03,289
Oh she was horrid to us.

898
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:05,208
Louisa, run upstairs
and change your dress.

899
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,342
You won't want to sit
around in your best all day.

900
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:10,670
No, I shan't, shall I.
No of course not.

901
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:13,819
Albert.
- Huh?

902
01:04:14,096 --> 01:04:16,776
I don't want you to mention Miss Fiske
again in front of my sisters.

903
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,819
They quarrelled with her.

904
01:04:19,382 --> 01:04:21,392
And it upsets them very
much to talk about her.

905
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:23,364
Sorry. Nobody told me.

906
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:26,055
What did you quarrel about?

907
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,328
I didn't say I quarrelled with her.

908
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,220
Would she by any chance be the friend
you lit those candles for last night?

909
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:38,187
Yes.

910
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,469
When did she die?

911
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:43,699
Die?

912
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:46,516
Who said anything about her being dead?

913
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:50,858
I just assumed she was.
You don't light candles for the living.

914
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:53,352
Do you?
- I don't know.

915
01:04:54,178 --> 01:04:55,831
I just thought they stood for prayer.

916
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,451
I must find Emily.
- By the way.

917
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,614
The postman gave her
a letter for Miss Fiske.

918
01:05:00,911 --> 01:05:02,450
From her bank, I believe.

919
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:04,375
Give it to me.

920
01:05:14,895 --> 01:05:16,951
I'm managing all her
affairs while she's away.

921
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:31,579
Anything important?
- Yes, rather.

922
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,512
I must get an answer
in the post immediately.

923
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:40,763
A stylish looking piano you've got here.

924
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:43,016
Don't distract me, Albert.
I must concentrate.

925
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,026
I'm sorry. Don't mind me, auntie.

926
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:01,335
I say, you are up to date.

927
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,648
I didn't expect to find a copy of
The Mikado way out here on the marshes.

928
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:15,500
[ whistling song: Tit-Willow ]

929
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:19,068
[ whistling song: Tit-Willow ]

930
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:21,491
Don't do that.

931
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:24,252
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to distract you.

932
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,960
It is just that I happen to dislike
that particular tune, that's all.

933
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:29,932
It is a bit on the morbid side.

934
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:37,845
Miss Ellen, how soon
will you want dinner?

935
01:06:37,945 --> 01:06:39,524
In about a quarter of an hour, Lucy.

936
01:06:39,624 --> 01:06:41,615
I'm just going to post this
letter at the crossing.

937
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:44,356
Let me go, Ellen. I could
do with a sniff of air.

938
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:47,003
No thank you. I prefer
to attend to this myself.

939
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:22,723
What are you up to now?

940
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,191
She's just written a reply
to that letter we opened.

941
01:07:25,426 --> 01:07:27,560
I thought it would be interesting
to see what she says.

942
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:33,285
"Dear sir .. cheque ..
something .. incorrect."

943
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:36,426
"Something .. owing."

944
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:40,454
"Something .. something .. wrist."

945
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:44,047
Here, what does that word
look like to you? Here, see.

946
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:47,521
"S .. P .. R .."

947
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:49,784
SPR .. sprained.

948
01:07:50,345 --> 01:07:52,413
That's it: "Owing to a sprained wrist."

949
01:07:53,878 --> 01:07:55,978
"Something .. yours."

950
01:07:57,352 --> 01:07:58,758
"Leonora Fiske."

951
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,514
She signed it "Leonora Fiske".
- What's it mean, Albert?

952
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,665
What do you think?

953
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:09,843
It looks as if she's pretending
to be Miss Fiske.

954
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:12,224
And getting money on the strength of it.
- Brilliant!

955
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,707
If that's true, she's a thief. Like you.

956
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:16,106
Shut up.

957
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,417
What will happen when
Miss Fiske comes back?

958
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:25,061
Suppose she isn't coming back?

959
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:29,149
Suppose she's died somewhere.
And Ellen is the only one who knows.

960
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:31,345
You can't die and only
one person know it.

961
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:32,744
Can't you? I'm not so sure.

962
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,600
One thing I do know.

963
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:38,896
She'd never take the risk unless she knew
Miss Fiske was out of the way for good.

964
01:08:39,955 --> 01:08:43,091
Alright .. assume she's dead.
Aunt Ellen is having the funds.

965
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:45,721
It might be years before
anybody would find out.

966
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:49,815
Why should she reap all the benefit?

967
01:08:55,456 --> 01:08:57,193
There might be some
pickings in it for us.

968
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:59,957
Would you like to see a bit of the
world? Have some fun with me?

969
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:01,928
You'd tempt Old Nick
himself, wouldn't you?

970
01:09:02,123 --> 01:09:03,540
You've got to help me get proof.

971
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:05,763
I don't want to do anything
mean or underhanded.

972
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:09,069
Would I ask you to? Use your eyes
and keep your ears open. That's all.

973
01:09:09,863 --> 01:09:12,662
What do you say?
- Oh, I don't know.

974
01:09:12,877 --> 01:09:14,737
Perhaps this will help
you make up your mind.

975
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,321
Well?
- I'll help you, Albert.

976
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,685
Here she comes. Look sharp now.
Back to the kitchen.

977
01:10:47,655 --> 01:10:48,984
She's coming.

978
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,214
Blimey! You almost made
me frightened, myself.

979
01:10:51,698 --> 01:10:53,567
Hurry up, hurry up.
- Alright. Shut up.

980
01:10:57,097 --> 01:10:59,119
Hey, go in the kitchen
and make some tea.

981
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:03,053
Take this with you. Go on, hurry.

982
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:10,610
Goodnight Bates.
- Goodnight, ma'am.

983
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,540
Don't forget. Ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.

984
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,710
Very good, ma'am.

985
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,960
Did you have a successful trip?

986
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:30,324
Yes.

987
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:32,615
I have your ticket.

988
01:11:33,462 --> 01:11:35,112
You leave tomorrow.

989
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,873
Do I?

990
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:41,037
Where are my sisters?
- I sent them off to bed.

991
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:44,567
They were getting a little out of hand.
- Well, I dare say it wasn't their fault.

992
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,694
Lucy is making some hot tea.

993
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,628
We thought you might be cold.

994
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,500
I'll be down again .. as soon as
I've said goodnight to them.

995
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:06,552
Is everything alright?

996
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,253
No it's not. She's packing me off
tomorrow. We've got to move fast.

997
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:14,109
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
- I couldn't refuse you anything .. now.

998
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:20,732
We thought you'd never come,
Ellen .. I was frightened.

999
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:22,343
Frightened?

1000
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:26,086
Yes, there were such funny noises.
- Oh, it was only the rats.

1001
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,343
What have you been doing all evening?

1002
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:33,166
We played a game of cribbage.
Of course, Albert cheated.

1003
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,420
But it was rather fun
watching him cheat.

1004
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,716
He hasn't said anything about
Miss Fiske, has he?        - No.

1005
01:12:39,005 --> 01:12:41,749
Miss Fiske? No .. why should he?

1006
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,983
And neither of you said anything to him
about my buying the house, have you?

1007
01:12:45,175 --> 01:12:50,143
No, Ellen. Don't you remember? You made
us swear on the Bible we wouldn't.

1008
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:55,327
Well, I think you'd better
go to sleep now, both of you.

1009
01:12:55,778 --> 01:12:58,491
I'm going downstairs to have a
hot cup of tea before I go to bed.

1010
01:13:11,633 --> 01:13:14,151
Albert, do you think ..?
- Pour the tea, Lucy.

1011
01:13:21,955 --> 01:13:24,408
Thank you Lucy. You may go to bed now.
- Yes, Miss Ellen.

1012
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,345
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1013
01:13:36,198 --> 01:13:37,701
Well auntie, where is your cane?

1014
01:13:38,312 --> 01:13:41,222
By the look on your face, you want to take
down my breeches and give me a dozen.

1015
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:45,357
There is a boat sailing for Canada
on Friday. You're sailing with it.

1016
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:49,719
I'm not sure I want to go
to Canada .. yet a while.

1017
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:51,779
You haven't much choice, have you?

1018
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,201
I don't know. I'm getting
quite fond of this place.

1019
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,278
The air suits me .. I'm very
happy here for the time being.

1020
01:13:57,712 --> 01:13:59,909
Well, I'm not happy having you here.
- Why?

1021
01:14:01,027 --> 01:14:03,956
Well, it isn't safe since Sister Theresa
knows you are staying here with us.

1022
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:07,129
The wrong sort of talk would bring
the Police around here in no time.

1023
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:09,826
I don't propose to risk a
scandal on your account.

1024
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,484
There is more to it than that.

1025
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:14,914
Lucy is apt to talk.

1026
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:17,383
I don't think we need worry about her.

1027
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:20,578
No. You've made sure of that.

1028
01:14:21,204 --> 01:14:22,556
Whatever do you mean by that?

1029
01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:24,416
You know what you
mean, you cheap little ..

1030
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:26,684
Stop it Ellen. You're going to
make me lose my temper.

1031
01:14:26,784 --> 01:14:27,717
Your temper?

1032
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:30,919
You leave here first thing in the morning.
That's the end of you and your temper.

1033
01:14:31,019 --> 01:14:34,557
I shouldn't try to bluff me if I was you.
- I'm not bluffing you, I'm ordering you.

1034
01:14:34,764 --> 01:14:36,520
And if I shouldn't choose to be ordered?

1035
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:39,511
I can't throw you out physically.
But I can send for the Police.

1036
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:40,765
And have your scandal?

1037
01:14:41,425 --> 01:14:43,625
Really, you're being very
inconsistent now, auntie dear.

1038
01:14:47,747 --> 01:14:49,119
You won't send for the Police.

1039
01:14:50,349 --> 01:14:51,841
Why are you so sure?

1040
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:53,992
Because you've another reason.

1041
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,914
A more important reason for
not wanting the Police here.

1042
01:14:57,546 --> 01:14:59,799
For wanting me out of this
house as quickly as possible.

1043
01:15:01,265 --> 01:15:02,936
As a matter of fact, you are right.

1044
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,124
Ah, now we're getting
down to brass tacks.

1045
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:11,134
Did it concern Miss Fiske by any chance?

1046
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:14,271
It would and it does.

1047
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,769
I met her in town today.
She's coming back.

1048
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:24,068
She's coming back?
- And why shouldn't she?

1049
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:27,138
I thought she'd gone for good.

1050
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:29,345
How utterly absurd of you, Albert.

1051
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,232
There has never been any
question of her not coming back.

1052
01:15:33,753 --> 01:15:35,547
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

1053
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:38,302
Well, you played the fool so
much with Louisa and Emily.

1054
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,693
I was afraid you'd blurt it out.

1055
01:15:42,589 --> 01:15:44,471
As it is, I'll have to
break it to them gently.

1056
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:46,477
Because it means
they will have to go too.

1057
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:54,189
Well, my little country holiday
has obviously come to an end.

1058
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:56,850
I don't know what the
blazes I'll do in Canada.

1059
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:59,325
But I suppose one can starve
there as well as anyone else.

1060
01:15:59,677 --> 01:16:00,790
You'll get on.

1061
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,762
I'll give you a little
something to start off with.

1062
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:05,908
For your mother's sake.

1063
01:16:06,405 --> 01:16:08,376
I suppose I should extend
my most humble thanks.

1064
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:10,540
No. That from you would be too much.

1065
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,664
If that's all we have to say to each
other, I may as well get up to bed.

1066
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:34,237
A good night's sleep wouldn't
do you any harm, either.

1067
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,483
You look a bit played out.

1068
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,698
I must lock up first.

1069
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,157
Will I be seeing you in the
morning before I leave?

1070
01:16:49,557 --> 01:16:50,486
Yes.

1071
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:01,266
Oh, I forgot to tell you, auntie.

1072
01:17:02,138 --> 01:17:03,848
I had a funny dream last night.

1073
01:17:04,814 --> 01:17:05,961
Oh, did you?

1074
01:17:08,636 --> 01:17:10,288
I dreamt Miss Fiske was dead.

1075
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:20,112
Goodnight, auntie.
- Goodnight, Albert.

1076
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,268
Miss Fiske ..

1077
01:19:01,256 --> 01:19:02,361
Ahh!

1078
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:07,625
Albert!

1079
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,953
Albert!

1080
01:19:48,578 --> 01:19:49,733
Good morning, Bates.

1081
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:52,997
Miss Creed ordered me. It's about the
train, but she didn't say which one.

1082
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,626
Bates!

1083
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,975
Cancel it. Miss Creed's
not feeling well.

1084
01:19:57,382 --> 01:20:00,712
Oh, nothing serious I hope, sir?
- No. Nothing serious.

1085
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:04,026
Well in that case,
I'd better be hopping along.

1086
01:20:11,215 --> 01:20:13,479
She did look ill when I
took in her early tea.

1087
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:15,276
I wish we hadn't done it.

1088
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:17,902
Pull yourself together. You'll ruin
everything. Upstairs .. go on!

1089
01:20:18,116 --> 01:20:20,071
She might have died.
- Shut up.

1090
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:24,304
Well she didn't. And we
proved what we wanted.

1091
01:20:24,605 --> 01:20:27,066
Miss Fiske is dead and she knows it.
- I wonder when she died.

1092
01:20:27,262 --> 01:20:30,193
One more go, and I'll tell you when
and how, she died. Now, go on upstairs.

1093
01:20:32,234 --> 01:20:33,778
What did Bates want, Albert?

1094
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:37,339
He brought the news from the outside
world. It will tickle you to death.

1095
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,500
Wigs and whiskers are
coming back in again.

1096
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:43,244
I don't think this is a time for joking,
Albert .. with Ellen the way she is.

1097
01:20:43,455 --> 01:20:45,806
You take the whole thing too
seriously my old brussels-sprout.

1098
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:48,296
She was walking in her sleep
and had a nightmare. That's all.

1099
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:50,738
It wasn't a nightmare, Albert.

1100
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,425
Oh .. what was it then?
- She says she saw a ghost.

1101
01:20:58,326 --> 01:21:00,241
In that case, lay another
place for breakfast.

1102
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:04,083
Do you really think
it was a ghost, Emily?

1103
01:21:04,814 --> 01:21:08,147
If it were only a nightmare,
we wouldn't have heard it too.

1104
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:12,379
Heard what?
- The music. Miss Fiske's music.

1105
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:16,886
Do you know Emily. I'm sometimes afraid
Miss Fiske will get the better of Ellen.

1106
01:21:17,358 --> 01:21:20,210
I sometimes think she wants
to come back and turn us out.

1107
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:23,299
I think Miss Fiske is here .. now.

1108
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:27,506
Well .. what are you
two whispering about?

1109
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,821
Hadn't you better go for your walk now?
- Yes, Ellen.

1110
01:21:31,124 --> 01:21:32,605
Anything you say, Ellen.

1111
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:48,838
Do you think you are
strong enough to be up?

1112
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:52,031
Yes, dear. I'm quite alright now.
- Hadn't you better have a doctor?

1113
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,336
No. A doctor couldn't do any good.

1114
01:22:01,118 --> 01:22:03,274
Why are you two standing
there like a couple of owls?

1115
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:05,790
Emily has been frightening me.

1116
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,724
You've been imagining
things, both of you.

1117
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,719
Now, run along for your walk.

1118
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:12,573
Whatever you say, Ellen. You know best.

1119
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:48,748
Good morning, aunt Ellen.

1120
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:53,848
We didn't expect you down today.

1121
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:56,748
Why aren't you ready yet?

1122
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,898
Bates will be here at any moment.

1123
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,876
Bates has been here and
gone .. I sent him away.

1124
01:23:02,599 --> 01:23:04,832
What do you mean by interfering
with my arrangements?

1125
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:07,308
Well, I didn't like to go and
leave you not feeling well.

1126
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:09,585
I'm quite recovered now, thank you.

1127
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:13,658
It was a queer turn you had
last night .. what happened?

1128
01:23:16,155 --> 01:23:17,012
Nothing.

1129
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:19,792
You know, you should really do
something about your nerves.

1130
01:23:20,064 --> 01:23:22,718
This isn't the first time you've walked
in your sleep, according to Emily.

1131
01:23:24,026 --> 01:23:26,539
What's Emily been telling you?
- Just the usual chatter.

1132
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:30,793
They do say that people who walk in their
sleep have something on their conscience.

1133
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,722
What's behind that remark, Albert?

1134
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:36,788
Nothing.

1135
01:23:56,997 --> 01:23:58,016
You know.

1136
01:23:58,692 --> 01:23:59,725
Uhuh.

1137
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:09,783
Then it was you last night?
- Yes.

1138
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:12,786
Me and Lucy.
- She knows too?

1139
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:16,579
Not what I know. That's something you
and I are going to keep to ourselves.

1140
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,302
Provided of course, you treat me right.

1141
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:22,852
What are you going to do?

1142
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:26,579
Well, as I said, I'm very happy here.

1143
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:29,880
I think with your financial help I'll
be able to adjust things at the bank.

1144
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:33,462
And we can all settle down in peace.
A contented little family.

1145
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,639
You mean, you propose
to go on living here?

1146
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,511
With me?
- Why not?

1147
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,164
Well, you'd never be
quite sure, would you?

1148
01:24:45,991 --> 01:24:47,704
You might not enjoy your meals.

1149
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,741
You wouldn't dare .. a second time.

1150
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,031
It takes a lot of courage to
kill for the first time, Albert.

1151
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,317
Once you've sold your soul to
the Devil it becomes easier.

1152
01:25:01,558 --> 01:25:02,675
Much easier.

1153
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:07,713
Alright .. give me £500 and I'll clear
out for good. And keep my mouth shut.

1154
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:10,215
I'm not afraid of you Albert,
and your shabby little tricks.

1155
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:13,323
In the middle of the night, you may
fancy yourself cutting quite a figure.

1156
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,595
It is broad daylight now.

1157
01:25:16,055 --> 01:25:17,426
[ door knocks ]

1158
01:25:22,761 --> 01:25:23,944
It's those nuns.

1159
01:25:24,482 --> 01:25:27,362
Get that out of sight.
And yourself with it.

1160
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,002
[ door knocks ]

1161
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:41,311
Good day, Sisters.
- I must talk to you, right away.

1162
01:25:41,997 --> 01:25:44,842
Are you alone?
- Why yes .. what's the matter?

1163
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:49,451
It is really none of my business
and I shouldn't have come but ..

1164
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,419
The Police. They've been to the Priory.
- What about?

1165
01:25:52,973 --> 01:25:54,653
They are searching for a young man.

1166
01:25:55,095 --> 01:25:57,671
Who stole money from a
bank over Gravesend way.

1167
01:25:58,212 --> 01:26:01,295
And from the description,
I suspect it was your nephew.

1168
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,680
And I thought, if he were told, he might
have a chance to do the right thing.

1169
01:26:06,213 --> 01:26:07,596
And give himself up.

1170
01:26:08,675 --> 01:26:10,261
It is your nephew?
- Yes.

1171
01:26:10,825 --> 01:26:14,130
But they mustn't search here.
- They've gone to the Coyne farm first.

1172
01:26:14,553 --> 01:26:16,139
I heard one of them say so.

1173
01:26:17,097 --> 01:26:20,813
Oh Miss Ellen. Have I done
wrong in coming to warn you?

1174
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:23,773
I don't know, Sister.

1175
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,719
I had a brother rather like that.

1176
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:28,938
He went wrong too.

1177
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,618
People are so easily lost, aren't they?

1178
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:35,575
Yes, they are.

1179
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:38,511
Poor girl. You have so many burdens.

1180
01:26:39,162 --> 01:26:42,342
If you are referring to Albert.
He means absolutely nothing to me.

1181
01:26:43,143 --> 01:26:44,543
No-one does for that matter.

1182
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,843
Except Emily and Louisa.

1183
01:26:48,365 --> 01:26:53,486
If, any time, we can do anything to make
things easier for you or your sisters ..

1184
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,078
Don't hesitate to turn to us.

1185
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:58,181
That is very kind of
you, Sister Theresa.

1186
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:00,509
But you know, we are not of your faith.

1187
01:27:01,152 --> 01:27:04,017
In my Father's house are many mansions.

1188
01:27:10,364 --> 01:27:11,837
Blimey, I thought they'd never go.

1189
01:27:12,013 --> 01:27:13,715
Thanks for putting in
a good word for me.

1190
01:27:15,247 --> 01:27:16,837
The Coyne farm, is it?

1191
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:19,448
That will give me a chance to
get behind them to the river.

1192
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,951
Hurry. There is no time to lose.
- Yes, I'll get my clothes.

1193
01:27:36,482 --> 01:27:37,496
Lucy.

1194
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,574
Why are you staring at me like that?

1195
01:27:47,259 --> 01:27:48,389
You've been listening.

1196
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,011
Lucy!

1197
01:27:53,847 --> 01:27:55,077
Lucy, come back!

1198
01:27:56,673 --> 01:27:57,922
Lucy, come back.

1199
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:01,729
What's up?

1200
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,539
Well, what is it?
- Lucy has run off.

1201
01:28:08,547 --> 01:28:09,842
She was listening.

1202
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:13,091
Turn me in, would she?

1203
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,946
I've got to move fast.
Where's that money and boat ticket?

1204
01:28:21,783 --> 01:28:23,304
You mean, she heard all about that?

1205
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,225
Yes.

1206
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:31,860
Hey .. you'd better
make a dash for it, too!

1207
01:28:46,271 --> 01:28:47,740
Don't stand there mooning about.

1208
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:49,909
Put your things on and
let's get out of here.

1209
01:28:52,816 --> 01:28:53,999
I'm not going.

1210
01:28:56,844 --> 01:28:58,130
Are you out of your mind?

1211
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:03,883
You know what they'll do to you?
- You'd better hurry, Albert.

1212
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,581
Well, if that don't beat the cards.

1213
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,710
Well then ..

1214
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:14,516
So long Ellen .. no hard feelings.

1215
01:29:49,121 --> 01:29:50,486
Oh Ellen, it was so funny.

1216
01:29:50,955 --> 01:29:53,922
We just saw Albert. He was
playing "tag" with some men.

1217
01:29:54,129 --> 01:29:56,069
He didn't win .. they caught him.

1218
01:29:56,298 --> 01:29:57,556
He got quite annoyed.

1219
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:03,068
Oh Ellen, look. We found
a lot of jackdaw feathers.

1220
01:30:03,302 --> 01:30:06,025
We are going to tie them into
bundles and make little dusters.

1221
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,492
Where are you going?

1222
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:11,816
I'm going to Coyne farm.

1223
01:30:12,298 --> 01:30:14,887
There are some gentlemen there from
Gravesend and I want to see them.

1224
01:30:15,068 --> 01:30:16,974
You won't bring them
back here, will you Ellen.

1225
01:30:17,228 --> 01:30:19,134
It is so nice and peaceful by ourselves.

1226
01:30:20,007 --> 01:30:22,812
No, dear. I'll try not to
bring them back here.

1227
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:35,655
You have been happy here, haven't you?
- We are happy here, aren't we Emily?

1228
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:38,249
Yes .. it is much better than London.

1229
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,897
It îs so good of you to have
bought this house for us.

1230
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:43,035
You have been clever, Ellen.

1231
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,632
How long will you be?

1232
01:31:08,778 --> 01:31:10,031
I don't know, dear.

1233
01:31:10,562 --> 01:31:12,115
Maybe quite ä time.

1234
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:15,317
I think I shall go down
to The Priory tomorrow.

1235
01:31:15,914 --> 01:31:18,728
I should like to see the things the
Reverend Mother collected on the marsh.

1236
01:31:18,965 --> 01:31:20,045
I'll go with you.

1237
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:29,371
Goodbye, Ellen .. don't worry about us.

1238
01:31:29,816 --> 01:31:31,460
We can look after ourselves.

1239
01:32:12,774 --> 01:32:13,678
T-G öö
