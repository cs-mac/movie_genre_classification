1
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:09,427
<i>And you instigated the murder
of former Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon</i>

2
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,464
<i>On those charges
I am reporting against you.</i>

3
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,515
<i>What kind of situation is this?</i>

4
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:15,926
<i>Aigoo...</i>

5
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:18,536
<i>Oh my!</i>

6
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:21,046
Admit your crimes now.

7
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:24,606
You instigated the murder of the Prime Minister
and you gave the order to abduct the child.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,106
What are you talking about now?

9
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,656
It's true that I met Doctor Im,

10
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:33,666
but I went that night
because I was feeling ill.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:40,616
The doctor's office was closed. My primary-care physician is a
quack, so I saw Eun Gang's primary-care doctor for a short time.

12
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:43,496
How does that turn into
instigation of murder?

13
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:45,267
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

14
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:50,347
It isn't true he ordered
the child's kidnapping,

15
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,627
because the child Il Joo brought

16
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,507
isn't Shin Eun Soo's child.

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,676
<i>What is this nonsense going on?</i>

18
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,596
Is that true?

19
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:13,776
Quiet, please.

20
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,366
Quiet or whatever!

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,756
Hey, did you have our father killed?

22
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:20,357
Come here!

23
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:23,057
<i>Honey. Please stop.</i>

24
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,917
<i>Order! Order!</i>

25
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:31,527
The court is adjourned. Clear the court!

26
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,046
Hey, you punk! What kind of son

27
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:49,596
goes around finding evidence his father is an
instigator of murder? Don't you have a conscience?

28
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:53,827
No, I take after my
father, so I don't. Why?

29
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:59,536
You taught me since I was a kid.

30
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,016
The weak fall prey to the strong,
and the world is a jungle.

31
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,316
Don't have sympathy for the weak.

32
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,766
Don't even shed a tear.
You beat that into me.

33
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,906
Yes, you bastard. I'm still your father!

34
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:13,966
I suffered through everything and came this
far in order to pass everything down to you.

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,627
How can you do that to me?

36
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,427
Are you crying, father?

37
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,386
A man can become weak after all.

38
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:28,336
I think your innocence was proven.

39
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,647
I think it'll be hard to put
Kwon Soo Myeong behind bars.

40
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:36,816
That guy... I expected him to be shameless,
but I didn't know it would be that bad.

41
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:40,026
We can't put him behind bars with
just Kim Gyeong Min's testimony?

42
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,216
Not to that extent.

43
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:45,307
Because he's denying even knowing about it.

44
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:49,317
Along with stealing Prime Minister Kang's
slush funds and laundering the money,

45
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:55,017
that's hard to pin on him unless Moon Seon
Ho makes a declaration of conscience.

46
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:59,606
The most important thing is to investigate the
Prime Minister's murder. We have to reveal it.

47
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,067
You heard it.

48
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:04,627
He won't even admit that he
met the attending physician.

49
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:09,936
Before we catch Im Dong
Jun, it'll be difficult.

50
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:13,977
Il Joo even sacrificed herself to do that.

51
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,766
<i>You try.</i>

52
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,086
<i>- No, I don't want to.- Why?</i>

53
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:50,126
<i>That doll looks impossible to grasp.
What if I really want it no matter what?</i>

54
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,276
<i>You can just keep trying
until you run out of coins.</i>

55
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:54,756
<i>And what if I still don't get it?</i>

56
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,846
<i>Then, it can't be helped.</i>

57
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,076
<i>We can't break the machine
just to get a doll.</i>

58
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,736
<i>I'm afraid I'll want to do that.</i>

59
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:03,987
<i>What?</i>

60
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:08,797
<i>What are you saying...
should we try once more?</i>

61
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:18,176
<i>Are you done?</i>

62
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,617
<i>Let me see.</i>

63
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,046
<i>Go to the karaoke room, take sticker
photos, go to the amusement park.</i>

64
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,596
<i>Oh, this is the same. Pitch
a tent and camp out.</i>

65
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:30,686
<i>This one, too. Backpacking
trip around the world.</i>

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,817
<i>Oh... Yeah!</i>

67
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:39,256
<i>To be honest, I've never done
these with any of my friends.</i>

68
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:40,917
<i>Me neither.</i>

69
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:46,997
<i>As you know, I'm everyone's enemy at school for
living in the same house as Jin Hyeong Woo.</i>

70
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:55,427
<i>So what I'm saying is, I like that
you're here because you're my friend.</i>

71
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:00,827
<i>Wow. But doing all this
will take about ten years.</i>

72
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:04,556
<i>Everything written down here,
we're going to try everything.</i>

73
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,696
<i>Yes. Let's do it.</i>

74
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,406
<i>How about this? Bungee jump?</i>

75
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,696
<i>No, let me think about that.
My heart... bounce...</i>

76
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:14,407
<i>- No...- Bounce</i>

77
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,757
Il Joo.

78
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:41,347
I told you to come to the house,
why did you want to meet here?

79
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:46,816
Because of Mi Rae, it's still
awkward to see Il Do and Il Ran.

80
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:51,097
I talked to the family members already.
Don't worry.

81
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:55,506
I'll go before I turn myself
into the police tomorrow.

82
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:58,297
Now, I just want to meet you alone.

83
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:01,367
Why did you do it?

84
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,707
You didn't have to do that.

85
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,236
My Mi Rae is also certain
that you didn't do it.

86
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,036
I felt like I wouldn't feel comfortable.

87
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,167
As my father said,

88
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,077
I don't want to live my entire
life carrying embarrassment.

89
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:27,637
Now that I think about it, Eun Soo, I must
have been messed up since I was little.

90
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:36,087
If there was something I wanted, I had to
have it even if I broke something else.

91
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,337
Mom tried her best to raise me.

92
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:45,817
It must have been because
I grew up so lonely.

93
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,777
I understand it all now, Il Joo.

94
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,687
Someday,

95
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,917
after I pay for my crimes,

96
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:11,177
will we be able to go back to the
dreaming mind like in high school?

97
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:17,917
We can go to karaoke rooms together,
pitch a tent, and camp out.

98
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:23,047
And we go on a backpacking
trip around the world.

99
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,837
I'm sorry, Eun Soo.

100
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:38,157
I have no friend other than you,

101
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,917
but I am so sorry toward you.

102
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:50,617
Why did we live like this?

103
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,026
Look here, Prosecutor Jeong, wasn't it
decided I'd be indicted but not detained?

104
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:09,306
But why do you keep calling me here
and being bothersome? I'm a busy man.

105
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,296
You must have heard from
your Chief Prosecutor.

106
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,756
What Jin Hyeong Woo said was true.

107
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:19,336
You stole Prime Minister Kang's money, fabricated
the evidence, and laid the blame on Shin Eun Soo.

108
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:22,206
Do you have evidence that I did that?

109
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:25,456
Jin Hyeong Woo could have that money, too.

110
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:28,476
This young guy has no manners.

111
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,076
Can you make your way in
career if you act this way?

112
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,956
Prosecutor Jeong, let's keep it simple.

113
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:38,093
Don't try so hard without any
evidence, and go easy at the trial.

114
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:43,216
Do you think I studied my ♪ss off
to make these kinds of deals?

115
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:46,636
He doesn't seem to
understand what I'm saying.

116
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:50,796
Do you have any evidence that I did that?

117
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,907
Prosecutor, someone is here to see you.

118
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,077
Who might you be?

119
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,686
I am the evidence.

120
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:06,607
I am the launderer for
Kwon Soo Myeong's money.

121
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,756
From nine years ago until now.

122
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:16,007
And framing Shin Eun Soo, I
did that on his instructions.

123
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,396
You must be crazy. Pull yourself together.

124
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,156
If you do this, do you think you
won't be punished under the law?

125
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,267
If I was afraid of that,
would I have come here?

126
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:30,767
Let's die together, Kwon Soo Myeong.

127
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,406
Why did he report you?

128
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,766
There's even word that you instigated the murder of
former Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon. Is it true?

129
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,436
<i>Everyone step back!</i>

130
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:44,866
<i>President Kwon, just say one word?</i>

131
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,226
<i>- President!- President,
please say something.</i>

132
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:50,736
<i>- Please say something!- President!
President!</i>

133
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:55,166
<i>President Kwon Soo Myeong of Taepyeong
Daily News was charged today.</i>

134
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,876
<i>President Kwon was arrested on a charge of smuggling
astronomical amounts of money out of country</i>

135
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:01,526
<i>and making a false accusation
of instigating murder</i>

136
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:05,006
<i>against the late Kang Seok
Hyeon's widow, Shin Eun Soo.</i>

137
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,946
<i>The person who revealed President
Kwon Soo Myeong's criminal activities</i>

138
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:12,286
<i>was revealed to be someone named Moon
Seon Ho, who laundered his money.</i>

139
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,546
<i>Moon Seon Ho is being imprisoned
along with President Kwon—</i>

140
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,026
Who is Moon Seon Ho?

141
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,506
More important, what happened to the
instigation of Father's murder?

142
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:22,286
Be quiet so we can hear.

143
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,266
<i>The former Prime Minister's family insist President
Kwon was the one who instigated his murder,</i>

144
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,706
<i>but the Prosecutors have revealed that
that they have no evidence of this.</i>

145
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:32,426
<i>The key point is whether they can catch</i>

146
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:36,387
<i>the former Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon's primary
physician, Im Dong Joon, who fled to Singapore.</i>

147
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:34,227
I understand what you said now.

148
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,987
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:47,686
Now I'm going to leave that path.

150
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,107
I'll take a few years.

151
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,697
I'll be back, Father.

152
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:10,397
For all this time, I've
been sorry and thankful.

153
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,677
I'm going.

154
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:22,006
Where are you going now?

155
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,506
Hey, where do you think you're
setting foot? Get out immediately!

156
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:32,357
You don't really want to
turn yourself in, do you?

157
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,646
Why?

158
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:39,376
How could we be on such different pages?

159
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:41,276
How could you betray me?

160
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:45,536
Don't you know that your
father killed mine?

161
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:49,066
- What's that? - Oh, that psycho. Hey!

162
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,467
- Shut up. - Oh, my, what?

163
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:56,856
It should've been enough that I
protected you from my father.

164
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,586
I would take over Father's position,

165
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:01,036
and we could live happily forever.
That was the plan.

166
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:03,136
The Il Joo I've seen till now; glance,

167
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:07,146
expression, words, actions.
All of them told me that!

168
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:09,307
I already sent the divorce
papers to the attorney.

169
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:13,253
Please take care of it with the attorney.

170
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,586
Divorce? You want to divorce again?!

171
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,006
Did I kill your father?! How? How?!

172
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,996
How?! How could you abandon me?! How?!?!

173
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:24,606
How could you abandon me?!?!?!!??!

174
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,196
LET GO!

175
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,636
IL JOO! IL JOO! LET GO!

176
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,936
LET GO! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF!!

177
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,946
LET GO!! LET GO!!!!!!!

178
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:41,756
I'm talking about Mi Rae's dad. I didn't expect him to
voluntarily step forward even allowing himself to be charged.

179
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:47,557
I felt like I should at least say something, so I
went to visit him in prison, but he won't see me.

180
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,327
But right now... what is this feeling?

181
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:59,837
He went to jail, which he had tried to avoid even
by changing his identity and losing his arm.

182
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,316
He struggled a lot because of
his unfortunate childhood.

183
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:06,977
His life was put up as collateral to Kwon
Soo Myeong, so he was controlled by him.

184
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:17,927
I can't help but think his life
must have been exhausting, too.

185
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,926
I'm foolish, to think this, am I not?

186
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,277
No.

187
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,757
This is how you originally looked.

188
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,937
Innocent and nice.

189
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,517
He would've liked you before too.

190
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:42,157
That's why he returned and
became a witness for you.

191
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,466
Hey, hey, look here.

192
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,996
You think this is fit for a person to eat?

193
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:55,986
If you aren't satisfied with it,
you'd better buy your own food.

194
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:59,236
There is not much difference between this and
that. That's not fit for a person to eat either.

195
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,786
I've never seen such small
and tough meat in my life.

196
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:04,856
Is this some kind of hotel?
You're in prison.

197
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:07,206
You rascal... do you know who I am?

198
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,186
I am the boss at the greatest media company,
who holds and controls Korea under his thumb.

199
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:12,456
But you're in prison now.

200
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:15,326
Ah, whatever. If you're not going to
eat it, give it back. I'll take it.

201
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:18,357
It's fine!

202
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:32,536
What are you doing, not using the
perfect lawyer's reception room?

203
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:36,466
I am sorry about that. Because of the public
opinion, we can't use the lawyer's reception room.

204
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:41,616
Anyhow, these people don't leave
anything that helps me alone.

205
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,556
Anyway, when can I get out of here?

206
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:46,246
I'm dying here! Get me out of here!

207
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,366
The lawyer group is working
on the upper authorities.

208
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,427
And our side of the assemblymen
is covering the petition as well.

209
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:56,696
Please endure until the trial.
You'll be released on probation.

210
00:15:56,697 --> 00:16:00,296
That's a given!

211
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:03,616
No matter how I think about it,
the trial date is too far away.

212
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,496
How can I stay here until then?

213
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:10,466
Do whatever you can to move the date up.

214
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:11,716
I'll do what I can.

215
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:16,037
Why doesn't Moo Hyeok visit me, his
father, even once while I am in jail?

216
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,646
Can I ask why you changed your mind?

217
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:56,707
Like you said, I'm only trying to repay
that woman back for seven years ago.

218
00:16:58,037 --> 00:16:59,956
Is the egg hitting the boulder going well?

219
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:02,717
Thanks to you I was halfway successful.

220
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:10,326
But in order to have him get all of his
due, there's someone we need to find.

221
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,676
Are you talking about that
primary-care physician?

222
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,177
He ran away to Singapore.

223
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:19,917
When I looked into you, you
also emigrated to Singapore.

224
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,867
Could you tell me about that country?

225
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,036
You seem to know a lot about
the dark side of its routes.

226
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:32,757
Since it isn't anyone else, but in order to
catch Kwon Soo Myeong, I'll give you a tip.

227
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,027
I hate him quite a lot too.

228
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:44,177
How much guts the primary-care physician
has, he must not use his true identity.

229
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:50,066
Seven years ago, I also got a new identity as
Brian Moon through a Chinese gang organization.

230
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:53,647
In that area, everything has to
go through that organization.

231
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:58,337
We might just be able to
locate him through them.

232
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,697
Where is that?

233
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:10,566
I still heave a sigh of relief.

234
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:14,517
Stop making me so upset.

235
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,297
I'm sorry, Mom.

236
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:25,606
In any case, I saw it all over the TV news,
that old president getting taken away.

237
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:33,416
Anyhow, the person who helped you...
what's he called? Moon... Seon... Ho?

238
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:37,046
Aigoo, thanks to him. I felt as if my
life had been shortened by ten years.

239
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:41,577
But who is he that he would
do such a grateful deed?

240
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,407
Mom!

241
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,507
Mi Rae!

242
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,246
Mi Rae!

243
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,306
Mom, aren't I doing well?

244
00:18:56,307 --> 00:19:00,116
Good job, my puppy!

245
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:05,506
Now you can speak well.
And she is so strong.

246
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:09,586
Mi Rae, are you exercising
a lot with the nurse?

247
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,526
Is that why you're strong?

248
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,446
I worked hard.

249
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:16,287
Sure, sure.

250
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,636
I told Moo Hyeok to come, why are you here?

251
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:33,276
That rascal doesn't listen
to a word his father says...

252
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,286
President,

253
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,746
Did something happen?

254
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:45,636
Actually, Executive Director showed symptoms
of mental illness and set fire to the house.

255
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:49,136
The fire spread quite far, and the house
is almost completely burned down.

256
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:53,716
What? That crazy punk.

257
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:56,406
So? Is he alive?

258
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,586
What about my safe?

259
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:03,986
Look here, Kwon Moo Hyeok, did you
commit arson? Do you admit it?

260
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,777
Our Il Joo...

261
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:15,277
Where is my Il Joo?

262
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,037
Please tell her to come here.

263
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,237
My Il Joo...

264
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:40,317
Eun Gang,

265
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:44,397
are you looking at me from up there?

266
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,187
What state is this to be in?

267
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:13,007
I wanted to contact you
before I came in here,

268
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:16,557
but I couldn't bear to face you.

269
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,106
I thought you'd come here once though.

270
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:22,667
Is it bearable?

271
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:27,996
- It's not too difficult?- It's a little
hard physically, but my mind is at peace.

272
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:30,107
Thanks for being courageous.

273
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:35,847
And ultimately it was that courage that
allowed your heart to be at peace.

274
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:39,717
All my shame isn't gone.

275
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,957
I'm still really sorry towards you.

276
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:52,937
Sixteen years ago, stealing that document
and putting it in Eun Soo's bag,

277
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:56,607
I sincerely apologize for that.

278
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:02,207
That's what started this whole tragedy.

279
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:10,527
It caused your father to die, and
it split up you and Eun Soo.

280
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,676
But towards you who
continued to love Eun Soo,

281
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:21,227
I felt so much resentment and hate.

282
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:27,277
That shame won't disappear no
matter how much time passes.

283
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,567
I'm really sorry.

284
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:36,657
The same goes for me.

285
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,617
Because of my desire for vengeance,

286
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,297
I used you for 15 years.

287
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,057
Don't feel guilty.

288
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,987
I feel a little better since you say that.

289
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:57,907
Since the law convicts you
of the crime you committed,

290
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,737
when you finish serving your sentence,

291
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:07,817
you'll probably be able to feel free.
But I'm not sure about me.

292
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:13,267
Actually, I want to go in there, too.

293
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,476
What are you talking about?

294
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:19,377
With the mind of hating someone,

295
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,397
using them and betraying them.

296
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:28,227
I killed them a hundred times in my heart.

297
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:33,396
The life I've lived until now was all fake.

298
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:36,047
For me, being here on the outside

299
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,327
is more suffering than being in jail.

300
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,227
Eun Soo will melt away

301
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:49,996
that suffering.

302
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:52,727
Eun Soo will have a harder time than me.

303
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,787
Eun Soo and I

304
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,687
can't become happy this way.

305
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:00,436
The trial of President Kwon Soo
Myeong is taking place here today.

306
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:02,876
President Kwon, who is on a charge
of smuggling ₩1 trillion abroad,

307
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:07,236
including the late Prime Minister
Kang Seok Hyeon's slush fund,

308
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:10,806
<i>and President Kwon's oldest son Kwon Joon Hyeok, who
helped steal the late Prime Minister Kang's slush fund,</i>

309
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:15,146
<i>and came from America,
will stand trial together.</i>

310
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,726
<i>Also, the second son, Kwon Moo Hyeok has been
arrested on a charge of instigating the murder.</i>

311
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,386
<i>The three of them seem to be
going to trial side by side.</i>

312
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,246
Defendant Kwon Joon Hyeok,
do you admit your guilt?

313
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:28,006
Yes, I acknowledge it.

314
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,646
Defendant Kwon Moo Hyeok,
do you admit your guilt?

315
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:34,076
Where is my Il Joo?

316
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:38,456
Please put me in the same cell as Il Joo.

317
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:41,316
Please, Your Honor.

318
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:43,957
I want to be with Il Joo.

319
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:47,586
Defendant Kwon Soo Myeong,
do you admit your guilt?

320
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,797
I'm sick so I don't have
the strength to respond.

321
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:56,897
<i>How could he say that?</i>

322
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,347
Your Honor!

323
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:07,036
We have to restart the trial
for President Kwon Soo Myeong.

324
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:10,396
Who heedlessly comes into my
courtroom and makes such noise?

325
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:12,306
Bailiffs, remove him.

326
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,506
Wait just a moment!

327
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,147
Please see this person
before having your say.

328
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:23,607
Who is that?

329
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:35,487
I arrested Dr. Im Dong Joon, who murdered the late Prime Minister
Kang Seok Hyeong, in the south Pacific and brought him here.

330
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:52,927
I did cause the pacemaker to malfunction.

331
00:26:54,597 --> 00:27:00,057
The one who gave me ₩20 billion and ordered
me to do it was President Kwon Soo Myeong.

332
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:04,817
Hey, Doctor Im, how could you do that?

333
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:08,327
<i>How could you do that to our father?</i>

334
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:13,227
Quiet! Quiet!

335
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:22,397
<i>In that moment, strangely
I didn't feel enraged.</i>

336
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:30,267
<i>Everything was over, but it
didn't seem like the end.</i>

337
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:35,537
<i>I felt like I had lost
my way in a heavy fog.</i>

338
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:43,017
<i>While living, is it possible
not to hate anyone?</i>

339
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:48,147
<i>Can the world be changed with good?</i>

340
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:55,487
<i>The war between good and evil occurring
in my mind several dozen times a day</i>

341
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,267
<i>will never find a victor.</i>

342
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:08,657
<i>Flowers bloom, the sun
gives warmth, leaves fade.</i>

343
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:14,016
<i>Even though the heavy snow
buries my past sins in my mind,</i>

344
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:18,377
<i>my life won't change.</i>

345
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:31,897
<i>In the brief moment of less than half
of my lifetime, too much has happened.</i>

346
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:42,227
<i>Even while I try to organize
my thoughts, I can't.</i>

347
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,927
<i>Where am I headed?</i>

348
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:56,717
<i>Will I be able to find myself?</i>

349
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:08,667
<i>Inmates Entrance</i>

350
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:27,566
I said I wouldn't see you, why do
you keep coming and bothering me?

351
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,567
I thought I should see you once.

352
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,007
Thank you.

353
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:42,966
I think I'll be able to tell Mi
Rae that you were a good person

354
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,006
as I did before.

355
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:47,077
Don't say things like that.

356
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:49,927
You know.

357
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:54,406
I approached you from the beginning
on Kwon Soo Myeong's orders.

358
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:57,626
I ran away abroad with ₩2 billion, abandoning
you in the last month of your pregnancy.

359
00:29:57,627 --> 00:30:00,717
Even when I returned, it was
me who put you into the trap.

360
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,546
I'm not a good person at all.

361
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:09,216
Still, in the end, you
stood on the good side.

362
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:13,097
It was because Kwon Soo Myeong tried
to kill me, it wasn't because of you.

363
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:16,426
Listen well,

364
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:19,247
I'm someone who's been erased forever.

365
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:24,817
Don't talk about me to Mi
Rae and don't come here.

366
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:31,597
When my sentence is over, I'm
going back to the south Pacific.

367
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,267
There are many more women
better than you there.

368
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:45,507
Jin Hyeong Woo is a decent man.

369
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,877
Live well at least starting now.

370
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:14,047
<i>Sentencing for Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon's Murderers: Im Dong Joon Gets Life, Kwon
Soo Myeong 15 Years, Kwon Joon Hyeok 2 Years, Kwon Moo Hyeok 3 Years in Mental Hospital</i>

371
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,267
<i>And the wind is blowing.</i>

372
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:23,137
<i>I still haven't decided where to go.</i>

373
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:31,547
<i>I should now go to the person
I'm supposed to go to.</i>

374
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:38,957
<i>But I have too many fearful
burdens in my heart.</i>

375
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:06,207
Go inside.

376
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:24,977
Hyeong Woo.

377
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:30,787
I can't go back to the way I felt before.

378
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:38,467
I don't think we'll be able
to walk this path again.

379
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,777
So much has happened during this time.

380
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:57,977
In a furious storm,

381
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,897
we didn't have room to
look back in our minds.

382
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:12,927
When everything was over, I thought
I could be happy with you.

383
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:23,316
But what went wrong?

384
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,327
It might not even be love.

385
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:32,677
Well...

386
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,367
Love?

387
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:41,057
Something different from that

388
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:46,617
is weighing down on me.

389
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:54,617
Could it be you felt indebted to me for
letting go of my hand 16 years ago?

390
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,367
That isn't it.

391
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,707
Lovers who meet in the midst of war,

392
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:08,017
have an intense feeling
of love for each other.

393
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:15,247
However, they say that those lovers
part ways when the war is over.

394
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:23,087
Because they weren't able
to experience normal love.

395
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:27,947
I wonder if that was the same for us?

396
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:33,037
I've come back to my position now.

397
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:37,727
So you don't have to feel indebted anymore.

398
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:44,697
You fully did everything
you could to protect me.

399
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:53,167
So go and find your happiness now.

400
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:58,557
I'll be going.

401
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,017
<i>Three years later</i>

402
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:32,116
Hey, Soo Ri!

403
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:36,006
If you go around hugging boys already, it
will be trouble. Looks aren't everything!

404
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:39,446
What's wrong with that? It's
all part of growing up.

405
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:41,466
You never know, we may end up as in-laws.

406
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:45,406
Hey! Quit that ridiculous talk!

407
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:50,906
Soo Ri, Soo Ri, My Soo Ri, there'll
be more than 100 men in your life,

408
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:55,246
but do you want to set your life already at the age
of three? Yoon Ho is absolutely a "no-touch," got it?

409
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:59,226
After a kid grows up, you can tell how he looks, but with the
theory of the good-looking parents bearing a good-looking son,

410
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:01,926
it'll be hard to find looks
like my Yoon Ho. Right?

411
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:07,736
Hey. Beauty can be upgraded
by a few alterations.

412
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:10,566
What use is a handsome husband? Do
you live by eating a handsome face?

413
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,186
That's how you think. Soo Ri
might have other thoughts.

414
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:15,986
- Hey!- Right?

415
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:18,676
We have more calls to acquire the business.

416
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,506
The franchise fee is less
than other franchises.

417
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:24,326
Rumors seem to say the
training is run properly, too.

418
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:29,056
President... If there's a
store left over, can I...

419
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:32,266
You can't.

420
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:36,256
He's worked hard all this time,
how about giving him a chance?

421
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:39,766
He might just have a knack for business.

422
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:43,586
That would be leaving a
fish market to a cat.

423
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,366
You're too much!

424
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:50,426
This manly Kang Il Do has worked without being paid or
complaining under the renewing-myself project for three years.

425
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:53,956
Is it... that I've been exploited?

426
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:59,776
Do you recall emptying my Il
Ran's safe three years ago?

427
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:03,726
The wedding jewelry I had
given her was in there, too.

428
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:09,206
If you were to count that, you wouldn't be able to
repay that even if you worked for free forever.

429
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:14,766
Truthfully, being born as the first-born in
this family, I haven't been given a cent,

430
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,766
don't you feel sorry for me?

431
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:20,156
Feel sorry for you? In a house
where you don't pay rent,

432
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:25,117
you eat three meals a day,
what should I feel sorry for?

433
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:28,876
Just look at the Chairwoman.

434
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,977
<i>Chairwoman Shin Eun Soo</i>

435
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:37,036
Because we got more donors, we are planning to expand
our support to more senior centers and orphanages.

436
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,456
Please increase the staff, too.

437
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,236
How about welfare centers? Isn't there any
problem for the budget bill submitted last time?

438
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:48,576
No. There isn't any problem with the budget
because sufficient funds have been secured.

439
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:52,006
Hello, everybody!

440
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:54,197
Il Ran!

441
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:59,617
What's going on? After moving out, did your affection
for me cool off? How can you not even visit once?

442
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,746
I thought you'd be busy raising Soo Ri.

443
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:06,886
She's growing up on her own. The
house feels completely empty.

444
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:09,786
Are you seeing anyone?

445
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,916
Oh my, when would she find time
to date when she's this busy?

446
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:18,326
Hey! I'm not talking about a man right now.

447
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:21,857
Is there another woman you're seeing that
you're keeping your distance from me?

448
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,986
Mom!

449
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,836
Oh, Mi Rae! Are you already
coming back from piano lessons?

450
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:31,386
I practiced since early this morning.

451
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:33,066
You worked even though it's Sunday?

452
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:34,666
I have a lot of work these days.

453
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:38,727
Mom, hurry, hurry! I'll show you
what I learned on the piano today!

454
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:11,346
To take everything you got in the will
and turn it over to the foundation,

455
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:16,316
three years ago or ten years ago,
why are we still living like this?

456
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:17,936
Aigoo. I feel upset.

457
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:22,136
If even one-tenth of that money was left over,
you could have at least bought Mi Rae a piano.

458
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,697
I save money in installment savings.

459
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:30,017
I'm going to buy Mi Rae a
piano with the money I earn.

460
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:44,986
President, it's going to be lunchtime
soon and I'm so busy. Why are we here?

461
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:48,847
Because there's something to
take care of, just follow me.

462
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,767
Good grief.

463
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:01,816
You've deposited faithfully every
month for three years now.

464
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,876
It matures next month, are you going
to withdraw the funds at that time?

465
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:09,826
What is this? You dragged me here in
the morning to brag about your money?

466
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:13,356
Someone's been working like a dog for three
years and hasn't even touched money.

467
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:17,856
Why would you tie it up for three years?
A man should know how to spend.

468
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:22,456
I think I'm going to have
to tie it up even more.

469
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:26,996
This account owner doesn't appear
to have his act together yet.

470
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:30,056
Then do I redeposit it
under Kang Il Do's name?

471
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:34,976
President, is this really mine? Really?

472
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:41,616
It was obvious if I gave it to you as salary,
you would have squandered it the very next day.

473
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:45,916
So I carefully saved it up for you.

474
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,556
You've gone through much hardship working
at the restaurant all this time.

475
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,337
President!

476
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,917
Wait, why are you hugging me?

477
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:02,966
- Then let's work hard for
just seven more years.- What?

478
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:07,316
We have to fulfill the ten
years from your father's will.

479
00:41:07,317 --> 00:41:10,196
I'll give this to you at that time.

480
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:14,857
President, I mean, In-law Ma,

481
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:29,996
- Moo Hyeok, when did you get
out?- It's been a few days.

482
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:33,606
Hey, kid! Then you should have come
to see your father, I've been dying.

483
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,436
What were you doing that
you're just coming now?

484
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:41,956
You're sentenced to 15 years but in just three you got out on
suspension of execution of sentence. What are you whining about?

485
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,716
You're feigning illness, aren't you?

486
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:48,476
No, I'm not. There isn't
anything that doesn't hurt.

487
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:52,376
The Prime Minister was released on
sick bail and went around freely.

488
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:55,786
But, they don't let me out of
here, it's just like jail.

489
00:41:55,787 --> 00:41:59,037
I should have gone to a
mental hospital like you.

490
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:04,007
You deliberately acted insane
to avoid jail, didn't you?

491
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:08,537
You're the one who said I was insane.

492
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:13,256
But, Father. Do you know
anything about Il Joo?

493
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:17,766
Hey, you. Even now, you
think of that backstabber?

494
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:21,017
Yes. I think of her every day.

495
00:42:23,347 --> 00:42:26,386
Your own children are of no use.

496
00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:30,156
Joon Hyeok went to the States
as soon as he got out of jail.

497
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:35,786
The company went bankrupt, and there's
no word from the grandchildren.

498
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,096
You're the only one here.

499
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,396
What have I done so wrong in my
past life to turn out like this?

500
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:45,277
It wasn't your past life,
you did a lot in this one.

501
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:49,087
You crazy punk.

502
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:57,806
Is this Kang Yoo Gyeong's teacher
certification with the ink not dried yet?

503
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,246
How is your work?

504
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,216
Why do you bother asking?

505
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:05,666
The third level of the internet reporter is always
called "Reggie."<i>(Reggie = report + garbage in Korean)</i>

506
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,406
Still, this Kwon Ah Reum will
receive the Pulitzer Prize someday.

507
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:13,796
I know you were avoiding Beom Soo so
carefully, but do you know how he's doing?

508
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:17,466
Last time, Beom Soo failed his bar exam.

509
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,347
Really?

510
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:24,196
You guys, why are you talking
about me behind my back?

511
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:27,446
You cut off a friend who's preparing
for an exam and don't cheer him on,

512
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:31,216
you have no loyalty.

513
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:32,316
What are you doing here?

514
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:35,936
What? What? You're always popping
up, can't I do the same?

515
00:43:35,937 --> 00:43:39,676
I called him here. After hearing that I
could finally contact you, Beom Soo...

516
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:41,076
I gotta go.

517
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,746
Hey, where are you running off to?
Sit down.

518
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:46,476
You better take responsibility
for me not passing my exam.

519
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:48,596
It's because you were disturbing me.

520
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:52,666
Hey, that isn't a fact. When,
where, how and why would I?

521
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,436
This is the first time I've
seen you in three years.

522
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:56,566
I don't know. In any case,
it was because of you.

523
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,346
Who said you could disappear
after a teary phone call?

524
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:05,656
From now on, let's eat a meal
and go drinking. You're buying.

525
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:08,916
Hey, you know who I am.

526
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:11,016
Because of my grandfather...

527
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:14,596
What do the grown-ups have to do with us?
It's busy enough just trying to eat and live.

528
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:18,466
I'm hungry, hurry up and buy me dinner.
Hurry up and collect all this.

529
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:21,477
Fine.

530
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:36,736
Why don't you stop in?

531
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:41,847
No, I have some things to take care of
at the foundation. Send my regards.

532
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,646
What brings you here without calling?

533
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,956
I was passing by and stopped in.

534
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,956
Myeong Joo, have you been well?

535
00:44:56,957 --> 00:44:59,246
Myeong Joo, your present.

536
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:01,706
Thank you.

537
00:45:01,707 --> 00:45:04,187
Of course.

538
00:45:09,197 --> 00:45:11,506
Isn't it difficult to run this?

539
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:13,026
What would be difficult about it?

540
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:18,806
The foundation gives us plenty of
money and the volunteers help a lot.

541
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:21,847
The welfare children's lives
have become brighter.

542
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:25,806
But I still feel bad when I see you.

543
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:31,797
You were an assemblywoman. Don't you have
any thought of getting back into politics?

544
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,116
Not at all.

545
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:37,876
I think this works suits me best.

546
00:45:37,877 --> 00:45:42,687
I think Father and Mother
would be pleased, too.

547
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:50,887
It's all thanks to you. Because you
gave me a chance to reflect on myself.

548
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:54,177
<i>Director!</i>

549
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,597
- There's been an accident.- Accident?

550
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:02,216
One of members in this center
escaped, but he's mentally disturbed.

551
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,856
It appears he was in an accident. I
was notified by the police station.

552
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:07,986
The volunteers are supposed to come.

553
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:09,496
I'll go.

554
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:14,276
Hong Myeong Ho, tell the truth.
Are you going to keep lying?

555
00:46:14,277 --> 00:46:16,947
Hello.

556
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:20,376
Yes, who are you?

557
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:24,167
I'm Hong Myeong Ho's guardian.
What happened?

558
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:27,196
He's here on suspicion of obscenity.

559
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:30,806
What? No, no.

560
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:34,746
<i>This person took my wallet.
Give me my wallet. My wallet.</i>

561
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:38,346
What are you talking about?
You touched my girlfriend.

562
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:43,266
<i>That's right,</i> this pervert touched my butt.

563
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,916
<i>So we'll have to receive a settlement.</i>

564
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:49,926
Hey? No, no, I didn't!

565
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:53,286
Hyung! Did you come?

566
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:56,767
You're dead. You're dead.

567
00:47:01,877 --> 00:47:05,517
I think it will be resolved.
I'll bring him back.

568
00:47:10,837 --> 00:47:14,756
- How did it turn out?- They're
expert defrauders at doing this.

569
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:17,456
They have quite a number
of previous convictions.

570
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:20,826
- I took care of it neatly
by law, so you can take him.

571
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:26,056
I don't know this lady. I want
to go with Hyung Hyeong Woo.

572
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:30,886
How am I your hyung?
You're much older than me.

573
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:34,387
Hey, that's why you are my hyung. Let's go.

574
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:39,456
I'll take him to the welfare center.

575
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:43,517
- Have you been well?- Yeah.

576
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:48,346
- You look good as well.-
Because my mind is at peace.

577
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,947
I heard that you were
staying in our home town.

578
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:54,667
I had nowhere else to go.

579
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,347
Let's go.

580
00:48:05,947 --> 00:48:07,687
I'll get going.

581
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:52,347
<i>Law OfficeAttorney Jin Hyeong Woo</i>

582
00:48:55,237 --> 00:48:56,867
Hyung!

583
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:02,136
What happened to bring you down to the countryside you
don't like because you're afraid you'll get rusty?

584
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:05,346
I came down here after
taking a preservative.

585
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:08,246
How long are you going to keep
doing work that doesn't pay?

586
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:10,426
Make your big comeback soon.

587
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:12,976
Then are you doing work that pays?

588
00:49:12,977 --> 00:49:18,436
That's what I mean. We need to
be a set of two to have synergy.

589
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:23,967
Ahh. That ₩300 billion! Instead of giving all to the
government, we should have saved some part for us.

590
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:28,836
It's not your bones getting
rusty, you're itchy all over.

591
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:31,886
Actually, there's this amazing woman.

592
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:34,076
She's a junior of mine
and she's the real deal.

593
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:38,097
She's really interested in you, do
you want to go on a blind date?

594
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:46,167
<i>Ajusshi Kku, I'm going out
for a competition now.</i>

595
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:50,187
What competition?

596
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:56,566
<i>I'll let you know if I win a gold trophy.</i>

597
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:58,376
<i>Look forward to seeing it.</i>

598
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:00,046
Are you listening to me?

599
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:03,646
She's total, total, totally a killer.

600
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,156
Hey, kid. If she's such a great catch, then you
date her. Why are you introducing her to me?

601
00:50:09,157 --> 00:50:11,997
Her standards are a little high, you see.

602
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:17,477
Just meet her once! Hyung!

603
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,296
I came.

604
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:38,506
Who are you?

605
00:50:38,507 --> 00:50:40,686
Who are you, Hyung?

606
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,306
What are you doing?

607
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:45,526
I have good judgment.

608
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:48,436
Just looking at you, I can
tell you're just like me.

609
00:50:48,437 --> 00:50:53,407
You came from the mental hospital
way over there, didn't you?

610
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:56,606
Get out of my way.

611
00:50:56,607 --> 00:51:00,187
I know right away when I see it.

612
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:07,956
I planted it so that when it blooms, it will be a
pink heart in the shape that you like so much.

613
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:09,817
You look forward to it, right?

614
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,777
Mom! Mom!

615
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:37,076
Catch your breath! What is it?

616
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:41,416
I won first prize in the
storybook drawing contest!

617
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:46,176
Really? My daughter is really amazing.

618
00:51:46,177 --> 00:51:50,127
- What did you draw that you won such
a big prize? - Do you want to see?

619
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:59,937
Wow. You drew it really well.

620
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:08,597
A long time ago, there was a
pretty fairy named Kku Ee.

621
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:15,007
But Kku Ee wronged the jade emperor

622
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:20,506
and as her punishment, she became a bird.

623
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:24,056
Kku Ee was crying on a large tree branch.

624
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,387
But one rainy night,

625
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:37,687
the Kku Ee bird fell from
the branch and got hurt.

626
00:52:38,497 --> 00:52:45,497
Then the Kku Ee bird was saved
by a young girl and boy.

627
00:52:57,987 --> 00:53:02,006
On that tree, there was a legend.

628
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:04,596
The young girl and boy like each other,

629
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:07,136
and if their hearts don't
change in ten years,

630
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:10,356
the two people will get
together and Kku Ee bird

631
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:13,427
becomes a fairy according to this legend.

632
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:17,256
However, when ten years passed,

633
00:53:17,257 --> 00:53:21,747
at the last moment the two people broke up.

634
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:41,707
And because of that, Kku Ee bird is still
crying because she can't become a fairy again.

635
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:46,567
I'm sorry, I'm a little late, ain't I?

636
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:52,397
Not at all. Please have a seat.

637
00:53:56,257 --> 00:54:01,057
You're Assemblyman Kim Yeong Deok's aide.
You're a lawyer too?

638
00:54:01,657 --> 00:54:03,286
You've done a lot for your young age.

639
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,436
But it's nothing compared to you.

640
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:09,177
In my world, you're legendary.

641
00:54:10,107 --> 00:54:11,306
Your praise is excessive.

642
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:16,107
You are the one who put media
king Kwon Soo Myeong in jail.

643
00:54:19,177 --> 00:54:22,426
I heard from senior Jong Yeol that
you give free legal service here.

644
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:26,417
Are you going to follow in your father's
footsteps and run for the assembly?

645
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:30,106
If not, there's no reason for
you to be working without pay.

646
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:33,637
If you get elected, I'd
like to become your aide.

647
00:54:35,927 --> 00:54:40,687
If possible, I'd like to
be your aide forever.

648
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:57,336
Mom, I threw it all the way over there.

649
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:02,027
Ah, you're not supposed to be
playing in a place like this.

650
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:16,747
<i>Let's meet at Kku Ee's
tree tomorrow morning.</i>

651
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:29,617
I'm sorry, my child is still young.

652
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:34,627
Not at all. It's okay.

653
00:55:40,177 --> 00:55:42,206
Where did you hear this story?

654
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:50,207
Umm, before Ajusshi Kku told me a story about a bird
who became a fairy and a story about the Kku Ee tree.

655
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,496
And I changed it a little bit. Why?

656
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:59,376
Nothing. You drew it very
well and wrote it well.

657
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:06,526
Mom, but is there really such
a thing as a Kku Ee tree?

658
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:09,707
I really want to see it.

659
00:56:38,107 --> 00:56:41,287
Whoa, is that the Kku Ee tree?

660
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:54,617
Ajusshi Kku!

661
00:56:56,407 --> 00:57:00,837
- Mi Rae!- Mom, it's Ajusshi Kku!

662
00:57:25,057 --> 00:57:32,376
Oh, Mom! Someone wrote my, your
and Ajusshi Kku's names here!

663
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:35,997
Wow, that's so neat? Who did that?

664
00:57:39,027 --> 00:57:42,397
<i>Kku Moo, Kku Soo, Kku Ee</i>

665
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:51,237
Ajusshi Kku, push me!

666
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:55,356
There.
