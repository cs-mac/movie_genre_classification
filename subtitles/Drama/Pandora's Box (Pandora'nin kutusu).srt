1
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,111
Yes.

2
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,149
I see.

3
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,390
When did it happen?

4
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,639
OK. All right.

5
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,391
Thank you very much.

6
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,150
Nesrin?

7
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,239
What is it?

8
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,550
Did something happen to Murat?

9
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,718
No. Not Murat.

10
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,311
My mother is missing.

11
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,989
Nesrin?

12
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,558
I just landed.

13
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,990
What?

14
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,390
When was this?

15
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,395
I'm on my way to
the newspaper office.

16
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,719
Okay, I'm coming.

17
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,910
Bye.

18
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,399
I'm coming.

19
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,711
- We're going to the village.
- Where?

20
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,393
Mom disappeared.
Nesrin is waiting in the car.

21
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,710
Get rid of that cigarette!

22
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,311
This early in the morning!

23
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,991
How did the local police know?

24
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,628
The villagers told them.

25
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,996
Where on earth could she be?

26
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,071
I have no idea.

27
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,399
Is he back?

28
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,550
All right.

29
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,394
I'll call you later. Bye.

30
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,070
C'mon Nesrin, let him be!

31
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,995
He's destroying his life and mine!

32
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,390
It's crap,
just to get our attention.

33
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,071
Watch your tongue!

34
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,631
She knows the mountains inside out.

35
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,552
- Who are you talking about?
- Mom.

36
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,915
You're so cruel!

37
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,470
You forget how hard she was on me.

38
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,233
But you were so stubborn.

39
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,311
You still blame me. I was a kid!

40
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,630
If you'd only listened to her.

41
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,233
I'm not you.

42
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,037
You forget what she went through.

43
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,394
She chased dad away.

44
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,395
- No! He disappeared in the mountains.
- Come on. He ran from mom's temper.

45
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,073
What's she talking about?

46
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,835
Dad took her to that village
and then abandoned her.

47
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,990
The road is blocked.

48
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,069
What luck!

49
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,233
Hello!

50
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,151
- What's wrong?
- The road is blocked.

51
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,149
What will we do?

52
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,312
It'll be cleared tomorrow.

53
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,912
There's a roadside inn, we can go there.

54
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,790
Hey, what kind of service is this?
Go on, move your butt!

55
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,993
Butt? Mine's an ass!

56
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,553
You guys are beginning
to get on my nerves!

57
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,549
Don't flirt with me when you're drunk.

58
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,993
- What're you gonna do?
- I'll kick your ass out!

59
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,718
Don't get Nezahat upset.

60
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,230
The road is closed.

61
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,390
Come on! Have a drink with us.

62
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,709
Okay.

63
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,550
- Are you going over?
- Yeah.

64
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,913
They left their car like us.
They're our guests tonight.

65
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,391
Enjoy your meal!

66
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,153
Thanks! Welcome.

67
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,719
Excuse us, we're truckers
with no manners.

68
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,711
No problem, I don't mind.

69
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,474
- Do you want a glass of raki?
- Sure.

70
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,077
...we were so drunk
when we got there...

71
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,311
We're not bothering you?

72
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,232
Not at all.

73
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,232
Thank you.

74
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,713
Don't eat that.
It'll make you sick.

75
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,313
- You're not eating?
- I have some crackers.

76
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,309
Thank you.

77
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,710
Enjoy it. Some raki?

78
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,479
No, thanks.

79
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,314
Dad left mom for just such a woman.

80
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,552
<i>Don't cry, my love</i>

81
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,713
<i>Don't cry, my dear</i>

82
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,158
<i>Don't cry, mama</i>

83
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,472
Bravo, bravo!
I'm giving you a discount of ten liras.

84
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,479
- Give it to me.
- Give it back!

85
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,312
- Messages to him!
- Give me!

86
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,152
I'll have an accident!

87
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,719
Right! Give me!

88
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,630
- Break up with this guy!
- It's none of your business.

89
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,916
That asshole's screwing with you.

90
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,559
That's enough!

91
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,154
- There's no connection.
- Of course not!

92
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,150
Shut up! Stop the car.

93
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,913
Why?

94
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,071
I have to talk to him.

95
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,992
Do what she says, Nesrin.

96
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,309
Will you stop?

97
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,708
All right!

98
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,629
Well, then I'll have a smoke.

99
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,549
It's too cold.

100
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,717
I'm getting a backache.

101
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,989
Stop smoking.

102
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,798
- You want one?
- No.

103
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,790
Leave it.

104
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,152
Clean your eye. It's disgusting.

105
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,310
Thanks.

106
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,394
- Hurry up, it's cold.
- I'm coming.

107
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,711
There's no connection.

108
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,552
Oh, it's too cold!

109
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,073
I'm freezing.

110
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,470
Finish up, I'm getting back in.

111
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,149
Mehmet.

112
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,151
The car won't start.

113
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,560
- What's wrong with it?
- I have no idea.

114
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,075
The fuel gauge is lit.

115
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,550
- What'll we do?
- We'll push it.

116
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,712
Don't be stupid, it's out of gas.

117
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,989
Didn't we fill it?

118
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,639
I don't know.

119
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,156
I have to take care of everything.
Mom, Murat, the gas,

120
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,995
I just forgot.

121
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,269
There he is.

122
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,390
I hope he figured something out.

123
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,993
He's not carrying anything.

124
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,389
Who knows!

125
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,471
- So?
- I found a tractor.

126
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,472
He'll bring us some gas.

127
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,709
You didn't go along?

128
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,911
Should I have left you alone?

129
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,309
I hope he comes soon.

130
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,473
When he comes, pay him ten liras more.
I didn't have enough.

131
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,992
You already paid him?

132
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,471
Yeah, so? He's not going to run away
with the money.

133
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,995
Of course he will, stupid!

134
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,631
- What?
- Open the door.

135
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,709
Do you think that everyone is like you?

136
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,470
Stop it!

137
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,633
Why? He was supposed to run off
with the money, right?

138
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,630
You can't even pay your own rent!
Don't teach me lessons.

139
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,839
At least I don't kiss
people's asses right and left.

140
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,479
Whose ass am I kissing?

141
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,790
Those bastards you used to fight.

142
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,479
Don't be cruel.

143
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,472
- Stop!
- You stop giving orders!

144
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,311
I am not!

145
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,233
Yes, you are!
To me, your husband, Murat.

146
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,710
Can Murat do anything without me?

147
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,399
Why? He'll end up like me?

148
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,075
I'd rather die than see him become
a parasite like you.

149
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,390
Pull over!

150
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,074
How can you talk to me like that?

151
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,708
Where are you going?

152
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,399
Mehmet, come back!

153
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,912
Where are you going?

154
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,991
What if he doesn't come back?

155
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,798
How do I know?

156
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,071
She left the key in the lock.

157
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,149
Mom?

158
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,389
Mom?

159
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,910
Mehmet?

160
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,994
Where did you go, you silly goat?

161
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,230
Mehmet. Where have you been?

162
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,832
Auntie Nusret...

163
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,073
Auntie Nusret...

164
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,798
Oh mom!

165
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,991
I found her prayer beads.

166
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,994
I hope nothing happened to her.

167
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,553
I'll never forget this house,
no matter what.

168
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,790
Where is the emergency room?

169
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,638
- Right there.
- Thanks.

170
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,711
We gave her a thorough examination.

171
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,639
And we didn't find anything unusual.

172
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,477
Her EKG and lab tests are okay.
There are no traces of toxins.

173
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,837
Don't worry too much.

174
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,710
It may have something to do
with her age.

175
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,549
It might be neurological.

176
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,550
What do you mean?

177
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,314
A neurological disorder.

178
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,233
I'm prescribing some medicine.

179
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,399
When will she wake up?

180
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,552
In a couple of hours.

181
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,309
Then you can take her home.

182
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,309
Come on, mom.

183
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,551
I'll get the bags and meet you
at the elevator.

184
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,551
Are you all right?

185
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,835
Come on, mom.

186
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,992
Go in there
and help her get comfortable.

187
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,639
Go get some slippers.

188
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,388
Sit down, mom.

189
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,911
Are you comfortable?

190
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,071
Let me put on your slippers.

191
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,390
Mom,

192
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,476
give me your foot
so I can put on your slipper.

193
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,711
No, not that one, the other one.

194
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,232
Okay, this one, then.

195
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,914
Fine.

196
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,389
This one, mom.

197
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,479
No, this one again.

198
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,553
This one, mom.

199
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,472
Where should I put this bag?

200
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,480
Put it in the small room.

201
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,399
We just arrived

202
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,153
at Nesrin's.

203
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,789
I can't go to the office today.

204
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,075
I'll try tomorrow.

205
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,911
I couldn't call earlier.

206
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,472
We'll talk later.

207
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,308
What about Murat?

208
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,073
He was at Ozan's last night.

209
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,833
He stayed at Ozan's?

210
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,313
You didn't tell me before?

211
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,473
- When could I?
- I haven't slept in days.

212
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,312
I'm not supposed to worry?

213
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,549
See you tonight.

214
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,799
Mom, what are you doing?

215
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,913
What did you do, mom?

216
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,152
Stop laughing you two!

217
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,558
Can't you sleep?

218
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,911
Come on, let's go to sleep, mom.

219
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,911
- Like this?
- Yes, nice and easy.

220
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,471
What's all this stuff, mom?

221
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,832
Give me the handkerchief!

222
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,399
Goodnight.

223
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,151
You can't sleep either?

224
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,392
I couldn't fall asleep.

225
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,833
Did you make tea?

226
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,798
Have some, if you want.

227
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,993
My shoulder hurts so much.

228
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,470
Mom has gotten very strange.

229
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,230
Especially in the bathroom.

230
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,713
She got mad, started shouting.
She wouldn't let me touch her.

231
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,229
Her hands stuck between her legs.

232
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,233
- She has no hair down there.
- Really?

233
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,993
We'll end up like that.

234
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,389
Nonsense.

235
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,551
How are things with Faruk?

236
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,228
The usual.

237
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,991
Nothing changed.

238
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,070
Haven't you solved your problems?

239
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,469
No.

240
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,470
I still freeze up when he touches me.

241
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,233
Didn't you see a therapist?

242
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,390
I did.

243
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,709
So?

244
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,554
He said the secret is to learn
to touch one another.

245
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,075
I don't know how to touch,
so I don't know how to make love.

246
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,316
At this age, you become like siblings.

247
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,551
Why are you saying that?

248
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,631
- What should I say?
- Just try.

249
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,309
Good morning.

250
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,719
<i>Don't call.
I'll call you tonlght.</i>

251
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,430
Who is this?

252
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,791
- Who, mom?
- Murat.

253
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,709
Your grandson.

254
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,711
Then, why is he...

255
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,470
Why didn't he come pay his respects?

256
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,393
He will. I'm going to get him.

257
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,392
Let's put this back.

258
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,915
Come sit here.

259
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,074
Go on, sit down.

260
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,719
I'm going to his school to find him.

261
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,234
Stay seated like that.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

262
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,310
OK.

263
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,836
Here's the phone.
I am writing down my number.

264
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,991
Call me if anything happens.

265
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,559
Go, go on.

266
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,719
OK. I'm leaving.

267
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,231
Can you read it?

268
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,993
Yes. Go! Leave!

269
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,231
I'll turn on the TV.

270
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,072
<i>This Is one of the biggest
demonstrations ever seen.</i>

271
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,993
<i>Even the boats are covered
with the Turkish flag.</i>

272
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,393
<i>- Where are you from?
- Izmlr.</i>

273
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,475
<i>My feet hurt, so I'm In the café.</i>

274
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,994
<i>Long live democracy!</i>

275
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,797
<i>We'll save the Republic, Inshallah!</i>

276
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,709
- You're selling it?
- Yes.

277
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,149
How much?

278
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,630
I bought it for 200 liras.

279
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,231
How much do you want?

280
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,797
Give me 100 liras.

281
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,798
It's not worth it.

282
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,796
How much?

283
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,797
50-60 liras max.

284
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,472
Okay, 60 liras then.

285
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,915
But it's cracked. I'll give you 50.

286
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,309
You said 60.

287
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,712
No, I said around 50-60. It's cracked.

288
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,232
Okay, it's a deal.

289
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,230
Good morning.

290
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,390
Thanks.

291
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,070
- Can I see that walkman?
- Of course.

292
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,149
The red one.

293
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,915
- Will you give me the SIM card?
- Sure.

294
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,394
- Is there a passcode?
- No, no problem.

295
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,789
The battery works?

296
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,479
Of course.

297
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,994
Check if you want.

298
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,835
How much is this?

299
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,479
30 liras.

300
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
You trying to die, man?!

301
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,310
If you don't have any balls,
why did you follow me?

302
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,553
Don't make me mad when my feet hurt.

303
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,835
Take off your shoes, asshole!

304
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,392
- Hello, Ozan!
- Hello, Mrs. Nesrin.

305
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,993
I'm looking for Murat.

306
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,390
I haven't seen him lately.

307
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,914
Are you sure?

308
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,790
- He didn't stay with you last night?
- Yes, but he left in the morning.

309
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,232
Come on, Ozan. Tell me.

310
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,994
I don't know anything.
I have class now.

311
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,629
I know what dirty business you're into.

312
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,155
I swear I'm calling the police.

313
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,313
I really don't know anything.
I have to go.

314
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,075
Where were you for the past few days?

315
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,310
We went and got your grandmother.

316
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,789
So, it's true, then!

317
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,559
You didn't know about it?

318
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,315
Damn. I thought my mother
was trying to trick me.

319
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,788
No.

320
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,232
What's wrong with her?

321
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,708
She had disappeared.

322
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,990
How come?

323
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,832
- She just disappeared.
- Where to?

324
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,071
Just left home and disappeared.

325
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,230
Why?

326
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,235
I don't know. We looked for her
and brought her here.

327
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,069
Where's she now?

328
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,719
At your parents' place.

329
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,798
What is she doing there?

330
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,913
She's pissing on the rug.

331
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,392
Wow. Right on.

332
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,911
I'll piss on that rug, too.

333
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,155
Me, I'm gonna shit on it.

334
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,710
You're lucky you're still alive, bro.

335
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,314
Why the fuck did I run after him?

336
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,912
It wasn't worth it.

337
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,392
He grabbed me

338
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,789
and pulled me into an alley.

339
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,629
He put a knife to my neck, like this.

340
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,993
There was nobody around.

341
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,835
He could have cut me to pieces.

342
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,911
I couldn't breathe.

343
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,233
He said some shit to me. Look at this.

344
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,914
- What the fuck?
- He took my shoes.

345
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,993
I froze up.

346
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,074
You should have seen his dark eyes.

347
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,630
As dark as the bottom of a well.

348
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,791
For the first time in my life,

349
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,314
I felt my feet, my hands,
the blood in my veins.

350
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,560
I've never felt
anything like that before.

351
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,070
So it gave you a real high, huh?

352
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,789
Yeah.

353
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:40,389
<i>HH: I've run out? Got a spliff?
Phantom: Go to the Infidel.</i>

354
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,312
<i>HH: He got busted.</i>

355
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,835
<i>Phantom: Then go to Tarlabasi, nr. 58.</i>

356
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,390
Nesrin?

357
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,550
Yes?

358
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,788
What are you doing?

359
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,719
I'm finding out who
he's hanging around with.

360
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,993
Has it come to this?

361
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,468
What do you mean?

362
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,632
You pay so much tuition,
and he doesn't even take the exams.

363
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,389
Wait a minute, mom.

364
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,230
Come here, mom.

365
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,914
Don't move from this spot, mom.

366
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,913
I will be right back, OK?

367
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,912
Mom!

368
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,390
Mom, I brought you something...

369
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,393
I brought meatballs
in yogurt sauce for you.

370
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,990
Come in.

371
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,390
Everything going well?

372
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,076
Yes. I'm finishing my dissertation

373
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,469
when I have time.

374
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,789
And your mother?

375
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,391
She just got out of the hospital.

376
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,914
And Murat? How is he?

377
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,232
Fine. He's sleeping right now.

378
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,311
- Alonso's with the Red Bull team.
- Yeah?

379
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,915
Get me out of here!

380
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,719
Mom!

381
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,478
Come here!

382
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,553
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

383
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,799
Blue, falcon, tulip.

384
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,915
Blue, falcon, tulip.

385
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,551
Very good. Remember those words,
I'm going to ask for them again.

386
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,154
Can you count down from one hundred
subtracting seven at a time?

387
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,913
Can you count down from there
subtracting seven at a time?

388
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,552
What were the three words from before?

389
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,991
- Blue.
- What else?

390
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,234
God! What other disasters
will befall us?

391
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,710
When will they let her out?

392
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,631
I don't know who to deal with first,
Murat or mom.

393
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,994
Very good. Now try to whistle.

394
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,712
Does it feels the same on one side,

395
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,072
as it does on the other side?

396
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,074
Does it feel the same

397
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,711
on both sides when I touch you?

398
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,310
Very good!

399
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,156
Now try to pull your arm towards you.
Very good.

400
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,631
Only I take responsibility?

401
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,236
Now you take care of mom.
I have to look for my son.

402
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,074
I don't have
a regular schedule, you know.

403
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,790
Fine. So it's my fault for having
a regular schedule.

404
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,994
Your mother is suffering
from Alzheimer's Disease.

405
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,313
The illness is in an advanced stage.

406
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,917
You have to expect
all sorts of difficulties.

407
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,995
For example,
your mother will no longer

408
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,391
be able to perform
many of her daily activities.

409
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,714
Possibly she won't be able
to wash herself

410
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,552
or go to the toilet alone,

411
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,394
or even dress herself.

412
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,473
You have to help her
and teach her routines

413
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,993
over and over again.

414
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,994
She should never be alone.
She lives with whom?

415
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,153
With me.

416
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,554
She may have some nervous spells
and act very irritably.

417
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,313
You will have to calm her

418
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,716
and stay calm yourself at those times,

419
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,074
because just the illness is to blame,
not her.

420
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,639
Do you have any questions?

421
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,995
You can call me
if there is any problem.

422
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,468
Thank you.

423
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,709
Mom, calm down, please.

424
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,150
You're going to fall down!

425
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,075
Mom, calm down!

426
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,788
Please, calm down.

427
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,995
Please, let me do it.

428
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,800
Is the water too hot?

429
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,479
It's hot!

430
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,550
Please, mom!

431
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,991
Look, mom, this is the toilet.

432
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,836
If you have to pee or shit,
you do it here.

433
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,313
You sit here like this.
Don't do it on the carpet, okay?

434
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,994
- Mom, pee and shit.
- This isn't working.

435
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,549
How else can I explain it?

436
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,315
Mom, here is the toilet,
don't do it on the carpet.

437
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,632
Nesrin, don't push her.
Let's put her in a hospital.

438
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,713
They'll say we didn't take care
of our mother!

439
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,310
- Who's going to say that?
- What?

440
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,153
I can't explain it to her?

441
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,469
You're exaggerating.

442
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,994
Enough!

443
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,560
- I'm going home!
- That's out of the question.

444
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,789
I'm going home.

445
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,149
Tonight?

446
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,993
After work?

447
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,472
Let me think.

448
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,913
Okay.

449
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,390
Let's meet in front of the newspaper.

450
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,072
Bye. Kiss.

451
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,391
Take us to Galata, please.

452
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,151
This way, mom.

453
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,553
You stay here tonight.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

454
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,392
Mom, please!

455
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,835
Fine, we'll wash your hands inside.

456
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,550
Murat! What are you doing here?

457
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,479
None of your business.

458
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,913
Your mom is looking for you.
Why haven't you called her?

459
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,915
Who is this?

460
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,799
Your grandmother.

461
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,913
Mom, look.
This is your grandson, Murat.

462
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,468
- She's staying here tonight.
- How come?

463
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,915
I've lots to do at work.

464
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,311
Let her stay tonight.
I'll come get her tomorrow.

465
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,393
- Where's Mehmet?
- He should be here soon.

466
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,991
- When does he get home?
- Do I know?

467
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:48,919
Mom, Mehmet will be here soon.
I'll come and get you tomorrow. OK?

468
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,151
- What should I do?
- Here's her stuff.

469
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,391
I'll give you some money.

470
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,070
150. Is that enough?

471
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,832
Give her these pills.

472
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,471
One in the evening,
and one in the morning, after meals.

473
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,554
And one of these, too,
every three hours. Don't forget.

474
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,391
- What's wrong with her?
- Alzheimer's.

475
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,709
- Alzheimer's.
- What's that?

476
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,639
She forgets everything except the past.

477
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,791
Keep an eye on her.

478
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,232
Tomorrow I'll be back
and you go home, agreed?

479
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,311
- I'm talking to you!
- Yes, go.

480
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,790
See you tomorrow, mom.

481
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,835
Grandma,

482
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,399
let's go inside.

483
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,152
Where's my mountain?

484
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,391
<i>Güzin? I couldn't find you at home.
Where are you?</i>

485
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,835
Don't worry. We're on our way.

486
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,991
<i>What? Where did you go?</i>

487
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,634
I had to stop by the paper.
Don't worry, we're going home.

488
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,235
<i>Why did you take mom? Is she all right?</i>

489
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,789
Stop worrying, Nesrin. She's fine.

490
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,719
<i>Call me when you get home.</i>

491
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,390
Okay, I'll call you.

492
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,031
- How are you, darling?
- Fine and you?

493
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,232
- I got rid of my mother.
- What's she doing here?

494
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,799
Since when do you care?

495
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,912
What do you mean?
Let's go to your place.

496
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,072
I don't want to.
Let's go talk somewhere.

497
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,833
I don't have a lot of time.

498
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,311
You won't stay overnight?
Can't we ever wake up together?

499
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,790
Güzin, please. I have so much work.

500
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,070
- That's enough!
- Why so upset?

501
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,153
I work too, but I make time for you.

502
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,719
I make time for you too!

503
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,474
I don't want your time!
Stop the car!

504
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,235
<i>What a damn callous world!</i>

505
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,314
<i>What a fucking senseless life!</i>

506
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,311
Will grandma get mad if we smoke pot?

507
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,834
No, she's cool.

508
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,991
Does she know what it is?

509
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,548
She's been using tatula plant for ages.

510
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,995
- What's that?
- You don't know?

511
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,628
No, what is it?

512
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,156
They collect tatula in the mountains.

513
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,709
They boil it then drink it.

514
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,228
To get high?

515
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,549
Stoned. But they fool us
saying it cures asthma.

516
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,472
Roll the joint, you'll see.

517
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,712
The smell will get her excited.

518
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,152
- I'm going to light up, then.
- Go right ahead.

519
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,151
You see how she likes it?

520
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,313
What's your name?

521
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,074
Murat, grandma.

522
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,309
Grandma?

523
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,313
Are you one of mine?

524
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,629
Yes, mom.

525
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:14,076
It was you that named him,
after my father!

526
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,992
Murat.

527
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,234
I should go now.
The road will get blocked.

528
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,152
Where are you going, mom?

529
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,310
Where, grandma?

530
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,154
The roads will be blocked.
It will snow!

531
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,153
No, it's not the season for that.

532
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,631
Don't worry, I'll take you tomorrow.

533
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:44,990
Okay?

534
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,710
Stay, Grandma.

535
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,310
That's right, mom. Relax.

536
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,076
She must be remembering
my father's death. Goddamn.

537
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,232
How did grandpa die?

538
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,153
In the mountains.

539
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,310
No, not in the mountains.

540
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,472
He abandoned you.

541
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,469
He always did whatever he wanted.

542
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,835
Like you.

543
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,390
I never abandoned anybody, mom.

544
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,312
Whether you've abandoned me
or yourself,

545
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,472
it's the same thing to me.

546
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,148
Come on!

547
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,995
Grandma, wait!

548
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,232
No, the other one.

549
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,708
Wait.

550
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,718
What's your name?

551
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,399
Murat, grandma.

552
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,719
What are you doing?

553
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,989
I have to pee.

554
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,390
Okay, but not here.

555
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,471
Over there, maybe.

556
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,631
No, grandma, come on.

557
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,075
Don't you have a family?

558
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,150
No.

559
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,279
Who brought me here?

560
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,354
Your children.

561
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,395
Who?

562
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,311
My mom, my aunt, my uncle.

563
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,758
I don't remember anything.

564
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,432
Well, don't remember.

565
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,109
It's better that way.

566
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,712
Kidnap me. Take me to my village.

567
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,950
Güzin?

568
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,749
Güzin? What's the matter?

569
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,670
Come on, say something! Are you okay?

570
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,075
Come on, get up! Tell me what's wrong!

571
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,438
Güzin? What's the matter?

572
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,796
Did something happen to mom?!
Where is she?

573
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,394
Tell me!

574
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,438
I left her with Murat.

575
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,912
With Murat?

576
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,235
Where did you see him?

577
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,117
At Mehmet's place.

578
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,316
What? Why didn't you tell me?

579
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,313
Enough! Stop irritating everybody.

580
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,709
Who do I irritate?

581
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,393
- You pester everyone!
- I do not!

582
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,152
Enough!

583
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,312
- I'm worried about my son!
- Leave me alone!

584
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,073
Come on, Grandma.

585
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,478
Just a few more steps.

586
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,831
What are you doing, man?

587
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,674
And where were you two?

588
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,593
You were snoring
when we left this morning.

589
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,875
What is all this?

590
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,076
I'm privatizing my electricity.

591
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,070
Why?

592
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,949
Because they cut mine off today.

593
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,915
So what is this thing?

594
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,428
You like it?

595
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,110
Look.

596
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,155
- Are we going to die?
- No, don't worry.

597
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,312
Hold that up, Murat.

598
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,551
- You are nuts.
- OK, ready?

599
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,239
Lights!

600
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,112
Damn, that's incredible!

601
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,717
What are you doing there?

602
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,269
What are you up to?

603
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,114
- Mom? What are you doing here?
- Why not?

604
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,958
You enjoy making me suffer?

605
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,509
- Why are you here?
- Why do this to me?

606
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,358
- What's gotten into you?
- How so?

607
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,911
- You want to end up like him?
- Hey!

608
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,674
- You bring mom to this place?
- Stop!

609
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,148
Just a minute.

610
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,555
Mom is fine here. As if you care.

611
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,676
He's a good boy.

612
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,196
- Don't yell at him.
- Mom, you stay out of this.

613
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,670
- Come, we're going home.
- What home?

614
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,189
You never ask me what I want to do.

615
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,595
You never asked me even once.

616
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,029
What do you mean? That's your home!

617
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,631
- Not in this dump!
- Fuck off!

618
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,354
It's you I don't want to be like.

619
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,115
For once just look what's in your hands.

620
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,595
I always wondered

621
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,989
if you ever really loved me.

622
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,038
Look at you.

623
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,598
You are empty...

624
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,390
as empty as the glass behind you.

625
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,478
The funny thing is, I'm just like you.

626
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,950
Now we are both the same.

627
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,557
Why are you calling me?

628
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,830
There's nothing to apologize for.

629
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,669
Mom?

630
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,912
Don't call me again.

631
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,951
I don't want to see you anymore.

632
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,636
Mom?

633
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,110
Güzin.

634
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,714
Giving birth to you was so hard.
You stuck to me.

635
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,229
And now you want everyone
to stick to you.

636
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,909
I might as well leave, I'd say.

637
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,915
But who will play with my toys?

638
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,669
And who'll caress
my hands and fingers

639
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,230
the way my mommy does
five times a day?

640
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,470
I might as well leave, I'd say...

641
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:25,029
Don't be like me.
Open yourself up.

642
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,630
Why did they shut her up in there?

643
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,069
How could they?

644
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,991
That's life, man.

645
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,108
You give in to it
sooner or later.

646
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,875
Are you going to leave me too?

647
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,908
Don't worry.

648
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,193
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

649
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,552
I wouldn't know how to live
without you.

650
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,957
That's even worse.

651
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,915
Let go of Murat.

652
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,471
Grandma, I can't light the fire.

653
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,149
Grandma!

654
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,313
How can I light the wood?
It's all wet.

655
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,231
Come and help me!

656
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,912
How do I get it to start?

657
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,559
What to do?

658
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,718
Standing here?

659
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,073
What should I do now?

660
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,231
Never mind, grandma.

661
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,717
Go back and lie down.

662
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,399
Uhff. Grandma.

663
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:11,709
Grandma,

664
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,072
what are you doing here?

665
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,312
They told me to walk.

666
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,549
Who?

667
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,071
Who said that, Grandma?

668
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,550
Never mind.
Now they're telling you to sit down.

669
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,916
Let me go to my mountain.

670
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,475
Or else I'll forget that too.
