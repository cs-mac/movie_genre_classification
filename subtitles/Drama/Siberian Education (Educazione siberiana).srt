1
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,627
By our ancestors,
free hunters and warriors,

2
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,381
By the great northern forests,

3
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,857
By the river Lena and Amur,
we pray to you.

4
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:35,717
Blessed Mary, Mother of God,
full of grace,

5
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,472
hear words of humble servant.

6
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,505
Forgive us honest criminals,

7
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:44,227
for the sins we
are forced to commit.

8
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:47,398
Assist us in our battle

9
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:52,073
against power-mongering polit
bureaucrats and their minions

10
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,730
cops and soldiers,

11
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:57,346
and every other devil in uniform.

12
00:01:57,512 --> 00:02:01,669
O most gracious Mother
of the most gracious God,

13
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:06,015
bless our weapons,
temper our knives,

14
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:11,620
guide our bullets
and anoint our souls

15
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,892
and our grasp
may become yours.

16
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:15,781
Kolyma!

17
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,048
We must respect
all living creatures,

18
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,333
except for the police,

19
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,508
people who work
in government,

20
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,269
bankers,
usurers,

21
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:36,456
and anyone who has
the power and money

22
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,075
to exploit
simple people.

23
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:42,562
Stealing from this people
is allowed.

24
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:48,325
But remember:
It's crazy to want too much.

25
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,915
Men cannot possess more

26
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,697
than his heart
can love.

27
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:05,348
SIBERIAN EDUCATION

28
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,998
Do not move!
Stay in the car!

29
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,391
Learn from our brother Plank.

30
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:13,358
It is sacrilege
for an honest Siberian

31
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:16,205
to keep money
in his house.

32
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,086
Even the stolen money.

33
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,341
10 YEARS LATER

34
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:39,786
1998- CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS, RUSSIAN ARMY,
SPECIAL FORCES

35
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:44,424
Kolyma, you think I could
have his cigarettes?

36
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:46,926
Thanks!

37
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,161
Three minutes ago

38
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,622
Yes, confirmed.

39
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,070
A truck loaded with heroin.

40
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,796
I think they're the ones
we're looking for.

41
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,645
Yes. We will find them.

42
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,319
Okay, roger that.
Over and out.

43
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,130
They were low on gas and were
out here without a spare tank.

44
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,559
They were headed
some place nearby.

45
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:18,632
Look what else I found.

46
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:25,840
You something, Sergeant?

47
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,700
The first job I ever had
was playing dead.

48
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,592
1988 - RIVERBANK, SOVIET UNION

49
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,654
- He's dead!
- No! I know I braked in time.

50
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,798
Look at him! Not even a scratch!

51
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:03,440
He's got a pulse.
What the fuck do you think happened?

52
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,320
Maybe he's sick.

53
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,810
Where am I?

54
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,657
It's a damned miracle you're alive, boy.
You know?

55
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,667
Uncle Vasia!

56
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:21,265
I'm not Uncle Vasia.

57
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,881
And what are you doing wandering around here
all by yourself, anyway?

58
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,394
I'm lost.
I forgot everything.

59
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,151
I better go home.

60
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:35,401
- You sure you're okay?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:48,691
Gagarin?

62
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,722
Kolyma, we got enough
for the whole neighborhood!

63
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,242
Kolyma, quick!
It is the army!

64
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,167
They are after the truck robbers!
Run!

65
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,891
Easy, easy!

66
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,955
- You two, sit down.
- But Grandfather...

67
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,340
Do as I say.

68
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,912
Good evening, comrade Officer.
How may I help you?

69
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:11,286
Where is your husband?

70
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,219
In the Kasparov Cemetary.

71
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:22,233
Are you this woman's father?

72
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,396
No, Grandfather is
my husband's father.

73
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,383
I did not ask you.

74
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,583
Someone robbed a truck
recently.

75
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,582
100 pairs of boots
have disappeared.

76
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:39,508
Anna, I need you to deliver
a few words on my behalf

77
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,454
to this piece of trash.

78
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,634
Can you ask him please
why he thinks

79
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:47,449
he can come armed
in the heart of Riverbank

80
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:50,481
and enter the house
of an honest criminal?

81
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,366
Grandfather asks, "If by-"

82
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,717
- Silence! Listen, you piece of shit!
- Kolyma!

83
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:04,628
Take your hands off
my grandfather, you pig!

84
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,467
Comrade Commander,
The place is full of...

85
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,768
Jesus Christ
and all his blessed relations!

86
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:29,337
I'm sorry, grandfather Kuzya...

87
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:32,536
but thank God no one
has been hurt.

88
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,027
Do you realize what times we live in,
brother Plank?

89
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:43,546
Not even in our homes
can we find peace.

90
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,164
True, but we are always
with you, Grandpa Kuzya,

91
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:49,401
in happy times and sad.

92
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,873
Kolyma.

93
00:09:55,196 --> 00:10:00,018
Tell me sister Lena,
brother Amur speaks too!

94
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:06,329
I crossed my land
from one part

95
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,943
stopping trains

96
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,004
singing and making my rifle,

97
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:17,725
and only the old taiga knows

98
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,830
I killed those cops!

99
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:23,380
And now that I'm in trouble,

100
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,802
Jesus Christ help me,
help me lose my gun!

101
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,140
Mama Siberia,
take my life!

102
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:40,278
Mama Siberia,
take my life!

103
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:42,846
He did it to
defend us.

104
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:44,756
Yes, but Kolyma
broke three rules.

105
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,359
He took a weapon without
the permission of an adult

106
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,150
He took it from the red corner,

107
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,967
and he attempted to
fire it inside the house.

108
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,782
These are things one
should never do!

109
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:56,059
Never!

110
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,370
But... it was brave.

111
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,545
You don't have a switchblade,
do you?

112
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,276
No.

113
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:17,723
Well, take this one, then.

114
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,679
- For me?
- Yes, Kolyma.

115
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,836
This switchblade has known you
since the day you were born.

116
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:31,584
It is the same blade that was
used to cut the umbilical cord

117
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,376
that tied you to your mother.

118
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,488
The switchblade is like the cross.

119
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:38,496
It stays with us our entire lives.

120
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,960
No, Gagarin. This is not
your switchblade.

121
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,888
But I...

122
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:48,033
Even if you cannot be gifted with
the blade that cut you from your mother

123
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,626
Here, take it!

124
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:53,337
May the good Lord also guide
your hand and...

125
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:07,866
Kolyma!

126
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,134
Fingers inward.

127
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:14,139
Protect your fingers
Protect yours.

128
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:17,213
Short and swift. Like this!

129
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,585
That way, the wound is bigger

130
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,432
and your opponent
dies more quickly.

131
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,745
Palms up,

132
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,294
you turn the blade and slash.

133
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,073
Watch Gagarin,
he's already good

134
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,529
Learned all by himself.

135
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,203
We are here.
This must be less than a kilometer away.

136
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,720
Eyes open
and absolute silence!

137
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,961
It's heroin. He's got 10 kilos.

138
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,735
Grandpa Kuzya, please!
I have three mouths to feed!

139
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,198
Three mouths?

140
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,721
- Yes.
- Is that so?

141
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,116
Then...

142
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,858
...Let's just start with yours.
- No! Please! No!

143
00:14:44,104 --> 00:14:46,657
There's something you want to ask me?

144
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:57,090
The answer to the question
you don't want to ask me is quite simple.

145
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:00,738
There is no place for drugs
in our community.

146
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:06,532
We Siberians do not dirty
our hands with that stuff.

147
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,097
Come on Mel, hurry up!

148
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,490
I'm trying!
Not so easy, you know.

149
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,534
- Move over!
- Get out of there!

150
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,505
Get out of there, you idiot!

151
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,811
Three fucking Georgians!

152
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,220
They stole my stamps,
the ones that I had just bought!

153
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,843
And so you started bawling
right in front of them?

154
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,729
Even the painting with Stalin!

155
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:55,812
He is dressed like a pilot!
It is really rare!

156
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,868
But I did not cry...
Not in front of them.

157
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,703
Look who's coming!

158
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:28,936
Look who's come back!
The little fairy with the stamps!

159
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,929
You know, you're pretty cute
up close...

160
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,491
Even if you wear glasses!

161
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:53,002
So very cute...
Too bad you're a fairy!

162
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:02,181
- Vitalic!
- Vitalic, we are here!

163
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,933
We give up!
We give up!

164
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,763
My friend Vitalic,
would like his stamps back,

165
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,867
Especially the one with the Red Lenin.
- Stalin! With the Stalin!

166
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,497
That's enough! Gagarin, that's enough!
We won!

167
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:32,100
Now listen carefully, you momma's boy
'cause I'm only going to say this once.

168
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,328
Nobody in this city
touchs us, Siberians.

169
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:50,032
Mama Siberia,
take my life!

170
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,526
Shut up!

171
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:40,012
First I'm going to release
the female.

172
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,607
Wait...

173
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,911
Now!

174
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,625
You see, Kolyma...

175
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,402
if they live only in a cage,
they die.

176
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:10,959
Because the home of every living
creature is the sky.

177
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:40,625
Go! Go!

178
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,294
Stop there!

179
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,729
Go!

180
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,321
No! No!

181
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,175
No!

182
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,516
Go! Go!

183
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:04,912
Go!

184
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:06,959
Go! Run!

185
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,835
Run! Run!

186
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,677
- It's from Vaisef.
- Here!

187
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:35,795
- It's from Sergei!
- He's my son.

188
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:44,659
Mel, this is it!
It's from Gagarin.

189
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,492
"They're keeping me seven years,
Kolyma.

190
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,757
"They will be sending me
far away soon.

191
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,302
"But I'm OK.
I am tough.

192
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:59,442
"These bastards
will never break me!

193
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:12,175
The winter seemed never ending,

194
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,436
and the pack was
dying of hunger.

195
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,874
The leader of the pack,
the oldest of all,

196
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:26,517
was out in front, comforting
the young wolves

197
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,782
telling them that
spring was coming.

198
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:35,318
But, at a certain point,

199
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:39,795
one young wolf
decides to stop.

200
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:44,437
He says he has had enough
of cold and hunger,

201
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,553
and he says he was
going to live among men.

202
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:54,707
Because the important thing
is to stay alive.

203
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:58,871
The young wolf
lets himself be caught,

204
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:02,192
and with the passing
of time,

205
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:05,273
He forgets he was ever a wolf.

206
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,518
One day
many years later,

207
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:13,336
as he was out hunting
with his master,

208
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,910
He runs sevile
to collect the prey,

209
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:30,070
but he realizes the prey
was the old leader of the pack.

210
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:38,805
He falls silent with shame
but the old wolf speaks

211
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:40,920
and says to him:

212
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:46,492
"I die happy because
I lived my life as a wolf.

213
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:51,194
"You, on the other hand, belong
neither to the world of wolves

214
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,814
"Nor to the world of men!"

215
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,552
Hunger comes and goes,

216
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:01,972
but dignity, once lost

217
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:07,163
never returns.

218
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:24,120
1989-1995
RIVERBANK, EX-SOVIET UNION

219
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,381
Kolyma, that girl
is looking at you.

220
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,749
Really?

221
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,546
Yeah, really.

222
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,597
- Do you know her?
- No.

223
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:19,962
- Do you?
- Never seen her before.

224
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,041
But I'd sure remember if I had.

225
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,259
Kolyma, we gotta go!

226
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:54,815
You sure took your time coming back!

227
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,729
Mel, don't tell me
you don't recognize him.

228
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:09,760
- Gagarin!
- Gagarin?

229
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:11,970
Shit!

230
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,839
Gagarin has gone back
to Riverbank!

231
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,822
My mother
I only wrote once

232
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:32,382
and that was to tell me
she had sold the house

233
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,459
and run off with some
truck driver from Romania.

234
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,145
They say that Romanians
make good lovers!

235
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,261
What's that?

236
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,906
Just a little something from
my friends inside

237
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:49,113
to make sure
I won't forget them.

238
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:53,148
So, what are you doing here in the station?

239
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:54,974
Copper, good stuff.

240
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,402
- And who's paying?
- The gimp.

241
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:00,354
As always.

242
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,508
Hey listen, you should be happy
with the price I gave you.

243
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,395
That is my final offer.

244
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:08,931
You think you're dealing with
a bunch of idiots, don't you, gimp?

245
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:11,906
Well you're wrong.
We're only asking for what's fair.

246
00:26:13,764 --> 00:26:16,416
- And what would "fair" be?
- Three times as much.

247
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,426
Three times?

248
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,346
You Siberians
are out of your mind!

249
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:28,065
- Mel, where does he keep the money?
- In the office.

250
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:29,918
- Gagarin, don't...
- Hurry up!

251
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,527
- Jesus Christ, got it!
- Alright.

252
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:43,134
- Come on, let's get outta this fucking dump
- No, Gagarin.

253
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,485
We said what's fair.

254
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:51,813
Fair?

255
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:55,710
And what, exactly,
is fair, Kolyma?

256
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,772
There is no such thing as "fair".

257
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,759
- So how did it happen?
- Mama!

258
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:09,244
Mom!

259
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:16,508
Nobody has been here since
husband was killed.

260
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,154
Here kept all his fishing
gear in here.

261
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,830
Are you sure, you don't
have a better place to live?

262
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,457
There is no better
than seeing

263
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,628
you and Vitalic
every morning, Aunt Katya.

264
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,278
Move!

265
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,495
We're not going to arrest you.

266
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,376
If you do not tell me where Ageyev
and his men are,

267
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:26,114
I'll kill you. Simple as that.

268
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,578
Our jails are full
of people like you.

269
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:32,706
So try and act
intelligently.

270
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,725
Ageyev is very powerful.

271
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:41,159
He's got a lot of men.

272
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,680
And this is his territory.

273
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,762
When he finds out you have taken us,

274
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:49,223
He will kill us all!

275
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:53,254
It would be better to die...

276
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:12,897
Shit, I can't believe it!

277
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:16,516
After 7 years, I find myself
right back where I started from.

278
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:20,291
- What's with them?
- Russian army.

279
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:22,629
When the Soviet Union fell,
they left.

280
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,032
Then they changed their flags
and came back.

281
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,822
Now they're even worse
before.

282
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:29,612
Supposedly they're here to help
the peace process.

283
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,850
Ya, to protect us.

284
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:35,111
But all they really care about
are the weapons factories.

285
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:38,059
A lot of the clans are
making deals with them.

286
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:44,551
And those?

287
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,859
They shot up overnight,
like mushrooms.

288
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:51,020
So now the poor are dying of envy
as well as hunger.

289
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:52,687
That's their fucking problem.

290
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,342
I'm sure as hell not going to stick
around to enjoy the view.

291
00:29:55,342 --> 00:29:58,342
- What are you going to do?
- To get rich.

292
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:02,085
That's a good one! Nobody in
Riverbank has ever gotten rich.

293
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,325
Well, I guess that means that
I'll be the first.

294
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:09,383
Bring me to see the city!

295
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,845
This is 'bank.
Can you really recognize it!

296
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:21,193
Completely in the hands of
Georgians now: weapons, black market...

297
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,878
They call this Odessa now.

298
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:25,456
The Jews control it.

299
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,303
Diamonds, precious stones...

300
00:30:30,383 --> 00:30:33,613
This is Bridges:
prostitution, drugs...

301
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,486
even a few Black Seed bastards.

302
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,526
Why are they bastards?

303
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,126
What the fuck do you know about
the Black Seed?

304
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,494
Shit, Gagarin, just look at them.
They look like clowns!

305
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:46,383
All covered in gold and no
respect for women...

306
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:50,150
You do not know...
You're the one who doesn't know shit,Kolyma!

307
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:56,202
When I was in jail, if it were not
the Black Seed, I'd be dead.

308
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,982
Come on, brother, take me around!

309
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,512
Bring me to see the world. Come on!

310
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:50,801
Go! Go!

311
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:15,369
What time is it?

312
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:18,738
Almost five.

313
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,195
Your friend with the truck
isn't showing up.

314
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,686
- We're going to have to walk back
- But it's far!

315
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:27,277
And dangerous, too!
We're in Bridges.

316
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:32,236
Here! Put this on.

317
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,990
Come on, let's get a move on.

318
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,491
I was just asking myself...

319
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:17,301
what a bunch of Siberians
are doing in Bridges!

320
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:23,381
- Ghat, did you invite them?
- Not me!

321
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:26,284
So why the hell are they here?

322
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:28,822
There is enough shit around here already.

323
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:32,469
Can one of you Siberians tell me,
Why you are here?

324
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:35,565
Did you ask permission to
come on to our turf?

325
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,205
And armed!

326
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,551
We're on our way home.

327
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:46,930
I am Gagarin, from Riverbank. Let us pass.

328
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,881
Advice for a friend.

329
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:52,623
And I am Vulture,
from Bridges.

330
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:57,488
And Vulture does not take advice
from anybody!

331
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,639
Well, then Vulture is an asshole.

332
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:08,948
Get them!

333
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,865
Welcome.

334
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:07,856
I'm doctor Nikolai Sakurov,
and this is my daughter, Xenya.

335
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,740
It's best you don't move.

336
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:12,532
You can stay with us tonight.

337
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,192
We wouldn't want to trouble you, Doctor.

338
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:16,952
Trouble?

339
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:21,660
My dear woman, my daughter and I
have been welcomed like family

340
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,765
Ever since we came
to Riverbank.

341
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:28,759
I feel like a member of this community,
not the director of the regional hospital.

342
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:35,794
Okay, confirmed. They're the
drug traffickers we were looking for.

343
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:38,460
We'll attack as soon as
our guest tells us

344
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,185
where Ageyev's hideout is.

345
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:43,769
By the way, Headquarters tells me

346
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:47,064
that someone with Ageyev
we have to watch out for...

347
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:52,150
considered highly dangerous.
A certain Yuri Lebedev.

348
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,649
A Siberian, like you.

349
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,452
Goes by the name of Gagarin.

350
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:02,165
Never heard of him.

351
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:04,797
I guess we'll meet him soon enough.

352
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,936
You work on him,
I'll leave you alone.

353
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,654
I made you some tea and

354
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:36,476
Papa said you could
eat some cookies.

355
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:59,036
Was this the knife
that hurt you?

356
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,382
- No, this is a tattoo.
- This hurt you, right?

357
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:11,673
- You like this book?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

358
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:14,688
- Do you want it?
- But it's not yours, it's your father's.

359
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:17,471
Everything here is mine,
the house, yard...

360
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,766
My father is mine.

361
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:23,478
- Do you want the yard?
- No, the book is plenty.

362
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:24,989
Good.

363
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:34,298
Papa says that I'm special,

364
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,409
and that I play the piano well.

365
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:38,974
- And you?
- I'm no-not the piano...

366
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,376
Not the piano.
Special!

367
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,665
And you're special, too?

368
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,807
Once, when once I was four,
I won the record for beatings.

369
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,913
My father beat me for half an hour
and I didn't cry.

370
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:55,391
Not once.

371
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,690
- Why?
- Why what?

372
00:37:57,923 --> 00:38:00,923
- Why did not you cry?
- Because men don't cry.

373
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:08,765
Oh! Poor men!
It is good to cry!

374
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:11,479
Are you happy when you cry?

375
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,619
That is too hard a question.

376
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,873
This is what I think.
I think...

377
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:25,248
that you do not cry,
but I do not read.

378
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,262
And that is worse than crying!

379
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,248
What do you mean you don't read?

380
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,498
Xenya does not know how to read.
Poor Xenya!

381
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,774
You can find someone
to read to you.

382
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:42,879
- Will you read to me?
- Of course!

383
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:48,705
Here!

384
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,923
"With yards of sunset yard

385
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:55,780
"Along the Nevsky of the world,

386
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,082
"With its glowing trail

387
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:02,083
"I linger with a Don Giovanni air. "

388
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:05,988
It's by a poet named Mayakovsky.

389
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:09,762
But do not ask me what it means,
I did not understand a word.

390
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:13,594
Xenya does not read
and Kolyma does not understand.

391
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,285
Kolyma!

392
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,996
- What is that?
- Kolyma!

393
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:44,060
The new doctor's daughter. She
arrived the same day you came back.

394
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:51,485
- She's got it all going!
- Except she's not all there in the head.

395
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:28,767
She's fine, thank you!

396
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:31,871
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

397
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:35,262
I guess Xenya's glad to
have found Kolyma.

398
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:41,569
That's very nice, Xenya but
you should really go home now.

399
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:45,830
People of Riverbank,
I, Yuri Lebedev

400
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:47,370
also known as Gagarin,

401
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,086
inform you that I have had
enough of this shit

402
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:53,223
Therefore, I have decided to kill myself.

403
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,423
Farewell, you shitfaces!

404
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:14,406
Do not worry, Xenya
he'll come up now.

405
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,137
He's probably swimming
under the boat.

406
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:19,174
No, he's not coming back up.

407
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,074
Gagarin, stop being such a jerk!
Come up now, asshole!

408
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:26,083
- He's not coming up.
- Mel, stop horsing around!

409
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,665
He's not even there, Kolyma.
Maybe he drowned.

410
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:31,371
Do not believe it, Xenya.

411
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:34,187
Gagarin, he always makes
jokes like that.

412
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,845
He's just making jokes.

413
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:48,296
See? I can stay under
for two whole minutes.

414
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,886
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crying, for you.

415
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:59,015
See, what did I tell you?
It was all a joke.

416
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,413
Nothing can kill Gagarin.

417
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:08,932
Don't worry, Xenya, it'll be alright.
You'll be okay.

418
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,482
Are you really crying for me?

419
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:21,605
Let me tell you, it is not worth it.

420
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:25,545
Nobody has ever cried for me.

421
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:45,095
People call them crazy,
insane, abnormal...

422
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,449
all because we don't understand
what they're thinking and saying.

423
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:53,191
But their language is the language of God.

424
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,421
That is why they are called
"A Gift from God."

425
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,223
And we must
respect them all.

426
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:06,217
Nobody is allowed
to lay a finger on them,

427
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,394
and it's up to us
to protect them

428
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:11,690
even if it cost us our lives.

429
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:18,410
Now, let's drink our "Chifir,"
The best tea in the whole world.

430
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:22,283
First we enjoy its warmth

431
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:27,654
and we appreciate its aroma,

432
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:33,552
and only then do we taste its flavour.

433
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,843
Three pleasures in one.

434
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:48,077
And think it is only just water!

435
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,632
Kolyma draws.

436
00:43:57,362 --> 00:44:00,209
He wants to study with you.

437
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:03,401
I cannot say if he is any good

438
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:07,601
but maybe you could kindly
look and see

439
00:44:07,634 --> 00:44:10,983
if our Holy Mother
guides his hand.

440
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:21,489
There is nothing for me to read.
Like an empty notebook.

441
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:25,255
Clean, white pages
waiting to be filled.

442
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:29,582
Kolyma, this is Ink

443
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:31,634
master of tattoos.

444
00:44:38,547 --> 00:44:42,541
Yes, the Mother by
the grace of our Lord,

445
00:44:43,156 --> 00:44:45,195
has blessed your hands.

446
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,373
But...

447
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:51,883
a tattoo is not simply a drawing.

448
00:44:52,532 --> 00:44:55,848
A tattoo artist
is like a confessor.

449
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:59,635
He writes the story of a man
on his body.

450
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:11,061
Mans' lives can all
seem all the same.

451
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:14,707
You're born, you grow up,
you fall in love,

452
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:17,162
You have children, you work

453
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:20,016
You die.

454
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:25,550
Some enjoy life,
Some don't.

455
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:30,829
But we Siberians, Kolyma,
we fight it.

456
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:35,250
You must do your very best to learn.

457
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:38,932
For many months
you will do only one thing.

458
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,288
Observe.

459
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:46,641
I heard one of his men
is a real cop hunter.

460
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:50,514
Something fierce, a different
breed from the rest of you.

461
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:53,520
Comes somewhere far away.

462
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:56,851
I do not know, believe me.
I'm not that important.

463
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:00,524
Ageyev has got a lot of
good strong men.

464
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,707
You will never catch him.

465
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:05,942
Because Allah
is on his side.

466
00:46:07,383 --> 00:46:10,613
That's funny, cause I'm pretty sure
he is on my side.

467
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,329
God helps one side sometimes

468
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:15,442
and sometimes he
helps the other.

469
00:46:16,663 --> 00:46:19,314
What matters is being on
the right side at the right moment.

470
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:29,496
No, no, please!
I dunno a thing!

471
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,438
I know nothing!
No, please!

472
00:46:41,177 --> 00:46:42,421
Get out of here!

473
00:46:43,193 --> 00:46:46,608
You don't know shit, and another death
isn't going to do anybody any good.

474
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,937
And maybe because God
is on your side right now.

475
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,414
So go before he changes his mind.

476
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,168
How you say "crazy"
where you come from?

477
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,039
We say, "Gift from God."

478
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,098
Kolyma, get up!
The river is flooding.

479
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:21,912
It's already washed away
some houses from the banks.

480
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,310
Come on, they need all the help
they can get.

481
00:47:52,987 --> 00:47:55,377
- Vitalic!
- Kolyma!

482
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,747
The river is washing away everything!

483
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:00,985
Gagarin and Mel are
already down at the canal.

484
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:03,059
There is all kinds of stuff you can have!

485
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,883
Grandfather Kuzya says we have to
help the others down at the river.

486
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:07,320
Shit, Kolyma!

487
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:09,778
There are so many helping already.

488
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,260
For once, we don't have to steal

489
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,569
or take out our knives!

490
00:48:12,604 --> 00:48:13,978
Please!

491
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,922
- Kolyma!
- Get back inside Xenya! It's pouring here.

492
00:48:23,964 --> 00:48:26,652
Papa is at the hospital.
Xenya is all alone!

493
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:28,147
Wait for me, I'm coming with you!

494
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,359
It is dangerous, the river
isn't normal today!

495
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:34,739
I know it is not normal! But Xenya
is not normal, neither are you!

496
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,758
Damnit, Xenya, I told you that
you're not coming with us!

497
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:38,902
But why?

498
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:43,481
I'm not a little girl, you know.
I'm not a little girl!

499
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:46,137
I am not going to be killed out there.

500
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:49,149
If I wanted to die,
I would do it myself!

501
00:48:49,149 --> 00:48:51,059
Stop it! Go inside!

502
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,894
Come on, Kolyma. Let's go.

503
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,367
That must be worth
at least 200 rubles.

504
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:35,104
What?

505
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,216
That table there!

506
00:49:36,864 --> 00:49:39,482
And those tires are worth
at least 20 a piece.

507
00:49:40,032 --> 00:49:42,366
Here is a whole
case of vodka!

508
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:44,575
Here are more!

509
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,438
The liquor store must have flooded!

510
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:52,191
Hey Vitalic, your mother,
can she sell these?

511
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,303
Vitalic!

512
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:56,155
Look what I found!

513
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:03,225
What the fuck would
we do with the piano?

514
00:50:03,297 --> 00:50:04,923
Shit, it's a good thousand!

515
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:10,743
Come on! We got to get it out
before the current grabs it.

516
00:50:10,786 --> 00:50:13,153
Who is going to buy a soggy piano?

517
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,777
I hate piano music anyways.

518
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:18,111
Shut up, Mel!
Just pull the rope.

519
00:50:23,073 --> 00:50:24,284
On my count.

520
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:27,615
One, two, three!

521
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:54,434
Vitalic?!

522
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:58,146
Shit! Vitalic, he fell under!
Fuck!

523
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,186
Vitalic!

524
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,738
How long has he been under?

525
00:51:41,317 --> 00:51:42,975
I asked you!

526
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,375
I asked you!

527
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:49,084
How long has he been fucking under?!

528
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:51,071
Vitalic!

529
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:56,346
Vitalic! Vitalic!

530
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:15,646
What was the fucking piano
going to get you, anyway?

531
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:21,567
- Money.
- It's all you think about anymore.

532
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:25,861
If it were not for that piano,
Vitalic would still be here!

533
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,926
Oh, so it's my fault now?

534
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:31,072
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

535
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,264
Xenya!

536
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:11,113
Papa! Papa!

537
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:24,620
- Papa is not here.
- Don't worry, Xenya.

538
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,954
We will stay with you
until he gets back.

539
00:54:39,596 --> 00:54:41,669
Papa will be back soon.

540
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,406
Vitalic?

541
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:49,769
Is he ever coming back?

542
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:54,433
Vitalic is never coming back,
Xenya. He's dead.

543
00:54:56,813 --> 00:54:58,220
Yes.

544
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:02,245
Yes, he's dead.
He's not coming back.

545
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:03,747
He's dead! He's dead!

546
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:12,460
Kolyma reads all kinds of books to Xenya.

547
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,179
Does Gagarin know how to read, too?

548
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,302
Read?
Of course I know how to read.

549
00:55:19,342 --> 00:55:21,382
So now Gagarin
will read to Xenya.

550
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:24,102
No, Xenya, come on.
I don't feel like it.

551
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:26,052
So Gagarin does
not know how to read.

552
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:30,406
Yes, I do. I just don't feel like
reading right now.

553
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,892
Please! Please!

554
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:38,413
Pretty please!

555
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,868
Gagarin is nice to read to me now.

556
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:02,758
"Ask not what end the gods
have set for you,

557
00:56:03,504 --> 00:56:08,971
"For me... Be wise,
Strain the wine

558
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:12,718
"And since life is brief...

559
00:56:13,392 --> 00:56:15,399
"Seize the day.

560
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:17,675
"Don't think about

561
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,702
"Tomorrow. "

562
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:33,931
This is for fucking kids!

563
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:38,543
- Why the hell did you bring us here?
- You'll see, or should I say...

564
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:39,860
you will hear!

565
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,161
Yeah, what?
What is there to hear?

566
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,585
Real western music!

567
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:04,460
Xenya's never been on a ride.

568
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:09,034
Okay, let's go. I'm paying.

569
00:58:11,828 --> 00:58:13,007
Yes!

570
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:18,127
- Where did you get that?
- You and I have to talk.

571
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:35,446
Ladies and gentlemen, I officially declare
that this blue ribbon

572
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,941
is happiness!

573
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:43,893
- Stay close to me. Very close.
- Okay. Very close.

574
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:49,012
- You're going to make Kolyma fly.
- Yeah, let's make him fly!

575
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:08,534
You'd say that is
fun to fly!

576
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,394
Terrible ride?

577
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:13,844
Papa!

578
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:18,325
Papa look
what Kolyma gave me.

579
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:24,153
Xenya is very happy!

580
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:29,622
Kolyma, please
come in for a minute.

581
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:34,745
I want to thank you.

582
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:39,920
You kids, you are
so good to my daughter.

583
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:44,432
You see, I am always
at the hospital and...

584
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:46,675
Xenya!

585
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:53,338
She is going through a very
delicate period.

586
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:56,632
Her body is now that of a woman.

587
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:58,713
But her mind...

588
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:02,323
She's feeling things that
she cannot understand

589
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:04,338
and she doesn't know how to react.

590
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,453
Because she is...

591
01:01:06,877 --> 01:01:08,665
She is...

592
01:01:09,373 --> 01:01:11,032
A gift from God.

593
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:17,077
Exactly! A gift from God.

594
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:37,145
- Careful, it is dangerous.
- Xenya wants to see.

595
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:41,496
- It's beautiful! I want one too!
- Careful.

596
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,766
Very high!

597
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:02,072
- Aren't they good?
- Yes!

598
01:02:12,576 --> 01:02:14,485
Very, very...

599
01:02:15,103 --> 01:02:16,598
And Xenya is good too!

600
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:22,783
Stupid!

601
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:32,380
Let's fly!
Make Xenya fly!

602
01:02:36,608 --> 01:02:38,365
Make Xenya fly!

603
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,287
Xenya, come.

604
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,377
I want to show you how the good Lord

605
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:47,483
has blessed our doves' nest.

606
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,023
Look.

607
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,523
The moment has come.

608
01:03:11,234 --> 01:03:14,104
It is not enough to observe any longer.

609
01:03:14,786 --> 01:03:17,274
Have you decided what it will be?

610
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:27,261
Impossible love.

611
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:33,698
Then write it forever
on your body.

612
01:03:36,738 --> 01:03:41,790
I cannot wait to see if the Mother
still guides your hands.

613
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:23,291
The sky and the river...

614
01:04:24,772 --> 01:04:26,201
and flowers.

615
01:04:28,325 --> 01:04:30,691
It's all so beautiful!

616
01:04:31,845 --> 01:04:33,984
So very beautiful!

617
01:04:40,966 --> 01:04:43,453
Xenya is only happy
when she is with Kolyma.

618
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:46,374
That's not good, Xenya.
I'm happy to see you too, but...

619
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:47,202
But?

620
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,131
I always go to Kolyma,
but he never comes to me.

621
01:04:52,486 --> 01:04:54,242
Why do you not want
to see Xenya?

622
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:57,030
I want to go to
the fair with you

623
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,557
swim in the river with you...

624
01:04:58,598 --> 01:05:02,210
I want you to read to me,
and to hold my hand, and then...

625
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:05,500
- Xenya, be careful!
- Give you a kiss.

626
01:05:11,143 --> 01:05:13,893
I knew it. I knew that
Kolyma would taste good!

627
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,460
Xenya, sit down!

628
01:05:16,486 --> 01:05:18,341
Why is Kolyma mad at me?

629
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:22,053
Why is Kolyma mad at me?

630
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,844
If Xenya comes looking for me,
I'm not here.

631
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:30,535
Even if I'm here,
I'm not here!

632
01:05:30,535 --> 01:05:31,429
But why?

633
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,508
I know why!

634
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,013
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

635
01:05:45,384 --> 01:05:47,424
These are really beautiful!

636
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:50,277
Who did it for you?

637
01:05:50,857 --> 01:05:53,671
A colleague of yours,
a guy in Moscow.

638
01:05:54,153 --> 01:05:56,193
Really, what's his name?

639
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:57,639
Plato Ivanov.

640
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:00,609
Plato Ivanov?

641
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:03,849
Wait a minute.

642
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:07,265
Plato Ivanov? I know him!

643
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:10,978
He is good!

644
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,699
He is very good...

645
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,062
but I'm Ink,

646
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,249
master of tattoos.

647
01:06:44,811 --> 01:06:46,338
Read.

648
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,655
This man killed someone.

649
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,252
Who?

650
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:10,027
- Cops. He killed some cops, but...
- But, what?

651
01:07:11,275 --> 01:07:13,315
It is not clear
why he killed them.

652
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,464
Where is he from?

653
01:07:15,853 --> 01:07:17,740
Who is his family?
It's not clear.

654
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:20,260
Exactly. It's not clear.

655
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,263
He's no cop killer
He's a Black Seed.

656
01:07:32,557 --> 01:07:34,379
He does business with the police.

657
01:07:34,604 --> 01:07:38,314
Exactly! He is a spy!

658
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:10,824
Up to this point,
we were always inpenetrable.

659
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:14,053
When plague breaks out...

660
01:08:14,671 --> 01:08:17,420
you burn sick people's belongings

661
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:19,821
You know why?

662
01:08:20,623 --> 01:08:23,241
To avoid contamination.

663
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:27,339
Sooner or later...

664
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:31,366
we will not know
what we need anymore.

665
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:35,758
We won't even know who we are.

666
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:40,265
When that day comes,
Kolyma,

667
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:45,896
Not even the signs cut into
our skin will help us.

668
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,695
Moscow, with what money?

669
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:01,515
- Where'd that come from?
- I told you we had to talk.

670
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,033
Hello, Gagarin.

671
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:06,730
Grandfather Kuzya!

672
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:13,392
What is this filth
doing in our house?

673
01:09:13,938 --> 01:09:16,010
Okay, what's up. I'd better be going.

674
01:09:18,065 --> 01:09:22,189
You're not going anywhere!
Clean it up first.

675
01:09:26,385 --> 01:09:27,814
The table!

676
01:09:28,946 --> 01:09:30,375
Clean it!

677
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:48,817
Thoroughly!

678
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:17,744
Kolyma!

679
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,049
Gagarin!

680
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,485
- Gagarin, wait!
- Who the fuck does he think he is?

681
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,787
Those are our rules,
Gagarin.

682
01:10:48,085 --> 01:10:50,197
You know we can't have
money inside the house!

683
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:51,829
Does that seem normal to you?

684
01:10:51,829 --> 01:10:53,813
It's almost the year 2000
for Christ's sake!

685
01:10:53,813 --> 01:10:55,787
Money is not
some dirty thing, you know.

686
01:10:56,598 --> 01:10:58,801
I don't buy these
rules of yours anymore.

687
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:01,712
I do not believe in anything,
so I can do whatever I want.

688
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:15,188
- What is this place?
- Just some people I know.

689
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:16,716
People with friends
in Moscow.

690
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:21,105
- Hey Gagarin.
- I brought a friend along.

691
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:29,555
Kolyma.

692
01:11:32,823 --> 01:11:34,350
Welcome.

693
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:38,862
- Hello Gagarin.
- Hey, Boris.

694
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:46,257
Gagarin!

695
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,753
These people are
the Black Seed!

696
01:11:50,007 --> 01:11:51,436
I'll wait for you outside.

697
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:03,535
Hello, guys. How's it going?

698
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:30,158
Kolyma, wait!

699
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:31,861
Kolyma!

700
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:35,898
- You fucking junkie.
- You deal with the Black Seeds!

701
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,385
- You make me sick!
- Kolyma, listen to me!

702
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,399
Talk through your nose, asshole!

703
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:43,214
Hey fucking dickhead!

704
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:45,241
You've become a brainwashed idiot

705
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,315
with all the bullshit
your grandfather spouts!

706
01:12:47,418 --> 01:12:50,266
He and that little retarded
whore friend of yours!

707
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,908
Watch out, Kolyma!

708
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:05,624
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!

709
01:13:14,235 --> 01:13:16,624
May our Lord watch over you, Gagarin.

710
01:13:36,347 --> 01:13:38,202
Hey, you! Halt!

711
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,381
Don't you know there is a curfew
in this neighborhood?

712
01:13:45,244 --> 01:13:47,480
Didn't they ever teach you how to speak?

713
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,802
- Let's see your ID.
- I don't have an ID.

714
01:13:52,124 --> 01:13:54,296
My name's Kolyma, from Riverbank.

715
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:03,673
Want one?

716
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:12,502
Riverbank? We know all about you Siberians.

717
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:19,028
This man
worked with us.

718
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:21,171
We know that your clan killed him.

719
01:14:21,981 --> 01:14:27,481
Just give me the name of who did it,
and you can walk out free.

720
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,890
Can you see ok?

721
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:42,965
Maybe there is something in your eye.

722
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,009
As you wish.

723
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:10,907
I am Shorty from Magadan.
Welcome, brother.

724
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:16,286
So you can tattoo!

725
01:16:16,386 --> 01:16:18,492
This is a blessing
for our family.

726
01:16:18,562 --> 01:16:20,570
Everyone wants a tattoo here.

727
01:16:21,474 --> 01:16:23,580
And they will pay well for it, too.

728
01:16:24,258 --> 01:16:26,047
I'm still learning.

729
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:31,033
Besides, I'm not very good yet
and I don't have any tools with me.

730
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:34,882
Everyone has a role here.
Igor is our tailor.

731
01:16:34,947 --> 01:16:37,217
Kiri is our carpenter.
He fixes the bunks.

732
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:39,739
Yahoud is our cook.

733
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,562
Here if you don't do something,
you're nothing.

734
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:47,771
Don't worry about the tools.
Just tell us what you need.

735
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,581
Kolyma!

736
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:46,819
Kolyma, my son...

737
01:18:47,081 --> 01:18:52,067
I have seen to it that money has arrived
in the hands of the right people,

738
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:54,723
so you will be getting out soon.

739
01:18:55,849 --> 01:18:59,329
Unfortunately, this is
not good news.

740
01:18:59,753 --> 01:19:02,754
I had to do this
because when you are free,

741
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:06,728
an even more difficult task
awaits you.

742
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,380
Grandfather Kuzya.

743
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,498
Welcome back, Kolyma.

744
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:48,865
I am happy to see the Mother
still guides your hands.

745
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:52,836
I had the chance to practice.

746
01:19:54,988 --> 01:19:57,289
Do you know why we got you out?

747
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:05,290
Something terrible has happened to Xenya.

748
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:10,475
And the House of Lords punishment
will fall on all of us

749
01:20:11,084 --> 01:20:13,229
because they did not protect her.

750
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:15,367
And now all that remains

751
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:20,011
is to show the Lord
that we are attentive to his signs

752
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:24,393
and we'll carry out
his justice.

753
01:21:04,494 --> 01:21:06,469
They found her in the park.

754
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:10,406
Two women
from Riverbank.

755
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:13,991
She had been raped and beaten.

756
01:21:17,743 --> 01:21:19,368
Xenya!

757
01:21:19,887 --> 01:21:21,894
Xenya, it's me.

758
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:25,037
It's Kolyma.

759
01:21:27,695 --> 01:21:29,670
She cannot hear you

760
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:32,583
Her mind is gone

761
01:21:38,672 --> 01:21:40,330
Xenya.

762
01:21:59,345 --> 01:22:02,444
The is the law:
You must find who did it.

763
01:22:02,897 --> 01:22:04,652
Mel will go with you.

764
01:22:05,489 --> 01:22:08,272
I loaded this
with my own hands.

765
01:22:08,817 --> 01:22:10,956
That means you have
the right to use it

766
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,514
to kill whoever
must be killed.

767
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,589
This is the task
reserved for you.

768
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,018
Why me?

769
01:22:19,986 --> 01:22:22,474
Be careful how you answer,
Grandfather Kuzya.

770
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:25,063
There is no turning back once
you kill someone.

771
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:50,218
Go! Go!

772
01:22:50,323 --> 01:22:51,371
Go!

773
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,805
Go!

774
01:22:53,907 --> 01:22:55,631
Get out!

775
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,801
Come on!

776
01:23:13,973 --> 01:23:15,565
Grandfather!

777
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:32,210
The Mongols call Siberia,
"The Sleeping Land."

778
01:23:33,205 --> 01:23:36,947
I want to go back there
and lay down.

779
01:23:58,518 --> 01:24:00,787
Ok, we've got a car

780
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,707
guns and enough money to
loosen some tongues.

781
01:24:03,254 --> 01:24:04,886
All of the clans have been notified

782
01:24:04,886 --> 01:24:06,196
and they're willing
to collaborate.

783
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:10,732
So, hunting season
begins tonight, Mel.

784
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:14,325
I'd like to bring my mother a fish.

785
01:24:15,094 --> 01:24:17,364
She really loves fish.

786
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:23,598
I haven't gone fishing
in so long.

787
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:27,829
Since we lost Vitalic.

788
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,072
Kolyma!

789
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,174
I heard you, Mel, but
now's not the time, okay?

790
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:40,693
I dont' feel like it and besides,
we don't have any equipment.

791
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:42,262
If that's the reason,

792
01:24:42,296 --> 01:24:44,467
you will find everything you need
in the toolshed.

793
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:52,401
Nobody has set foot in here
since Gagarin has left.

794
01:24:52,728 --> 01:24:54,189
You will need a flashlight.

795
01:25:28,634 --> 01:25:31,416
Finally! Yes! The rod!

796
01:25:31,898 --> 01:25:34,964
And the drill should be here somewhere.
Help me.

797
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:55,191
Is that where you left your switchblade?

798
01:26:56,702 --> 01:26:58,840
Kolyma!

799
01:27:03,165 --> 01:27:07,541
And the switchblade placed
in the door of a house...

800
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:12,055
means that a meeting of
destinies will take place there.

801
01:27:49,183 --> 01:27:51,322
You sure took your time finding me!

802
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:55,448
Any longer, you and I, we'll
have to die of old age.

803
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,554
It wasn't easy.

804
01:27:58,848 --> 01:28:02,623
I never thought I'd
see you wearing that.

805
01:28:03,936 --> 01:28:05,213
It's horrible.

806
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,209
It is horrible...

807
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:12,223
but enlisting was
the only way to find you.

808
01:28:39,393 --> 01:28:42,296
Oh, I forgot you don't drink.

809
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:46,656
The Russians are right on your tail,
Gagarin.

810
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:48,770
Lots of them.

811
01:28:49,218 --> 01:28:51,422
You won't even know you're dead.

812
01:28:52,963 --> 01:28:54,850
And this isn't good, right?

813
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,752
Because you want to be the one
to kill me.

814
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,420
Strange.

815
01:29:03,619 --> 01:29:07,231
After all this time,
whenever I think about you,

816
01:29:07,331 --> 01:29:09,697
I still picture you as a boy.

817
01:29:28,547 --> 01:29:30,370
Xenya's ribbon.

818
01:29:30,467 --> 01:29:33,053
I found it in Aunt Katya's toolshed.

819
01:29:33,476 --> 01:29:36,640
It's stained with her blood;
so was the wall

820
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:39,839
and the mattress where you slept.

821
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:51,235
I'm listening.

822
01:29:52,132 --> 01:29:53,595
You want the whole story?

823
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:56,122
It's not like those ones
your grandfather used to tell!

824
01:29:56,165 --> 01:29:58,532
- There is no moral here.
- Just tell me why.

825
01:29:58,628 --> 01:30:01,858
There is no why. No reason.
And no excuses either!

826
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:05,566
It just happened.
Sucks, doesn't it?

827
01:30:10,309 --> 01:30:12,611
I destroy everything I touch.

828
01:30:19,974 --> 01:30:22,495
Grandfather loaded it for me.

829
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:31,397
I've been waiting for you.

830
01:30:33,222 --> 01:30:35,335
I kept looking towards the woods, every day,

831
01:30:35,335 --> 01:30:38,117
trying to imagine when exactly you'd appear.

832
01:30:39,718 --> 01:30:41,791
I missed you, you know?

833
01:30:41,991 --> 01:30:43,998
We've had great company.

834
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,728
I was always alone, Kolyma.
I've been alone my whole life!

835
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,095
When I got out of jail,
I said to myself:

836
01:30:53,095 --> 01:30:55,364
"You belong to no one
and no one belongs to you!

837
01:30:55,495 --> 01:30:57,634
"And since the game is dirty,
No rules!

838
01:30:57,735 --> 01:31:00,997
"Take everything you can without asking.
Without saying 'thank you!'

839
01:31:01,063 --> 01:31:04,608
"Because no one, no one is going to
give you anything. Not for free! "

840
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:11,679
But instead, I ended
up in this shithole.

841
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,088
I want to go back, Kolyma.

842
01:31:26,601 --> 01:31:28,772
There is only one way.

843
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:35,109
I know.

844
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,990
And when a criminal
dies,

845
01:32:26,058 --> 01:32:29,736
his switchblade
must be broken.

846
01:32:29,802 --> 01:32:32,520
One part remains
with him,

847
01:32:33,323 --> 01:32:39,041
The other part, with the person whom
he loves most in this world.

848
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,522
Why?

849
01:32:40,812 --> 01:32:43,811
Because that way
on Judgment Day,

850
01:32:43,885 --> 01:32:46,786
They can find
each other

851
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:50,373
And be reunited in peace.

852
01:33:22,157 --> 01:33:24,328
Dear mama,
you were right...

853
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:27,430
Some choices don't allow you
to turn back.

854
01:33:27,534 --> 01:33:29,956
And now, I can never
come home again.

855
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:34,084
I think of you often.
Take care of yourself.

856
01:33:35,118 --> 01:33:38,217
I've decided to follow the sun
and will go west.

857
01:33:38,959 --> 01:33:40,846
I'm not sure what
my future holds,

858
01:33:40,846 --> 01:33:44,195
but I can tattoo,
use a knife and shoot a gun.

859
01:33:44,655 --> 01:33:46,312
Don't worry about me.

860
01:33:46,606 --> 01:33:49,127
I will stop you must fight life

861
01:33:49,326 --> 01:33:51,562
and I'll know how to.
