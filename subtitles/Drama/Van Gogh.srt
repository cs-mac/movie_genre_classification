1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
- Taking them?
- No

2
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,499
Dr. Gachet's place?

3
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,900
He won't arrive until
the 7 o'clock train

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,750
Know a cheap boarding house?

5
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,900
Ravoux's. That's the only one

6
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,400
You needed the next stop,
Ravoux's is closer to Auvers

7
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:00,900
- Glass of wine?
- I don't drink

8
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,399
Wait!

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't go like that.
No suitcase?

10
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,600
I'll store all this
and go with you.

11
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,399
- You're no talker.
- I am...

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,700
- What are you doing in Auvers?
- Nothing

13
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,399
That's restful

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,799
You're in Auvers for the air.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,199
I'm the railroad company
agent in Chaponval

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,300
Whole family's on the railroad.
Trains put me to sleep as a baby

17
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:46,300
Dad was a stationmaster
I couldn't pass...

18
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,399
...the test.

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,000
There's Ravoux's. If there's a room
she'll take you. But it's simple.

20
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm not picky

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,799
Buddy here needs a place

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,050
3.50 francs room and board,
drinks extra.

23
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,300
- I don't drink
- He lives off his rotgut.

24
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,900
Want to see the room?

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Bread and wine...

26
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,399
Here you are. Clean.

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,700
Fresh sheets once a week,
you make your own bed

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,300
A big cloest for your stuff

29
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,799
A view of the sea?

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Lean out, you see the beach

31
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:30,600
Pretty port

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Auvers-sur-Oise
is a charming town

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,800
Vessenots Street

34
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,200
There's Dr. Gachet
Tightwad took a cab!

35
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,200
"A handsom went
trotting along...

36
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,599
"Hippety-hop..."

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,699
- Taking it?
- It's fine...

38
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,300
- Going to Gachet's?
- Yes, where is it?

39
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,350
Vessenots Street,
And the bags?

40
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll send for them tomorrow.

41
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Still the right hand...

42
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,800
Change your pedal...hold it...

43
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,800
There! Then it shifts...

44
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,300
Right hand...

45
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,899
There...

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,800
Let up on it...softly...

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,799
Very good, Marguerite.

48
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
You have talent
Too bad you stopped

49
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,800
I stopped when mother died.
I'll start again

50
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,500
I hope so

51
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,850
Play "Lakme" for me

52
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:50,225
I can't play "Lakme"

53
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,600
Play "Lakme" Marugerite

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,699
You won't play it?

55
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,200
It makes me cry
I had a monkey named Lakme

56
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:02,399
And?

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,399
It's gone?

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,300
Dad put it in a zoo,
said it was too dirty

59
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,600
- Let the teacher play it
- No

60
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,899
Odd, to love a monkey

61
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,950
- It's not for tonight
- No, tomorrow

62
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:17,000
- They stink
- I bathed her every morning

63
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,600
Like a baby

64
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,200
Let's go on

65
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
We'll do staccatos

66
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,799
You're a bit late

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,199
I took the 3 o'clock train

68
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,300
I mean late in the season
The lilac's going to leaf

69
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,200
Come in

70
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,900
Sit down

71
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,800
I expected you in my
office...in Paris

72
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't see patients here

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,100
I've a note from my brother

74
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm not set up here
We'll manage...

75
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,500
...with what's at hand

76
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,800
Undress

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,100
My drawers too?

78
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:42,200
Keep them on

79
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,100
Need a napkin, Dad?

80
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,199
Smells good...Stew?

81
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,900
- It's not for tonight
- No, tomorrow

82
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,800
Lie on the couch

83
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,200
Sit on the table

84
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,100
Stare at me

85
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,400
Describe your fits

86
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,650
Go on

87
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,599
They vary

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,300
Recall the strongest?

89
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,100
The last one

90
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,850
How long ago?

91
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,525
Nearly 3 months

92
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,199
Time of day?

93
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,100
At night. 2 or 3 a.m.
I'd just fallen asleep

94
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,999
How long before?

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,400
Half and hour
I woke with a raging headache

96
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,999
Where?

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,150
There.
I'd never felt such pain

98
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:58,300
It lasted at least 20 minutes

99
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,900
A cold compress helped a bit

100
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,050
Did it return?

101
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,099
Not entirely

102
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,399
Bearable. And now?

103
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,799
I have a steady dull cahe

104
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,799
Now and then it vanishes, for a while

105
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,600
No pain...behind the eye?
Back of the neck?

106
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:19,899
Always on the side...

107
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,000
- ...you showed me?
- Yes, there

108
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,100
I have others, like everyone
but they're different

109
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
How do you know?

110
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:30,399
Who's that guy?

111
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm not kept informed
A painter, I think

112
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,599
That so?

113
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,499
Here for rest and treatment

114
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Can't he rest here?
We have room

115
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,400
Must I spell it out?

116
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Great engraving. First printing

117
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,299
See how the blacks stand out?
Superb!

118
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,100
And the central figure, remove
it and it's a routine picture

119
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
I needn't tell you that

120
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,800
It's by Meryon
I'd like to have treated him

121
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,900
He was really sick

122
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,000
- Dad, I took some of your books
- My son, Paul, "Coco" to us

123
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,499
Do I...inform your brother?

124
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,800
- What do I owe you?
- I'll settle it with him

125
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,500
He's not here. How much?

126
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,200
7 francs all right?

127
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,000
- Need lodgings?
- It's done

128
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,599
Where, if I may ask?

129
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,699
The cafe near the station

130
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,100
Ravoux's, It's simple.
How much?

131
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:57,500
3.50 francs

132
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,900
I understand

133
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
Let's eat

134
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Your sister's late, as usual

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,900
He's odd
I showed him my Renoir

136
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,300
What's for dinner?

137
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:14,300
Rabbit

138
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,100
- Where's the wine from?
- Duval's

139
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
It's not the greatest

140
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,799
I was saying
he ignored my Renoir

141
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
A doctor shouldn't always
discuss painting

142
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,100
He should think of other things

143
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:32,000
What?

144
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,899
You haven't eaten?

145
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,400
- I can serve you some soup
- I'd like that

146
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,900
Dinner here's at 7 o'clock

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Sit on the other side,
it's quieter

148
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
- You still here?
- I haven't budged

149
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,099
I don't drink

150
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,200
Your napkin ring
It's the prettiest

151
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
You don't dose it?

152
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,200
People think that means pouring
wine in the soup and stirring

153
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,100
No, you save
just a bit of broth

154
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:44,000
...add a good spoonful of wine

155
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,299
That's how I do it

156
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,400
It's called dosing in my Mom's
town, spiking in my Dad's

157
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,500
Yet they're only 20 miles apart

158
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,300
Dad calls a funnel a "fontel"

159
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:03,100
In Mom's town it's a "tunner"

160
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:06,150
Where's your Mom from?

161
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,200
She's dead and buried

162
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,100
Life's funny

163
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,899
My brother's...

164
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,699
...first post was at Penglon,
near the grave site...

165
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,100
The big curve before the river.
There's a railroad crossing

166
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,900
The Clermont express roars by.
Every year...

167
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,500
...it runs over someone

168
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,299
No, don't

169
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,800
- I thought you were asleep
- No, I needed some air

170
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
What'll I do with this?

171
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,900
You'll see

172
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,750
God any soup?

173
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:06,100
Here's some

174
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,700
It's easier to wash at
the pump in the yard

175
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Did you hear me?.

176
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,599
I heard you

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,000
- I'm Adeline. I'm 13
- I'm Vincent

178
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,600
What're you writing?

179
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,000
To my brother

180
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,450
You write often?

181
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,825
May I read it?

182
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,200
Too bad...

183
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,250
My grandson...

184
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,499
...wants to chat

185
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,300
My grandson
wants to talk to you

186
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,550
I'd like you to do my portrait

187
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:23,100
- What?
- I want you to paint me

188
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,900
Go home, grandpa

189
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,700
Come have a drink

190
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,600
- Your health
- And yours

191
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,600
To health and wealth

192
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Wealth

193
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,500
Here he comes...

194
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,300
What's up?

195
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,699
What?

196
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
My portrait

197
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Like it? The blue?

198
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,300
Want your portrait in blue?

199
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,900
Smile

200
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,000
Life isn't so bad, there's
even room for the village idiot.

201
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
I'll cost you 2 sous

202
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,600
I got no money

203
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,800
Take it and scram

204
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
Scram!

205
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,000
...Cezanne can't stand me.
Called us "Gauguin and Van Gag"

206
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:39,400
- Among aritists, that's mild
- I don't call him "seize- anes"

207
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,900
"16 asses"
I never thought of that

208
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,599
That's my house

209
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,900
Cezanne throws a lot away,
like all great painters. Do you?

210
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:51,999
Never
My family does it for me

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,300
My Guillaumin
but I've no frame for it

212
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,600
- You don't paint nudes, right?
- I can't afford models

213
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:04,000
A little Seurat

214
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,400
How'd you get it? He doesn't let
sketches out of his studio

215
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:13,800
It's a copy I made
In scret. I'm proud of it

216
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,900
- The scret or the work?
- Both

217
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
The hanged man's house

218
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,699
It's called that...

219
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,400
...but no one hanged there.
It had to do with the owner's name

220
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,200
He's improved since then

221
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,300
I'll show you...

222
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,000
...the finest..

223
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,399
That's really painting!

224
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,000
And how! Cezanne was about
to scrape it. I stopped him

225
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:50,799
I never scrape

226
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,900
Only once, "Christ in the
Garden of Olives"

227
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:55,800
That so?

228
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,300
- My daughter, Marguerite
- Nice flowers in your room...

229
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,700
- What?
- The painting

230
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,100
I want one of yours soon

231
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,250
Well, they're cheap

232
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:06,299
Mrs. Chevalier!

233
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,900
My Paris friend let me down
tonight. Come to my room?

234
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,500
You get what I mean?

235
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,800
- What's this dirt?
- It's a spot

236
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,399
I can see that!

237
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,400
It's rust
Don't worry, you can't see it

238
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:35,400
I can. A new dress!

239
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,700
Lovely old lace
from Aunt Francia

240
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:39,699
Hand-me-downs

241
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,200
You're pretty as a princess

242
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,900
If only
your Mom were here

243
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,500
She's not!

244
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,650
Want some tea?

245
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:00,299
I don't like it

246
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,400
We never see you
It's so long since you came

247
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,699
2 days ago

248
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,999
Seems like ages to me
You're so hesitant

249
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,800
I've watched you.
You hesitate over the simplest things

250
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,700
In fact, you do as you please

251
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,450
How do you want me?

252
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:24,900
Like that. Play

253
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
I've a headache

254
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,500
Want some quinine?

255
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Bring Mr. Van Gogh
some quinine

256
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,600
All right. Let's go on

257
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Don't feel like painting?

258
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,500
No, I don't

259
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,799
Yet I was told..

260
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,200
Who told you?
I'm not a machine

261
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:05,200
Sorry

262
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
I mean it.
Your simpering bores me. Play

263
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,000
At least you don't
pull faces like a virtuoso

264
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,400
Maybe bacause you're not one

265
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,500
You mean I play badly?

266
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,600
That's not for me to say

267
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,700
My sister Mina plays well.
Or so I thought at home

268
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,599
Is she pretty?

269
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you care? Feminine rivalry
"She's prettier than me?"

270
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:32,800
You're cranky with everyone
Must be a strain

271
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:35,600
No, I'm happy as a lark.
Now play

272
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,700
Hold that pose

273
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,900
- You smiling?
- Yes

274
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,999
Not too much

275
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Why are you here?

276
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,700
Simplicity is so difficult

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,700
We'll lunch outside
...in 15 minutes

278
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,800
Never changes!

279
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,800
At home, my mother and sister
always interrupted my work

280
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,799
To eat their lousy Dutch chow

281
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Mother yelled "It's cold" or
"It'll burn!" My sister came...

282
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,400
...never looked at my work

283
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,700
- Women only care about material things.
- Don't be unfair

284
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,600
My late wife valued
painters' work

285
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,299
She adored Cezanne

286
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,900
It hurt her that
I was just an amateur

287
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,100
The "chow" here's not bad.
Mrs. Chevalier's quite the cook...

288
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,000
...except for my mother

289
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,799
It's ready

290
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,900
Marguerite's posing
Mr. Van Gogh's painting

291
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,899
Eating's more important
than painting

292
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,000
You can live without painting
but without food...you die

293
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,700
If I had a cook, I'd let her cook
I'd rather listen to you

294
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,400
So you say, but it's not true

295
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
When the food's ready
you chomp at the bit

296
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,200
Lunch is served!

297
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,400
Come anyway

298
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,300
Coming

299
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,100
Each year he takes Coco
and me to the company fair

300
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,100
The railroad band
plays classics

301
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,100
It's a bit boring

302
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Last year there were ballet
stars from the Opera

303
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,300
They danced to Grieg's
"Solveig's Song"

304
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:14,300
- You like Grieg?
- Don't know him

305
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,100
My life's silly. I've the
right to read, Dad's liberal

306
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:25,899
Using what I learn is
another matter

307
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,300
A girl's called a tomboy on
her looks, not how she feels

308
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,700
We have to hide our
feelings. Men are lucky

309
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,300
They aren't restricted

310
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,799
We spend
all those days shut in...

311
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
...wanting to live. All we
can do is...

312
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,300
Is...?

313
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,100
Embroider

314
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,499
Painting's my embroidery

315
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,100
Go on, make fun!
Idle rich girls are the worst

316
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,100
At least working girls work

317
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,099
You've lived in England

318
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,200
Seen those suffragettes
protest?

319
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,799
I don't like those
marching women

320
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't like to bite or being bitten
I wage my revolt in private

321
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,600
Much good it does me!

322
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm tired of playing

323
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,600
Take the pose!

324
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
No more piano!

325
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,300
- Take the post
- Then it's no pose

326
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Want to know what I think?

327
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't care

328
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,100
I love grouchy painters!

329
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,200
My dress isn't like that

330
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,400
You made it leaden. The train
drags and my hands are claws!

331
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:09,700
It's all nonsense

332
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,600
The colors are like puke! And
your landscapes! You serious?

333
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,799
Is this a pictorial
disagreement?

334
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,400
Pose and shut up. Models have no say
in how pictures are exucted

335
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,499
The very word!

336
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,900
You're a pest! Our guest
kindly offered to paint you...

337
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,700
- I'm not talking to you!
- Enough!

338
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,700
Sure, treat me like your dog!

339
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,299
Hotblooded, like her mother

340
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,300
MY late wife treated our
painter friends better

341
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,900
This generation is hopeless

342
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,900
Admirable! That's the word!

343
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,900
The muted mauve, the rhythem,
background, hands, the swirling skirt...

344
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:52,999
It weighs a ton!

345
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,600
...like a wave, Vincent..
may I call you Vincent?

346
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Painting is making a great
leap with you

347
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,400
How can we keep up with you?

348
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,300
Good news. I went by the gallery
and invited your brother

349
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,000
The whole family's
coming Sunday

350
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,050
I met your sister-in-law
Johanna

351
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,199
Theo's a lucky dog
Admirable woman!

352
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,700
Such a gentle look
yet strong, almost violent

353
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,600
In a positive sense,
of course

354
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,200
I venture to think
their marriage troubles you

355
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,750
You fear it may affect
your close realtions...

356
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:46,200
...with your brother
so fruitful for your work

357
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,799
...will strengthen your ties

358
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,900
Or in fact, restore them in
a calmer, more ample situation

359
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,799
I truly feel this

360
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,900
It's what I wish for
the three of you

361
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,800
I don't like mauve.
I wasn't wearing mauve

362
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,099
Neither was the wall

363
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,100
You paint me from behind
Never look at me head-on

364
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,700
Why not from the front?

365
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,099
Don't I inspire you?

366
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,700
I'm no goddess, but am I that
purple lump on a purple ground?

367
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,000
Look who's here!

368
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,150
We meet again

369
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,300
We met in Arles

370
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,050
I'm glad to see you

371
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,025
Stop, that's mine!

372
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,899
Yours? Impossible

373
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,699
It is. I just paid her for it

374
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,100
All the more reason..
She forgot her belt

375
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,400
It's a small world. When I heard
I thought, "it must be him"

376
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
How's your illness?

377
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,699
It's OK, Cathy

378
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,799
- I'm glad
- It's OK

379
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,300
How we talked!
I love talking to you

380
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
You bored here?

381
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I can come and see you
It's better in the country

382
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,200
Am I still so stingy?

383
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,800
Give me another, that one's...

384
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:34,300
It's wet. Want your shirt?

385
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,600
There...

386
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,700
Leave the bottle

387
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,950
It's Tockay

388
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:23,099
But warm

389
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,900
I put it in the spring
but the heat...

390
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,700
Here

391
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,099
What've you been up to?

392
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,600
A 5-year Legion hitch
4 really

393
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,800
I was discharged

394
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
I tried to enlist
in the Legion

395
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,800
You wouldn't have lasted
a week

396
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,200
- You like bang-bangs
- I like weapons. You scared?

397
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:20,400
Gives me a laugh

398
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,100
Best thing for blowing
your brains out

399
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,600
For cowards

400
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
It depends...

401
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,500
My captain...

402
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,100
...Captain Longot...

403
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,200
...surrounded by Germans,
with the dead around him...

404
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:49,000
...knowing what they'd do to
him, he didn't hesitate!

405
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
What's going on?

406
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
You scared me.

407
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,700
Takes guts!

408
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,500
Coming?

409
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,100
Big-hearted

410
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,500
Most whores rush the client

411
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm no whore

412
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Three lays at my age,
the monster's tired

413
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,950
How old are you?

414
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:33,100
- Guess
- 40-45

415
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,600
You burned yourself out

416
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,099
And how!

417
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,900
You put it all into your work
left nothing for the rest

418
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:42,600
The rest counts most!

419
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,500
You a philosopher, too?

420
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:47,700
Not at all, but...

421
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,899
I've my way of talking

422
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
- And Sonia, in Arles?
- You liked Sonia, eh?

423
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,400
- Well?
- She went like that, phtt!

424
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:58,199
- You mean..?
- She's dead

425
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,399
I love being naked
in the country

426
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,800
Especially in summer, the rain's
warm, I roll in the grass

427
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,400
It's terrific!

428
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,700
The leaves stick to the skin

429
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,100
I didn't want to tell you
in Arles...

430
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,400
What?

431
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,299
Spit it out!

432
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,100
But that night when you...

433
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,999
I god a bad name!

434
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,600
But I know how you really are

435
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,999
And last year, remember?
When you scared me so?

436
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I should't have let you go like
that. I wonder how you got home.

437
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,350
I do, too.

438
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,425
You were alone

439
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:44,299
I remember nothing

440
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,300
You could've let me know.
I thought you'd died

441
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:51,250
We do nothing
for fear of scandal

442
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,999
We're cowards,
it makes me sore!

443
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,900
That's how the worst things
happen, which you regret forever

444
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:01,499
But you can't always face up
to trouble

445
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,700
I'm not the remorseful type, but
when I think of it...I'm ashamed

446
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:08,650
Never mind, it's over now

447
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:10,600
Were you on something?

448
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,599
I said it's over

449
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Hey, I can't see a thing!

450
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,199
I just went...

451
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Aren't you ever happy
with a man?

452
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,899
Why not?

453
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,899
My husband...

454
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,700
- Your husband?
- Yeah, I was married

455
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:31,200
It was fine, now it's over

456
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,000
I can't do it with the guy
I live with

457
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,300
You're the only one

458
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:40,199
I'd like to

459
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,100
All men want that. They all
want that with whores

460
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:47,600
But women hate that,
they hate men

461
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,150
You never liked men?

462
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:50,925
I don't give a shit

463
00:37:50,926 --> 00:37:52,599
That's the way I live

464
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,800
You can't always live
that way

465
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,199
I can

466
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,250
Well, what's it to me?

467
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:00,300
At least you're genuine

468
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Looking for someone?

469
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,800
No, thanks

470
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
How did you find this place?

471
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,750
Everyone knows it

472
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:24,625
Men do. But women?

473
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:26,500
Depends which ones

474
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,300
How can they manage?
All those costumes!

475
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,700
And they take them off
with such ease..

476
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,500
You think I'm silly,
like all women

477
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,599
I don't know you

478
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,299
You probably don't
get to talk much

479
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,400
True. Dad says I'm introverted.
I don't speak for hours

480
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,050
There are no trains at night
It's a local line

481
00:38:57,051 --> 00:39:00,400
I often hear the last train,
but not the first

482
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,400
When I sleep poorly,
I rise late

483
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,800
In Arles
I lived by the station

484
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,899
I love trains, like a kid

485
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,600
You're still a kid
in many ways

486
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:13,300
Lots of trains went through
Arles

487
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Shall we sit or stand?

488
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:27,599
You'd rather lie down!

489
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,500
It's not that time
I have to get my gear

490
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,200
I have to go too

491
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,300
Won't you join us for lunch?

492
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,200
Friends are coming..

493
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:52,599
Sorry, I can't

494
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,700
I have a family lunch

495
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,800
It was a last minute idea

496
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,200
A pity, I would have loved to

497
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,500
I'll play you something
You have a lovely voice

498
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,300
That's going too far

499
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,400
You should visit me more
often. We could sing that

500
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:14,999
I can't read music

501
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,500
- I never studied it
- You sing wonderfully

502
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,300
My dad wouldn't let me.
And I work in the bar

503
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:26,100
- You have some free time
- See, they want me!

504
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,000
I've made a spot

505
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:29,900
'Bye!

506
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,500
Hurry! What are you doing?

507
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
You've got work to do!

508
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,600
I know

509
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Chaponval!

510
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Next stop, Auvers!

511
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
All aboard!

512
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,700
Here he is

513
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,450
- How are you?
- I wanted to rent a carriage

514
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:18,200
- You've got no money...
- It's not far..

515
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,600
Give him to me

516
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,400
I'll carry him

517
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,100
Chocolate!

518
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,600
Here they come!

519
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,700
My daughter, Marguerite

520
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
My son, Paul

521
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,499
He got little
or no care there.

522
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,600
The doctor at St. Remy
worte me that he got..

523
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:33,700
...no specific therapy,
nor regular supervision

524
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,599
I can't believe...

525
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,899
...he had epileptic fits

526
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,200
That word is used
to cover up ignorance

527
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,599
Your brother was...

528
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,000
...exhausted, overworked.
He works too much

529
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,000
Still now. It was drink, too.
Absinthe

530
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,800
And bad food

531
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,600
That's all it takes with
over-sensitive people like him

532
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,400
His pulse is good,
as are his circulation...

533
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:08,000
...blood pressure, and arteries

534
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,800
He's tough and in good shape

535
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,000
But any over-excitement
becomes an attack...

536
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,099
I'd say of hysteria

537
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,999
It's not confined to women

538
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,100
He is too concentrated,
monomaniacal...

539
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,450
The seating layout!

540
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,800
It's on the sideboard

541
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:30,599
You crazy?

542
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
It was harmless...

543
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,200
Well, lovebirds?

544
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,100
She connived to serve here today

545
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:49,600
Keeps tabs on you

546
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:52,100
You painted the pest?

547
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:52,999
Yes, why?

548
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,799
She's cute, but a bit vulgar

549
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,100
She's an innkeeper's daughter
Not your class

550
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,700
You're mean!

551
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,500
It's the champagne

552
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,000
To little Vincent!

553
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,599
I like him very much

554
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,900
And to the complete
recovery of big Vincent

555
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,400
Vincent the great

556
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,400
- Let's be serious...
- Homeopathy's not a serious topic

557
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,500
Homeopathy has one great virtue

558
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:46,999
It put an end to...

559
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,399
...the barbaric practice
of draining

560
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,300
That sounds good. But I read and
unconvincing homeopathic treatise

561
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:56,500
It listed 350 types
of headaches

562
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:58,099
I only know of one

563
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,700
There's a remedy for the fear
of being cuckolded!

564
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:05,100
- Charlatanism!
- A very widespread fear!

565
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:08,900
Come on, that doesn't exist

566
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,800
In allopathy, we did little
to cure patients

567
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,599
I soon realized...

568
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,299
...and I wasn't alone...

569
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,500
...that we hadn't learned
enough to heal...

570
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,700
- ...the sick
- Has that changed?

571
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:22,899
I've changed

572
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,500
The are of 1870 did it

573
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:27,999
I saw real suffering

574
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,900
Not just the usual
hypochondriacs

575
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:34,400
Men who'd been butchered

576
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,699
We had to do something

577
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,700
We couldn't handle
these men in real pain..

578
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:48,100
...with the usual phony
palliatives

579
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:50,600
Someone in pain is alone

580
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:53,100
Good intentions won't help

581
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,099
Sorry, madame,
we're boring you...

582
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,600
Not at all.
I'm never bored with painters

583
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:02,099
Painters?
I'm not much of one...

584
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,700
Theo must become a painter.
I insist. We're all talented...

585
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:08,899
Why else did I marry him?

586
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,600
He'll paint.
We got our talent from Mother

587
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,800
We shouldn't have
become art dearlers

588
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,300
You're right, but for yourself
For a somple man like me...

589
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,299
Not so simple, Mr. Van Gogh

590
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,100
You've carved a name in the art
market, almost cornered it

591
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,599
There's Durand-Ruel

592
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,300
- You have more taste and courage
- But less money

593
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:37,000
- You sponsor Impressionists..
- Except his brother

594
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,899
You've championed
Monet and Renoir

595
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,200
- Others will follow
- I can't wait! Right, Theo?

596
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,400
Enough laces. OK?
Not too tight?

597
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:56,300
Not too tight...Wait..
Don't move

598
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,400
One, two..

599
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,900
"My name's Toulouse-Lautrec,
I'm a handsome wreck,

600
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:13,200
"I get my inspiration,
In places of damnation

601
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:16,500
"Although I'm short of leg,
all the ladies beg

602
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,300
"So hide your wives from
the meanie

603
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:22,100
"They all want to taste my
wienie!"

604
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:23,700
In front of my kids!

605
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,200
I'm choking!

606
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,299
Once more?

607
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
Shall I do a number?

608
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,400
"After he entered a
monastery...

609
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,599
"...the King of Beggars..

610
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,700
"It's not really Quasimodo,
but it's quasi him!"

611
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,400
Dad, do the camel!

612
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,799
"The little mountain dwarfs...

613
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,900
"Do all the dirty work,
while the shepherds sleep...

614
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:17,100
"from the witch
they save the sheep..."

615
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
The Auvers ballet

616
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,100
I'd have liked a poem

617
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,900
There are lovely ones

618
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:41,699
I don't know any

619
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,600
Then a song. Jo, sing us
"Cherryblossom Time"

620
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,000
Everyone knows that song!

621
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,800
Don't insist, Theo

622
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,200
- You, Madame
- I don't dare

623
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:55,200
Please do

624
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,000
You can't turn us down..
A little song

625
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,100
I'll need the first note

626
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,400
We'll accompany you

627
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,600
"When we'll sing
of cherryblossom time...

628
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:15,600
"all the nightingales
and blackbirds

629
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:20,899
"will come out to rejoice...

630
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:28,000
"Lasses will have
ribbons in their hair..

631
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:35,399
"and lovers unshine
in their hearts

632
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,299
"When we'll sing
of cherryblossom time..

633
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:49,700
"But who of us can match
the blackbird's song?"

634
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,650
What about my poem?

635
00:49:57,651 --> 00:49:59,500
I don't know any

636
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:00,399
It can't be

637
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,199
Is that true, doctor?

638
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,700
No, she just won't recite
one...Search your memory

639
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:09,800
I can't remember any

640
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,099
Let's go for...

641
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,200
...a walk by the river

642
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Why not..

643
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,500
But the train's at 5:50

644
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:19,499
You've time

645
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,900
It'll do us good

646
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,100
You'll see, it's a
lovely spot

647
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,800
That's why
so many painters come

648
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,100
Jo has a fine face
My brother's lucky

649
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:36,100
So paint her

650
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:39,100
She scares me

651
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,800
Meet my fiancee.

652
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,350
She's fallen for him

653
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,499
Idle girls fall easily

654
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,400
If Vincent was a chic painter
Gachet would...

655
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,200
Let's get back to homeopathy

656
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,399
It's all contradictions

657
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,400
You can interpret it
any way you want

658
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:23,300
Like your brother's fine
works

659
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,799
People reject them today..

660
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,100
..as an outrageous,
clumsy mess

661
00:51:29,101 --> 00:51:33,199
Soon those same
"learned" people..

662
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,200
..will claim they're sublime
But they are now!

663
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:38,500
I hope you're right

664
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,099
Sorry...

665
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,600
Shall we dance?

666
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,099
He's so clumsy

667
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,300
You wonder if he
really does those things

668
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:19,500
His many weaknesses
add up to strength

669
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:22,800
So do ours
How can you stand him?

670
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
You don't dance?

671
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,800
My father disapproves.
I practice secretly

672
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,400
Don't kiss a girl's hand!

673
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:46,100
He's a bumpkin

674
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,099
We sorely missed you
for lunch

675
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,000
Still want me to sing?
A friend, Mrs. de Marigny

676
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,550
You've been hiding her?

677
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:05,100
I don't recruit for anyone!

678
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,599
I didn't mean that...

679
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,800
Are you a lady killeR?
As with Lakme?

680
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,700
Good idea

681
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,700
Sing Lakme.
The pianist will accompany you

682
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,000
Our friend has a lovely voice

683
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,500
Accompany her?

684
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,000
Absolutely

685
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
That was wonderful

686
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,200
Remarkable voice

687
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,100
It's hard to find a woman
at least for me

688
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,350
For everyone
You're a wild man

689
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:36,600
I'm shy
especially with women

690
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,300
Meaning?

691
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,700
I don't dare
But I can also be bold

692
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:44,100
Really?

693
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,200
You never paint water?

694
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,699
No, I don't like to

695
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,400
It's too fluid
the reflections are tricky

696
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's one thing,
then another...

697
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,599
Cezanne can't paint the sea

698
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,500
It looks like cardboard,
but people dote on it

699
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,400
In a short time, the gentlest
of men has become..

700
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:16,199
..irritable and bitter

701
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,500
There are constant fights
Within a year...

702
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,100
Sorry to tell you...

703
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,699
My husband isn't
the Theo I once knew

704
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,500
He's more like you
They way he says you are

705
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:33,500
You don't love him?

706
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:35,299
Are you mad?

707
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,950
I love him more than ever

708
00:56:37,951 --> 00:56:40,499
To see him like this...

709
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,300
He tries to be cynical..
He forces himself..

710
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,000
He's sick, that must be it

711
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,299
Something's going on.
But he won't tell me

712
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,400
He always was fragile. But,
unlike me, never complains

713
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,099
I can feel it...

714
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,100
He's still considerate, but...

715
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,000
You'd better..

716
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,000
I feel like a stranger

717
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,999
He rejects me

718
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,400
As for our child..He's
worried...

719
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:26,800
...by the tiniest bruise...

720
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:30,100
But he's also distant

721
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,599
At times wholly absent

722
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,900
What's wrong?
Is it another woman?

723
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,900
Not his style

724
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,099
Don't say that

725
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,300
He told me of your sprees,
the three of you

726
00:57:45,301 --> 00:57:46,099
Ages ago!

727
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,699
I was forewarned

728
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,100
All that's past
Theo's faithful as can be

729
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,399
I'm sure of it

730
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,200
You don't see him that much

731
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,200
One's faithful or not

732
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:02,600
I don't agree

733
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,900
But he feeds the whole family!
You, the baby, our mother...

734
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:12,600
...one sister, and me.
That's a lot of worries

735
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:15,600
Not you, Vincent. You work

736
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,600
If you say so..

737
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:18,799
I do

738
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:25,000
But he's wearing himself out.
I tell you, it can't go on

739
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,399
Things must change
Listen to me

740
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,499
I don't want my brother's
death on my conscience

741
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,200
He can't die for my smudges
that'll never be worth a cent

742
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:41,499
No, I say that things
will change

743
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:47,100
I must do something. Theo, you and
the baby can't go on this way

744
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:50,300
What can you do?

745
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,100
What's he doing?

746
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,700
Don't worry

747
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,500
He did it on the ferry
with Mom

748
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,500
- Can he swim?
- He did it through our youth

749
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,200
There..

750
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,500
Pretty good

751
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,999
He'd really upset Mom

752
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,900
Come along...You'll catch
cold..How smart of you!

753
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,700
Very clever!

754
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,800
I'll get in first

755
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:48,000
My hat

756
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,200
We spent a nice day, right
kids?

757
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,700
Come back,
I'll paint the baby

758
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,300
You'll be a monster

759
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:58,499
Come visit

760
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,800
- Come to Paris soon
- On a Sunday

761
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
- Where is he?
- Gone. He always does that

762
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,900
We can't abandon him

763
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,300
Who said we will?

764
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,800
We never discuss things

765
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,500
Don't bother to ask!

766
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,600
Now I've got to go refill it!

767
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,100
You could say thanks

768
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,700
He gets on my nerves!

769
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,100
Now you water the wine!

770
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,700
- So, who taught me?
- Shut up!

771
01:01:58,701 --> 01:01:59,899
You did!

772
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,150
Hear how she talks to me?
So much laundry!

773
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:08,400
I told my hudband
we need bigger vats!

774
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:10,450
He never listens!

775
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:12,500
I'm sick of it!

776
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,400
That's too much..Shit!

777
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,599
It's musty in here

778
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,900
I thought it might storm

779
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,000
Not a breath of air

780
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,099
Is the baby restless?

781
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,599
No, he didn't get much
champagne

782
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,000
You're being so nice.
Can't you always be this way?

783
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:33,800
It won't last

784
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,800
You haven't had a real talk
with your brother for a year

785
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,400
All last year..

786
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,800
Never

787
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,700
You were around

788
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yes, I was

789
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,600
But I was selfish

790
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,000
I thought only of us

791
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,300
That's all I ever do

792
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,800
When Vincent starts to paint,
I sell other painters.

793
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,600
That's what destroys him

794
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,399
You can't deny it

795
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,400
...his life's a disater

796
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,000
You're part of it

797
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,100
Your life's a disaster, too

798
01:05:00,101 --> 01:05:02,500
You don't love me?

799
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,200
Of course I do

800
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,000
If you don't udnerstand
that...

801
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:13,699
I can't explain

802
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,000
You sling a lot of mud at me
Why?

803
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,400
I don't know

804
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,100
Let go of me

805
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,800
Some water? It's cool

806
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,400
Can I take it?

807
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,500
How will you paint?

808
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,000
Wait!

809
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,200
The milk's boiling...
You leaving?

810
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:02,700
I've got things to do. Be
back later

811
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,100
You won't eat with us?

812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,699
I lost

813
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,500
Six and one, seven
Almost eight

814
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,999
There..No, a nine

815
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,900
A nine would be nice
Fice and four is nine!

816
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,200
Your turn

817
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,199
Call it

818
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,900
- What number?
- One!

819
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,000
Will you draw
the sand-merchant for him?

820
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,200
Mr. Van Gogh will draw you
the sand- merchant

821
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:12,000
Come beside me

822
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,500
Go on

823
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,800
Well?

824
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,400
It's nice

825
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Thanks, Mr. Van Gogh

826
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,500
Look!

827
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,000
See the nice sand-merchant?

828
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,599
You're not kind

829
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,500
- What's it for?
- What?

830
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,699
Kiindness

831
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,150
To get on witih people...

832
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:01,600
To live happily, have friends

833
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,600
Some more?

834
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,799
Bread and butter?

835
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,000
I never eat in the morning

836
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,300
I was looking at this...

837
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,900
She's like my mom in her
youth, You did it?

838
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,100
No, Gilbert did

839
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:19,000
That's not like your other work
More like paper for books

840
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,300
Mom used to say one loves
only one person in life

841
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,100
It's true. Mom loved Dad, Dad
only loved her, Coco loves Dad.

842
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:36,600
- And you?
- I don't know yet

843
01:10:36,601 --> 01:10:38,100
And you?

844
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,000
You love no one

845
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Strange, my fire's lit

846
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,000
Who lit it?

847
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,499
Did you?

848
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,400
So do it everyday,
and bring me breakfast

849
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:18,600
I'm not Gilbert!

850
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,600
Don't joke. He had a fever
last night

851
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:24,000
How do you know?

852
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,299
Snopping again?

853
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,200
I never get to see you

854
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,600
I should've brought my
embroidery

855
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Garlic sausage. What a treat!

856
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,500
Want some?

857
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,500
I needed a pick-me-up

858
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,100
I enjoy a rest. Mountain
guides eat slowly, in silence

859
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,700
You don't need a rest
You haven't started work

860
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,700
I'm all done

861
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,600
So paint me...

862
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,400
I Dad knew, he'd kill me

863
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,800
Him? No chance

864
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,100
You think everything's funny

865
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,500
No, I don't

866
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,899
You've got strength

867
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:19,600
Who, me? A real strongman

868
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,200
Your arms aren't very
muscular

869
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:29,000
A woman's shouldn't be

870
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:31,800
Well, a little shape...

871
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,600
Only Dad exercises in
our family

872
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,400
Glass of wine? C'mon

873
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,699
Coming?

874
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,800
Good wine from
my brother's vineyard

875
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,200
We'll soon see

876
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,900
If we don't drink too much!

877
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,200
It's nice here

878
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,200
You want another?

879
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,800
Seen my daugher?

880
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:09,200
Ah, doctor..

881
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,700
I see it's real party...

882
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:15,599
Sort of..

883
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,000
Can I have a shot?

884
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,900
Well, 'bye
