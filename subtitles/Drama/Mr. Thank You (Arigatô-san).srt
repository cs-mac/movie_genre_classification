00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,500
What's going on?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,660
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,090
Hello?

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,170
Hello? Choi Shin Hyung?

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,320
Choi Shin Hyung. Choi Shin Hyung.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,230
Choi Shin Hyung.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,770
Choi Shin Hyung, what's wrong?

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,030
Hello?

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,220
Hello?

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,810
Father.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,030
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,590
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm sorry, my son.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,410
Father...

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,800
Father.

17
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,420
Father!

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,420
Father!

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,170
<i>[Episode 14]</i>

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,190
You're here.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,670
What happened?

22
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,030
Luckily, he's breathing normally.

23
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,790
We don't know when
the symptoms may return.

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,880
He needs complete rest for now.

25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,160
Well...

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,170
how sick is he?

27
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,700
You once asked me if
Choi Shin Hyung was leaving.

28
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,370
- You asked if he was sick.
- I did.

29
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,800
His condition... seems serious.

30
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,200
How serious?

31
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,300
He's not suffering from
a terminal illness, is he?

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,830
I'm not sure.

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,300
I'm so confused.

34
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,800
According to the doctor...

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,730
he'll live if we remove
the meteor from his heart.

36
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,820
How did the meteor get
in there in the first place?

37
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,830
There might have been an accident.

38
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,700
Then he should have surgery first.

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,760
But he keeps refusing to do it.

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,430
- Why?
- I don't know why.

41
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,790
Then... what should we do?

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,050
Go home for now.

43
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,840
No, I will stay with him.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,840
He's asleep, so I'll call you
when he wakes up.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,530
Don't worry and go home.

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:11,190
<i>I wish I could leave
without hurting anyone.</i>

47
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,800
Father.

48
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,180
Father.

49
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,140
Father, are you up?

50
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,980
Yes.

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,840
How did this happen?

52
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,130
What happened?

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,680
There was an accident.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,040
A-an accident?

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,200
What accident?

56
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,110
The accident involving the sinkhole.

57
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,940
This happened after that accident?

58
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Yes.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,930
How could this possibly happen?

60
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,660
Why didn't you tell me?

61
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,350
I wanted to tell you...

62
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,580
But...

63
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,350
so many things happened.

64
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,370
Father, if you have surgery,
they said you could get better.

65
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,860
Why wouldn't you want
to have the surgery done?

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,490
It's no use.

67
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,020
Father.

68
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,070
Choi Go Bong... is already dead.

69
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,730
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,730
You're still alive like this.

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,030
Are you doing this because of the texts?

72
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,690
Are you giving up without even trying?

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,710
To go back to the way it was before...

74
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,090
I may have come too far.

75
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,140
Father.

76
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,180
How are things going
with the investors?

77
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,780
I got the Cruise Hotel business plan
from Choi Shin Hyung.

78
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,370
Everything is coming along
just fine now.

79
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,600
Did he really hand it over?

80
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,410
I'm not sure what he was afraid of...

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,520
He delivered it to me himself.

82
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,070
Soon Daehan Resort will change owners.

83
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,440
Things are really going
to get busy from now on.

84
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,630
People might start rumors about you two.

85
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,570
What are you doing?

86
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,110
Why address me so formally?

87
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,630
Manager Hong.

88
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,340
Go ahead.

89
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,500
I have something to discuss
with Director Jung.

90
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,230
Yes, I understand.

91
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,290
What do you think you're doing?

92
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,470
What did you think you were doing?

93
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,660
Why are you suddenly
keeping her around?

94
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,320
- I need her for work.
- Work?

95
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,030
Not because you love her?

96
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,640
I told you, didn't I?

97
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,170
Not to expect anything else from me
until everything is finalized.

98
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,480
It's up to me whether
I expect something or not.

99
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,460
I got a hold of another seven percent
of the company's stocks.

100
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,680
Now do you understand?

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,390
Who it is that you need?

102
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,600
Soon we'll dream about the same thing.

103
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,410
- You're up?
- Yes.

104
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,080
You must be hungry.

105
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,990
No, I don't have much of an appetite.

106
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,060
Here we go.

107
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,390
- I'm okay.
- Hold on.

108
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,250
Here you go...

109
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,840
All done.

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,490
- Here you go.
- I said it's all right.

111
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,230
- Try.
- Give it.

112
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,390
- I'll eat it myself.
- Try.

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,960
Oh my...

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,390
I could have never imagined
something like this...

115
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,120
My son is feeding me porridge.

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,500
I did a lot of thinking last night.

117
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,110
I can't call you 'older brother.'

118
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,190
I can't call you 'Father,' either.

119
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,070
You look like you'd be my brother,
but still, you're my father.

120
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,450
I will just call you brother.

121
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,480
- What?
- Please let me.

122
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,730
Father.

123
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,570
You spent your entire life
working for money.

124
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,100
You didn't get to enjoy yourself much.

125
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,360
What do you know?

126
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,890
That's true. I was trying to
earn money all my life.

127
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,660
I only focused on work.

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,770
But while I was working

129
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,540
it was rewarding.

130
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,420
- I felt accomplished too.
- So now...

131
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,000
you can finally do everything
you didn't get to do.

132
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,920
Don't worry about work,
and leave that to me.

133
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,300
Be in love as much as
you want with Eun Ha Soo.

134
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,250
From now on,
I'll call you older brother.

135
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,060
That's okay, right?

136
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,560
You're all grown up now,
you little punk.

137
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,890
Why would you want to
go to work in this state?

138
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,650
I said I'm fine.

139
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,380
But the doctor said
you had to take it easy.

140
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,220
I don't have the time
to take it easy right now.

141
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,230
I don't know how much time I have left.

142
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,520
Anyhow, you made the right
decision about your son.

143
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,660
How long could you have
possibly kept it from him?

144
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,300
Do you know how nervous
I've been all this time?

145
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,980
I really thought we got caught last time,
so I was so nervous...

146
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,980
It's not like a fable where
the king has donkey ears.

147
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,790
By the way...

148
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,670
Now that he tries to understand
why I did what I did.

149
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,970
I feel even more sorry towards him.

150
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,030
There's nothing you can do about that.

151
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,200
That's Chairman Choi Go Bong's suit.

152
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,290
Why are you wearing it?

153
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,150
There's someplace I need you
to come with me.

154
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,840
Good.

155
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,850
Look over here, please.

156
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,810
Please lift your chin.
There you go.

157
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,120
Please smile a bit more.

158
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,810
Perfect.

159
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,860
Here we go. One, two.

160
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,750
- Is it okay for you to come to work already?
- Yes.

161
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,910
I'm fine.

162
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,550
You were really worried, weren't you?

163
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,830
Yes.

164
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,480
Now I'm okay, so don't worry.

165
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,660
Are you sure you're really okay?

166
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,330
See? I'm all better.

167
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,510
I'm glad.

168
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,090
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

169
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,110
Are you free tonight?

170
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,920
I have something to tell you.

171
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,490
Yes, I am.

172
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,050
How did it go?

173
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,440
The investment terms are a bit strict...

174
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,820
- but I think they're going to work out.
- Really?

175
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
What are the terms?

176
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,870
They want the wages
cut by 30 percent...

177
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,260
and 30 percent of the employees
to become temporary workers.

178
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,620
What? Seriously?

179
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,720
Then it means they won't accept
the terms Choi Shin Hyung asked for.

180
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,700
I expected this.

181
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,140
Then that's not what you promised.

182
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,710
What's going to happen
to the employees then?

183
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,520
You're being naive.

184
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,730
Business matters shouldn't
be handled with emotions.

185
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,520
We'll put an end
to the Choi family regime

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,700
and watch me rebuild this place.

187
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,670
Unbelievable.

188
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,560
You're a prosecutor?

189
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,950
The law is a joke to you, isn't it?

190
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,180
I guess you want to quit, huh?

191
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,650
You're saying we received funding
for Cruise Hotel in secret?

192
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,970
Great job accusing us of something
that never happened.

193
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,650
I'm sure that's just the beginning of
some other past illegal activities

194
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,560
that the Choi family was involved in.

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,000
What did you do with Cruise Hotel?

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,990
- I handed it over to Jung Yi Gun.
- Pardon?

197
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,290
Why in the world did you
hand it over to that jerk?

198
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,290
I had no choice.

199
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,060
Because you couldn't trust me?

200
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,930
It wasn't because I couldn't trust you.

201
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,550
It was a project that
you worked on for three years.

202
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,910
How could you let him just take it?

203
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,590
Including your uncle

204
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,190
it involved the rest of the family.

205
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,530
I had no choice but to
hand it over to him for now.

206
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,410
Do you have any idea
what he'll do with it?

207
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,450
Before he does anything...

208
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,450
we should take it back.

209
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,050
You should.

210
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,080
You must complete the plans
for Cruise Hotel.

211
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,360
Of course, he'll do a good job.

212
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,990
You can do it.

213
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,660
Thank you.

214
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,660
Hot.

215
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,030
Do you also like food like this?

216
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,570
Of course. It's so good.

217
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,750
I guess the late Chairman Choi
was a regular here too.

218
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,560
True.

219
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,740
Every time I think about him

220
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,750
oddly enough, I get sad.

221
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,750
I wanted to do more for him.

222
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,190
I'm sad that I didn't get to.

223
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,860
Eun Ha Soo.

224
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,360
Well...

225
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,870
There's something I need to tell you.

226
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,700
Gosh, this tastes so bland, doesn't it?

227
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,570
It tastes bland today.
I'll add more peppers.

228
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,030
Look...

229
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,510
- It's just that...
- Ah, it's so good.

230
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,890
Why don't you add some
for yourself too?

231
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,480
It's so good.

232
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,430
Will you let me talk?

233
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,850
What's wrong?

234
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,690
What is it?

235
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,620
It's just so spicy.

236
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,130
Gosh, it's spicy.

237
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,950
About what you're trying to tell me...

238
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,600
After you grant me my fifth wish

239
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,490
I'll hear it then.

240
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,170
Can we go ice skating today?

241
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,090
- Ice skating?
- Yes, ice skating.

242
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,440
I heard from Director Jung.

243
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,970
He got the Cruise Hotel business plan
from Choi Shin Hyung.

244
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,990
That's right.

245
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,890
Director Jung must be trying to
get as many shares as he can.

246
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,300
If he acquires more shares than you

247
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,480
he can sell the resort
to a foreign corporation.

248
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,100
Then...

249
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,430
It's urgent that we acquire more shares.

250
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,790
At present, in order to convince
the board of directors

251
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,900
we need to come up with
a different strategy.

252
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,280
By the way, why did you drink so much?

253
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,580
Is this because of Choi Shin Hyung?

254
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,460
Which way is truly for
Choi Shin Hyung's sake?

255
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,560
He really doesn't have much time left?

256
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,780
I don't know what's what...

257
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,340
I'm so confused that I might go crazy.

258
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,460
What happened?

259
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,370
How come nobody's here?

260
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,100
I sent everybody home.

261
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,340
So we can ice skate by ourselves.

262
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,580
Here we go.

263
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,290
Hold on. Wait.

264
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,620
Choi Shin Hyung! Hold on!

265
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,130
One, two, one, two.

266
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,270
- Ouch.
- Good for you.

267
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,890
- One, two, one, two.
- One, two, one, two.

268
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,630
Don't let me go!

269
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,160
- Stay right there. I'll come to you.
- Come to me.

270
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,090
Be careful. Be careful.

271
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,800
- Oh my.
- Are you okay?

272
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,070
- One, two.
- One, two.

273
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,830
When did you learn how to ice skate?

274
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,420
I learned about fifty years ago...

275
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,840
I've been skating for five years
like I've been skating for fifty.

276
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,630
- One, two.
- One, two.

277
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,130
Are you okay?

278
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,640
- Doesn't it hurt?
- It hurts.

279
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Where does it hurt, huh?

280
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,920
It's snowing.

281
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,530
<i>[Choi Go Bong]</i>

282
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,650
This suit belongs to the late
Chairman Choi, doesn't it?

283
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,320
Yes, it does.

284
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,830
How did you know it was my father's?

285
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,500
There's a name stitched
inside the jacket.

286
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,870
Oh, I see it.

287
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,080
We used to get our names stitched
in our tailored suits back in the day.

288
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,840
Man, the suit is about thirty years old.

289
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,660
It still looks good, right?

290
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,520
By the style of the name...

291
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,300
my father must have done it.

292
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,240
Did he?

293
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,720
Chairman Choi Go Bong...

294
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,580
I heard he'd come by our shop
to get his suits tailored sometimes.

295
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,980
- It must have been true.
- I see.

296
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,190
I heard from your mother.

297
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,300
Come to think of it...

298
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,770
we seem to go way back.

299
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,720
Should we call this destiny then?

300
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,190
By the way, why aren't you
telling me your final wish?

301
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,120
Ah, that one is for later.

302
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,430
Later when?

303
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,110
I'll go wash my hands.

304
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,630
<i>[Five things I'd like to do
with Shin Hyung.]</i>

305
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,140
Go see the cherry blossoms...

306
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,930
Why didn't you go home?

307
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,880
I just felt uneasy.

308
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,290
Actually, whenever I think about you

309
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,410
I can't sleep.

310
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm literally suffering from insomnia.

311
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,630
48 days mean...

312
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,380
if it really means four pains
and eight sufferings

313
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,140
Birth, aging, sickness, death.

314
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Choi Go Bong already went
through all of those four pains.

315
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,570
If I get over the other four sufferings

316
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,070
I could end up living forever, couldn't I?

317
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,140
Enjoy eternal life.

318
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,140
It would be great if that could happen.

319
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,830
If you could live forever
in your young body

320
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,330
It's every person's dream...

321
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,030
but does anything last forever
in this world?

322
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,040
True.

323
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,770
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

324
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,930
Stay positive.

325
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,750
Let's just wait.

326
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm okay with whatever happens.

327
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,620
I'm worried about the ones
I will leave behind.

328
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,900
Well, I don't know how
this might sound...

329
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,560
But you don't have much time left.

330
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,160
Until then, just focus on yourself.

331
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,330
If...

332
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,720
If my death is my destiny

333
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,480
I should tell her before it's too late.

334
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,930
Are you going to tell Eun Ha Soo?

335
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,930
Are you going to confess that
you're Chairman Choi Go Bong?

336
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,800
By the way...

337
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,400
I still have things that
I'd like to do for her.

338
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,880
After that...

339
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,190
How are you going to take care
of the aftereffects?

340
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,270
Because of me...

341
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,680
I hope she won't be too heartbroken.

342
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,880
I got a call from Dr. Kim.

343
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,510
- Where is he?
- He's returning today.

344
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,720
- Really?
- Yes.

345
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,740
- Did he say anything else?
- He said he'd tell you more in person.

346
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,130
- Dr. Kim!
- How have you been?

347
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,040
Do you know how much
I've wanted to see you?

348
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,980
Why didn't you contact me regularly?

349
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,520
How did it go?

350
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,630
I did some research while I was there.

351
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,200
- There isn't nothing much.
- What?

352
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,010
Emperor Qin Shi Huang tried
to live an eternal life.

353
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,010
So he tried restricting his diet
to solely mercury...

354
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,010
but he ended up dead.

355
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,640
Depending on how you look at it

356
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
everything can be either
medicine or poison.

357
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,710
Did I send you over there to hear
that obvious explanation?

358
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,930
Oh, hold on.

359
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,620
The village leader was the only one
who became young after eating a meteor.

360
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,630
- Why him?
- Why?

361
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,990
- The village leader...
- Okay.

362
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,140
And a chairman...
See? they sound very similar.

363
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,310
So?

364
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,820
The leaders whose personality
were very nasty...

365
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,350
- Those leaders ate the meteor.
- Okay.

366
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,250
- Me?
- Yes, it sounds like you.

367
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,710
When those two entities come
in contact with one another

368
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,210
and those two men must
possess powerful energy

369
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,570
and that's what makes
those men become young.

370
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,820
Then if someone like me
consumes a truckful of meteor

371
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,680
it means nothing will happen to me?

372
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,850
Then what will happen if I have
the meteor taken out of my heart?

373
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,580
You'll return to your original state.

374
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,090
I suppose you'll die like
the village leader did.

375
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,770
Is that right? What if I try to live?

376
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,530
What should I do to live?

377
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,870
Didn't you find that out?

378
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,160
On the day of the next
meteor shower

379
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,290
Take this at the scene of the accident.

380
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,960
What is this?

381
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,570
I acquired it in the Sahara Desert.

382
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,720
There are those who saw a benefit.

383
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,700
Then if I take this...

384
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,870
are you saying that I could live?

385
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,200
There are also people who
didn't see a benefit.

386
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,010
What do you want him to do?
You should have found out first.

387
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,360
I had to go through
a lot of trouble to acquire that.

388
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,080
<i>[Job Application]</i>

389
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,090
<i>A job where I can make people
smile and happy.</i>

390
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,550
<i>Well, what do you call it?</i>

391
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,060
<i>Someone who create memories for you?</i>

392
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,140
Someone who creates memories for you, huh?

393
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,390
Among the education team
at our resort...

394
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,030
what are the courses for the interns?

395
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:15,390
Well, I was hoping there were some
more detailed and specialized courses.

396
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,590
For our current interns

397
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,970
we've designed a specialized
four-week education course.

398
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,060
The title of the program is...

399
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,990
'People Who Create Memories.'

400
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,120
First, for this Christmas season

401
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,750
I want you to design
an event for the resort.

402
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,510
We will choose the ones
with the highest scores.

403
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,200
And those will go through professional
event or party planning programs.

404
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,890
Wow, if we do a good job this time...

405
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,700
it will open doors for us.

406
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,990
Jackpot, isn't it?

407
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,540
What are the events that will create
happy memories for our guests?

408
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,920
I want you to think about that.

409
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,430
We will officially start
when we meet next time.

410
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,340
<i>['People who create memories.']</i>

411
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,990
<i>Do you have someone you love?</i>

412
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,730
<i>What kind of memories are you
creating with the person?</i>

413
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,000
So will you really take that medicine
during the next meteor shower?

414
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,440
Not sure.

415
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,040
What if something goes wrong?

416
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,520
I can't trust him whether
he really did his research or not.

417
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,310
At least I have hope now.

418
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,180
What if you turn even younger
and you turn into a baby?

419
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,190
Or you could end up dying
right then and there, too.

420
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,570
How can you trust
that medicine and take it?

421
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,330
What are you doing?

422
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,110
- About Choi Shin Hyung...
- Choi Shin Hyung...

423
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,320
Go ahead.

424
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,420
He's so much like
the late Chairman Choi.

425
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,070
I know that it makes no sense...

426
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,660
but I don't know why
it keeps bothering me.

427
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,750
You're great, Manager Hong.

428
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,120
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that.

429
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,040
By the way...

430
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,890
What was it that you were going to say?

431
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,500
I want to see Choi Shin Hyung
stick around for a long time.

432
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,730
But I just don't know what to do.

433
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,590
You said if he has the rock removed
from his heart, he could get better.

434
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,670
It's just that...

435
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,480
It might be a meteor.

436
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,130
If he has it removed,
he could come back...

437
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,990
What do you mean?

438
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,810
No, nothing.

439
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,720
Yes?

440
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,110
About Choi Shin Hyung...

441
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay. I got it.

442
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,110
Prosecutor Yang, it's me.

443
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,540
Can you confirm whether
Choi Shin Hyung's fingerprints

444
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,590
match those of the late
Chairman Choi's or not?

445
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,350
All right then.

446
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,720
Are you trying to bargain off
the merchandise that didn't sell?

447
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

448
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,720
Bargain off?

449
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,560
Getting rid of people by your side
once you've gotten what you want.

450
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,990
If that's not it,
how could you do this to us?

451
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,320
You thought my husband was weak, huh?

452
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,800
But we have a problem
if you think I'm weak, too.

453
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,540
A problem?

454
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,570
The will of the late Chairman Choi...

455
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,550
No!

456
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,480
<i>Director Jung sneaked it out.</i>

457
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,600
<i>And I burned it.</i>

458
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,970
What do you think?

459
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,630
This information should make your
situation complicated, shouldn't it?

460
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,470
Do whatever you want.

461
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,210
What did you say?

462
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,210
I'm rather busy now, so...

463
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,530
So this is how you'd like
to handle it, huh?

464
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,720
Fine. Wait and see.

465
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,010
If I'm going down,
I won't go down alone.

466
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,240
Never!

467
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,110
There might be a way
we could both stay alive...

468
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,840
You know how things are
at the company, right?

469
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Hand your stocks over to me.

470
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,350
If you hold onto them,
you'll be the one to lose.

471
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,370
If I hand them over...

472
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,000
Starting next year, I'll double its value.

473
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,900
I'll give you the position you wanted.

474
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,500
Really?

475
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,620
Was it you who wanted to see me?

476
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,350
I wanted to talk to you about something.

477
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,200
You're suddenly unhappy with
the way Jung Yi Gun does things?

478
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,470
The terms for the buyout
you asked for won't take place.

479
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,520
I was wondering about that...

480
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,000
Why are you telling me this?

481
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,440
I thought he cared more about his employees
and the company than President Choi did.

482
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,730
That's why I was helping him.

483
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,830
- Thank you.
- Then...

484
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:03,570
Jung Yi Gun is going all the way, huh?

485
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,120
Is Choi Shin Hyung back yet?

486
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,730
He's on his way now.

487
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,220
Why does he ask me over
when I just got out of the hospital?

488
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
What uncouth comments will he make now?

489
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,870
- Call him.
- I will.

490
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,530
Why did you go see
Director Jung earlier today?

491
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,410
Aren't you going to tell me?

492
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,870
I'm running around to help you
get back on your feet.

493
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,630
Just sit back.

494
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,100
What if you get fooled again?

495
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,430
I won't this time.

496
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,780
He's now trying to get the shares
from the board of directors.

497
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,480
Shares?

498
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,810
You got all of yours taken away
by Choi Shin Hyung...

499
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,220
- but I still have some.
- So?

500
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,110
If I help him this time...

501
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,420
he said he'd give us our titles for sure.

502
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,860
Are you serious?

503
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,010
You're here already.

504
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,940
Can we have some drinks here?

505
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,250
- Would you like makgeolli?
- No.

506
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,890
I'd like half-dried herring and
some refined rice wine, please.

507
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,540
Half-dried herring?

508
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,870
That's what I'd have with my brother.

509
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,690
Even your taste is exactly
the same as my brother's.

510
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,990
I had this half-dried herring with
my brother until we got sick of it.

511
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,290
It was when you lived
in Po Hang, wasn't it?

512
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,700
That's right.

513
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,740
How did you know that?

514
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,710
My brother sold this half-dried herring
to support me and Yi Hye to school.

515
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,390
He'd pack the leftovers
for our lunches, too.

516
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,210
You. How can you say that after
what you heard at the hospital?

517
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,440
It's time for you
to change your mind, too.

518
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,330
What is he saying?

519
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:59,190
My father helped you start
your married life as newlyweds.

520
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,540
At a small motel that eventually
became our resort today...

521
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,870
he helped you two get jobs there.

522
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,680
You know so much.

523
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,040
Gosh, my brother...

524
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,780
He was so strict.

525
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,690
When it was a day to buy a bag of rice

526
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,050
he divided it among
thirty letter envelopes.

527
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:23,470
Yi Hye, my brother, and I would eat
the rice in one envelope at a time.

528
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,150
It lasted us three months.

529
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,140
Gosh, he lived his life like that...

530
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,200
and ended up dying in vain.

531
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,030
Gosh, my brother...

532
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,920
Why did you bring up how
we were when we were poor?

533
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,530
The motel was doing well.

534
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,230
My father wanted to expand the business.

535
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,110
He had a suit tailored at that time.

536
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,110
But then you wanted to move out...

537
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,220
and wanted to start
an import cosmetic business.

538
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,770
He gave you guys all the money he had.

539
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,080
He didn't even have enough money
to go pick up the suit.

540
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,380
Oh my, my brother!

541
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,760
It was because of that thief,
Charlie Park...

542
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,390
- We ended up losing everything again.
- That's right.

543
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,370
So at that time...

544
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,670
- Welcome.
- How do you like it?

545
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,280
- Do you like it?
- Actually...

546
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,800
I actually don't have the money now.

547
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,770
Here...

548
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,490
After I earn some money,
I will come pick it up.

549
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,890
You should take the suit.

550
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,340
After you succeed in your business,
you can pay us back then.

551
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,690
<i>Amazingly, ever since
he put on that suit...</i>

552
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,850
<i>my father's business took off.</i>

553
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,240
That suit was no ordinary suit.

554
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,690
Oh my, my brother...

555
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,770
I had no idea.

556
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,410
I always wanted to start a business
and lost everything.

557
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,090
I always asked for money from you.

558
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,730
Are you drunk, honey?

559
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,470
That's enough.

560
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,290
Don't say anything.

561
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,030
You half-dried herring of a woman!

562
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,680
- You look like small octopus.
- You half-dried herring...

563
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,300
Oh my, my brother!

564
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,240
<i>You're experiencing that
because it's almost time.</i>

565
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,310
Your body knows the time is coming,
so it's reacting to it.

566
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:58,130
Then are you saying that the body knows
when it returns to its original state?

567
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,590
There are only few days left now.

568
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,680
What are you going to do?

569
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,830
I'll do whatever I can.

570
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,920
Then shall I tell you another method?

571
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,200
Instead of taking some medicine...

572
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,440
is there another way?

573
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,380
Tell me if there's anything else.

574
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,020
Anything at all.

575
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,180
What are you doing?
Get over here now! Hurry!

576
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,560
Why couldn't you let him
just take the medicine?

577
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,270
Why torture us in this cold weather?

578
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,950
Are we doing this because we want to?

579
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,290
He was asking for a way to live.

580
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,720
If he drinks that mineral water

581
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,260
it will purify his heart
and let him live.

582
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,990
If drinking that water
could fix everything

583
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,770
then who wouldn't
be able to live forever?

584
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,660
Then what else does he have to do?

585
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,100
Just trust me and follow me.
Follow me.

586
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,700
Follow you?
I'll get there faster than you.

587
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,910
Okay, okay! Lower!

588
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,210
After you make your body feel lighter...

589
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,440
Okay, like that.

590
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,210
And then drink up!

591
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,320
Excellent!

592
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
What's next?
What should he do next?

593
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,590
In exactly three minutes,
you turn upside-down.

594
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,330
Oh my.

595
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,100
People might assume he's running
for a national championship.

596
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,170
This is more important than
running for a national championship.

597
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,940
- Will this really work?
- What did I say?

598
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,970
Depending on what you believe

599
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,740
anything can be considered
medicine or poison.

600
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,310
No matter how good the medicine is

601
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,480
you'll die if you think it's poison.

602
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,720
If it doesn't work, I'll see you later.

603
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,450
How much longer
do I have to do this for?

604
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,280
My head hurts so much that I might die.

605
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,620
Cut!

606
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,590
Are you okay, Chairman Choi?

607
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,430
Hold him.

608
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,360
Oh my gosh.

609
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,900
- Man.
- Are you okay?

610
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,800
Yes, I did it. I did it!

611
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,270
The more profits, the better
it is for us, isn't it?

612
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,510
That's true.
We're counting on you, Director Jung.

613
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,200
I agree.

614
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,270
This place was literally
built up by my father.

615
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,970
They're trying to sell it
to someone else.

616
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,270
We expected that.

617
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,470
We should start to fight back.

618
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,610
It won't be easy.

619
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,550
His shares already exceed
President Choi's shares.

620
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,320
When threads are all tangled

621
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,820
we should start untying them
from the first knot.

622
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,590
About the case involving
Choi Go Bong's five billion won.

623
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,360
If we find who was behind it...

624
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,200
we can turn things around.

625
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,940
What did you want to see me about?

626
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,180
Manager Hong.

627
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,910
Today, I'll talk to you
as one woman to another.

628
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,120
Whether it's Choi Dae Han
or Jung Yi Gun

629
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,220
you should draw clear boundaries.

630
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,050
Pardon?

631
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,960
Stop acting coy and
like you have no idea.

632
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,630
Can't we be honest
and talk about it?

633
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,630
- I think there's a misunderstanding...
- Misunderstanding?

634
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,540
Didn't Director Jung propose to you?

635
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,270
Let's talk about that first.

636
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,280
I want to get these as a couple.

637
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,820
You won't use them
even if you buy them.

638
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,450
Look at the color of these pans.
They're so cute.

639
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,820
If you're not going to buy them,
stop touching them.

640
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:23,760
Why does he want us to buy
colored papers, scissors, and glue?

641
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,800
Hello, Manager Sung.

642
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,000
<i>Why aren't back yet?
What are you doing?</i>

643
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,670
We'll be right there.

644
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,270
Let's go. He's going crazy.
Okay then.

645
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,470
You're not an elementary school kid.

646
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,840
What are you doing this for?

647
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,140
Stop talking and get to it.

648
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,450
Are you trying to make 1000 paper cranes,
and have your wish come true?

649
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,520
Seriously.

650
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,050
Give it back if you're not going to help.

651
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,220
- I'll do it myself.
- I'll do it.

652
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:54,960
I'll do it.

653
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,030
By the way, about what Dr. Kim said...

654
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,600
it turns out the next meteor shower
falls on Christmas Day.

655
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,930
Really?

656
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,970
Whether it's fortunate or unfortunate

657
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,140
it's the same day written on
the text messages as well.

658
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,410
It would have been better
if it were the day before.

659
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,350
I'm too nervous to know what to do.

660
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,050
Christmas Day?

661
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,220
Wait, what time is it now?

662
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,460
We don't have any time. Hurry!

663
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,820
I will.

664
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,240
Gosh, it's cold.

665
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,540
<i>She's here.</i>

666
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,650
<i>[She's here.]</i>

667
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,650
Hey, let's begin.

668
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,090
- Choi Shin Hyung?
- You're late.

669
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,660
Yes, I had a lot of work today.

670
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,000
How did you know that
I was on my way home?

671
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,570
No need to know that.

672
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,440
- Stop right there.
- What?

673
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,040
It's too cold to stop here.
I'm going to leave.

674
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,810
Gosh, can't a young person
wait for one minute?

675
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,880
Stop right there for a bit.

676
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,610
Gosh, why are you getting annoyed?

677
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,050
You're one interesting man.

678
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,450
Here I've stopped. What else?

679
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,300
Hello?

680
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,760
When did you prepare all this?

681
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,070
Once I decide to do something...

682
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,870
there's nothing I can't do
and nothing will go wrong.

683
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,140
<i>I wonder if you like it.</i>

684
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,210
It's so pretty.

685
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,120
I feel like I'm dreaming.

686
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,120
How did you come up with this idea?

687
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:23,500
Actually, my last wish was
to go see the cherry blossoms.

688
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,530
Was it?

689
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,310
Your wish is adorable, just like you.

690
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,910
Don't you have anything glamorous?

691
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,110
Tell me anything.
I'll grant all of your wishes.

692
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,220
What is it?

693
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,790
For Myung Soo and me

694
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,860
it was our dream to go to
an amusement park when we were little.

695
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,010
But things were financially
tight back then.

696
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,770
We couldn't ask our parents who
had to be at the shop to take us.

697
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,440
You guys matured too quickly.

698
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:09,110
But suddenly, our father took us
to an amusement park one day.

699
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,850
We had so much fun,
and ate lots of pizza.

700
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,080
We even bought some expensive toys, too.

701
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,220
It wasn't even our birthdays,
but we were so happy.

702
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,760
That was the last time.

703
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,830
What do you mean?

704
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,400
My father passed away that winter.

705
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,880
That one day was his last present
that he had given us.

706
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,580
Is it how you're going
to say goodbye, too?

707
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,520
Look, Eun Ha Soo.

708
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,190
I won't think of this
as my last wish.

709
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,960
Grant me another wish.

710
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,970
Let's go see the cherry blossoms
in the spring next year.

711
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,370
The real ones...

712
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,320
Choi Shin Hyung.

713
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,990
When two people meet...

714
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,900
they are bound to part ways one day.

715
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:45,840
Just like a flower in full bloom
eventually withers.

716
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,480
There's something I need to tell you.

717
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,290
No.

718
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,030
I'm sorry, anyway.

719
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:14,970
I can't promise you that
I can grant you your wish...

720
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,170
No.

721
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,180
No way.

722
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,540
I won't let you go.

723
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,920
I'll pray every day.

724
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,590
I'll wish for it.

725
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,890
No.

726
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,860
You can't leave me.

727
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:44,600
How can you be so stubborn like this?

728
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,980
You made an educational program
for me, didn't you?

729
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,380
So I can make my dream come true.

730
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,990
Learn as much as you can.

731
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:13,830
If you want to create
happy memories for many people...

732
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,260
No.

733
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,260
No.

734
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,370
I want to make you happy first.

735
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,640
So...

736
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,510
don't scare me by saying that
you're leaving or something.

737
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,910
Give me some time, will you?

738
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:38,190
I've been more than happy...

739
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,060
thanks to you.

740
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,590
Choi Shin Hyung.

741
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,960
Thank you.

742
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,770
I'm truly grateful.

743
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,080
<i>I'm doing all sorts of unusual things.</i>

744
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,410
<i>Something unusual, right.</i>

745
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,350
<i>It fell from the stars.</i>

746
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,050
On the day you were involved
in the sinkhole accident

747
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,690
Yes?

748
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,290
Did you eat one of these?

749
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,890
Me?

750
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,300
Why would I eat one of these?

751
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:02,140
That's right. I'm the only one
who ate one and turned out this way.

752
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,610
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

753
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,600
- Did you bring it?
- Here it is.

754
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,370
Why did you want to see
the black box this late?

755
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,130
Put it on.

756
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,470
You confirmed that
you ate a meteor last time.

757
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,080
It's here.

758
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,980
Rewind further.

759
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,110
Go back further.

760
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,250
There. Leave it there.

761
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,790
This is Eun Ha Soo...

762
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,390
What is it?

763
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,460
Eun Ha Soo grabbed your hand.

764
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,570
<i>Eun Ha Soo was the one who
held my hand at that time.</i>

765
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,240
<i>The one who kept me from dying</i>

766
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:22,550
<i>I can't keep this from her anymore.</i>

767
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,330
<i>Remember the day you were
involved in the sinkhole accident?</i>

768
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,940
<i>It might have something
to do with that accident.</i>

769
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:44,140
You two almost died together then.

770
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,580
That's why Choi Shin Hyung
gets better if you're around him.

771
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,660
Eun Ha Soo.

772
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,530
Choi Shin Hyung.

773
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,270
What brings you here?

774
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,070
I need to tell you something.

775
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,680
Actually I am...

776
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:40,130
