1
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,570
When you get home,
take a clock out for practice...

2
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,910
and have your mother help
teach you how time works.

3
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,950
It's really hard!

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,190
It's super easy!

5
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,860
Yeah... sure.

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,900
Is the answer 12 o'clock?

7
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,400
- Number one?
- 7 o'clock.

8
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,560
- Number two.
- Number two...

9
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,430
- School starts at what time?
- 8:30!

10
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,180
- She got all that?
- Yeah.

11
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,950
She's good.

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,130
Wow, it's a lot.
How do I take all this?

13
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,690
Watch it!

14
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,290
Why are you so late?

15
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,870
I had a hair appointment
at 3 o'clock!

16
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,030
Hurry up and take your sister home.

17
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,850
Sis!

18
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,440
All done.

19
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,640
No, don't touch!

20
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,410
Mom, I got 100% on my homework.

21
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,580
Nice.

22
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,280
Mom!

23
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,120
0h Bin, let me take my coat off.

24
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,620
Jin, take Bin over there.

25
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,130
Set the table.

26
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,830
Jin!

27
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,470
- Yes?
- Come and get this.

28
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,270
Were you late picking up Bin today?

29
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,310
Yes.

30
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,480
Do I always have to tell you?

31
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,860
- Don't be late again.
- Okay.

32
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,090
Here's a bean.

33
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,640
What are you doing?

34
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,870
Eat your dinner.

35
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,970
Here, drink some water.

36
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
Jin, get the door.

37
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,790
- Mrs. Lee, can we talk for a second?
- Yes.

38
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,820
Go back in.

39
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,970
Let's go outside and talk.

40
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,360
Mom, what'd you talk about?

41
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,930
Never mind. Finish your dinner.

42
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Did you finish your homework?

43
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,210
Not yet.

44
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,490
Mom...

45
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,540
I...

46
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,570
I... wet the bed.

47
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,050
It's okay.

48
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,660
Blow your nose.

49
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,330
We'll keep it between us. It's fine.

50
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,130
Go sleep on my side.

51
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,920
Let's try it. What's the first answer?

52
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,560
- Nine!
- Easy.

53
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,600
- Okay, what's next?
- One!

54
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,460
- Next?
- Seven!

55
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,160
- Now, add nine, one and seven.
- Seventeen!

56
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,830
Actually, we haven't learned how to
add up to the teens yet.

57
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,240
- We'll learn this soon. Know when?
- Nope!

58
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,980
Next lesson. We'll start on Monday.
It'll be super fun!

59
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,490
- I wish it was Monday now, Teacher!
- Yes, me too.

60
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,960
That's messed up!
Why do I always get stuck?

61
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,170
Be careful kid.

62
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,620
Mom, what's going on?

63
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,620
Come inside and help me clean up.

64
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,880
What about my school?

65
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,020
I told your teacher so it's all set.

66
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,540
Aren't you excited to visit your aunt?

67
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,110
It'll be fun.

68
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,250
Big Aunt

69
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,250
Jin...

70
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,720
Listen...

71
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,320
Stay here with Bin... for a second.

72
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,400
I... have to go find your aunt.
Okay?

73
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,000
Bin, stick to your sister.
Don't move.

74
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,540
Sis...

75
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,910
Come see our delicious fish for sale!
Best price in town. 5 dollars a box!

76
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,150
Bin!

77
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,820
I've been looking all
over for you!

78
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,410
Jin! I told you to watch your sister.

79
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,050
Stick to your sister, got it?

80
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,650
Keep an eye on her.

81
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,880
You're here!

82
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,890
Oh, how are you sister-in-law?
It's been a while.

83
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,930
Yeah... so what happened to your face?

84
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,460
You remember Jin?

85
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,430
- Jin, greet your Big Aunt.
- Oh! You've grown so much.

86
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,200
Do you remember me?

87
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,270
Girls, bow to your aunt.

88
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,110
We meet for the first time, right?

89
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,740
Here, you can hold her.

90
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,580
Let me see.

91
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,620
You're a little twig, huh?

92
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,160
Anyhow...

93
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,330
Have you heard from that bastard?

94
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,440
0kay, let's go.

95
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,110
Jin, hold your sister's hand.
Take this bag.

96
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Here you go. Eat up.

97
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,130
Eat.

98
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,880
Go ahead. What's wrong?

99
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,860
It's not as good as your city food.

100
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,360
No, it looks delicious.
They're good eaters.

101
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,300
But they ate some junk food
on the bus.

102
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,030
Hurry up and eat.

103
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,240
They'll eat anything...

104
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,750
so it won't be too hard for you.

105
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,910
It will be fine.

106
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,320
What choice is there?

107
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,200
Mom, what are you doing?

108
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,010
Jin...

109
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,950
I have to tell you something.

110
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,910
You two...

111
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,720
have to stay here with
Big Aunt for a little bit.

112
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm... going to go find your dad.

113
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,220
No way! I'm going with you.

114
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,230
This is for you and Bin.

115
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,940
Whenever you obey your aunt...

116
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,080
she'll give each of you a coin.

117
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,920
Put the coins in here,

118
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,490
and when it gets full, I'll be back.

119
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,460
0kay?

120
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,110
Take care of Bin for me.

121
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,850
I believe in you Jin.

122
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,300
Please take care of them.

123
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,140
Take care of yourself and
don't worry about them.

124
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,180
Thank you so much.

125
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,520
Let's go in.

126
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,390
Mom!

127
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,990
Where are you going?

128
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,790
Sis!

129
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,870
Oh, there she is!

130
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,570
Mom! Mom!

131
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,710
Mom!

132
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,880
Sis... let's go inside.

133
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,730
Here it is!
Get it! Get it!

134
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,880
Sis, let's play.

135
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,580
Go away.

136
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,150
Don't mess around.

137
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,300
Let's eat.

138
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,530
Give me your bowls.

139
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,400
Eat up.

140
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,400
You were hungry.

141
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,440
You know how to eat!

142
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,180
Why aren't you eating?

143
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,690
0kay, don't eat.
Bin, you eat.

144
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,760
Go ahead and starve yourself.

145
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,170
Go to your room.

146
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,080
Bin, wait outside.

147
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,790
Go outside!

148
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,940
- What? Peeing in bed at your age!
- Didn't do it.

149
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,340
Quiet! Your blanket is all wet.

150
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,140
You keep annoying me and I'll send
you to your grandparents' farm.

151
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,550
- Don't want to.
- Put your shoes on.

152
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,260
Auntie...

153
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,570
- I didn't pee in bed.
- Be quiet!

154
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,280
Here, go beg for salt
from the neighbors.

155
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,910
Big Aunt...

156
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,290
Get going!

157
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,720
Sis...

158
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,860
Hurry up and go get some salt.

159
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,460
Auntie!

160
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,060
I'll go instead.

161
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,130
Come with me.
You got work to do.

162
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,730
You two are a real pain.

163
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,340
Bin! Bin!

164
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,560
Bin!

165
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,230
Yeah!

166
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,240
Hey!

167
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,740
What are you doing here?

168
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,420
Let's go.

169
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,170
No way!

170
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,410
Oh, who are you? Her sister?

171
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,250
Yes.

172
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,450
- Let's go in and have some snacks.
- Go inside.

173
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,750
Kids, come here. Have some cookies.

174
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,960
You too, come here.

175
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,810
Come on, dig in.

176
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,410
Hyun, here.

177
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,180
Don't be shy. Eat.

178
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,790
- What's your name?
- Jin.

179
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,790
- And you?
- Bin.

180
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,670
This is the first time
I've seen you around.

181
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,930
- We came to visit our aunt.
- Oh, really?

182
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,940
- And where's your mom?
- She went to take care of business.

183
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,410
0h, really?

184
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,550
Hyun, share your stickers with friends.

185
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,120
- Like this?
- Right.

186
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,560
Want to give it to your friend?
Here you go, Bin.

187
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,430
Can you give one to Jin?

188
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,660
- We have to go now.
- Going already?

189
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,910
Bin!

190
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,060
Wait.

191
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,930
Don't forget to wear this.

192
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,600
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

193
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,700
Good-bye. Come over anytime.

194
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,840
- Okay!
- See you soon!

195
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,910
Let's go in.

196
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,280
Sis! I found a tree.

197
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,690
- But it's dead.
- No, it's not.

198
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,060
0h yeah? Let's try planting it.
Hold it up high.

199
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,860
Here?

200
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,170
- Now, get me some rocks.
- Rocks? Here is one.

201
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,910
Look around for more.

202
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,380
I found one.

203
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,250
Just this one.
0h! It's standing!

204
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,220
We did it. That was hard.

205
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,400
Sis...

206
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,240
Mom comes back when our
piggy is full, right?

207
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,690
Sure.

208
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,030
It was that tall boy in the alley?
He's right over there.

209
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,330
Stand here and be quiet.
Hello?

210
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,260
- Yes?
- Can you come out here?

211
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,700
What's the matter?

212
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,820
Your son threw a rock and
hit my kid on the face.

213
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,980
- My son? He'd never.
- He did! Her older sister saw it.

214
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,320
- He'd never do that.
- Ask him! Girls, he's the one right?

215
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,520
Wait one second.
Minoo!

216
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,070
- They were just playing, so what?
- Just playing?

217
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,640
He drew blood!
That's not just playing.

218
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,940
Give me money for her medicine.

219
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,850
- What medicine money?
- Here, look at her bloody face.

220
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,520
What's the fuss? It's just a scratch.

221
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,290
You want me to do that to your boy?

222
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,320
You should apologize.

223
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,630
Minoo!
Don't play with these kids!

224
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,340
- Is that enough? What a weirdo!
- Who are you calling weirdo?

225
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,410
Why don't you raise your son better?
You're the weird one!

226
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,320
Let's go.

227
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,900
Jin and Bin...

228
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,370
Stop and listen.

229
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,800
I have to go take care of something.

230
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,770
Jin, take Bin home first, okay?

231
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,110
What about Bin's medicine?

232
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,770
What? She's fine.
It's just a scratch.

233
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,950
Just clean her up.
Go on home.

234
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,460
You'll get your allowance
after you clean up.

235
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,960
- Deal?
- Deal.

236
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,340
Here Bin, wipe the floor with this.

237
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,450
Wait, let me see.
Who painted your nails?

238
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,090
- Mom.
- Your mom?

239
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,520
What a thing to do to a child.

240
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,820
Go clean that room.

241
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,290
Wipe it clean.

242
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,170
Big Aunt, have you heard from Mom?

243
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,200
Not yet.

244
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,250
Don't just eat the soup,
eat some fishcakes.

245
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,480
- I'm eating fishcakes!
- Okay.

246
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,190
You were hungry.

247
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,060
Not much...

248
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,710
0ne... Two... Three...

249
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,290
Auntie!

250
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,360
What?

251
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,900
She took my card!

252
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,630
What? She took your card?

253
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,270
Hand it over.

254
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,110
Why are you teasing your
sister with this?

255
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,710
Come with me.

256
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,450
Stand here and lift your arms up.

257
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,400
Didn't I tell you to play nice?
You little brat.

258
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,270
Are you trying to make your sister cry?

259
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,230
Put your hands down.
Go out and play.

260
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,570
I said go play. Stop crying.

261
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,270
What's there to cry about?

262
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,000
Sis.

263
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,240
It's all fine. Stop crying.
You can go.

264
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,270
Let's go.

265
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,780
You don't want to go either?
Fine, stay with your sister.

266
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,500
Sis!

267
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,410
Get lost!

268
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,520
Get lost!

269
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,760
Are they in pain?

270
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,870
Why would it hurt?
They are dead already.

271
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,120
Hey Sis!

272
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,290
That boy gave me this.

273
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,270
- What's this?
- Grasshoppers.

274
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,800
It's yummy!

275
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,430
That's gross.

276
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,400
Here!

277
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,840
Try it.

278
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,410
You eat!

279
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,720
- Give me one.
- Me too.

280
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,960
Get away, it's mine!

281
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,330
- Let's share it.
- Wait!

282
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,200
- How much?
- Six dollars.

283
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,480
Thanks.

284
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,610
Let's go.

285
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,790
Why aren't you asking?

286
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,100
You're supposed to do it first!

287
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,760
What's going on? What?

288
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,100
- We want... some cake.
- What? Cake?

289
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,070
Ask your mom later.
I'm not made of money. Let's go!

290
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,640
- Hello!
- Oh, hey.

291
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,810
You two sit down here.

292
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,520
- It's been a while.
- Yeah, I need a drink.

293
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,080
- How's your health?
- You kidding? I'm sick all over.

294
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,800
- How's your business?
- It's finished.

295
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,160
- What?
- I closed it.

296
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,150
Auntie, I'm hungry.

297
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,110
Wait until we get home.

298
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,080
- Are they your grandkids?
- No way! Do I look that old?

299
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,210
They're my nieces.
I'm taking care of them for a bit.

300
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,420
- Should I get them something?
- No way! Why waste my money?

301
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,090
They'll eat at home.

302
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,140
Auntie!

303
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,470
Auntie, I'm hungry.

304
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,670
- I'm hungry.
- Shut up.

305
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,950
Here's rice!

306
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,260
Let's go eat.

307
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,590
Grasshopper, grasshopper...
where are you?

308
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,200
Here! Here! I see one.

309
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,560
Look, hold it like this.

310
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,230
I'm making money.

311
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,100
- Did you do mine?
- No not yet. Be careful.

312
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,140
Ready.

313
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,900
- Ready to eat?
- Nope.

314
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,930
- Sis...
- Yuck.

315
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
- Can I eat one?
- No way.

316
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,690
- Hi, I'm selling grasshoppers.
- Yeah? How much?

317
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,920
- Ten cents.
- Give me one. Here.

318
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,520
- Give me two.
- I'm first.

319
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,260
Cool. Let's go.

320
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,730
Let's go.

321
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,000
No way! I'm putting them in.

322
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,210
Hey little piggy, stay still.

323
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,650
One, two, three!

324
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,520
Grasshopper, grasshopper,
gr-gr-gr-gr-grass-hopper!

325
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,320
It will pop out when we fill it up.
Told you to be careful with it.

326
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,710
Lady! Lady!

327
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,490
We'll be late.

328
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,890
Hi there!

329
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,800
- Hey, what's up?
- Can I play with Hyun?

330
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,960
Be quiet.

331
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,060
He's over there.
You want to ask him?

332
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,420
It's yours.

333
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,400
Got one? Put it in the jar.
Thanks.

334
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,610
They are having fun...
before they die.

335
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,320
Mom!

336
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,560
Grasshopper, grasshopper,
gr-gr-gr-gr-grass-hopper!

337
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,960
- Grasshopper....
- Hey kids, where did you go?

338
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:43,660
- We went to catch grasshoppers.
- Oh, I see. You caught a lot.

339
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,500
- Want to come in for some cookies?
- No thanks, we have to go.

340
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,870
- Then next time. See you.
- Good-bye.

341
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,440
Let's go play.

342
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,010
0h, darn.

343
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,780
- What?
- I killed it.

344
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,710
- Grasshopper killer.
- Bin, you flip it.

345
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:09,150
- Look, use this to poke them.
- Yeah! Very funny.

346
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,550
- Then kill 'em with this.
- No way.

347
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,530
- Try it.
- No way.

348
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,930
- It's almost done.
- Stop it!

349
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,900
- Hot, hot, hot.
- It's not hot.

350
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,170
Stop goofing around.

351
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,910
Almost but not yet.

352
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,350
Wow, it stinks!

353
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,410
It's burning...

354
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,020
But they are burnt.

355
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,730
It's fine. Hold this.

356
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,160
Hey! Hey! Hurry, hold this.

357
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,370
You want some grasshoppers?

358
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,840
- Okay, give me one.
- Me too.

359
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,040
Me too, here.

360
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,080
29... 30... 31...

361
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,220
You can see it using one eye.

362
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,530
But I have to hold it really high.

363
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,960
- Okay, here then.
- Oh, where is the hole?

364
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,600
It's right here. Look through it.

365
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,310
- Wow!
- It's exciting right?

366
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,750
How'd you mess up your dress like this?

367
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,680
Can't you play like a princess?

368
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,830
I have to wash my hands...
roll up my sleeves first.

369
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,810
Hello!

370
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,050
- Hello!
- Yeah, what?

371
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,130
Hi, is Minoo home?

372
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,990
Minoo's at school.

373
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,600
- What do you want?
- We were going to play...

374
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,400
Shouldn't you be in school, too?

375
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,610
Don't you go to school?

376
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,380
We're here visiting our aunt.

377
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,150
Well... Minoo has to study hard.
So don't bother him.

378
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,050
Go play on your own.

379
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,320
- You understand?
- Yes.

380
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,420
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

381
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,490
- We can cross.
- Not yet.

382
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,000
Come on!

383
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,130
Lady! Lady!

384
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,870
Hello there.

385
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,140
What's the matter?

386
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,280
- Our aunt's not home.
- Your aunt?

387
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,110
I'm hun... no, I want cookies!

388
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,750
0h sure, come on in.

389
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,760
Bin, drink some milk.
Hyun, you too.

390
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,500
- Who bought you that dress?
- My mom.

391
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,240
It's very pretty.

392
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,410
Mom's coming when our piggy is full.

393
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:27,980
Piggy?

394
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,180
Anyway, where is your aunt?

395
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,450
I don't know.

396
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:42,490
Should I call the police and check?

397
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,460
- No, thank you. It's fine.
- You're okay?

398
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,000
Thank you for the food.

399
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,270
- You're going home?
- Yes.

400
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,740
Bin, let's go.

401
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,800
Sis, let's go. All the grasshoppers
have gone home.

402
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,270
Hello, I got grasshoppers.

403
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,850
You sold us the burnt ones.
No way!

404
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,820
Wait! I'll give you a discount.

405
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,210
What do you think?

406
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,410
Get it cheap.

407
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,160
Okay, give me all
your stuff for 10 cents.

408
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,270
What's the matter, Sis?

409
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,240
I finished drawing.

410
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,300
Ask him.

411
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,870
Mister... can I make a call?

412
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,020
- What? Who do you want to call?
- Our mom...

413
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,290
- What's the number?
- 011-242-0945

414
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,430
That number is disconnected.

415
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,020
Here.

416
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,250
Come on, let's eat.

417
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,070
What's all this? Stop crying.

418
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,960
Bin, doesn't it look good?

419
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,480
Make your sister stop crying.
Why can't you two get along?

420
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,510
Make her feel better.

421
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,280
Let's just eat.
What a way to ruin the day.

422
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:42,200
Wipe your face.
Here. That's enough.

423
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,740
Piggy, I'll fix your eye.

424
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,960
Got it.

425
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,610
All better now.

426
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,730
Piggy, when is Mom coming?

427
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,510
- Lady! I want to buy a sweetbun.
- Oh, you came alone?

428
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:29,740
Yes.

429
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,970
Come here.

430
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,710
Here you go.

431
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,880
Wait for your change.

432
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,110
I only have one cent coins.

433
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,920
Here you go.

434
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,050
Give me your hand.

435
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,760
- Wow!
- Oh...

436
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,330
- Be careful.
- Yes.

437
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,670
Hey, Sis!

438
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,410
Where did you get that?

439
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,200
I bought it.

440
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,070
Where did you get the money?

441
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,250
From piggy... a coin... sweetbun...

442
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:15,590
I bought a bun with a big coin
and got many small ones.

443
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,090
- What?
- Look at this.

444
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,030
I got a lot of coins from one.

445
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,900
Let me!

446
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:35,910
Get all the big coins.

447
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,680
Mister!

448
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,170
Hello, kids.

449
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,980
Can I have small coins?

450
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,980
- Change to one cent coins please!
- Oh...

451
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,730
Hurray!

452
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,530
Hurry up and put them in!

453
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,870
Wow, we got a lot!

454
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,050
Hurry, hurry.

455
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,650
Wow, it's full!

456
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,060
Bin, here comes a bus!

457
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,710
- Mom didn't come.
- She'll be on the next one.

458
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:50,980
Sis...

459
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,380
Mom didn't come.

460
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,390
Don't worry. She'll come tomorrow.

461
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,490
Let's go.

462
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,190
Big Aunt...

463
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,530
We want to eat.

464
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,630
Auntie!

465
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,180
Auntie, we're hungry!

466
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,350
Here, go and get something.

467
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,350
Tastes good?

468
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,240
Good.

469
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,220
Bus is coming!

470
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,600
Getting on?

471
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,190
Here, you have the rest.

472
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,080
Bin...

473
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:49,020
Don't be sad...
Mom will be here soon.

474
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,580
A few days ago,
I got a letter from your mom.

475
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,450
But I didn't know how to tell you...

476
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,450
I was waiting for the right time.

477
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,720
What did she write?

478
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,930
Here, I'll read you the letter.

479
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,630
Dear Sister-in-law,
I hope you are well.

480
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,330
Things with Kang have not gone well.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

481
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:43,300
Even if I return now,
I'm not capable of supporting my girls.

482
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:50,280
I know they are a burden and I can't
ask you to look after them longer.

483
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:00,990
Only option left is my parents' farm....

484
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,360
Liar! You just want to get rid of us.

485
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,730
No, why would I want to do that?

486
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:20,210
I tried my best to take care of you.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

487
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,710
But you had fun here, didn't you?

488
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,520
Sis, what about Mom?

489
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,080
Mom's not coming, stupid.

490
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:15,760
They are your responsibility now.
Their mom asked me to bring them here.

491
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,430
What are you talking about?
They're not my kids!

492
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:26,030
- What? They are your grandkids.
- That bastard brother of yours!

493
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,800
Don't bad-mouth my brother.
What about your daughter?

494
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:39,650
- Shut up!
- They're yours now. I can't raise them.

495
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,710
- Got it?
- Do whatever you want!

496
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:48,990
You do whatever. I'm done.
I did all I can. You should thank me...

497
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,990
Kids, what are you doing?

498
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,530
- We came with our aunt.
- Oh, really?

499
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,540
- Come with me. It's cold.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

500
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:00,700
Follow me.

501
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,380
Sit there.

502
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,450
Girls! Come over here.

503
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,550
It's nice and warm.

504
01:06:56,570 --> 01:07:00,730
Get warm. Put your hands up like this.

505
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,310
We got a good fire!

506
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,350
You are just like your mom.

507
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,360
- I'm not at all.
- Is that so?

508
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:41,240
Mom's a big liar.

509
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:48,240
Is that what you think?
But... you shouldn't say such things.

510
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,530
Thanks for helping me.

511
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,300
Jin come here.

512
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:19,170
Don't you want to say good-bye?
Come closer.

513
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,020
Hurry up.

514
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,160
While you are here, be good.
Listen to your grandma and grandpa.

515
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:46,000
Jin, take care of Bin.
Bin, listen to your sister.

516
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,400
Don't fight, okay?

517
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:57,520
If you wait just a little bit longer...
your mom will come for you.

518
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:02,550
She'll come for you, understand?

519
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,430
Big Aunt!

520
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:21,400
Go inside. Go in!

521
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,030
Sis...

522
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,990
I miss Mom.

523
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,170
And I miss Dad.

524
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:13,240
I miss... Big Aunt, too.

525
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,980
I miss them all.

526
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:55,560
Hey kids, come over here. Come here.

527
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,220
Come on over.

528
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,440
Here you go. Eat this.

529
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,410
You too. Come to your grandma.

530
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,990
Take this and eat.

531
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,130
Come on!
Don't be afraid of your grandmother.

532
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:43,010
Want some? Put this in your mouth.

533
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,570
Here.

534
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,670
How do I do this?

535
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,240
Here, do the rest.

536
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:04,890
Sis, look!

537
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,750
- Finish it for me.
- Here.

538
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,260
Where's my lunch?
What are you doing?

539
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:20,900
What's the matter with your belly?
The kids aren't even complaining.

540
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:30,040
You two are making me laugh.
What are you staring at?

541
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,110
Are you learning something?

542
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,790
Getting nice and big!

543
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:45,300
- Can I touch it?
- Of course, go ahead.

544
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,240
- You think she'll cut it?
- Yeah...

545
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,570
- Dumplings!
- It's too thick...

546
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,800
- Looks like a dumpling.
- Not ready yet...

547
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,030
Bin!

548
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,930
Grandma's calling us.

549
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,610
Straighten this for me. Pull it.

550
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,590
You can do that side. Good.

551
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,320
Leave it like that.

552
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,830
Grandma, what is this stuff?

553
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,120
They are "chee-ja."
Spread them out.

554
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,340
Grandma, can you eat this?

555
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,970
You can, it's herbal medicine.
Very good for you.

556
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,160
Turn it off!

557
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,330
Good.

558
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:33,570
Grandma!

559
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,170
You got me water?

560
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,720
Good job girls.

561
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:59,130
Sis!

562
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,210
Peep-peep-peep....

563
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,920
You can't smile and you can't move.

564
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,960
Where are you going? Come back!

565
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,390
Catch me if you can.

566
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,560
Now you have to freeze!

567
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:33,900
You can't smile...

568
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,730
Hey!

569
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,630
... and you can't move,
when I say "freeze"!

570
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,040
"Per..."

571
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,700
Wait, let me erase this.

572
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,240
Try writing "The person."

573
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,380
When is Mom coming?

574
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,720
Just study.

575
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,720
"The person..."

576
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,460
Until the mountains in the Als...

577
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,600
- "Alps."
- "Alps."

578
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:10,660
... mountains, at nigh change...

579
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,930
- "night"
- "night"

580
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:18,440
... change their colors to red,

581
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,170
Heiti and Peter

582
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,510
- "Heidi"
- "Heidi"

583
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:29,150
Heidi and Peter.... Herd.... their sheep...
and play.

584
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,380
Let's take the wood home.

585
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,520
Help your sister.

586
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:19,090
Grandma!

587
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,430
Sit down, sit.

588
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,100
Get warmed up.

589
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,440
You want some sweet potatoes?

590
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,690
0h, hot! Hot.

591
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:41,450
Here. Peel the skin and eat.

592
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,320
Isn't it cold today?

593
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,130
It's hot, hot.

594
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,230
Real hot!

595
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:17,920
Eat up girls...

596
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,860
Me too...

597
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,370
These are all done nicely.

598
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,860
- Hot, hot.
- Real hot.

599
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,800
Now, I can peel it.

600
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,410
- Grandma...
- What?

601
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:41,140
- Can you buy us some winter shoes?
- Oh... okay.

602
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,140
Sure thing...

603
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,950
0h, a rock... better take it off.

604
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,030
Grandma, you got a hole in your shoe!

605
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:08,640
- What?
- You got a hole in your shoe.

606
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,240
0h, this lil' thing.

607
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,440
Grandma!

608
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:57,390
- Grandma!
- What?

609
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:02,460
- You can buy new shoes.
- Girls, come over here.

610
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,500
Here's our piggy bank...

611
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,730
What are you doing with your toy?

612
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:10,100
- No, it's...
- Put that down.

613
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:13,640
Please buy yourself
new shoes with this.

614
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:15,170
0h... really?

615
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,580
Let me see.

616
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,150
Wow! It's so heavy.
You got a lot in here.

617
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,180
Thank you very much.

618
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,510
You have to wash.

619
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,980
Come here girls.

620
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,620
- Are your hands cold?
- Nope.

621
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,240
Mom's coming for sure.

622
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,140
I promise. Seal it. Super seal.

623
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,530
- Grandma! Grandpa wants his lunch.
- Coming right up.

624
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,210
- Bin!
- Sis!

625
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:31,840
Let's catch grasshoppers and grill!

626
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:26,230
I want to walk up
the side of a mountain,

627
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:29,770
I want to walk down
the other side of the mountain,

628
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,770
I want to swim in a river,
lie in the sun,

629
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:38,280
I want to try to be nice....
to everyone.
