1
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,124
Mmm, what are you doing, babe?

2
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,926
Going to work.

3
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,394
It's rainin'.

4
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,964
No. I'll drive ya.

5
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,233
I got to cash my check.

6
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,736
Well, hurry up.

7
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,204
I'm gonna be late.

8
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,274
Well, good morning to <i>you,</i> too.

9
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,578
Hm, look at you.

10
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,980
What?

11
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,181
You look great.

12
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,316
I love that color on you.

13
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,419
Let's go.

14
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,655
All right.
Hold your horses.

15
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,140
So, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

16
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,441
Yeah?
Where's that list?

17
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,143
Watch out.
That person...

18
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,544
Ahh. I had a list with me.

19
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,113
It's good to make lists of stuff.
It's good.

20
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,615
I always make a list
so I don't forget.

21
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,750
That's what I keep telling you.

22
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,251
Anyway.

23
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,320
All right.
So, I'm gonna cash my check,

24
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,088
and, uh, then we'll do
a little shopping,

25
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,658
get some food and some beer.

26
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,262
I got to fix that ham
radio for that lady.

27
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,098
That's gonna probably bring
in a couple bucks.

28
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,734
If I can figure out the whole,
you know...

29
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,536
Shit.

30
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,506
What? What?

31
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,675
We're low on gas.
<i>Real</i> low.

32
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,312
Fuck it.

33
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,714
Say a prayer.

34
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,087
Damn it.

35
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,688
What?

36
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,358
For real?

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,767
Sorry, babe.

38
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,503
God damn it.

39
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,773
Okay.

40
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,442
Wish me luck.

41
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,677
Yeah.
All right. I'll see you.

42
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,079
What are <i>you</i> gonna do?

43
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm just gonna wait it out.

44
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,815
You sure?
Yeah.

45
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,085
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Go ahead.

46
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,520
You got it.
It's okay.

47
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,457
Okay.

48
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,595
I'll see you later.

49
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh, come on, Rich.

50
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,469
It's not your fault.

51
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,737
I'm the one who drove it last.

52
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,339
Yeah, but still.

53
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,776
Man.

54
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,278
Okay.
Here I go.

55
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,473
Sorry I'm late.

56
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,775
Hmm.

57
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,579
I personally don't give a shit,
but Edwin's pissed off.

58
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,514
Ay, mamita.

59
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,850
Your hair's a mess.

60
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,852
Why don't you go fix it
before I leave, huh?

61
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,287
I will.

62
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,259
What?

63
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,262
Coquito.

64
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,864
Christmas <i>is</i> coming.

65
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,732
Yeah, in two months.

66
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,768
Did your calendar break?

67
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,969
Oh, I forgot.

68
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,404
You don't know how to read.

69
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,206
Oh. Ha ha ha.

70
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,907
You want some or not, smart ass?

71
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,609
Sure.

72
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,280
You sound like a Mexican.

73
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,984
Now, that's some straight up
Puerto Rican Coquito,

74
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,787
not some Mexican bullshit.

75
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,624
Oh, good morning.
Look who decided to join us.

76
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,793
Oh, shit.

77
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,762
You'd better call
management to complain.

78
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,864
Oh, wait.
He <i>is</i> management.

79
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,934
Best watch your mouth, winters.

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,705
Could have you fired
for being late again.

81
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,774
You know, I give you
the best shift of the day,

82
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,776
and you still can't be on time.

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,978
Why is that?

84
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,512
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

85
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,915
It won't happen again.

86
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,884
Well, you're working
a double here.

87
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,653
I know. I know.

88
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,455
What else you know?

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,957
You know you're not supposed
to be smoking that cigarette

90
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,993
behind the counter,
so put it out.

91
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,694
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,665
And you other one,
you fixing to pay for those?

93
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,933
Honey, trust me.

94
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,735
If I wanted to steal
something from you,

95
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,837
it wouldn't be no
little shit like this.

96
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,272
How many cans you took?

97
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,276
Huh?

98
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,012
Thanks.

99
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,880
Your pants are wet.
Yep.

100
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,951
It's not 'cause of me, is it?

101
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,455
Ha ha.

102
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,625
Anything that says
"Swabian farms,"

103
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,494
pull it all and Chuck it.

104
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,599
So, that college program,

105
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,001
does the company pay for it
before or after you sign up?

106
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,770
Well, first off,

107
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,474
you got to be working here
a full 12 months to qualify.

108
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,775
I told you that before.

109
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,944
Secondly, you don't sign up.
You apply.

110
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,479
Just tell me.

111
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,147
Do they pay before
or after you sign up?

112
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,882
I don't know.

113
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,017
Maybe you should call the lady
in charge and ask her.

114
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,454
Better yet, maybe you can
look it up online.

115
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,057
Lady? What's her name?

116
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,436
Where do you want it?

117
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,971
You're not done, are you?

118
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,907
You didn't get that
peanut butter over there.

119
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,909
Says "Swabian farms" on it,
don't it?

120
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,678
Didn't I say anything that said
"Swabian farms" on it?

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,414
Geez.

122
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,789
You throwing all of it away?

123
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,490
Sure am.

124
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,926

That ain't no way
to live right there.

130

Hey, dad.

00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,049
Do you think when we get home,
we can go shooting?

133
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,518
You can go shooting
with your Uncle Jack.

134
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
I got some business

00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,992
Tell me about it.

142
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,862
I ran out of gas

143
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,065
driving Melissa to work
this morning.

144

I'm the one who feels like
a piece of shit about it.

151

You cash that for me?

00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,724
Yeah.

156
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,959
Thanks.
Burger and grits?

157
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,128
Yeah. And, uh, get me a beer

161
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,545
I saw your boyfriend
this morning

162
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,581
rolling down the highway...

163
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,550
Like a bum.

164
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,657
I'm calling the cops.
It's legal.

165
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,158
There ain't nothing they can do.

166
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,662
So, I've been seeing
Krystal lately.

Mm-hmm. She's hot.

sucks my dick <i>real</i> good.

169
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,170
Can I help you, sir?

170
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:57,841
You're going out with a gimp
'cause you fucked up... Again.

171
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,143
I got a weapon down here.

172
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,344
Yeah, what do you got?

173
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,946
You got an A.K., Uzi?

174
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,017
That's $3.62.

175
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,187
Have a nice day.

176
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,158
I miss you.

177
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,794
Don't.

178
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,696
Just the water?

179
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,131
Yeah.

180
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,704
What are they building
over there, Mick?

181
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,939
Probably another
fucking strip mall.

182
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,876
Yeah, right?
Just what we need.

183
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,847
You miss working construction?

184
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,349
Hell no.

185
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,251
But you can make
a good living at it.

186
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,187
I did pretty good at it.

187
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,089
I made some good money.

188
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,724
Yeah.

189
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,126
What happened to that?

190
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,028
Man, that money's history.

191
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,696
"What happened to it?"

192
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,099
Shit, man.
Life happened to that.

193
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,702
I gambled it, you know.

194
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,072
I had this other girl back then,
this girl Tammy.

195
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:07,344
Man, this chick
was a piece of work.

196
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,781
She was a borderline
personality disorder.

197
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,349
You ever met one of them?

198
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,685
You're crazy, man.
No, man.

199
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,320
<i>She</i> was crazy.

200
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,922
She was bat-shit crazy.

201
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,227
How's Kyle?

202
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,229
Thank you.

203
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,664
He ain't yours.

204
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,932
I don't know what
difference it makes.

205
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,200
Hey, Jimmy.
How you doing?

206
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,769
Great. Thank you.
Pack of smokes?

207
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,437
Please.
How you doing, Mel?

208
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,439
I'm all right.

209
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,309
I miss your ass.

210
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,311
Is it still fat?
Shut up, Justin.

211
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,713
Watch it, guy.

212
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,014
Don't worry, Jimmy.
I got it.

213
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,086
I'll be outside if you need me.

214
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,287
Keep the change.

215
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,689
Thanks, Jimmy.

216
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,091
Bye, Jimmy.

217
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,895
If you don't leave
and leave now,

218
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,731
I will knock you on the head
and tell God you died.

219
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,734
Can I get the bathroom key?

220
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,402
No.

221
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,104
How can I help you, sir?

222
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,273
Maps. City maps.

223
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,175
I got it.

224
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,444
Right there.

225
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,712
Is it...?

226
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,486
Is this all you have?

227
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,254
That's it.

228
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,723
This will have to do.

229
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,458
All right.

230
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,462
How much?

231
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,203
Uh, that's $4.95.

232
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,505
With the water...

233
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,807
It's $8.76.

234
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,845
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

235
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,113
Thank you.

236
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,381
Y'all have a nice trip.

237
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,953
Sunlight Jr.

238
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,821
I'm locked in the bathroom!

239
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,456
The fucking handle
came off in my hand!

240
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,127
Good lord, Justin.
Give me a break.

241
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,263
Better let me out of here...

242
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,867
Before I fucking report your ass!

243
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,035
Missy, come on, babe.

244
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,505
I'll call Edwin.
<i>He'll</i> let you out.

245
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,073
Come on!

246
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,043
I told you, don't mess!

247
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,312
You're real tough now, huh?

248
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,982
And take this shit back, too.

249
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,251
Aww, man.

250
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,954
What the fuck, Missy?

251
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,556
Come on!

252
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,124
If you don't let me out of here,
I'm gonna press charges.

253
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,225
Whatever.

254
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,913
Hey, Richie!

255
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,414
You coming?

256
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,249
Hold on!

257
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,984
Come on, Richie!

258
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,820
Jesus, give me a break,
would ya?

259
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,188
Hold on!

260
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,563
What, already?!

261
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,464
Are you coming?
Yeah.

262
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,501
Who's the jerk-off that parked
in front of my space?

263
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,036
I don't know.

264
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,205
I mean, it's got a big-ass
wheelchair in it.

265
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,439
Anybody can see that.

266
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,374
I don't know.
Damn!

267
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,910
I'm gonna find that guy, man.

268
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,415
Hey, Darth, cigarette.

269
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,251
Yes, mother.
Hey, Richie!

270
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,553
Wow.

271
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,855
You miss me?

272
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,122
Of course I missed you, baby.

273
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,591
Got a light?
Give me a light.

274
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,026
I heard you got a
new man in your life.

275
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,361
Mmm.

276
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,596
Do I hear wedding bells?

277
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,030
Mnh, mnh.

278
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,399
Always getting married, man.

279
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,535
You know this.

280
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,937
All right, you freakin' losers.

281
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,907
It's about time we started
having a little fun around here.

282
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,208
Richie, we <i>are</i> having fun!

283
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,409
Who's got a pillowcase?

284
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,978
Pillowcase?
Pillowcase?

285
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,946
You got a pillowcase, Jorge?
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,015
What do you want
a pillowcase for?

287
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,483
You have some in your room.

288
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,418
Yeah, we got a pillowcase.
I'll be right back.

289
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,020
And step on it, Darth.

290
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,356
What are we gonna do
with the pillowcases?

291
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,091
I'm gonna have a little race.

292
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,292
A race?
Yes.

293
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,393
And the winner...

294
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,963
Gets to finish this here bottle.

295
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,365
Ahhh!

296
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,368
Richie

297
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,372
Come on, you people.
Up to the starting line.

298
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,407
Okay.

299
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,476
Molly, are you gonna
participate in this one?

300
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,044
No, I'm sitting out.

301
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,312
Okay.

302
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,613
Let's go.

303
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,315
All right. All right.
All right.

304
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,117
Come on. Get ready.

305
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,954
On your mark!

306
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,057
Get set!

307
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,359
Darth! Oh, my God!
Mom!

308
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,694
Hey, man.
Get back!

309
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,629
You got to wait
till I say "go," man!

310
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,098
All right.
Then say it!

311
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,366
All right! Go!

312
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,074
Move! Move! Move!
Rusty takes the lead by...

313
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,576
¡arriba! ¡arriba!
Come on, Jorge! !arriba!

314
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,312
Ohh!

315
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,282
Don't they have bag races
South of the border?

316
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,686
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

317
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,158
Winner!

318
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,492
Whoo!

319
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,660
Here we go!

320
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,495
Whoo-hoo!

321
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,297
What do I win, huh?

322
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,299
Not me, baby.
I'm taken.

323
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,992
Hey, buddy.

324
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,765
Did you get wet?

325
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,337
<i>I</i> sure as shit did.

326
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,255
Hey.

327
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,523
Hey.

328
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:12,736
Uh, I made you Richie's special
Spanish mac and cheese.

329
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,438
I hope you like it.

330
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,373
You're sweet.

331
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,142
Sorry about this morning.

332
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,416
You didn't do nothing.

333
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,119
Yeah, but still.

334
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,094
You know,
I really missed you today.

335
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,462
Me too.

336
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,363
Yeah.

337
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,400
I like the flowers.

338
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,402
So, how'd it go?

339
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,437
Boring.

340
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,772
How about you?

341
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,173
Come home all right?

342
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,475
Yeah.

343
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,278
Where's the car at?

344
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,881
Some jerk-off parked
in my space.

345
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,883
I had to move it down
to Molly's room.

346
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,618
Believe that?

347
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,187
I didn't know if you'd left
it on the road or what.

348
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,750
Oh, come on.
I take care of my business.

349
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:14,631
I tried talking to Edwin about
that college program again,

350
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:20,537
but he just keeps
on blowing me off.

351
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,372
So, what are you gonna do?

352
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,574
I don't know.

353
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,577
Call the number, I guess.

354
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,847
Just, I hate to make
phone calls like that.

355
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,782
I never know what to say.

356
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,651
Just be yourself.

357
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,188
Yeah.

Thank you, sir.

399
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,796
You hung over, mamita?
You all right?

400
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,865
I'm just mad tired.

401
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,703
I'm mad hungry, too.

Tired and hungry, huh?

Yeah.

404
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,111
I feel sick.

405
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:32,148

with something.

Fuck you.

409
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,223
Tired, hungry,
and now very grumpy.

410
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,693
Huh. Let me see.

411
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,469
Thank you.

412
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,904
Good lord.

413
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,232
I'll take three of those, too.

414
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,701
Sure thing.

415
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,104
Here you go.

416
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,958
That's $9.72.

417
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:01,604
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're
gonna have to hurry on up.

418
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,989
Oh, good morning, ladies.

419
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:58,094
Looking mighty fine today.

420
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,034
Honey buns, why don't you and me
step in the office?

421
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,398
Are you messing with me?!

422
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Bitch!

423
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,803
I can smell your pussy
through the window.

424
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,972
Fuck you!

425
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,751
Tell your daddy to behave,

426
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,352
'cause he's acting up,
and I'm about...

427
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,021
He don't listen.

428
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,324
Ha ha!

429
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,761
Bye, Missy!

430
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:08,765
Bye, Kyle.

431
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:19,275
How'd it go today?

432
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,145
It's okay.

433
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:34,090
Justin's stalking me again.

434
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,692
What do you mean?

435
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,861
He keeps coming in the store.

436
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,229
Why?

437
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,065
I don't know why.

438
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm gonna kill him, Melissa.

439
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,736
This time,
I'm gonna freakin' kill him.

440
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,471
Don't be stupid.

441
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,075
Mom's probably egging him on,
knowing her.

442
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,711
Your mother
is an alcoholic bitch.

443
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:58,314
Look who's talking.

444
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,716
Yeah.

445
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,484
You still love him.

446
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,953
That's why he's stalking you,
'cause he's in love with you.

447
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,722
And he wouldn't be
in love with you

448
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,490
if you weren't in love
with him, too!

449
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,192
What?!

450
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,298
I said it.

451
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:20,870
'Cause I know it to be a fact.

452
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,810
I hate that guy.

453
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:31,180
I hear his name,
and it gets me nuts.

454
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,417
I swear to God, that guy...
I...

455
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,372
What's the price?

456
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,088
Hey.

457
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,957
This is perfect for you.
Maybe you'll learn something.

458
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,094
I reckon you'd better
clean up your act

459
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,395
if you're gonna be a daddy.

460
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,331
Look.

461
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,167
It's brand-new,
still got the tags on it.

462
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,002
What are you talking about?

463
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,305
Well, it's too soon to know
if it's a boy or a girl,

464
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,909
but I think it's so cute we
should buy it just in case.

465
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,944
I'm pregnant.

466
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,383
Yeah.

467
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,351
Yeah!

468
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,020
Come here!

469
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:49,892
Big papa.

470
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,528
Big papa in the house!

471
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,164
You know it!

472
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,366
You like it?

473
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,968
Well, maybe it's not...

474
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,570
I wouldn't have <i>my</i> son
wearing that.

475
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,241
Oh! Oh! Oh!

476
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:09,278
I have to check and see if they
have a daycare at college.

477
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,380
No way, Melissa.

478
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,016
<i>I'm</i> taking care
of the little guy.

479
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,054
I'm gonna make
an awesome daddy.

480
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,256
You will, indeed.

481
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:25,928
You know,
I got some powerful sperm.

482
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,398
Yep. Sure do.

483
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
I thought you couldn't
make no babies.

484
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,336
Well...

485
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,873
I want a little girl.

486
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,910
I want to dress up
a little girl <i>so bad.</i>

487
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,484
Listen, I want
to ask you something,

488
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,020
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

489
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:55,391
Did you ever get pregnant
with Justin?

490
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,995
We already talked about that.

491
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,931
Remember?

492
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,933
Yeah. Okay.

493
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,402
Okay, but, uh...

494
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,606
Did... did you <i>want</i> to have
a baby with him?

495
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,643
I'm not gonna get mad.

496
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,678
He had Kyle.

497
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,213
That was enough.

498
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,049
I'm not talking
about that dick head's kid.

499
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,486
Look, Kyle... he don't have
nothing to do with Justin.

500
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,556
Yeah, and he don't have nothing
to do with you or us, either.

501
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:33,095
Yeah. That's true.

502
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,368
All right.

503
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,971
So, uh...

504
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,106
Well, let's get married, huh?

505
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:55,117
Are you...

506
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,019
Are you asking me?

507
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,621
Yeah.

508
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,523
Well...

509
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,726
Oh.

510
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,395
Okay.

511
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:12,401
Melissa?

512
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,736
Mm-hmm?

513
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,738
Would you marry me?

514
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,610
Hmm. All right.

515
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,447
What took you so long
to answer the question?

516
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,617
Okay.

517
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,519
Come on. We're in a restaurant.
Cut it out.

518
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,624
Hey! Stop it.

519
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,327
Can you... can you wait
till we get back home?

520
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,298
I love you.

521
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,666
I love you, too.

522
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,369
I mean it.
I really love you.

523
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:09,058
Come here.

524
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:21,370
So, you think I can make
an honest woman out of you?

525
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,671
Yeah?

526
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,740
I've been a bad girl.

527
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,208
Yeah. You really have been.

528
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,777
Oh, yeah.

529
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,311
And you're gonna be...

530
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,347
An even worse girl
in about two minutes.

531
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,351
Wait a minute.
You made me miss the room.

532
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,153
Right here.

533
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,130
Oh!

534
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,266
Come on, now. Wait.

535
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,601
Come and get it, baby.

536
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,382
Here.

537
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,650
No, it's okay.

538
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,753
It's not for you.
It's for the baby.

539
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,655
Hmm?

540
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:18,160
Well, if you say it like that.

541
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,164
<i>...cloud comfort</i>

You sure you don't want a bag?

546
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,242
No, thanks.
Have a good one.

547
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,743
All right. Well, thanks
for shopping at Sunlight Jr.

548
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,847
Hey, Helen.
How are ya?

549
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,248
Melissa?

550
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,449
Yep?

551
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,253
This here is Helen Mccormick.

552
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,554
Oh.

553
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,424
Hi.

554
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,593
You the lady from
the college program?

555
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,828
Nice to meet you.

556
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,364
No, she's, uh,
gonna give you a drug test.

557
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,334
Oh. Didn't I do
one of them already?

558
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,337
Yes.
What, are you worried?

559
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,739
Hell no.

560
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:07,376
I don't do no drugs!

561
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,311
Come on.
Let's do this.

562
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,349
Hey, little man.
What can I do for ya?

563
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,918
A ball, huh?

564
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,494
Why, Richie.
What a pleasant surprise.

565
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,996
Yeah.

566
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,765
And how in the world
is my beautiful daughter?

567
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,667
She's good.
She's real good.

568
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,003
Yeah, too good to come
and see her mama?

569
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,972
No, I mean,
she's working all the time.

570
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,440
You know how that is.

571
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,708
Oh, yeah. At Sunset Jr.?

572
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,543
Yeah, "Sunlight."
Whatever.

573
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:02,391
Put your cup in here, please.

574
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:11,267
Can you straighten up in here?

575
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,769
This place is kind of disgusting.

576
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,938
Yes, ma'am.

577
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,453
No! Nuh-uh! No!

578
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:35,658
How did you know that
family services wrote me up

579
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,860
for not having enough food
in my cupboard?

580
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,428
No!

581
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,330
I'm sorry to hear that.

582
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,399
Oh, don't be.
It's not their fault.

583
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,434
They think they're doing
their job,

584
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,537
but they know that foster care
doesn't give me enough money

585
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,039
to feed all these damn kids.

586
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,643
You stop it!

587
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,079
Did you get this
at the food bank?

588
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,547
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,583
Crap.

590
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,719
They're not giving out
any more peanut butter,

591
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,721
and that's all Jeral will eat.

592
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,990
I don't know how
I'm gonna feed that boy.

593
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,059
Are you stayin'?

594
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,761
Listen, I want to talk
to you about Justin.

595
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,897
He's been hassling
Melissa again.

596
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,467
He's been showing up at her job,
you know, shit like that.

597
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,669
Well, that's because
the restraining order's up.

598
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,972
Well, I'll just get my 9

599
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,542
and settle it
the old-fashioned way.

600
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,876
Boom!

601
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,678
You know his mama died.

602
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,715
Yeah? Sorry to hear that.
Shit happens.

603
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,917
Yeah, but I got to pay
Justin my rent now.

604
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,453
That makes him my landlord.

605
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,687
Whoa!

606
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,888
Oh!

607
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,123
You want a motorboat ride?

608
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,691
Yes.
All right.

609
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:46,395
♪ Motorboat, motorboat

610
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,997
♪ Goes so slow

611
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,734
♪ Motorboat, motorboat
goes so fast ♪

612
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,703
♪ Motorboat, motorboat,
step on the gas! ♪

613
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Sam. Come here.

614
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,142
Listen, I want you
to go tell the other kids

615
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,044
we're gonna have noodles.

616
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:06,548
They can have noodles in butter
or cottage cheese or ketchup.

617
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,950
You find out what they want,

618
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,885
and you come tell Kathleen,
okay?

619
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,387
Yes, mom.

620
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,088
I win! I win!
Oh, that's great.

621
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,824
Why don't you take her over
there to play, Cody?

622
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:21,630
Kids... give them an inch,
they'll take a mile.

623
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,565
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

624
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:42,117
Hello.

625
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,519
Hey, pumpkin.

626
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,154
Ooh, look at you.

627
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,688
Oh, she likes you.

628
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,759
You want her?

629
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:54,563
Well, I'm about ready
to have my own, so...

630
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,132
Oh, well, good luck...
or congratulations...

631
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,934
I guess.

632
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,913
What about Zeke?

633
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,581
You like Zeke?

634
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,918
Yeah, I do.
It's cute.

635
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,687
I like "z" names.

636
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,490
Like...

637
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,226
Zara or Zora.

638
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,495
You like Zora?

639
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,996
Zora?

640
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,731
Mm-hmm.

641
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,834
You freakin' kidding me?

642
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,504
That sounds like a witch.

643
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,840
Or a stripper.

644
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,609
Or both... a stripper witch.

645
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,678
No.

646
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,981
My daughter's gonna be
an ass kicker like her mama.

647
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,251
Yeah.

648
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:54,690
I like old-fashioned names,
too, like...

649
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,726
Like Jamie.
Jamie.

650
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,596
She could be a boy or a girl.

651
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:04,199
Yeah, Jamie's all right.

652
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,568
It's not special, though.

653
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,872
What about, um...

654
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,243
What about Chester?

655
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,012
No?

656
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:22,518
How come you always think
of boys' names, hmm?

657
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,821
Are you gonna love this
baby if it's a girl?

658
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,758
Um, what do <i>you</i> think?

659
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,296
Do you think I wouldn't love
the baby if it was a girl?

660
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,865
Come on, lady.

661
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,967
Who are you talking to?

662
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:43,005
My dad didn't give
a flying fuck about me.

663
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:47,609
Well, I'm not your dad.

664
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,111
I'm your daddy.

665
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,014
Rich, they're sore.
Don't touch.

666
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:55,851
Ow!
Ow!

667
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:00,656
How come you're always so
horny all the time, huh?

668
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:04,226
You act like I never fuck you.

669
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,834
So, I was thinking,

670
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,338
so I can get all those extra
hours you were talking about,

671
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,808
can I work a couple extra shifts
a week for a while?

672
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,044
Well, funny
you should say that, Mel.

673
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:25,280
Starting next week, I'm gonna
have to put you on graveyard.

674
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,683
You can still work mornings
if you want to,

675
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,619
but I'm gonna have to switch
your shift over to graveyard.

676
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,854
What?

677
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,624
Where's Vivian?
She does graveyard.

678
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,327
She <i>did</i> graveyard.

679
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:40,228
Vivian quit.

680
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,598
Well, <i>i</i> can't do it.

681
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,734
I'm gonna get robbed or
raped or something.

682
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,769
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

683
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,738
'Cause I'm the assistant manager,

684
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,239
and you're the cashier.

685
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,875
Now, you want to go train
to be an assistant manager,

686
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,243
then you tell <i>me</i> what to do.

687
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,778
Until then,
I'll tell <i>you</i> what to do.

688
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,980
We clear?

689
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,216
Why'd she quit?
I don't know.

690
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,784
Called me on the phone.

691
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,721
She said she didn't want
to work here no more.

692
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,657
Maybe she wants to be
a drug dealer.

693
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,325
Oh, yeah?

694
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,962
Well, maybe I'd rather sell
drugs than work the graveyard.

695
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,031
Good lord.

696
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:20,636
Hey, Kelly.

697
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:21,837
You want your smokes?

698
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,339
Yeah. Thanks, Mel.

699
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,974
So, can I bring Richie?

700
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,342
Suit yourself.

701
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,978
Just don't let me see him
behind the counter.

702
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,115
Are you gonna let me have
those extra shifts, or what?

703
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:35,984
Yeah, if you can handle them,
you can have them.

704
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,753
Thanks.

705
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,390
Thanks.

706
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,426
What are you doing?

707
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,963
What's wrong with you?!
That's her family!

708
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,998
So?
She don't work here no more.

709
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,034
Why should I have to look at 'em?

710
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,671
You know, you're an asshole,
you know that?

711
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:59,074
Yeah, well, you best watch
your mouth, miss.

712
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,977
I <i>can't</i> do the graveyard.

713
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,914
You <i>will</i> do the graveyard,
or you won't have a job.

714
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,718
Now get back to work.
You have a customer.

715
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,037
Richie!

716
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,305
Yep?

717
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,374
You coming?

718
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,810
No, I'm good.

719
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:36,445
I'm good!

720
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,990
Got some work to do here.

721
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,841
27 cents is your change.

722
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:07,175
Thank you very much.

723
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,510
Thank you.
How are you, sir?

724
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,413
Get a full house
and a monopoly.

725
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,752
Where the hell you going?

726
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,053
I'm sorry.

727
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:25,060
I'm sorry.
I'm sick. Really sick.

728
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,463
Thank you for shopping
at Sunlight Jr.

729
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,265
You need a bag, sir?

730
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:35,403
Check it out.

731
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,439
20 bucks.

732
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,541
Where's the DVD player, Rich?

733
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,343
Come on, man. 20 bucks.
You can sell it for $40.

734
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,944
Are you kidding?

735
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,813
Dude, you can buy one
of these new for 30 bucks!

736
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,182
Come on, man.
All right.

737
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,218
Give me 10 bucks,
and you can sell it for $20.

738
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,821
You're...
come on, man! Give it a spin.

739
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,456
You're killing me, man.

740
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,358
Come on, man.
I'm your friend.

741
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,160
Just take it, man.
Take it.

742
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,962
You don't want it, nobody's
putting a gun to your head.

743
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,368
We got to wait till after hours.

744
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,170
Mick, I don't think, uh,

745
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:11,907
the clientele's gonna mind
watching a little pornography.

746
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,843
Yeah, and in walks the lady
from the liquor board,

747
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,244
and I'm shut down.

748
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,381
Come on, man.
I'm just messing with you.

749
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,851
Through the cables.

750
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,519
Appreciate it, man.

751
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,454
That machine's gonna
work like a gem.

752
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,956
Do you want to start a tab?

753
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,958
Yeah, sure.

754
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:35,497
♪ <i>Maybe I've forgotten</i>
<i>My name</i> ♪

755
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:39,234
Hey, Micky.
Tell you something, man?

756
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,270
Yes, sir.

757
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,973
Melissa, uh...

758
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,543
turns out,
she's gonna have a baby.

759
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,515
Congratulations, papa!
Yeah.

760
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,250
That's awesome, man!
Yeah!

761
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,551
How many kids <i>you</i> got?

762
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,053
Me?
I got four.

763
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,956
I got three boys
and one baby girl.

764
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,490
Wow.

765
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,026
And, uh, they're hellcats,
all of them.

766
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,595
A matter of fact,

767
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,631
my oldest boy Brian
just had a baby of his own.

768
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,266
Grandpa?

769
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,001
What? No.

770
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,203
Young man like yourself?
Not me. Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

771
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,873
My grandson's
gonna call me "captain."

772
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,975
Captain, huh?
Yeah. Yeah.

773
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,611
Man, I'm too young
to be called grandpa

774
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,914
or pawpaw, or fuck that, man.

775
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,649
I can't believe it, man.

776
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,485
The whole time,
I thought I was...

777
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,988
I thought I was shooting blanks.

778
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,256
Hey, look.

779
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,224
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

780
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,059
Amen.

781
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,965
Is my baby gonna be okay?

782
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,001
I can't really say.

783
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:49,070
I'm the sonographer,
not the doctor.

784
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,539
I'm here to take a picture
of the uterus,

785
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:55,076
and when the doctor comes in,
she'll interpret it for you.

786
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,979
Oh. All right.

787
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,489
Take a few deep breaths
in and out for now.

788
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,960
Is that it?

789
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,562
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,265
That's your baby.

791
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,504
I can see it.

792
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,339
Mm-hmm.

793
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:32,480
Oh, thank God.

794
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,516
Thank God.

795
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,722
Thank God.

796
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:48,563
Thank you.

797
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,184
Not even a fucking phone call?!

798
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,619
How stupid can you be?

799
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,188
You know how much this shit
is gonna cost us?!

800
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,291
I was bleeding.
What was I supposed to do?

801
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,460
Call your fucking man!

802
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,095
That's what you're...
my phone is spent!

803
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,598
Then use the fucking pay phone,
like the old days!

804
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,201
All right.

805
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,803
Look, Mel...

806
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,805
Did they do anything for ya?

807
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,241
Can you tell me that?

808
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,779
Did they give you any pills?
Can you tell me?

809
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,647
I got vitamins.

810
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:16,484
You got vitamins?
Did they actually do anything?

811
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,154
I saw the baby.
It was alive.

812
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,388
Isn't that good news?

813
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,790
Well, that's great news,

814
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,526
but we already fucking
knew that, didn't we?!

815
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,795
Now we get to pay $1,500,

816
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:31,433
or twice that amount
if they send it out to a lab

817
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,134
or did some bullshit tests.

818
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,702
All that money down the drain

819
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:38,139
just to find out what we already
knew in the first place,

820
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,208
is that you're
fucking pregnant.

821
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,443
You're an asshole!

822
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,678
Wow! Fucking news flash
on that one!

823
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,847
We already knew that!

824
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,783
Hello!

825
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,220
Hey, you stop this shouting
or I'm calling the police.

826
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,689
We're having a spat.
We'll keep it down.

827
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,357
Spat? I can hear you
all the way down in 4.

828
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,559
Don't make a federal case of it.
Come on.

829
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:58,560
Where's the girl?

830
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,662
Where's the girl?!

831
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,597
Right here, sir.

832
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,233
You see that?

833
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,702
No bruises, no broken bones.

834
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,105
All right.

835
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,407
Have a good night.

836
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,476
You heard the lady.
Good night.

837
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,511
Just keep it down, all right?

838
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,849
Fucking idiot.

839
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,674
Uh, that's bad for the baby.

840
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,711
So is screamin' and yellin',
dumb ass.

841
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,880
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Melissa,

842
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,916
but I've been through
the whole hospital system.

843
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,684
You got to be careful.

844
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,687
I know how these
thieves operate, okay?

845
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,223
Just next time, call me.

846
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,461
I hope there won't
be a next time.

847
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:09,230
I'm not saying there will be.

848
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:14,736
Are you still bleeding?

849
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,505
No.

850
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:23,411
Oh.

851
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:30,185
I printed these out for you.

852
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,205
Edwin put me on graveyard.

853
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,678
Oh, nice.

854
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,580
Yeah.

855
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:07,989
The work may affect the
amount of your check,

856
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,392
however, we do not count
the first $65 of earnings

857
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,362
in a month, plus 1/2
of the remainder.

858
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,531
This means we count less
than 1/2 of your earnings

859
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,266
when we figure
your payment amount.

860
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,704
Now, you may still qualify
for other work incentives,

861
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,006
and you'll continue
to receive Medicaid.

862
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,375
Now, there are a lot
of job openings

863
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,744
for the handicapped
in high-tech fields.

864
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,816
<i>...empty fields</i>
<i>with piles of dirt,</i>

865
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,618
<i>but in just two years,</i>

866
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,753
<i>this could be the bay area's</i>
<i>premier shopping center.</i>

867
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,688
<i>This development was proposed</i>

868
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,024
<i>for this site</i>
<i>almost 20 years ago.</i>

869
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,727
<i>After calling it quits</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

870
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:48,496
<i>developers are ready</i>
<i>to move forward</i>

871
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,465
<i>with plans for the mall</i>

872
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,333

876
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:05,013
Melissa Winters?!

877
00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:11,519
How worker's compensation

878
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,322
and other disability payments
may effect your benefits?

879
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,059
Uh, the windfall elimination
improvisation has it.

880
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:22,030
We also have a publication in
the government pension offset.

881
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:24,532
You can get these publications

882
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:25,900
either from our website...

883
00:58:48,857 --> 00:58:52,427
Mr. Barnes?

884
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,529
Mr. Barnes?
Huh?

885
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,731
Do you have high-tech experience?

886
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,334
You mean like, uh, computers?

887
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:01,602
That's right.
Nah.

888
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,505
I mean, yeah,
I can get on the Internet,

889
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,475
you know, but I can't
fix them or nothing.

890
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,811
I mean, um,
you know what I fix?

891
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,879
I fix, like, television sets,

892
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,816
electronics, stuff like that,
you know?

893
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:16,718
Mid-tech, I call it.

894
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,052
All right. Well,

895
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,355
I'm sure there are
some classes in there

896
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:21,956
for you to update your skills.

897
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,791
You look in there.

898
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,861
And I'll see you next month.

899
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,062
Okay?

900
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,665
Thanks.

901
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,704
Just seemed like
a lot of blood.

902
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,974
Well, I've had patients bleed
their whole pregnancy long

903
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,576
and everything was fine.

904
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,945
I hope that's not me.

905
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,680
It's very rare.

906
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,916
It usually resolves itself
after the first trimester.

907
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,120
You said you had a sonogram.
Is that correct?

908
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,588
Oh, yes, ma'am.

909
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,792
See?

910
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,694
It was kicking its little legs

911
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,597
and punching its little
fists the whole time.

912
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,432
I couldn't hardly believe it.

913
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,900
That's good.

914
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:09,771
All right.

915
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,972
Excellent.

916
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,707
Thanks.

917
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,942
Would you like
to keep a journal?

918
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,478
I sometimes ask my patients
to do that.

919
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,781
In fact, I had one
patient that told me

920
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,183
she used it to write
letters to her baby.

921
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,919
Oh, okay. Thanks.

922
01:00:27,189 --> 01:00:29,590
So...

923
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,593
Should I bring this back
next time I'm here?

924
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,163
Oh, no.
It's not for me, it's for you.

925
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:37,198
Oh, okay.
I-I'm sorry.

926
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,669
I thought it was, like, some
kind of homework or something.

927
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,073
The only homework you have
is to take care of yourself.

928
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,575
Eat healthy and no smoking.

929
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,211
Oh, yes, ma'am.

930
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,085
<i>The scratch-off game</i>

938
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,759
Excuse me?

939
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:45,166
Leave me alone!

940
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,035
God damn it. Jesus.

941
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,171
So, why don't you take a nap?

942
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:53,107
Do you realize that
you're falling asleep?

943
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,709
I'm not. I'm reading.

944
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,544
If you fall asleep again,

945
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,847
then I'm... I'm gonna insist
that you take a nap.

946
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,553
You're asleep again.

947
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,854
Hey, how you doing?
All right.

948
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,823
Let me know
if I can get you anything.

949
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,157
Yep.

950
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,994
Take a nap, babe.
I'll watch the store.

951
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,962
Yeah, go.

952
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:18,766
Go. Sit.
Take a nap.

953
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,067
I got it.

954
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,160
Hey.

955
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,761
Hey, winters.

956
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,697
You and me need to talk.

957
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,332
Right now.

958
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,668
No, just me and her.

959
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,908
Sure thing. Talk.

960
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,910
Well, apparently
you forgot the rules.

961
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,746
Video camera up there's got
pictures of your boyfriend here

962
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,315
waiting on customers while
you're sleeping on the chair.

963
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,250
Hey, hey.

964
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,252
She was tired, man.
It's no big deal.

965
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,787
It's not gonna happen again.

966
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,089
You, my friend, got to go.

967
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,291
Adios. Goodbye. Right now.
Come on, Edwin.

968
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,259
Hey, it's not safe
for a woman here

969
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,661
all alone by herself at night.

970
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,862
Vivian did it.

971
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,831
Well, I can't speak for Vivian,

972
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,699
but it's not safe for Melissa.

973
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,868
All right, look.
Either he goes, or you both go.

974
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,269
What's it gonna be?

975
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:06,073
What's it gonna be?!

976
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:13,080
I'll be outside.

977
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,958
You are so full of shit.

978
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,393
Yeah, well, I don't know why

979
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,361
you went and put me
on graveyard.

980
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,997
It's bullshit. I've been
working here eight months.

981
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,332
I'm sick of your lip.

982
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,933
Oh, you're sick of <i>my</i> lip?

983
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,769
What about all the nasty talk

984
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,804
I hear coming out <i>your</i> mouth
all fucking day long?!

985
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,139
I'm out of here.

986
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,374
Hey, you leave,
you ain't never coming back,

987
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,243
you do not have a job.
You get it?

988
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,414
You know, I'm wondering
if they got a camera

989
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:47,848
in that walk-in,

990
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,884
taking pictures of you
jerking off,

991
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,719
you nasty man!
All right. That's it.

992
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,055
Off the premises, both of you,
or I'm gonna call the cops!

993
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,724
Get off the premises right now,
or I'll call the cops on you!

994
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,726
Right now!

995
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,127
You should have
woke me up, Rich.

996
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,829
Now look what happened.
I just lost my job.

997
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,130
Wait a minute.
You're saying it's <i>my</i> fault?

998
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,932
I'm just saying you should
have woke me up

999
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,434
when customers come in!

1000
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:08,903
So you're blaming me
for trying to help you

1001
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,438
help our baby be healthy?
Is that it?

1002
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,906
Come on, Mel.

1003
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,841
Sure am blaming you.

1004
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,142
All right.

1005
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,377
It's my job, not yours!

1006
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,878
We'll figure it out, baby.

1007
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,313
I'm gonna take care of you,
all right?

1008
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,715
Yeah.

1009
01:05:37,165 --> 01:05:39,967
You pay for the nights
you stay here, okay?

1010
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,435
There's no credit.

1011
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,505
M-m-my wife, she can maybe help
clean some of the rooms?

1012
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,173
Okay, yeah.

1013
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,142
This is a job
interview now, huh?

1014
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,077
No. I have a maid.
She's very good.

1015
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,113
If you stay in your room
past next week,

1016
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,347
I'm calling the police.

1017
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,382
Hey, hey, Jimmy.

1018
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,752
I got the rent, man.
Where's the other credit card?

1019
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,387
Huh?
Credit card?

1020
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,123
We got rid of them, remember?

1021
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,025
Hey, do you guys want to stay
with me and Kristi?

1022
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,327
No, thanks.

1023
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,763
You can sleep
on the floor, man.

1024
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,097
Richie!

1025
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,401
I think I got something, Rich.

1026
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,804
Aw, shit.

1027
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,474
Hey, Mel?
What?

1028
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,543
Think about it.
It could be a lot worse.

1029
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,812
We could be <i>this</i> guy.
Ha ha.

1030
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,882
Kind of looks like Edwin,
though, don't he?

1031
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,418
That fish is <i>way</i> cuter
than Edwin.

1032
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,788
Yeah.
Trust me.

God damn it!

1034

How many times
do I have to tell you?!

1035

Just go over there and
sit down and be quiet!

alls I had was a hot plate.

1138
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,884
You know what's that?

1139
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:39,419
Yeah, it's like, um,
one of them things,

1140
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,622
like a little table
you plug in, right?

1141
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:43,223
That's right.

1142
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,492
It's what you use to cook
in jail with.

1143
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,828
Can you get some plates, hon?

1144
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,465
I want to check
these tater tots.

1145
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,567
I love tater tots.

1146
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,769
Oh, yeah.
You got to eat the fish, too.

1147
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,838
That's where you get
your protein.

1148
01:12:59,874 --> 01:13:02,342
Rich!

1149
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:05,646
Tell 'em dinner's almost ready.

1150
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,682
Here, you want to flip 'em?

1151
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:09,950
Thank you.

1152
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,685
Be careful.
It's real hot.

1153
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,253
That's it.

1154
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:19,426
I missed you.

1155
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,295

Will you tell 'em?!

1159
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,776
Hey, Mel.
Can I get a beer?

1160
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,711
Nope. There's none left.

1161
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,912
Are you sure?

1162
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,514
Here you go.
Yep.

1163
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,383
Hey, Cody, can you go
run over to the fridge

1164
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,785
and... and check on my beer?

1165
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,222
I don't know why
you don't believe me.

1166
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:49,423
I'll go.

1167
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,624

How come I'm always
the last person

1172
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,668
to know when we got folks
in the house?

1173
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,606
No folks... daughter.

1174
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,474
Him too?

1175
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,410
Ah, leave Richie be.
He'll kill you in your sleep.

God damn.

1177
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,548
Kathleen, I got enough shit
to worry about

1178
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,351
without having a house full
of damn vagrants!

1179
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:18,685
Just wait one minute!

1180
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,354
Wait for what?
You come in here...

1181
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:21,855
I come in here, yeah.

1182
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,490
We have been here
all afternoon cooking!

1183
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:24,992
I don't need all
these people in here!

1184
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,760
You wouldn't believe
the amount of effort

1185
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,495
that went into doing this meal!

1186
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,564
It's mama's whiskey.

1187
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,898
Don't tell her
I swiped some for ya.

1188
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,834
Oh. Thanks, babe.

1189
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,937
Yes, they have to stay!

1190
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,839
There you go, Cody.
Thank you.

1191
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,540
Hey, babe?
What?

1192
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,710
I notice this one needs
a little help with her food.

1193
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,412
That's Chloe.

1194
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,514
I know who Chloe is.

1195
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,982
Chloe, come here.

1196
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,485
You gonna have some fish?

1197
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,819
Come on.
You said you would.

1198
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,056
I done.

1199
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,557
You're all done?

1200
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,293
Well, let's have
a little bit more.

1201
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:02,396
Got to eat something.
Chloe? Come on.

1202
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:07,434
I'm not hungry.

1203
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,069
What?

1204
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,872
Kathleen always tries to get
him to eat <i>our</i> food,

1205
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,407
but he don't ever wanna.

1206
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,509
Well, you want
some more ketchup?

1207
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,444
See, if you put a lot
of ketchup on it,

1208
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,645
you won't taste nothing
but ketchup.

1209
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,946
It's real sweet.

1210
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,549
He should go live
with some Mexicans.

1211
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,919
Just try eating some.

1212
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,921
I'm not hungry.

1213
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,323
Well, all right.

1214
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,892
Go on and put it
in the kitchen yourself.

1215
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,861
Wait.
What's that?

1216
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,965
You got bedbugs here?

1217
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,601
I... I don't know.

1218
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,871
Yep.

1219
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,873
It's bedbugs.

1220
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,876
Look at his legs.
It's on his back, everywhere.

01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,747
Why don't you ask Richie
for help, then?

1297
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:58,752
What kind of man is he?!

1298
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:00,186
He's gone.

1299
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,223
I don't know where he's at,

1300
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:06,059
but I got to get out
of my mama's house.

1301
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,294
And, plus, you owe me.

1302
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:14,334
You are trash!
You know that?!

1303
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:18,271
Ever since you started going
out with that cripple,

1304
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,740
you act all stuck up!

1305
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,109
Real stuck up!

1306
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:26,346
I'm fucking sick of it!

1307
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:30,884
Who the fuck
do you think you are?!

1308
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:34,054
Hi, Kyle.

1309
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,189
Hey, Missy.
What are you doing here?

1310
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,957
Go back to bed!

1311
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:45,131
And you... you get the
fuck out of my house!

1312
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:51,738
I ain't leaving till
you give me some cash.

1313
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,909
Get the fuck out of my house!
Get up!

1314
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,278
Go!
Before it gets worse!

1315
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,346
Get the fuck out of my house!

1316
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,820
Missy! Come back.

1317
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:31,878
I need to know
if you're 100% sure

1318
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,281
you want to terminate
this pregnancy.

1319
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,017
Yes, ma'am.

1320
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:41,421
Do you have a partner?

1321
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,957
No.

1322
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,026
Have you told anyone
about your decision today?

1323
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,165
No.

1324
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,467
You okay with that?

1325
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,402
Mm-hmm.

1326
01:23:22,129 --> 01:23:25,398
Okay.
We're done.

1327
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,970
You did real good.

1328
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,540
Just take a minute, relax.
The nurse will take care of you.

1329
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,341
Thanks.

1330
01:23:44,518 --> 01:23:46,052
Hi, how are you feeling?

1331
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,388
Yeah, they say everything
went really well.

1332
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,057
Um, I just have some more
information for you.

1333
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,525
I need you to, um,

1334
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,861
check your temperature for us
for the next week,

1335
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,263
once in the morning
and once in the evening.

1336
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,098
If it ever gets above 100.4,

1337
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,601
I need you to call us
immediately, okay?

1338
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:04,838
It's really important
to come back in two weeks

1339
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,239
for your pelvic exam.

1340
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:11,311
Okay, now, you've been given
prescription medication...

1341
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,847
Excuse me.
Can... can I get a doughnut?

1342
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:15,315
Oh.

1343
01:24:17,117 --> 01:24:18,418
Thanks.

1344
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,853
Mm-hmm.

1345
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:22,121
Uh, okay.

1346
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,390
You've been given prescription
medication, two types.

1347
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,092
One is to prevent infection,

1348
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:28,628
and the other one encourages
the uterus to contract

1349
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,230
and helps minimize bleeding.

1350
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,232
Um, sometimes...

1351
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:24,183
Put it back.

1352
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,618
Where does this go?

1353
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,153
I know where it goes.

1354
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:28,521
I do too.

1355
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:32,525
Bubba, where does...
does <i>this</i> go?

1356
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,661
Uh, we don't need it.

1357
01:25:37,364 --> 01:25:40,133
Hey, Missy.
Where have you been?

1358
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,303
My car.

1359
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,138
I had a long night.

1360
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,140
I got to get some sleep.

1361
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,975
No. No. No. No.
You can't go back there.

1362
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,678
Tom came in in the middle
of the night last night

1363
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,180
stoned out of his mind.

1364
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,648
And I know.

1365
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,617
He said he was gonna quit, but

1366
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:01,254
Anyway, you wouldn't believe
the night I've had.

1367
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,123
Oh.

1368
01:26:07,561 --> 01:26:10,363
Why the long face, Missy?

1369
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,999
Well, you know, Nora decided

1370
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:17,170
she was gonna have
nightmares all night long.

1371
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,405
And she was crying
and she was yelling.

1372
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:22,275
Then Chloe woke up throwing
up all over the place.

1373
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:25,545
And then you never get Cody up
in time to help with anybody.

1374
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,280
And on top of all that,

1375
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:30,350
I mean, what's going
on with you and Rich?

1376
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,753
I mean, he's been sitting
out there all day long.

1377
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:47,160
I had to do it.

1378
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:53,266
I'm sorry.

1379
01:27:56,437 --> 01:28:00,139
We can't have no baby, Rich.

1380
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:04,844
I knew you were thinking it.

1381
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,750
I knew it.

1382
01:28:16,723 --> 01:28:18,825
What about us?

1383
01:28:33,707 --> 01:28:36,375
I want to be with you.

1384
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:41,614
I still do.

1385
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:49,622
For real?

1386
01:29:14,214 --> 01:29:16,916
Oh, Rich.

1387
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:29,829
You're not mad at me?

1388
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:34,367
No.

1389
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,202
I'm not.

1390
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:50,716
It was hard, Rich.

1391
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:55,655
Yeah.

1392
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:04,830
I ate a whole bag of doughnuts.

1393
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:08,401
That's good.

1394
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,574
That's good.
