1
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:22,430
I'm always included
in everything.

2
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:23,630
My mother says

3
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,830
it's not healthy
to eat so late.

4
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,500
So what do you do?

5
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:31,130
I eat on the card table
in my room with my sister

6
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:34,030
because that's what
children are supposed to do.

7
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:35,900
Says you.

8
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,430
All right, young people

9
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't want to have to
call you children, ok?

10
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,360
So let's start finishing up.
Come on, let's go.

11
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:47,530
Let's gather up
our things, boys.

12
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:51,360
Oh, billy, what a perfectly
wonderful pig.

13
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,930
How did it get
into central park?

14
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,130
Search me.

15
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,730
Let's put it away,
all right?

16
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,600
Eli, let's go over here.

17
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,700
Peter,
let's put our papers away.

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Juju.

19
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:16,230
What's the matter?
Aren't you doing well today?

20
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:21,030
How come?
Those are very strong colors.

21
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,160
I can't draw any people.

22
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,060
I bet you can.

23
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,660
I bet they're
just in their houses

24
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,430
till they're ready
to come out.

25
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:31,200
How about it if tomorrow
I help you bring them out?

26
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,630
Ok.
Ok.

27
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,130
Let's gather up our paints.

28
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,830
All right,
I want everything picked up.

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,660
Let me see
what you did today.

30
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,800
I made a picture of the guy
on the skateboard.

31
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:46,660
And I made my skater fall down
'cause he was showing off

32
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,630
and it made this guy mad,
so he socked him.

33
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,060
And busted his head.

34
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh, he did not.

35
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,660
I want everything picked up.

36
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:05,730
I don't want to see
a paper towel.

37
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,760
I don't want to see
a gum wrapper.

38
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,630
There are plenty of
paper towels for everybody

39
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,660
if you take just one.

40
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:15,900
Jeannie Griffin,
I am talking to you.

41
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:18,730
Willful waste
makes woeful want.

42
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:21,630
Miss penny! Miss penny! Miss
penny! Quiet. Quiet everyone.

43
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:25,330
How can you hear instructions
if you're making such a hubbub?

44
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,800
Quiet! Silence!

45
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,930
Did you hear what I said?
What?

46
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:37,260
I said maybe we ought
to let 'em blow off steam

47
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,530
before we put 'em
back on the bus.

48
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,530
Maybe a game
of follow the leader?

49
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:42,860
Yes, follow the leader.

50
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,430
That would be fine.

51
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,930
Michael.

52
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:50,130
All right, everyone put their
supplies into the big box

53
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,100
and then line up
behind Miss Dorsett

54
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:53,430
for a game
of follow the leader.

55
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,330
No, no. Back this way.

56
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,360
Ok, everybody.

57
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,530
Come on. Peter.

58
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,060
Come on, girls.
Now, let's not shove.

59
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,660
Goodness sakes,
I'll get squashed.

60
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,930
Ok, here we go.
Is everybody ready?

61
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,260
Let's go.

62
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,060
oh, my god, Sybil.

63
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:01,460
For heaven sakes, what
are you doing in the water?

64
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,600
Sybil.

65
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:03,730
What?

66
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,560
You went exactly the opposite
way from fifth avenue.

67
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,260
The bus driver is very angry.

68
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:13,560
Now, come out of the water,
Sybil. We're going to be late.

69
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,000
All right. Now, children,

70
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,960
you form up in a line
right over here.

71
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,760
Quickly, please. Come on.

72
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,460
I couldn't figure
out what happened.

73
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,900
All of a sudden, you were
running in the opposite direction.

74
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,000
I yelled. I hollered.

75
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,460
Oh, Sybil,
look at your shoes.

76
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,500
I-I don't feel very well.
I think I'd like to go home.

77
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,060
Maybe you ought
to see the school nurse.

78
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:43,160
No, I can cope.

79
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,630
Because, Sybil, I don't know
if I can cover for you.

80
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:50,160
I mean, if we're late and
the homeroom teacher asks me.

81
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm sorry. I- I'll
see you tomorrow, all right?

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,960
Sybil.

83
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,460
All right, kids.
Come on, let's go.

84
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,160
Hey, you're gonna turn into a
banana, you keep livin' on fruit.

85
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:25,600
Ha, Mr. Darwin says we're
just a bunch of monkeys anyway.

86
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah, but they eat
lots of protein, too, Sybil.

87
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,560
They eat roots, nuts, bugs.

88
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,300
Oh, I have lots of bugs,
thank you.

89
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,330
How much do I owe you?

90
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,860
That's, uh, one nickel,
half a dime.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,030
I don't think so.

92
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,660
Oh, come on, will you?

93
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,100
If these had
anymore bruises on 'em,

94
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:44,130
I'd have to send 'em
to the hospital.

95
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,260
Go ahead.

96
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you, Mr. Rizo.

97
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,730
Have a good day.

98
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,000
hi, Miss Dorsett.

99
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,230
School let out early?

100
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:08,730
So it seems.

101
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,930
Uh, when did
the piano move in?

102
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,930
Today, 2nd floor, front.

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,800
It's loud, isn't it?

104
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,330
It don't stop
by 10:00 tonight,

105
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,500
they get my foot
through the door.

106
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,460
how could you embarrass me
in front of them all that way?

107
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,160
Get away.

108
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,100
Please, get away.

109
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,500
I will not get away.

110
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,960
I will stand here
till you explain yourself.

111
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,530
I don't even know
what I did. I don't-

112
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,760
don't you plead ignorance
aloud on me.

113
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:27,330
Out, out, out.
I had to get out.

114
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,060
What?

115
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,160
no!

116
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,560
That's not a chord.
This is a chord.

117
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,000
You can't sharp a "g".

118
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,400
What's the matter with you?

119
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,400
I've got more brains
in my little finger

120
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,600
than you've got
in your whole body.

121
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,400
You didn't cut
deep enough, did you?

122
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:16,130
Now, we gotta get you
to the hospital.

123
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,000
I see

124
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,130
one eye

125
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,560
and-and another one

126
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,760
and some glasses

127
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,130
and

128
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,300
some red kind of hair.

129
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:43,260
Mmm-hmm. Now, tell me when
you see my fingers wiggle.

130
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,560
I see- I see a picture frame
and a...

131
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,660
there's a doctor,
a lady, is in it.

132
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, yeah.
You see a circle, right?

133
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:57,500
There's a circle, and it's
dark on the sides of it.

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,100
I see a white coat.
It's a white coat.

135
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,900
What's the matter? Does
my white coat bother you?

136
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,860
I see some fingers wiggling.

137
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
You have a ring.

138
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,700
A married wedding ring.

139
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:25,860
Mmm-hmm.

140
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,900
You have a little girl
all your own?

141
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
No.

142
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,730
You have a little boy?

143
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,100
Mmm-mmm.

144
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:44,000
Is it fun talking like a
little girl, Miss Dorsett?

145
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,130
What?

146
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,860
What just happened? Jetlag?

147
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,460
I cut my wrist.

148
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,260
That's right.

149
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,700
Why, don't you remember?

150
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,730
Yes, of course.

151
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,630
I'm in New York.

152
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:06,030
I'm in a hospital.
Mmm-hmm.

153
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,300
I've cut my wrist.

154
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,730
Mmm-hmm.

155
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:10,260
Am I through? May I go?

156
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:14,630
Well, I'd like to finish
the neurological exam.

157
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,360
Why is there a neurological
exam? I've cut my wrist.

158
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,160
I think you have the
charts mixed up. It's, uh...

159
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,700
no, it just seems

160
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,100
that when the surgical
resident was patching you up

161
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:27,360
he thought you seemed kind of
confused, so he called me in.

162
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:29,030
Don't you remember?

163
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,660
And I asked you how I could
help you, and you took my hand.

164
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,460
You came right on in here.

165
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,430
Don't you want to stay?

166
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,930
Come on.
Let's finish it up, ok?

167
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,560
Here.

168
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:51,360
Tell me what you smell
in these little bottles.

169
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,500
Cloves.

170
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,730
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,400
I...

172
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,760
I know I should
smell something-

173
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,730
no, you shouldn't.
It's water.

174
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh! Disinfectant.

175
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,830
It's all right.

176
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:17,030
What's the matter? You smell
something like that before?

177
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
Yes.

178
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,330
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,330
You asked me something?

180
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,660
No, you were just telling me
about your symptoms.

181
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,930
Your, uh, tunnel vision and
your bumping into walls and...

182
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,230
yes. Yes, I know.

183
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:54,730
Sometimes, when I'm heading
for the door, by mistake, uh...

184
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,860
what is it?

185
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,760
This is your office?

186
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:06,930
Yes.

187
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,330
No!
Without looking at your watch,

188
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,260
tell me what you just said.

189
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
Is it so important?

190
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,830
Yes.

191
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I said,

192
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,600
"is this your office?"

193
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,430
That was a half an hour ago.
It's nighttime now.

194
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,800
I didn't...

195
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,130
I didn't want you to know.

196
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,200
Yes, you did.

197
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Nobody knows.

198
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,560
Somebody knows now.

199
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,300
All right?
Do you remember anything?

200
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:14,500
Do you remember
the vocabulary test

201
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:16,760
or saying the numbers
backwards or any of that?

202
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,330
No, I don't. I don't.

203
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,800
None of it?
No.

204
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:21,760
You don't know whether
you've been here for an hour

205
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,900
or a day or a week, do you?

206
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
I don't think
it's been a week.

207
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,730
Has it been a day?
No.

208
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,560
I cut my wrist.

209
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:35,700
Mmm-hmm.

210
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,830
And I don't know how.

211
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:43,230
And then I was here,
talking to you.

212
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,600
Mmm-hmm.

213
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,400
Have I hurt somebody?

214
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,830
Have I done something bad?
No.

215
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,800
No, of course not.

216
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,200
Have you always
lost time like that?

217
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm so awfully
ashamed, doctor.

218
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:12,300
It's all right.

219
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,300
I've always been like this.

220
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,660
Always.

221
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,830
And I used to think
that everybody was like this.

222
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:24,560
That they would just naturally
wake up and be someplace else

223
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,500
or a whole lot older
or wearing another dress.

224
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,160
Once, I woke up,

225
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,300
and I was 2 years older.

226
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,030
And...

227
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:39,830
it was very hard for me
to get through college.

228
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:42,200
I want very much
to be a teacher.

229
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:44,830
I wanna give
something to somebody.

230
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,430
You understand that?

231
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,000
Sure.

232
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,060
I substitute teach

233
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:59,330
because I'm gonna get
my m.a. In art.

234
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
It's in art.

235
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,360
It never happened before
in front of the children

236
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:25,860
but things have been getting
a lot worse lately.

237
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,760
I can't do anything.

238
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,560
I can't study.

239
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
And then,

240
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,560
I woke up,
and I was in the water.

241
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,230
And the children saw me.

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,230
Sybil.

243
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:01,300
Please don't touch me.
It hurts me.

244
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,130
It hurts to be touched?

245
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,200
Here, have a crying towel.

246
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
No, thank you.
I don't cry tears like people.

247
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:17,200
You must have cried like
people once upon a time.

248
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,600
Here. Sybil, come on,
sit down.

249
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,960
You know,

250
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,800
I think the fear
that you're suffering from

251
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,400
is very, very deep.

252
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,360
And I think
your-your symptoms,

253
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,030
your-your tunnel vision
and your blackouts

254
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:41,400
are a result of that fear.

255
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,330
It's a kind of hysteria.

256
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,500
You see?

257
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,260
Yes.

258
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,760
You understand,
if you are-are

259
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,030
too scared to face something,

260
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,230
then it just makes perfectly
good sense to blackout

261
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,600
and then you never have to
know what you're scared of.

262
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,330
Nothing scares me.

263
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,100
Listen, would you like to
come back and see me again

264
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,160
on, um, thursday?

265
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:15,600
Uh, my name is Dr. Wilbur
by the way.

266
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,460
Is it expensive?

267
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,060
No, not in the clinic.

268
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:21,860
I think you can afford it.

269
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,830
I have to ask my father.

270
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,230
He's here on his honeymoon.

271
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,730
My mother died a while back.
He remarried.

272
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,860
Have to show him
the sights tomorrow.

273
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:42,130
If you can call

274
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:45,230
lunching at the museum
cafeteria the sights.

275
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:49,130
Well, I must say this is
sure a delightful notion.

276
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:53,530
Eating by a real roman pool
in the middle of New York city.

277
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,200
I better not say
"roman" out loud.

278
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:58,630
The pope might
jump out and eat dad.

279
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,300
Now, you quit that.

280
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,130
Well,
what's the native custom?

281
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,230
Do we stack our trays
or eat right off 'em?

282
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:07,660
Well, I'm setting
my place proper.

283
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:09,460
Wait, willard,

284
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:12,030
till I slide a napkin
under your plate.

285
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
There, now,
isn't that more homey?

286
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:17,460
Here, you see
how she babies me?

287
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,930
Well, he is a baby.

288
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,800
Just a big, strong,
sweet old baby.

289
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,860
But he's just what
the doctor ordered.

290
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:27,600
Aren't you, lovey?

291
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,900
How do you
like Chicago, dad?

292
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:36,960
Oh, fine.
Um, plenty to do.

293
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,430
Oh, my spaghetti
looks yummy.

294
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:42,600
Nice and crusty
and tomatoey.

295
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,760
What did you take, Sybil?

296
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,360
Just chicken salad?

297
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:48,760
No, it's tuna.
Oh.

298
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,030
That's a puny kind of lunch
for a growing girl.

299
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,060
I don't want you
to skimp on your food.

300
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:55,360
Well, I stopped growing
a long time ago, dad.

301
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,360
It's fine,
a gracious sufficiency.

302
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,930
Thank you.

303
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:01,300
We, uh, thank thee lord

304
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,800
for all thy bountiful
blessings. Amen.

305
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,100
Amen.
Amen.

306
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:09,060
But, oh, the prices
of everything here.

307
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:11,930
I nearly die every time
a waiter brings the check.

308
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,160
That's what you get
for looking, huh?

309
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,630
Of course, things
are dear in Chicago, too.

310
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,800
It's hard to make ends meet.
Hmm.

311
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,530
When we lived
in Willow Corners,

312
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,500
you could eat
a meal like this.

313
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:26,760
Oh, I used to get
your mother to...

314
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,060
God rest her soul.

315
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:31,230
To go down to
the green-green comet cafe

316
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:34,660
and ordered a whole
covered dinner on a sabbath

317
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:36,430
so she wouldn't have to cook.
Yes.

318
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:39,560
And why,
what with the roasted chicken

319
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:43,100
and yellow gravy and the
fixings it didn't come to $1.50.

320
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:44,830
Dad,

321
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:48,100
l- I have an illness.

322
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:52,060
It's what you and mother
called my moodiness.

323
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:54,060
And it's getting
worse and worse.

324
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:56,460
It will be
the end of everything

325
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,300
unless I can do
something about it.

326
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:01,530
I'm sorry to bring you
in on this, frieda,

327
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:03,700
but you're not blood family

328
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,400
and I don't seem
to be able to get dad alone.

329
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:10,460
Well, uh, I feel like family.

330
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:11,630
Goodness.

331
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,700
Dad, there's a lady,

332
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:20,600
a doctor,

333
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:23,900
and l- I've talked to her.

334
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:26,730
She can help me
in the pursuit of me

335
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:29,100
and she thinks that
that's a useful pursuit.

336
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:30,930
Willard, you said yourself

337
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:33,560
we have a perfectly
good spare room

338
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,360
and all her things would fit
in there just perfect.

339
00:25:36,395 --> 00:25:39,860
Nothing will fit perfect
anywhere until I fit perfect.

340
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,130
I'm going to the restroom.

342
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't want it said
that I influenced anything.

343
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,460
Between a rock
and a hard place, Sybil.

344
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:07,930
I mean, you know
how the church views

345
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,500
the practitioners
of the mind.

346
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm very frugal.

347
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,400
If I give up
my luxuries, television,

348
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,260
and I don't read after sunset

349
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:19,460
and i
- and I use the stove only occasionally to cook 3 days at a time,

350
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,400
I could- I could get by
on what you send me.

351
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:25,730
The devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape.

352
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,130
She's not the devil, dad.
Now, l-I know that.

353
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:29,700
I don't know that about anyone

354
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,230
except the people
in our own congregation.

355
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:32,660
She's a reputable doctor.

356
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:33,930
First thing
you know it's drugs,

357
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,900
then a hospital
full of lost souls.

358
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:38,200
That's the way they
begin it, Sybil. Oh, lord,

359
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:39,400
I think I'm trapped.

360
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:42,430
The final preparation
for the holocaust.

361
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,930
It's armageddon, Sybil.

362
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:46,830
"And it shall rise up
in the east

363
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:49,100
and the rivers
shall flow as blood."

364
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,060
Sybil!

365
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,060
I'm sorry. Oh, dad,

366
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm-I'm sorry.

367
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,030
I can pay for it. It-it-it
surely is-is about $2.

368
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:10,760
What is the matter with you?

369
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,630
Sybil. Sybil.

370
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:24,400
Sybil! Sybil!

371
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,900
Sybil!

372
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Now, tell me when you see
my fingers wiggle.

373
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,900
The devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape.

374
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,860
I've cut my wrist.

375
00:30:06,895 --> 00:30:08,930
You know how our church feels

376
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:11,160
about the practitioners
of the mind.

377
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,430
What's the matter?
My white coat bother you?

378
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,830
Always. Always.
I was always like this.

379
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,830
First thing
you know it's drugs,

380
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,260
then a hospital
full of lost souls.

381
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,960
It's all right.
It's just disinfectant.

382
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:42,560
The final preparation
for the holocaust,

383
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:45,030
the armageddon, Sybil.

384
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:46,700
I always thought

385
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,400
that people would just
naturally be someplace else

386
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:51,560
or wearing another dress
or be a whole lot older,

387
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:54,360
like when I was in the 3rd
grade and my grandmother died

388
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,400
and-and I wasn't anyplace
for 2 years.

389
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:58,830
I just wasn't anyplace,
not anyplace at all.

390
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,830
Would you like to come back
and see me on thursday?

391
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,600
What is the matter with-

392
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,400
it's all right. I've got it.

393
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah.

394
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,330
Who?

395
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,660
Vicky who?

396
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,200
It better be an emergency for
"just Vicky" at 3:00 in the morning.

397
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,200
Ok, put her on.

398
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,960
Dr. Wilbur?

399
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,730
Yeah.

400
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:40,260
That window is beginning
to look awfully good to Sybil.

401
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,430
What window? Who are you?

402
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:45,830
I'm Sybil's friend.

403
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,860
It's very high, Dr. Wilbur.

404
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,400
It's up 4 floors.

405
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:52,630
You'd better come quick
to the staton hotel-

406
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:54,900
hold on a second.
Hold on, ok?

407
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,160
Staton hotel-

408
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:01,300
hold on. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Hold on. Yeah.

409
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,660
All right,
it's the staton hotel,

410
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:07,360
136 west 125th street.

411
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:09,100
Opposite the roslyn.

412
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,130
Ok.

413
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:13,060
What is she doing in harlem?

414
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,060
Vicky?

415
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,860
Leave me alone.

416
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,600
Vicky, let me in.
It's Dr. Wilbur.

417
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,860
Thank you.

418
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,730
Sybil?

419
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, no.

420
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,560
I didn't want to do this
in front of you again.

421
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,230
It's all right.
It's all right.

422
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,530
Listen, would you
just wait downstairs, ok?

423
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,700
Where is this?

424
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,930
Have I missed thursday?
Did I miss thursday?

425
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:26,730
That's all right.

426
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:28,460
Where's your friend Vicky?

427
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:30,360
I don't have a friend Vicky.

428
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,030
She has a friend Sybil.

429
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,600
What kicked it off this time?

430
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,500
I lost my job.

431
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:43,800
And l-I tried to ask...

432
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,230
my... my...

433
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:50,630
yeah? You asked your father
about seeing me.

434
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:52,630
What happened?
What did he say?

435
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,830
Sybil?

436
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,730
The people. The people.
The people.

437
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:05,430
The people,
they're everywhere.

438
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:07,630
There, there, there.
They're everywhere.

439
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,560
No, you keep them
away from me.

440
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:12,530
I will, I will,
I will do it. I will do it.

441
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:16,860
He doesn't care.
He doesn't care.

442
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,500
Sybil.

443
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:22,100
I hate Sybil. I hate her.

444
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:23,300
Who are you?

445
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:24,530
I can do anything.

446
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,360
I can do anything I want to.

447
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:27,760
I can do anything.

448
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:30,330
I can walk on the furniture
if I take my shoes off

449
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:32,530
like that and like that
and like that.

450
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:35,500
And I can walk on the chair like
that and like that and like that.

451
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:38,430
And you can't stop me. I promise
you, Sybil, I wouldn't stop you.

452
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,530
You can't stop me. I won't
stop you. It's all right.

453
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,030
It's all right.
It's all right.

454
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,360
It hurts me!

455
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,530
What hurts? What hurts you?
Where does it hurt?

456
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,130
I have to get out.
I have to get out.

457
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,330
No, wait!

458
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:49,930
I have to break the glass.
No, no, no, no.

459
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,530
No, we don't-don't
break glass.

460
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,500
You won't let me out, and you
won't let me have any peace

461
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:55,900
and you leave me alone
and it hurts,

462
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,230
and you don't
leave me alone, it hurts.

463
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:59,630
Who are you talking to?
Who am i?

464
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:02,400
Who hurt you? Oh, please,
I have to get out. Get out.

465
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,360
I have to get out. We'll just go
downstairs, we'll get in the taxi

466
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,030
and then you'll be out, all
right? No, no, no, she's there.

467
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,660
When she's there,
the people are there.

468
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,700
Who's there? Who is there? The
people. I don't wanna see them.

469
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,600
I don't wanna feel them.
Where is Sybil?

470
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:15,030
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

471
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:16,630
Where is Sybil? Tell me.
I have to get out.

472
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:17,960
I have to feel the glass.

473
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,560
I have to feel the glass.
No, no. No,

474
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:20,930
no. No, no.

475
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:23,300
I have to feel the-
don't break it.

476
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,530
I see the knob.

477
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,800
I see the knob
on the white house.

478
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,830
On the white house,
I see the knob.

479
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:32,530
And the shades
are pulled down.

480
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:35,130
I live right there.
I live right there.

481
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,800
Right there.
201 west 4th street.

482
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,600
Willow Corners, Wisconsin.

483
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:42,360
I live right there.
Right there. Right there.

484
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,300
That's harlem.

485
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,430
I don't know
where the other glass is.

486
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:49,430
It's in Dr. Quinoness'
instrument case,

487
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,330
and it's all white
and shiny knives.

488
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:52,800
And my momma says,
"I will take you

489
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,500
"to play with monica
and cheryl

490
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:56,260
"because you like monica
and cheryl."

491
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:58,000
And my grandma says...
my grandma says...

492
00:35:58,035 --> 00:36:00,300
my grandma says, "you-you
go like momma says."

493
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:02,100
My grandma's good.
She's good.

494
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,560
She loves me.
She loves me.

495
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm afraid! I'm afraid!

496
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,430
There's nothing
to be afraid of here.

497
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,000
They never forget anything,

498
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:29,300
and they listen
to every sound.

499
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,200
And they're everywhere,
and they're everywhere.

500
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,830
They're in this room
and that room

501
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:34,630
and everywhere you look,
and everywhere you look,

502
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:35,760
who?
And everywhere-

503
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:38,730
the people.
The people. No! No!

504
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:40,200
No, don't make me go there.

505
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:41,900
I don't wanna go
up there, please.

506
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,360
Please don't make me
go up there.

507
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,400
I won't go up there. Please.

508
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,700
Please don't make me
go up there.

509
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,230
Go where? Go where?
Please.

510
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:51,200
It's not happening now.
Please.

511
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:54,560
It's not happening now.
Please don't do this.

512
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:55,860
Well, here we are.

513
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:57,800
Oh, look, who else got here.

514
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:00,660
Daddy'll take you upstairs,
won't you, daddy?

515
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,460
Where's cheryl and monica?
They'll be here later, Sybil.

516
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,300
Your mommy'll bring you some
ice cream, won't you, mommy?

517
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:07,200
You're just going upstairs
for a little nap.

518
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:09,300
What kind do you like? You
can have any kind you like.

519
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:10,700
Now, hush now.
Double, double.

520
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:13,400
Easy does it. Double dip.
That's it. That's it.

521
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:14,660
Come along.

522
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:15,960
No!

523
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,560
No!

524
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,430
No! No!

525
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,060
No!

526
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,160
No!

527
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:25,730
Now, now, big breath,

528
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,200
big deep breath.
No!

529
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:30,930
Now, I can't do anything
if you're gonna to fight me.

530
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:32,800
No!

531
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:37,500
All right,
there's plenty of air.

532
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,160
Now, there just seemed
to be no air

533
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:41,460
because you were breathing
air mixed with ether.

534
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:45,300
They have to use 2 cans of
ether to take her tonsils out

535
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:48,360
because she's a real
strong little girl.

536
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,830
Right, right,
and a mad little girl, too.

537
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:52,600
They lied to you,
didn't they?

538
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,860
Yeah, they got you there
under false pretenses.

539
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,830
They're gonna kill her.

540
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:00,560
That's what they're gonna do.

541
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:03,430
No, they're not
going to kill you.

542
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:07,030
And why do you keep referring to
yourself in the third person, hmm?

543
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,360
Because she's Sybil.

544
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:12,100
But my throat hurts, too.

545
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,200
And who are you, sweetie?

546
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:17,200
Will you tell
Dr. Wilbur now?

547
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,700
Dr. Wilbur's too far away.

548
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:24,260
No, no.
Dr. Wilbur's right here.

549
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:26,430
Dr. Wilbur just seemed
very far away

550
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,330
because all good
and safe things

551
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:32,060
must have seemed
very, very far away.

552
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,260
Dr. Wilbur, a white coat?

553
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:39,200
That's right,
but I'm not wearing it now.

554
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,460
Hi. Everything's ok now.

555
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:48,930
You just try
and get some sleep, ok?

556
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:51,460
I wanna be your little girl.

557
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,460
Please, take me to your house.

558
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:57,900
Oh, honey, your mommy and
daddy love you very much.

559
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,530
They'd miss you.

560
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:01,900
Just try
and get some sleep, ok?

561
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:04,830
You take me, please.

562
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:08,600
Honey. Honey, please,
just-just try to sleep, ok?

563
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,700
Hello.
Here's your mommy, Sybil.

564
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:12,900
Everything's all right now.
Hello.

565
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,200
How's my little girl?

566
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,860
Look what I brought you,
Sybil.

567
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,800
Sybil?

568
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,560
Sybil.

569
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,100
Sybil.

570
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,300
Don't you turn
your back on me.

571
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm talking to you.

572
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:31,630
Sybil. Sybil.

573
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,130
You're...
no cuts. No bruises.

574
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:42,960
I busted it all to pieces.
You're all in one piece.

575
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:45,730
It's all right. It's all right.
It's easier to fix windows

576
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,300
than little girls.

577
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,500
Little girls are more
important than windows?

578
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,100
This little girl
certainly is. Sure.

579
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,500
I got something to tell you.

580
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,330
It's about Sybil.

581
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,700
She puts guck
all over her hair

582
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:13,460
'cause she has gray hair.

583
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:17,060
I don't. I'm natural.

584
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,430
You like the way I look?

585
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,530
I have a real pretty face.

586
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:25,330
See me in the mirror?
And a little nose

587
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,960
and all my freckles
and my bangs.

588
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:30,300
I'm only 9.

589
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,130
Do you believe me?

590
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:33,760
Yes, I believe you.

591
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,360
My name's Peggy,

592
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,300
and you're my Dr. Wilbur.

593
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Tell me about your patient.

594
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:59,100
You think she's really
a multiple personality?

595
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:00,460
Erna, I know she is.

596
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:03,200
I've-I've met
one alternate, I know.

597
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:05,400
And I've talked to
another one on the telephone.

598
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:08,830
Such a compliment that they should
reveal themselves so quickly.

599
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:11,900
Erna, the-the waking self,

600
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:13,260
the Sybil part,

601
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:17,160
is very repressed
and-and-and very troubled.

602
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:19,260
A grim-grim person,

603
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:21,400
but the-the other one,

604
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,930
the-the little Peggy,
is just enchanting.

605
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,160
She's-she's, uh,

606
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:28,100
she's just adrift in time.

607
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:29,900
She doesn't know
that she's in New York

608
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:33,830
and she's-she's absolutely full
of misconceptions about everything.

609
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:35,300
How are you
going to treat her?

610
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,430
Psychoanalysis.

611
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:37,500
Which one?

612
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:38,630
All 3.

613
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,200
That's unprecedented.

614
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:41,860
Why are you
the big pioneer?

615
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:43,930
Well, why did you
teach me to be?

616
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:46,600
Be careful.

617
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,500
Connie, be careful.

618
00:41:49,535 --> 00:41:52,130
Don't fall in love
with her illness.

619
00:41:52,165 --> 00:41:54,660
Or she could be obligated

620
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:57,800
to seem just more complex
than she is

621
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,500
just to keep your approval.

622
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:02,830
You know,
they are not little girls.

623
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:05,900
They're defenses
that belong to somebody else,

624
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,060
pieces, fragments,
only illusions.

625
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,900
And they are acting out
a drama

626
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:13,460
that has nothing
to do with you.

627
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:15,100
Well, I know that.

628
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:18,600
So you mustn't act out one that
has nothing to do with them.

629
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:19,900
Oh, for instance?

630
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:21,660
For instance,

631
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,600
you are not their mother.

632
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,760
It wasn't easy to heed
my friend's warning.

633
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:34,760
Every time Peggy leaves my
office to disappear into the city,

634
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:37,960
I have the most awful urge
to call her back

635
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:41,100
because I know that New York
doesn't exist for her.

636
00:42:41,135 --> 00:42:46,130
She lives in the small midwestern
town of her memory 20 years ago

637
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:50,860
where there weren't any taxis or
buses or strangers to harm her.

638
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,700
And whenever
the city swallows her up,

639
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:55,000
I wonder if I'll ever
see her again

640
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:59,700
until, by some miracle, she
or Sybil appear on my doorstep.

641
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:02,760
I wonder what she does
and how she lives

642
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,100
or who she sees.

643
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:08,560
hush-a-bye

644
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:12,630
don't you cry

645
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:15,330
go to sleep-y

646
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:19,700
little baby

647
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:23,060
when you wake

648
00:43:23,095 --> 00:43:26,730
you will have

649
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:31,360
all the pretty
little ponies

650
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,900
blacks and bays

651
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:39,100
dapples and grays

652
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,560
coach

653
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:45,730
and 6 a-little horses

654
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,500
hush-a-bye

655
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:53,360
don't you cry

656
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,530
go to sleep-y

657
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:01,030
little baby

658
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
hey, Sybil Dorsett!

659
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,930
Wanna pet my horse?

660
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:33,460
Come on, ma'am. Now, have
no fear or trepidation.

661
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:35,200
We've fallen on hard times,
him and me,

662
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:37,360
since we were the finest
roping team in all the west

663
00:44:37,395 --> 00:44:39,960
and it kind of looks like it's
gonna be the dog-food factory

664
00:44:39,995 --> 00:44:43,630
unless some kind soul believes
in us enough to take a ride.

665
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,860
How about you?

666
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,360
Would you take
your hat off for a second?

667
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:53,030
Think you've seen me
in the pictures?

668
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,930
Oh.

669
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,930
I didn't know you did this.

670
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,360
I knew you did that.

671
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:07,560
What?

672
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:11,260
Paint. That's an art book,
isn't it?

673
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,100
"Turner." yeah, I knew
you were an artist.

674
00:45:14,135 --> 00:45:16,200
I've seen you painting
in the middle of the night.

675
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,860
I don't do that. I haven't
painted in a long time.

676
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,630
Yeah, you do. I watch you.

677
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:24,000
From window to window,
right across our backyards.

678
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:26,860
Each window a stage
in this theater of the absurd

679
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:28,960
which we call life.

680
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,530
You never have company.

681
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:34,400
You eat by yourself.

682
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,630
You still play with dolls.

683
00:45:36,665 --> 00:45:38,860
And you watch me, too.

684
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:41,030
I've seen you over there
with the lights out

685
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:45,060
seething with passion
on those hot summer nights.

686
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:47,500
I don't happen
to be seething with anything.

687
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:49,530
I'm just trying to keep
my electrical bill down.

688
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:50,730
I have to go.

689
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:53,730
Well, wait.
Why?

690
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:57,400
Say, "w-a-t-e-r," and I'll
tell you where you come from.

691
00:45:57,435 --> 00:45:58,930
Do I have to?

692
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,700
You want your book back?

693
00:46:03,035 --> 00:46:04,560
Water.

694
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,260
Illinois. Iowa.

695
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:10,760
It's Wisconsin.
I really have to go.

696
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:13,760
Oh, come on, Sybil. Get in,
I'll give you a free ride.

697
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

698
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:16,630
Well.

699
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:18,760
Well, that's the 2nd time
you've said it,

700
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:20,130
so I guess
you want me to ask.

701
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:22,500
How do you know my name?

702
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,360
My little boy Matthew
is in love with you,

703
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,860
and he wanted
to write you a letter.

704
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:27,230
So I walked around the corner,

705
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:28,760
looked at all the names
on the bells

706
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:30,460
and you're
the only single on 5.

707
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:32,260
I never got a letter.

708
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,800
No, we never sent it.

709
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:36,000
We both forgot
he hasn't learned to write.

710
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,530
Look, I got
an italian sausage sandwich.

711
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,660
It's really too big for me,
and he won't even touch it.

712
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Who are you?

713
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:50,900
I haven't got a clue

714
00:46:50,935 --> 00:46:53,630
but it's called
Richard J. Loomis.

715
00:46:53,665 --> 00:46:56,830
And just like my horse here,
I cannot inflict harm.

716
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,160
Oh.

717
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,000
Hey, you're a linguist.

718
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,500
I only know pig latin.

719
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:18,760
Yes, I was bilingual
as a child. French.

720
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,730
That's all I remember, and I'm
sorry to say it's all wrong.

721
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:23,660
Raised in paris.
Come on, pony.

722
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:25,030
Paris? Ooh-la-la!

723
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:26,660
Yes.

724
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:27,860
C'est bien.

725
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:29,560
We played hopscotch
in the bois.

726
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:31,330
We had cafe au lait
for breakfast

727
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:32,930
and porridge,
if you can believe it.

728
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,530
Of course, we had
an english nanny.

729
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:36,860
Yeah?
Yes.

730
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,030
Did she say, "bois," too?

731
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,660
You got me there.

732
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,930
Hello...

733
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,460
oh, oh, what's your name?

734
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:23,060
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't recognize my voice.

735
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:26,300
I'm Vicky.
Victoria, Sybil's friend.

736
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:28,700
Victoria antoinette scharleau.

737
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:30,060
Allo. Allo.
Hello.

738
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:31,730
Good to see you.

739
00:48:31,765 --> 00:48:33,160
Allo a vous, too.

740
00:48:33,195 --> 00:48:34,660
Well.

741
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,260
Well, come.
Come, right in.

742
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:37,800
Merci. Merci.

743
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,800
Oh!

744
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:43,430
Quel jolI bureau!

745
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,730
Oh, thank you.

746
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:46,800
Um...

747
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,530
asseyez-vous.

748
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:52,300
Ou? Sur this couch

749
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:54,160
ou sur that couch?

750
00:48:54,195 --> 00:48:55,930
Comme vous voulez.

751
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,330
Je choose this couch.

752
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,600
I don't blame you
for not remembering.

753
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:09,030
It was months and months ago
since I called you

754
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:11,260
from that dreary
little harlem hotel.

755
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:12,730
Mmm-hmm.

756
00:49:12,765 --> 00:49:14,260
Well, tell me, um,

757
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,500
where's Sybil?

758
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,200
Sybil is a bit embarrassed

759
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:25,860
about the financial
arrangements.

760
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:30,360
Since you've been seeing her
in your practice privee,

761
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:33,360
she doesn't know
how she will ever repay you.

762
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
She'll repay me when
she gets herself together

763
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:41,400
if you'll excuse the pun.

764
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,730
Yes?

765
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,500
Dr. Wilbur,
mmm-hmm.

766
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,430
Peggy is very worried.

767
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:59,230
She thinks that perhaps you
think she wants to hurt you

768
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:00,730
because she breaks
the windows.

769
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,200
Well, I don't.

770
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:04,200
No, she wouldn't hurt anyone.

771
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,400
She'd been so hurt herself.

772
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,730
I wouldn't hurt anyone either,
not by word nor deed.

773
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:15,130
I don't even like to hurt
someone's feelings.

774
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:16,800
Do you know?

775
00:50:16,835 --> 00:50:20,830
If someone calls me Sybil by
mistake, do you know what I do?

776
00:50:20,865 --> 00:50:23,630
I look in their face
and I say, "yes. Yes."

777
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:27,230
Or, "oui. Oui.
You're speaking to me?"

778
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:30,400
Because it hurts to be
embarrassed, do you know?

779
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,530
Mmm-hmm.

780
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:40,260
Sybil is such
a lamentable creature.

781
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:41,700
Why do you say that?

782
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:43,530
She can't do anything.

783
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:46,200
She starts to paint,
she can't paint.

784
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:48,960
She wants to play the piano,
she can't play the piano.

785
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,230
She won't have fun.

786
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:53,000
The woman refuses to have fun.

787
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:55,460
She's afraid of people,
you know.

788
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,430
I'm not. No.

789
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,230
I simply adore people.

790
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,300
Do you know,

791
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:07,830
the other day, she wanted
to take a ride in the park

792
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,630
with that attractive
young man, uh, Richard Loomis

793
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:13,000
who lives across the yard?

794
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,430
She was afraid
to take his hand.

795
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,330
She's afraid of hands.
So is Peggy.

796
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,600
I had to go.

797
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,200
I'm not afraid of hands.

798
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:27,800
I'm not afraid of anything.
No, sir.

799
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,860
Whose hands are Sybil
and Peggy afraid of?

800
00:51:32,895 --> 00:51:34,800
Don't you dare tell.

801
00:51:34,835 --> 00:51:38,260
Next worse thing to being a
fibber is being a talebearer.

802
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:42,230
You tell, and I'll fix it so you
ain't got nothing to tell with.

803
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,400
Vicky,
did your mother ever hit you?

804
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,630
Oh.

805
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,130
Mine? No.

806
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:56,700
My mother
is an absolute angel.

807
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:58,330
She lives in paris,
you know.

808
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,030
She'll be coming for me soon.

809
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:02,230
We'll be together,
all my brothers and-

810
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:04,560
is Sybil's mother
not an angel?

811
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,730
Do you like my hair?

812
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:11,700
It's called a french twist.
I do it myself.

813
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,800
I look a great deal
older than 13, don't i?

814
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,830
That's because european
children mature so much sooner.

815
00:52:21,865 --> 00:52:26,730
But I'm so thin.
This suit just hangs on me.

816
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,900
Maybe Sybil
isn't feeding you enough.

817
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:31,900
I never complain exactly.

818
00:52:31,935 --> 00:52:33,760
But all she eats
is rotten fruit.

819
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:36,460
That's all she's eaten
all month long.

820
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:38,500
Her daddy forgets
to send her the check.

821
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,760
Lots of times, her daddy
forgets to send a check

822
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:42,500
and that makes Peggy
very, very mad,

823
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:43,960
and she barges into the stores

824
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:47,830
and smashes all the crystal,
and Sybil has to pay for it.

825
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,430
But I don't care.

826
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,030
Did you have breakfast
this morning, hmm?

827
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,460
Sweetie, are you hungry?

828
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:02,160
If I stand very, very erect

829
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,800
with a certain air of dignity

830
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:07,500
you can't tell
how thin I am, can you?

831
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,900
Come on. I'm gonna
make you a sandwich.

832
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,730
I see the wheels
going round and round.

833
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:17,100
Why do they do that?

834
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:18,960
Why do they go round and round against me?

835
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,930
They're not going around
against you.

836
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,160
They're just
making a recording.

837
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:26,960
Remember Peggy said
I could when she was here?

838
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,560
Yes, I know,
to help Sybil.

839
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:30,330
Mmm-hmm.

840
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:33,060
Because she seems to have so much
more information than Sybil does.

841
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:34,960
Oh, I have more.

842
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:37,460
I have more than Peggy.
I have more than anybody.

843
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:38,900
I know everything.

844
00:53:38,935 --> 00:53:42,160
Every thought she thinks,
everything she does, I remember.

845
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:44,600
She can't remember.

846
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:47,630
She mustn't remember.

847
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:49,800
That's why it's very,
very important

848
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:51,900
that you don't tell her
about us.

849
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,560
It would be too big
a shock for her.

850
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:55,760
She's not ready to take it.

851
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,460
Here.

852
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,930
I have a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich for you and some banana bread

853
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:08,160
and a big glass of milk.

854
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:11,360
Now, I want to see you just
eat and eat and eat, all right?

855
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,600
Thank you.

856
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:14,060
Mmm-hmm.

857
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:15,560
Milk is good
for growing girls.

858
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:17,100
That's right.

859
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,560
Lots of mummies
aren't like you.

860
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:22,630
Lots of mummies
are real tricky.

861
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,000
Vicky,

862
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,660
do you remember
Sybil's tonsillectomy, hmm?

863
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:37,600
I saw. I was there.

864
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:40,730
It made, uh, Sybil's
throat hurt, didn't it?

865
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:42,130
Yes, very much.

866
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:44,300
Mmm, hurt so bad she had to
whisper and she couldn't talk.

867
00:54:44,335 --> 00:54:47,300
Talked like this
all the time.

868
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:50,130
Funny thing is, it made
Peggy's throat hurt, too.

869
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,230
Now how come
both their throats hurt

870
00:54:52,265 --> 00:54:54,560
if, if all of you are
different people?

871
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,300
Vicky?
I know. I'm thinking.

872
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,660
Don't I have
lovely table manners?

873
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:06,930
Notice how delicate
my hands are.

874
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:09,130
The pinkies,
it's called continental.

875
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:11,160
Hmm, yes, it's lovely.

876
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:14,960
Tell me, are you related
in some way, all of you?

877
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:18,160
I know where I am. I'm in new
york. Lots to do in New York.

878
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:19,700
Museums to go to,
concerts-

879
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:21,400
do you think that
Sybil and Peggy

880
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:24,130
share the same mother
and father?

881
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:26,200
Now how are they related?

882
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,000
Hmm?

883
00:55:28,035 --> 00:55:29,960
Are they sisters?

884
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:32,700
Or are you all parts
of the same person?

885
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:35,000
Don't be silly.
It can't be that.

886
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,800
No, it can be that.

887
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:40,130
You can all be aspects
of the same person.

888
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:41,700
All pieces of Sybil.

889
00:55:41,735 --> 00:55:43,560
No, no.

890
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:46,030
We're all people.
You can see us.

891
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,100
Look around.

892
00:55:49,135 --> 00:55:51,560
There's nobody else here,
just you and me

893
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,760
and the sink
and the dishes and the door.

894
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:55,560
Nobody else here.

895
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,930
Do you believe me?

896
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,060
Sweetie,
I believe that you believe.

897
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,730
Come on,
you have your sandwich.

898
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,730
Questions, questions,
questions. My goodness, so many.

899
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:16,100
Look, you even have questions
in your eyes right this minute.

900
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,100
I'd like to ask you
a question.

901
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:22,900
Ask me.

902
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,130
What's love?

903
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,730
Sweetie, don't you know?

904
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:29,000
No, I don't.

905
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,030
Please tell. We all
want to know, all of us.

906
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,800
Who's all of us?

907
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,230
Everybody
that lives with Sybil.

908
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:46,430
Who are the others, Vicky?

909
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:50,330
Are there more besides you
and-and-and Sybil and Peggy?

910
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,200
Vicky?

911
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:54,430
I hear you.

912
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:56,460
Are you seeing them now?

913
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,500
Yes.

914
00:56:59,535 --> 00:57:02,030
I don't want to,
but I can.

915
00:57:03,595 --> 00:57:07,460
It was so nice a moment ago
when they weren't here.

916
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:10,430
I need to know what you're seeing, sweetie.

917
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:13,500
If I don't know who you
all are and what you want,

918
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:16,260
I can't help you
as easily as I'd like.

919
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
Vicky?

920
00:57:17,995 --> 00:57:19,960
Help, help, help, help.

921
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:23,760
We all keep hoping
things will get better

922
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:27,830
but i, I don't think Sybil's
going to live that long.

923
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,930
Why, sweetie?

924
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:33,200
Why do you have
this awful feeling of doom?

925
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,530
Because of Marcia.

926
00:57:37,565 --> 00:57:40,100
Marcia's going to
kill Sybil someday.

927
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:42,630
Let it come. Let it come.

928
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,600
We're walking corpses.

929
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:48,860
We start dying
the moment we're born.

930
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:50,330
Who's Marcia?

931
00:57:50,365 --> 00:57:52,560
Why does Sybil need Marcia?

932
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:53,800
Vicky?

933
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,900
One of them
plays the piano.

934
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,530
She's the prettiest.

935
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,660
She's the only one
with any joie de vivre.

936
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:06,330
What's her name?

937
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,400
No.

938
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:12,330
Mustn't tell you.
Mustn't tell any more.

939
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:14,860
I shouldn't have even
told you about Marcia.

940
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,630
Why not?

941
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,660
Why are you so afraid to
tell about the others, Vicky?

942
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,360
Who told you it was wrong
to tell people things?

943
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:23,860
Who said it was dangerous
to tell?

944
00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:26,730
Vicky?

945
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,360
Mustn't tell.

946
00:58:32,395 --> 00:58:33,560
Can't tell.

947
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:35,260
There are guards
around the palace.

948
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:37,760
Sweetie, even the guards
around the palace

949
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:39,700
will tell
if the queen's in danger.

950
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,500
Marcia appeared
for the first time

951
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:52,800
at the session
the following thursday.

952
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:55,760
She admitted trying to kill
Sybil in the harlem hotel

953
00:58:55,795 --> 00:58:57,760
and was sorry
that Vicky stopped her.

954
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:00,230
She allowed me to photograph
her, as the other's have

955
00:59:00,265 --> 00:59:03,730
saying that she wanted this
picture published with her obituary.

956
00:59:03,765 --> 00:59:06,630
When I asked her why she thought
about suicide so obsessively

957
00:59:06,665 --> 00:59:09,560
she pretended to lock her
lips and throw the key away,

958
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:13,630
then proceeded to draw scenes
from a recurrent nightmare,

959
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:16,660
as though this were a secret
way of revealing information

960
00:59:16,695 --> 00:59:18,660
she couldn't give me openly.

961
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:21,260
By drawing
her dreams in silence,

962
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:23,230
nobody could eavesdrops
on her,

963
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:25,460
and that seemed to be
a constant dread

964
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:29,000
that someone would find out
that she'd confided in me.

965
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:30,460
In the dream,

966
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:33,560
a child comes upon,
uh, a lost kitten

967
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:36,700
in the tunnel of a great park

968
00:59:36,735 --> 00:59:38,430
and then she discovers, uh,

969
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:42,000
a box where other kittens
have been abandoned.

970
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:45,160
The child is-is overwhelmed
with-with love and pity

971
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:48,660
and-and runs off with the box
in order to save the kittens.

972
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:51,760
Suddenly,
she sees a dead cat,

973
00:59:51,795 --> 00:59:53,130
which horrifies her

974
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:55,200
because it's been beheaded.

975
00:59:55,235 --> 01:00:00,100
Both the head and body
come to life and pursue her.

976
01:00:00,135 --> 01:00:02,860
Marcia said they all shared
the same nightmares

977
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:06,560
but that Sybil
doesn't remember any of them.

978
01:00:06,595 --> 01:00:08,930
The dreams
are all of entrapment

979
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:10,530
and relentless pursuit.

980
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,360
Large families of children

981
01:00:12,395 --> 01:00:16,030
awaiting some
terrible retaliation.

982
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:20,200
Loneliness,
the hopelessness of rescue.

983
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:23,160
Paralyzing fear
pervade everything.

984
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,330
When I suggested
that the kittens

985
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:28,600
might be
the various aspects of Sybil,

986
01:00:28,635 --> 01:00:31,630
that she's trying to
bring me for protection

987
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,960
and that the cat might be her
desire to destroy again and again

988
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:38,100
some unspeakable tormentor
who won't stay dead,

989
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:43,930
Marcia became so fearful,
she dissociated into Peggy,

990
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:46,960
who wanted to escape with me
to Amsterdam to get away

991
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:50,600
from what she calls
"the people."

992
01:00:50,635 --> 01:00:54,130
I look at all the faces,
furious, terrified Peggy,

993
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:56,860
sepulchral little Marcia,

994
01:00:56,895 --> 01:01:01,030
Vicky with her social ease
and uninterrupted memory,

995
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,460
and Sybil,

996
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:07,030
and I wonder,
what there was back there

997
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:09,460
that could've caused
such a shattering.

998
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,830
What could've forced her

999
01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:14,830
to thrust onto creatures
she doesn't even know exist

1000
01:01:14,865 --> 01:01:18,700
all those capacities
in herself she must deny?

1001
01:01:18,735 --> 01:01:21,600
And why is it so vital
that she deny them?

1002
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:23,530
What was the torment?

1003
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:25,500
Who was the tormentor?

1004
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,360
Hey, Sybil.

1005
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,400
Hey, Sybil.

1006
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,030
I know you're there.

1007
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,400
Why don't you come over?

1008
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:44,630
We can go downtown.

1009
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:46,760
You can, uh,
see me in action, ok?

1010
01:01:46,795 --> 01:01:50,560
I'll buy you a hotdog,
sauerkraut, pickles.

1011
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:53,230
You like pickles?

1012
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:56,800
I don't go out at night,
but thank you anyway.

1013
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:59,200
Oh, come on. Look, uh,
it's just for a little while.

1014
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:01,300
I only gotta go down
and play the intermission

1015
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:03,830
and if it doesn't rain, uh, you
know, I'll catch them going out.

1016
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:05,960
Catch them for what?

1017
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:08,900
By day,
I'm a central park cowboy

1018
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:12,300
but by night, a tone-deaf
wandering minstrel.

1019
01:02:12,335 --> 01:02:14,000
Street musician.

1020
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:15,300
Say yes.

1021
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,900
Sybil can't say yes.

1022
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:27,800
Vanessa, you go.
You like music.

1023
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:29,730
You may go, Vanessa.

1024
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:31,100
Richard?

1025
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,060
Richard?

1026
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:37,030
Richard.

1027
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,300
Richard!

1028
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,960
Hey.

1029
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,730
Ok, but look, I'm not any
good at jumping over fences,

1030
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:53,360
so where do you live?

1031
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,800
Uh, the gray house,
apartment 5c.

1032
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,330
Ok.

1033
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,000
Hi.

1034
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:38,630
Guess what I am.

1035
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,630
Uh, a kumquat.

1036
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:43,960
No.

1037
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:45,400
A donut with ears.

1038
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:46,600
No.

1039
01:03:46,635 --> 01:03:48,100
Um...

1040
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:50,600
a smile that went looking
for a boy, and found one.

1041
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:52,030
No.
No.

1042
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:53,360
I'm a clown.

1043
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:55,130
A clown.

1044
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,900
Sybil, this is Matthew.

1045
01:03:56,935 --> 01:03:59,500
Matthew, say hello to Sybil.

1046
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,000
I know Sybil.

1047
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:03,300
I watch her
through the window.

1048
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,330
He's a little wound up
at the idea of company.

1049
01:04:09,365 --> 01:04:13,000
I really love your apartment.
It's, it's all lit up.

1050
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:14,530
Sybil bibble dribble.

1051
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:17,660
Matthew, simmer down.
Sit!

1052
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,800
Matthew.

1053
01:04:23,835 --> 01:04:27,130
Now, don't let appearances
deceive you.

1054
01:04:27,165 --> 01:04:28,600
I am really not company.

1055
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:30,130
You know what I am?

1056
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:32,960
I'm a princess who's been
asleep for 1,000 years

1057
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,200
in a forest
called simmer down.

1058
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:36,000
And you know why?

1059
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:38,460
That's because a wicked witch put
an evil spell on my ice-cream cone

1060
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:41,330
the very day I was born, and if
a prince doesn't come along soon

1061
01:04:41,365 --> 01:04:42,730
and break
the spell with a kiss,

1062
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:44,960
I guess I have to go on forever
looking like Sybil bibble,

1063
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:47,760
and I wouldn't wish that
on a dragon, would you?

1064
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:50,530
Oh, I'm getting so sleepy.

1065
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:57,300
See you blinking.

1066
01:04:57,335 --> 01:04:59,530
That's because princesses
always blink in their sleep.

1067
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:01,500
They have to stay alert
for the palace revolution

1068
01:05:01,535 --> 01:05:03,160
which is liable
to take place any moment.

1069
01:05:04,665 --> 01:05:07,100
If you wake up,
I'll show you my toys.

1070
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:09,000
There's only one way.

1071
01:05:12,935 --> 01:05:15,500
Ok. Enchantment's broken.

1072
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:22,830
Say goodnight to Sybil.

1073
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:26,160
That's not Sybil.
Sybil stayed home.

1074
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,160
Ok, but we still
gotta get you next door.

1075
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:33,530
So here's bear-bear.

1076
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:36,030
And how about night-night.

1077
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,960
And doody.

1078
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:40,530
And doody.
Can't forget doody, ok?

1079
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:41,800
And wash you face,

1080
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:44,300
or there'll be smiles
all over your pillow.

1081
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,430
That wouldn't be
such a bad thing

1082
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:50,300
to wake up to sometimes,
would it?

1083
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,460
What?

1084
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,100
Smiles.

1085
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:58,230
All over your pillow.

1086
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:09,860
I've been wondering
why you wear

1087
01:06:09,895 --> 01:06:12,000
that outrageous smile
all the time.

1088
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:14,300
People think you're smiling,
they smile back

1089
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:15,860
and that makes them
feel good.

1090
01:06:15,895 --> 01:06:18,130
So they put
more money in the kitty.

1091
01:06:18,165 --> 01:06:20,030
See how crass.

1092
01:06:20,065 --> 01:06:21,930
Clever, clever man.

1093
01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:23,500
Of course,
my face doesn't get tired

1094
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:25,360
so I can keep
grinning away all night

1095
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:27,300
and never have to smile
at all.

1096
01:06:27,335 --> 01:06:29,000
Do you make
fabulous amounts of money?

1097
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:31,130
I mean,
just tons and tons of money?

1098
01:06:31,165 --> 01:06:33,760
Well, over $5,000
last year, tax free.

1099
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:36,230
And that was just on the sidewalk
in front of carnegie hall.

1100
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:37,330
That's fabulous.

1101
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:38,830
Plus I get compliments,
you know,

1102
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:40,560
from the great
and near great.

1103
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,300
I have an autographed picture
from Lawrence Welk that says

1104
01:06:43,335 --> 01:06:44,860
"good luck and success,
always."

1105
01:06:44,895 --> 01:06:47,400
Now, that really makes
me feel neat, you know?

1106
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:50,560
Like all my years at julliard
were really worthwhile.

1107
01:06:50,595 --> 01:06:52,660
Once, I yearned to be
a concert pianist.

1108
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:53,830
What stopped you?

1109
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:55,260
I couldn't find
the right piano.

1110
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:56,960
I mean,
should it be a steinway

1111
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:59,430
or a bechstein grand?
I didn't know.

1112
01:06:59,465 --> 01:07:02,730
You are 12 years old at the
most, and I gotta kiss you.

1113
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,760
2 gentlemen in one night.
Fancy that.

1114
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,530
I got blue paint
all over your lip.

1115
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:11,830
Oh.

1116
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:13,860
Got it. Got it.

1117
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:15,000
Ok.

1118
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,860
My mother wanted to be
a concert pianist, too.

1119
01:07:19,895 --> 01:07:21,500
Yeah?
Yeah.

1120
01:07:21,535 --> 01:07:23,200
The biggest
disappointment in her life

1121
01:07:23,235 --> 01:07:25,100
was when her sister faye
got married first

1122
01:07:25,135 --> 01:07:28,500
and left her behind to demonstrate
pianos in the family music store

1123
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:30,030
instead of being
allowed to pursue

1124
01:07:30,065 --> 01:07:33,430
her dreams
like she'd been promised.

1125
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:35,400
That was in Willow Corners,
Wisconsin.

1126
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:37,830
That's my natural habitat,
believe it or not.

1127
01:07:37,865 --> 01:07:40,060
Willow Corners, Wisconsin.
Yeah.

1128
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:41,830
My goodness.

1129
01:07:41,865 --> 01:07:44,630
After that, mother would just
punish the music, you know.

1130
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:46,560
She'd just sit there
and bang on that piano

1131
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,360
and call out
the time out loud

1132
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:50,460
and call out those notes
like she hated them.

1133
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:52,560
You know,
just bang on the piano.

1134
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:53,760
Yeah, love and hate.

1135
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:55,360
Peanut butter and jelly.

1136
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:57,600
I used to hate
my late wife

1137
01:07:57,635 --> 01:07:59,260
who I speak of
with a certain irony

1138
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:01,960
so as to keep a total
collapse at a distance.

1139
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:11,000
I wish
you wouldn't mock yourself.

1140
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,100
You wanna hear about it?

1141
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,430
'Cause I'd like to tell you.

1142
01:08:20,465 --> 01:08:22,800
You would?
I'd like to hear.

1143
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:25,100
I just didn't think
I should ask.

1144
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,960
Beep-beep with the horn.

1145
01:08:29,995 --> 01:08:31,430
Choo-choo with the train.

1146
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:33,400
Crash-crash with the car.

1147
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,130
All broken.

1148
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:38,530
As Matthew says
when I drop a dish.

1149
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,430
Anyway, uh,

1150
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,730
her name

1151
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,230
was Janie.

1152
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,330
And she was 19.

1153
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,260
And, uh, I never thought
I was gonna be able

1154
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:05,830
to cope with anything
after she got killed.

1155
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,960
And I hated her
for finking out.

1156
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,760
But one thing it taught me.

1157
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,760
You're never ready
for what you have to do.

1158
01:09:21,795 --> 01:09:23,360
You just do it.

1159
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,600
That makes you ready.

1160
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,560
It's New York. Nobody cares.

1161
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,800
This is us.

1162
01:11:00,835 --> 01:11:02,260
It is?
Yeah.

1163
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:03,330
Oh.

1164
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,130
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1165
01:11:12,165 --> 01:11:17,900
follow the band

1166
01:11:17,935 --> 01:11:19,800
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1167
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:21,660
follow the band

1168
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:25,300
join in
and follow the band

1169
01:11:25,335 --> 01:11:27,360
my husband is a cabbie

1170
01:11:27,395 --> 01:11:29,260
is a cabbie, is a cabbie

1171
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:33,060
my husband is a cabbie,
is he

1172
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:35,100
all day he strips gears

1173
01:11:35,135 --> 01:11:37,060
strips gears, strips gears

1174
01:11:37,095 --> 01:11:40,060
and at night he comes home

1175
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,460
and drinks tea

1176
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:46,230
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1177
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:52,000
follow the band

1178
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:54,030
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1179
01:11:54,065 --> 01:11:55,830
follow the band

1180
01:11:55,865 --> 01:11:59,200
join in
and follow the band

1181
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:12,860
give me a bite.

1182
01:12:14,795 --> 01:12:17,200
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1183
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:22,900
follow the band

1184
01:12:22,935 --> 01:12:24,860
hey rig-a-jig
kiss a little pig

1185
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:26,660
follow the band

1186
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:30,900
join in
and follow the band

1187
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,700
you stop that now.

1188
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:03,460
There's not a thing in the world
the matter with those shoes.

1189
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:05,130
What- are they so small,
daughter?

1190
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:06,360
Maybe they pinch.

1191
01:14:06,395 --> 01:14:08,260
No, I greased them myself.

1192
01:14:08,295 --> 01:14:09,900
There's plenty of room
to grow in.

1193
01:14:09,935 --> 01:14:11,460
Feel the toe.

1194
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:14,160
Then why is she screaming so,
I want to know.

1195
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,300
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.

1196
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,160
I'm not supposed to tell you.

1197
01:14:24,195 --> 01:14:26,360
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.

1198
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:39,630
I can't tell you.

1199
01:14:39,665 --> 01:14:41,760
Now you just collect yourself,
young lady,

1200
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:44,500
or we'll be late for church.
We'll be late for church.

1201
01:14:44,535 --> 01:14:45,830
Beg your pardon?

1202
01:14:45,865 --> 01:14:48,230
You just collect yourself,
young lady.

1203
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:51,530
I won't go!
I can't tell you! I won't go!

1204
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,930
Hey, man, hold my guitar.
Take care of it.

1205
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,000
People, why do they do it?

1206
01:14:59,035 --> 01:15:01,530
Why do they do it? Why do
they do it? Why do they do it?

1207
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,860
No moss growing on that girl.

1208
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:14,130
There's no moss
growing on that girl.

1209
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,330
I don't wanna go.

1210
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:23,460
I wanna get out.
I wanna get out.

1211
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,030
Don't touch me.

1212
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:42,230
I'm going to go
run away down.

1213
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:44,230
Don't touch me.

1214
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,230
Sybil!

1215
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,900
Get out.

1216
01:15:52,365 --> 01:15:54,030
Gotta break the glass.

1217
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,430
Gotta break the glass.

1218
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,060
I must break the glass.

1219
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,230
Gotta break the glass.

1220
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,930
The people just gotta get out.
Get out!

1221
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:15,460
No, no, don't touch me.

1222
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,560
I know. I know. I know.

1223
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,060
Write, then you can see.

1224
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:27,830
I know. I know. Hold on.

1225
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:31,100
I have to do it.
I have to do it.

1226
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:33,160
I have to do it, young lady.

1227
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:36,900
You just lay still.

1228
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:38,800
Just lay still.

1229
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:41,300
If I lay still, it hurts me.

1230
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,060
Oh, it hurts me.

1231
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,460
I did it. I did it.

1232
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:51,800
Sybil.

1233
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:53,000
What?

1234
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:12,360
You ok in there?

1235
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,630
Sybil.

1236
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,730
Who's that?

1237
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,660
Who that who say, "who that"?

1238
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:26,500
Who that who say,
"who that who say,

1239
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:28,060
who that'?"

1240
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,460
Richard Loomis, hello.

1241
01:17:38,495 --> 01:17:39,760
Hello.

1242
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:47,060
I don't understand.

1243
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,660
Do you need to?

1244
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,100
Well, I'd like to

1245
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,760
but I don't have to.

1246
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,100
Have I mentioned Danny?

1247
01:17:59,135 --> 01:18:00,360
No.

1248
01:18:00,395 --> 01:18:01,660
Who's he?

1249
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,300
We were children together.

1250
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,430
He was
an outcast like me, only,

1251
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:11,930
in his case,
it was because he danced.

1252
01:18:11,965 --> 01:18:14,960
I used to be sort
of an outcast, too,

1253
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:17,360
because I couldn't
pronounce my s's.

1254
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:22,460
Whenever I feel especially
warm toward somebody,

1255
01:18:22,495 --> 01:18:24,960
especially grateful,
I think of Danny.

1256
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,430
He had kind of
a holy forbearance.

1257
01:18:29,465 --> 01:18:31,000
Even at the age of 9 or 10,

1258
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:34,400
how he got it in that
benighted town, I'll never know.

1259
01:18:34,435 --> 01:18:37,330
He never asked
for explanations.

1260
01:18:37,365 --> 01:18:40,060
Never. He just accepted.

1261
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,860
Dance with me.

1262
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:45,730
I'd get in awful trouble.

1263
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:50,260
I have to stand up in church and tell
it out loud in front of everybody.

1264
01:18:50,295 --> 01:18:54,430
I want my arms about you

1265
01:18:54,465 --> 01:18:58,300
the charms about you

1266
01:18:58,335 --> 01:19:02,260
will carry me through

1267
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:04,860
to heaven

1268
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,600
I'm in heaven

1269
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,100
and the tears
that crowd around me

1270
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:15,030
through the week

1271
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,060
seems to vanish

1272
01:19:18,095 --> 01:19:21,030
like a gambler's
lucky streak

1273
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,730
when we're out together

1274
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:30,900
out together

1275
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:34,460
out together
dancing to the beat

1276
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,900
thank you.

1277
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
Am I gonna see you again?

1278
01:20:12,835 --> 01:20:14,760
You don't have to be polite.

1279
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:16,200
I never am.

1280
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,300
Hey.

1281
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:22,300
Um, kiss a clown,
get a smile on your pillow.

1282
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:24,760
I don't sleep with a pillow.
It's bad for your spine.

1283
01:20:24,795 --> 01:20:26,260
Your hand at least?

1284
01:20:27,695 --> 01:20:30,200
Burning kisses. Burning.

1285
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,700
What did I do?

1286
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,330
Isn't that nice?
Mmm-hmm.

1287
01:20:56,365 --> 01:20:58,830
Sometimes, he, he plays songs
that are like happy and gay.

1288
01:20:58,865 --> 01:21:01,530
One time he played, um,
with a song in my heart.

1289
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:02,760
You know that one?

1290
01:21:02,795 --> 01:21:04,860
Uh, it goes...
you know. Yeah, right.

1291
01:21:04,895 --> 01:21:06,660
I always knew

1292
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,300
I'd live life through
with a song in my heart

1293
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:12,730
I can see you have
a lovely voice.

1294
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:14,460
One time, we went to the park,
you know,

1295
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:15,700
'cause we were
gonna play catch

1296
01:21:15,735 --> 01:21:16,930
and then one of the boys
came out

1297
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:18,500
because he wanted
to play catch.

1298
01:21:18,535 --> 01:21:20,430
And Richard thought it was
me, so he went over to Mike

1299
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:22,160
and he kissed him right
smack dab on the lips.

1300
01:21:22,195 --> 01:21:23,330
He went... and Mike went...

1301
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:24,460
what is a boy-

1302
01:21:24,495 --> 01:21:25,660
wait a minute.

1303
01:21:25,695 --> 01:21:28,160
Do you mean
some of the others are boys?

1304
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,160
I wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

1305
01:21:34,195 --> 01:21:35,830
Now Vicky's
gonna be mad at me.

1306
01:21:36,995 --> 01:21:39,460
Vanessa, I don't understand.

1307
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,500
It hurts.

1308
01:21:41,535 --> 01:21:44,500
When Richard
kisses Sybil, it hurts.

1309
01:21:44,535 --> 01:21:47,130
Why is that?
Why does love hurt?

1310
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,260
Love doesn't hurt, sweetie.
Love heals.

1311
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,730
It smelled
like disinfectant.

1312
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,760
What smells
like disinfectant?

1313
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,930
The hands
in the green kitchen.

1314
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:10,360
Like that stuff you made Sybil
smell that time, remember?

1315
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,200
Mmm-hmm.

1316
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,600
I just love you to death.

1317
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:19,760
Bushel and a peck,
a hug around the neck.

1318
01:22:19,795 --> 01:22:21,330
Now, you just
come on over here.

1319
01:22:21,365 --> 01:22:22,900
Let me give you a hug,
honey.

1320
01:22:22,935 --> 01:22:25,830
That's a girl.
Don't hang back like that.

1321
01:22:25,865 --> 01:22:27,830
No. Isn't that fun?

1322
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:30,130
Just tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

1323
01:22:30,165 --> 01:22:32,500
And tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

1324
01:22:34,395 --> 01:22:36,860
Then there'd be a big pinch.

1325
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,760
But I wasn't hurt by love
because I came later.

1326
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,800
Besides that, I was quick
as grease lightening

1327
01:22:42,835 --> 01:22:44,260
and I could always get away.

1328
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:46,160
Sybil had a dream
she could play,

1329
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:48,030
but I can really play.

1330
01:22:50,335 --> 01:22:54,160
dreamer

1331
01:22:54,195 --> 01:22:57,560
you have easter...
you have easter bonnet.

1332
01:22:57,595 --> 01:22:58,830
I love easter bonnet.

1333
01:22:58,865 --> 01:23:00,660
Play it for me, will you?

1334
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,160
Oh.

1335
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:04,630
You could do it.

1336
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,700
ok.
I'm ready.

1337
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,700
Ok. Ok, wait, wait.
Ok. Start again.

1338
01:23:15,735 --> 01:23:19,030
in your easter bonnet

1339
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:23,000
with all the frills
upon it

1340
01:23:23,035 --> 01:23:26,500
I'll be
the grandest fellow

1341
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:29,730
in the easter parade

1342
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:34,860
I'll be all in clover

1343
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:38,630
and when they look me over

1344
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:42,130
I'll be
the proudest fellow

1345
01:23:42,165 --> 01:23:46,130
in the easter parade

1346
01:23:46,165 --> 01:23:47,960
on the avenue

1347
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,600
fifth avenue

1348
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,030
Vanessa,
what's the matter, sweetie?

1349
01:24:06,065 --> 01:24:07,960
I'm not Vanessa.

1350
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,060
I'm sorry, Peggy,
but you popped out so fast.

1351
01:24:12,095 --> 01:24:13,630
What's the matter, sweetie?

1352
01:24:13,665 --> 01:24:15,760
It was my idea
and she stole it.

1353
01:24:15,795 --> 01:24:19,500
I wanted to sing easter
bonnet really, really bad.

1354
01:24:19,535 --> 01:24:22,260
Well,
you can sing easter bonnet.

1355
01:24:22,295 --> 01:24:24,430
I don't want to.
I wanna dance.

1356
01:24:24,465 --> 01:24:25,900
Well, fine.

1357
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,030
And I want you to watch me.

1358
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:29,930
All right. All right.
I'm all eyes, all right?

1359
01:24:29,965 --> 01:24:31,630
Ok.

1360
01:24:31,665 --> 01:24:33,400
All right.

1361
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:37,000
Vanessa will be my stage man,
and you're gonna watch me.

1362
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Ok. Ok.

1363
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:45,360
heaven, I'm in heaven

1364
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:46,860
and my heart beats

1365
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:50,430
so that I can hardly speak

1366
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:54,030
and I seem to find
the happiness

1367
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,830
I don't, I don't find
happiness anywhere.

1368
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,760
We'll find it, Peggy.

1369
01:25:06,795 --> 01:25:08,830
It just got lost someplace.

1370
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
I want to sit
in the big chair with you.

1371
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:16,660
Well, you can come sit
in the big chair with me.

1372
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:17,930
Ok.

1373
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,300
Dr. Wilbur, would you help me?

1374
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:27,330
I can't see anything.

1375
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,360
What's the matter?

1376
01:25:30,395 --> 01:25:31,760
I can't see anything.

1377
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:34,260
Why can't you see anything,
honey?

1378
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,600
There's dish towels
around my eyes,

1379
01:25:37,635 --> 01:25:40,000
and they're around
my wrists, too.

1380
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:41,100
Dish towels?

1381
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:42,460
Yes.

1382
01:25:42,495 --> 01:25:44,160
Here, come on.

1383
01:25:44,195 --> 01:25:45,900
Here. There you go.

1384
01:25:45,935 --> 01:25:47,260
All righty?
Yeah.

1385
01:25:47,295 --> 01:25:50,800
Here. Is that better?
There. Ok.

1386
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:53,460
Well, now, how did
the dish towels get there?

1387
01:25:53,495 --> 01:25:55,330
I don't know.

1388
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:57,900
I'm scared of dish towels.

1389
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:01,300
Well, dish towels are just
inanimate objects, Peggy.

1390
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:04,200
Will you call me "sweetie"?

1391
01:26:04,235 --> 01:26:07,130
I'm sorry, sweetie, but, now,
dish towels don't just

1392
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,030
jump up and
tie themselves around

1393
01:26:09,065 --> 01:26:10,960
little girls' faces
and around their wrists.

1394
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:12,930
They have to be put there
by somebody.

1395
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,860
Just hands, not somebody.

1396
01:26:14,895 --> 01:26:17,800
Well, honey, the hands
have to belong to someone.

1397
01:26:17,835 --> 01:26:19,300
Now who-who did
the hands belong to?

1398
01:26:19,335 --> 01:26:20,660
Just hands.

1399
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:27,000
Well, you want to take off the
dish towels and look at the hands?

1400
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:29,700
Why don't we do that?
Will you do that?

1401
01:26:29,735 --> 01:26:30,960
Will you help me?

1402
01:26:30,995 --> 01:26:32,160
Sure.

1403
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:35,030
Ok. Now zip and zip.

1404
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,760
Now,
the dish towels are off.

1405
01:26:37,795 --> 01:26:40,100
Now, will you look at
the hands?

1406
01:26:40,135 --> 01:26:41,860
No. I don't want to.
I don't want to.

1407
01:26:41,895 --> 01:26:43,260
Well, try. Try.

1408
01:26:43,295 --> 01:26:45,730
Just try looking
at the hands, ok?

1409
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:47,600
Can you see the hands?

1410
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,630
Hmm?

1411
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,460
Now can you see the arms?

1412
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,630
Up to the elbows?

1413
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,000
And up to the shoulders?

1414
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,760
Can you see the neck?

1415
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,360
Now can you look at the face?

1416
01:27:05,395 --> 01:27:06,730
No. There isn't any face.

1417
01:27:06,765 --> 01:27:08,200
There isn't any face.

1418
01:27:08,235 --> 01:27:11,630
The hands did it or the towels
just did it all by themselves.

1419
01:27:11,665 --> 01:27:12,730
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1420
01:27:12,765 --> 01:27:14,330
I know. I know.

1421
01:27:14,365 --> 01:27:17,360
I know, but if we look at the
scary stuff, it'll go away.

1422
01:27:17,395 --> 01:27:19,500
Oh, it hurts me.
It hurts me.

1423
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:20,730
I know,
but we have to find out

1424
01:27:20,765 --> 01:27:23,430
what did the hands do
to make that hurt.

1425
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,500
Oh, come on, Peggy.
You don't have to do that.

1426
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,100
Oh, my god.

1427
01:27:33,135 --> 01:27:34,760
Keep away from the window.

1428
01:27:34,795 --> 01:27:37,160
Remember, you promised you
wouldn't break glass in my office.

1429
01:27:37,195 --> 01:27:39,160
Hands and the people
and you could see them

1430
01:27:39,195 --> 01:27:41,200
and they walk and they talk
and you can hear them

1431
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:42,860
and, and "a" sharp and "c".

1432
01:27:42,895 --> 01:27:44,400
Oh, oh, it hurts me.

1433
01:27:44,435 --> 01:27:46,830
Who are the people, sweetie?
What hurts? What hurts?

1434
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:48,960
I will. I gotta get out.
I gotta get out. Peggy!

1435
01:27:48,995 --> 01:27:51,030
I will. I will. Glass break.

1436
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,100
Where are you? Where
are you, Peggy? Tell me.

1437
01:27:55,135 --> 01:27:56,860
The kitchen,
the kitchen, the kitchen.

1438
01:27:56,895 --> 01:27:58,600
It's all green.
It's all green.

1439
01:27:58,635 --> 01:28:01,560
And the sink and the table
and the light, you can see it.

1440
01:28:01,595 --> 01:28:04,630
And the shade, and the shade,
and the piano in the living room,

1441
01:28:04,665 --> 01:28:06,200
and the piano
in the living room.

1442
01:28:06,235 --> 01:28:08,400
And the people, and you
can't get away from the music,

1443
01:28:08,435 --> 01:28:10,230
and it doesn't
make any difference.

1444
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:12,630
Oh, don't hook me.
Don't hook me.

1445
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:13,900
Hook you with what?

1446
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:15,260
Don't hook me. Don't hook me.

1447
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:17,060
I know. You got a big hook.
You got a button hook.

1448
01:28:17,095 --> 01:28:19,230
You're gonna hook me. You're
gonna hook me. No. No. No.

1449
01:28:19,265 --> 01:28:21,500
Peggy, who are you talking
to? No, you won't let me out.

1450
01:28:21,535 --> 01:28:23,560
You won't let me break glass.
You won't let me draw.

1451
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:25,530
And you won't let me draw.
Yes, I'll let you draw.

1452
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:27,030
You won't let me draw.
I'll let you draw.

1453
01:28:27,065 --> 01:28:28,430
You won't let me draw.

1454
01:28:28,465 --> 01:28:30,330
You won't let me draw
because I'll draw my way out.

1455
01:28:30,365 --> 01:28:31,430
I'll draw my way out.

1456
01:28:31,465 --> 01:28:32,760
And all the people
and the colors.

1457
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,600
And the people
and the colors.

1458
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:36,400
You won't be mad.
You won't be mad.

1459
01:28:36,435 --> 01:28:39,060
No, no. Draw.
I'll draw my way out.

1460
01:28:39,095 --> 01:28:41,000
You watch. You could watch.

1461
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:43,300
Vicky would say "may," but
I can say "can" if I want to.

1462
01:28:43,335 --> 01:28:44,730
I can say "can" if I want to.

1463
01:28:44,765 --> 01:28:46,830
The people, the people,
the people.

1464
01:28:46,865 --> 01:28:49,830
It's all purple. And it moves
and you watch them

1465
01:28:49,865 --> 01:28:51,960
and you see their feet.
And you have to get away.

1466
01:28:51,995 --> 01:28:53,900
And there's another
and another and another.

1467
01:28:53,935 --> 01:28:57,100
And the music, it goes around
and around and around and around

1468
01:28:57,135 --> 01:28:59,360
and over and down like that,
and then like that.

1469
01:28:59,395 --> 01:29:01,130
And you could see,
you could see,

1470
01:29:01,165 --> 01:29:03,030
you could see,
and the people have hands.

1471
01:29:03,065 --> 01:29:04,360
Peggy, who are the people?

1472
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:05,630
I don't know. I don't know.

1473
01:29:05,665 --> 01:29:07,560
They're just people.
They're just people.

1474
01:29:07,595 --> 01:29:09,430
And it's like that
and like that and over

1475
01:29:09,465 --> 01:29:11,700
and around and like that
and like that.

1476
01:29:11,735 --> 01:29:13,500
And you can hear it,
and you can hear.

1477
01:29:13,535 --> 01:29:16,360
And it goes sharp, sharp.
It goes sharp. "a" sharp.

1478
01:29:16,395 --> 01:29:19,800
"A" sharp and "f" and "f"
and-and-and "b" and "d"

1479
01:29:19,835 --> 01:29:22,800
and-and-and-and-and
brahms and beethoven.

1480
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:25,060
And-and-and-and-and-and

1481
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:28,400
Brahms and-and-and the New
World Symphony and Dvorak.

1482
01:29:28,435 --> 01:29:29,960
And Dvorak, you can hear it.

1483
01:29:29,995 --> 01:29:31,800
You can hear it.
You can hear it.

1484
01:29:31,835 --> 01:29:33,930
Oh, oh, mustn't waste paper.

1485
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:35,160
Mustn't waste paper.

1486
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:37,500
Paper is valuable.
Paper is valuable.

1487
01:29:37,535 --> 01:29:39,500
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1488
01:29:39,535 --> 01:29:42,300
It's valuable. It's valuable.

1489
01:29:43,835 --> 01:29:45,500
You can see now.

1490
01:29:45,535 --> 01:29:48,730
You can see the people.

1491
01:29:48,765 --> 01:29:50,630
You can see the people now.

1492
01:29:50,665 --> 01:29:52,260
You can see them.

1493
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,700
You can see.

1494
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,060
Oh.

1495
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:07,430
It's all right.
It's all right.

1496
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:09,760
Oh, god,
how did I get under here?

1497
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,800
How did I get under there?

1498
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,060
You have to stop me
from doing this.

1499
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:22,500
I can't go on.

1500
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,760
Sybil, how do you feel?

1501
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,130
Relieved, a little.

1502
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,430
Hmm, I'm not surprised.

1503
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:38,800
You've accomplished
a great deal.

1504
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,530
Sybil, come and sit down.

1505
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:44,800
I wanna show you something.

1506
01:30:44,835 --> 01:30:46,500
Come on. Sit down.

1507
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,560
Now, you told me that

1508
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,060
this was a picture
of the people.

1509
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,960
Who drew that?
That's my mother.

1510
01:31:03,995 --> 01:31:05,460
That's a picture
of my mother.

1511
01:31:05,495 --> 01:31:08,500
Look, the little wisps
of hair there and,

1512
01:31:08,535 --> 01:31:10,460
and you can't see her eyes.

1513
01:31:10,495 --> 01:31:12,200
Her eyes always scared me.

1514
01:31:12,235 --> 01:31:13,560
Did you do that?

1515
01:31:13,595 --> 01:31:15,700
No. No, I didn't do it.

1516
01:31:15,735 --> 01:31:21,000
Look. Look, the little bow and
hairpins she always wore in her hair.

1517
01:31:21,035 --> 01:31:23,460
And-and there's
the button hook.

1518
01:31:23,495 --> 01:31:25,400
I don't remember.

1519
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,130
Button hooks scare me.

1520
01:31:28,165 --> 01:31:30,960
Like they're gonna get me.

1521
01:31:30,995 --> 01:31:32,930
Button hooks are good things.

1522
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,330
What about dish towels?

1523
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:38,100
Do dish towels scare you?

1524
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,500
How do you know
about dish towels?

1525
01:31:40,535 --> 01:31:41,600
Do they scare you?

1526
01:31:41,635 --> 01:31:44,130
Yes.

1527
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,530
But now dish towels are good
and useful things, right?

1528
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,800
Sybil,
love is a necessary thing.

1529
01:31:53,835 --> 01:31:57,830
But now if a voice says,
"c-come here, I love you"

1530
01:31:57,865 --> 01:32:01,000
and then a hand reaches out
and pinches you like that, hard,

1531
01:32:01,035 --> 01:32:04,060
then-then love is spoiled
by that hand, isn't it?

1532
01:32:04,095 --> 01:32:07,960
And-and-and music, now that's
something that-that you love very much

1533
01:32:07,995 --> 01:32:09,630
and you miss very much

1534
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:13,500
because somehow that was spoiled
for you, too, by the hand.

1535
01:32:13,535 --> 01:32:16,630
We don't know how,
but-but we're gonna find out.

1536
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:18,760
And that hand
belongs to the people

1537
01:32:18,795 --> 01:32:20,360
and the people
was your mother.

1538
01:32:20,395 --> 01:32:21,800
The people,
I cannot see the people.

1539
01:32:21,835 --> 01:32:23,030
Oh, Peggy, stop that!

1540
01:32:23,065 --> 01:32:24,400
What?

1541
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,100
Oh, Dr. Wilbur,
it's getting worse.

1542
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:36,100
This is getting a lot worse,
isn't it?

1543
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,430
How do you know
those things?

1544
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,860
I don't tell you them.

1545
01:32:42,895 --> 01:32:45,300
And who does those drawings?

1546
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,330
You do.

1547
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,300
Oh, but you do them
as other people.

1548
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:55,300
Do you understand?
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

1549
01:32:55,335 --> 01:32:57,500
You do them as other parts
of yourself no, I don't.

1550
01:32:57,535 --> 01:32:59,160
...who are still children.
No, I don't.

1551
01:32:59,195 --> 01:33:00,930
It's true.
No, it's not. It is not

1552
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:04,030
Sybil, you've got to understand.
It is true. This is not possible.

1553
01:33:04,065 --> 01:33:05,200
It's possible.
Mmm-mmm.

1554
01:33:05,235 --> 01:33:06,930
In fact,
through most of the analysis,

1555
01:33:06,965 --> 01:33:08,630
I've been talking to you
through them.

1556
01:33:08,665 --> 01:33:11,200
They all have names and they
come here and they protect you.

1557
01:33:11,235 --> 01:33:13,160
They keep your appointments
and they're the ones

1558
01:33:13,195 --> 01:33:15,460
who pour out this information
that you're afraid to face. Oh, no.

1559
01:33:15,495 --> 01:33:17,700
You've got to understand
that, Sybil. No, it's not true.

1560
01:33:17,735 --> 01:33:22,100
It's true. It's not true. No,
it's not. No. It's not true.

1561
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,360
Sybil.

1562
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,500
Sybil.

1563
01:33:26,535 --> 01:33:29,830
Everything you care about
survives in those parts of you

1564
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:32,230
that your mother
wasn't able to reach.

1565
01:33:32,265 --> 01:33:35,030
Your music, your painting,

1566
01:33:35,065 --> 01:33:38,130
even your ability to love,
they survive there.

1567
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,960
Sybil, I want you
to hear something.

1568
01:33:42,995 --> 01:33:44,800
What are you going to do?

1569
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,860
I'm going to let you hear
yourself play the piano.

1570
01:33:50,895 --> 01:33:52,900
I can't play
the piano anymore.

1571
01:33:52,935 --> 01:33:55,000
I used to play it.
I can't play it anymore.

1572
01:33:55,035 --> 01:33:58,300
Well, this is a part of you who
calls herself Vanessa, and she can.

1573
01:33:58,335 --> 01:34:00,100
She plays beautifully.

1574
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,800
I don't wanna know about her.

1575
01:34:01,835 --> 01:34:02,900
Sybil.

1576
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:05,600
We've got to make
this real for you.

1577
01:34:06,995 --> 01:34:10,330
Doctor, I don't think
that I can take it.

1578
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,260
My hands are going numb.

1579
01:34:13,295 --> 01:34:15,560
There's no danger for you.
There is no danger.

1580
01:34:15,595 --> 01:34:18,400
There are no dish towels
tying your wrists now.

1581
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,430
My heart. My heart.

1582
01:34:22,465 --> 01:34:24,430
That's only adrenalin.

1583
01:34:24,465 --> 01:34:27,000
There is nobody here
to hurt you, I promise.

1584
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:30,430
Nothing bad is going to happen.
It's gonna make it better.

1585
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:32,700
Please, Sybil,
just relax and listen.

1586
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,900
that's Vanessa.

1587
01:34:53,935 --> 01:34:56,600
And she's got all your music
for safekeeping.

1588
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,400
that's me?

1589
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,700
Playing mozart?

1590
01:35:13,735 --> 01:35:14,760
Mmm-hmm.

1591
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:18,360
And you played Sibelius, too.

1592
01:35:18,395 --> 01:35:19,900
You played Finlandia.

1593
01:35:21,935 --> 01:35:23,960
Don't you dare tell.

1594
01:35:23,995 --> 01:35:26,230
Next worse thing to being a
fibber is being a talebearer.

1595
01:35:26,265 --> 01:35:28,700
That's my mother's voice. That's my
- that's my mother's...

1596
01:35:28,735 --> 01:35:31,760
that's my mother's voice.
That's my mother's voice.

1597
01:35:31,795 --> 01:35:33,960
Sweetie, that's not
your mother's voice.

1598
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:35,900
That's you imitating your...

1599
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,560
Sybil?

1600
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,800
Sybil!

1601
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:54,860
What the hell
did that monster do to you?

1602
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,130
What happened
in the green kitchen?

1603
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,920
Hello. Erna.

1604
01:36:49,055 --> 01:36:51,520
Listen, I need your support.
I, uh...

1605
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,660
Sybil has dissociated
into a baby.

1606
01:36:55,695 --> 01:36:57,260
I can't get her back.

1607
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,190
A baby.

1608
01:37:00,225 --> 01:37:04,920
Oh, l-I was too eager.
I pushed her over the edge.

1609
01:37:04,955 --> 01:37:08,890
Well, I can't get her hypnotized.
If I could, I'd-I'd contact Vicky,

1610
01:37:08,925 --> 01:37:11,420
but she won't focus
on-on-on-on anything

1611
01:37:11,455 --> 01:37:13,590
and-and she doesn't
understand a word I say.

1612
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:15,460
She's-she's preverbal.

1613
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,790
Yeah, but what if
she stays like that?

1614
01:37:18,825 --> 01:37:20,820
No. No. No hospitals.

1615
01:37:20,855 --> 01:37:22,020
No, not with her history.

1616
01:37:23,355 --> 01:37:25,490
Could you?
Could you please, Erna?

1617
01:37:25,525 --> 01:37:28,620
I hate to drag you out on
a night like this, but l-I...

1618
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,460
oh! Hold on a second.

1619
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:34,120
Dr. Wilbur, uh,
I'm getting her a snack.

1620
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:37,920
Sweetie, how do you feel?

1621
01:37:37,955 --> 01:37:40,760
A little woozy. Hungry.

1622
01:37:40,795 --> 01:37:43,160
Well, there's-there's food
in the kitchen.

1623
01:37:43,195 --> 01:37:45,520
Go get some cheesecake
or something.

1624
01:37:45,555 --> 01:37:47,260
I'll be there in a minute.

1625
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,120
Oh, Erna, it's ok. It's ok.

1626
01:37:50,425 --> 01:37:52,820
Onward and upward,
she came to as Sybil.

1627
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:58,220
Sybil Dorsett,
psychoanalytic session 251.

1628
01:37:58,255 --> 01:38:00,290
I'd hardly breathed
a sigh of relief

1629
01:38:00,325 --> 01:38:04,690
about Sybil's making her
spontaneous reentry out of the baby,

1630
01:38:04,725 --> 01:38:08,920
when, suddenly, we're facing
this ghastly season of mirth.

1631
01:38:08,955 --> 01:38:11,890
Christmas seems to be
a stressful time for Sybil.

1632
01:38:11,925 --> 01:38:14,090
The other personalities
have been stirred

1633
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:16,220
into a kind of
frenzied wakefulness

1634
01:38:16,255 --> 01:38:18,960
and some who've been dormant
until now have come out.

1635
01:38:18,995 --> 01:38:20,690
One of them, Mary,
is a devout,

1636
01:38:20,725 --> 01:38:22,320
old-fashioned
little homemaker

1637
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:26,060
who seems almost the reincarnation
of Sybil's grandmother.

1638
01:38:26,095 --> 01:38:29,060
I wish you all
a happy holiday.

1639
01:38:29,095 --> 01:38:31,020
Joy in the new year.

1640
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,920
Nobody answers, Vicky.

1641
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,220
Mary, this is New York.

1642
01:38:39,255 --> 01:38:40,860
This is not Willow Corners.

1643
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:42,460
Don't be upset.

1644
01:38:42,495 --> 01:38:44,520
Let me carry
the portfolio for you.

1645
01:38:44,555 --> 01:38:46,690
It's getting awfully heavy.

1646
01:38:46,725 --> 01:38:48,460
Thank you, dear.

1647
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:51,360
I can vaguely
remember what's in it.

1648
01:38:51,395 --> 01:38:54,120
Everything's been
getting so dim lately.

1649
01:38:54,155 --> 01:38:56,290
Must be senility.

1650
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,090
Angels.

1651
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,060
They're only decorations,
Mary.

1652
01:39:02,095 --> 01:39:05,690
Grandma's with the angels.
So am I.

1653
01:39:05,725 --> 01:39:07,790
Am I going to
see grandma, Vicky?

1654
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:09,390
Not yet.

1655
01:39:09,425 --> 01:39:11,360
We're going to see
Dr. Wilbur first.

1656
01:39:11,395 --> 01:39:13,120
Come away, Mary, please.

1657
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:20,020
Marcia promised that she'd
send me to grandma soon.

1658
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,920
Why doesn't she do it?

1659
01:39:22,955 --> 01:39:25,220
I'm getting

1660
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:28,960
Come in.

1661
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:32,290
Oh, Vicky, come on in.

1662
01:39:32,325 --> 01:39:33,660
Dr. Wilbur.

1663
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,820
Pardon me for
barging in on you like this.

1664
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:46,090
I'm sorry, but it all
seems to be falling apart.

1665
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:49,090
I don't seem to be able
to control things any longer.

1666
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:52,020
It's all right.
Tell me about it.

1667
01:39:52,055 --> 01:39:54,960
Marcia is constantly
thinking of suicide.

1668
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:56,860
Mary thinks
she's in heaven.

1669
01:39:56,895 --> 01:39:59,560
And Sybil has invited Richard
over for Christmas dinner.

1670
01:39:59,595 --> 01:40:02,520
Now, I know she isn't able
to handle it. I know this.

1671
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,560
It's all just awful.

1672
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,120
Well, what made it go awful?

1673
01:40:11,155 --> 01:40:12,990
What happened this time?
Hmm?

1674
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,120
It's Christmas.

1675
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:23,920
The trees and the windows
and everybody all cozy.

1676
01:40:23,955 --> 01:40:27,090
Everybody having to
rush around, hurry before...

1677
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,220
before what?

1678
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:33,290
We've made you this.

1679
01:40:33,325 --> 01:40:36,220
It's a Christmas card,
for you.

1680
01:40:36,255 --> 01:40:37,920
For our Dr. Wilbur.

1681
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:40,060
Thank you.

1682
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,290
Sorry about the color.

1683
01:40:48,325 --> 01:40:50,160
Sybil tried
for red and green,

1684
01:40:50,195 --> 01:40:51,990
but it just
kept getting purple

1685
01:40:52,025 --> 01:40:54,520
and she wasn't able
to stop it.

1686
01:40:54,555 --> 01:40:56,420
Do you know what she did?

1687
01:40:56,455 --> 01:40:59,520
She took the crayon, and she
just scrubbed on the paper

1688
01:40:59,555 --> 01:41:02,320
and scrubbed on it like that,
and she grit her teeth

1689
01:41:02,355 --> 01:41:05,460
and then she wadded it up
and threw it in the trashcan.

1690
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,420
We rescued it.

1691
01:41:08,455 --> 01:41:11,120
We-we tried
to make it prettier, you see.

1692
01:41:11,155 --> 01:41:13,420
Peggy added the red,
and we smoothed it out.

1693
01:41:13,455 --> 01:41:14,820
We-we all tried.

1694
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,090
Thank you. Well, sit down.

1695
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,820
I've brought you these, too.

1696
01:41:25,325 --> 01:41:27,190
But you mustn't tell her.

1697
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:34,020
They're our paintings.
We do them at night.

1698
01:41:34,055 --> 01:41:35,620
We hide them
on a secret shelf

1699
01:41:35,655 --> 01:41:37,860
on top of the closet
that Mike made.

1700
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:45,020
We want you to have them
for safekeeping.

1701
01:41:45,055 --> 01:41:48,260
The way you say
that Vanessa keeps the music.

1702
01:41:48,295 --> 01:41:51,220
Because something awful is
going to happen. I can feel it.

1703
01:41:51,255 --> 01:41:53,390
It's going to fall apart,
or-or blow up,

1704
01:41:53,425 --> 01:41:55,520
or there's going
to be an earthquake.

1705
01:41:55,555 --> 01:41:57,420
Sweetie, there's not going
to be an earthquake.

1706
01:41:57,455 --> 01:42:00,990
Or a tidal wave, or-or a glacier,
or something. I don't know what.

1707
01:42:01,025 --> 01:42:03,290
Just something awful
is going to happen.

1708
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:06,660
The end of the world is not
what you're afraid of, Vicky.

1709
01:42:06,695 --> 01:42:09,520
Please keep them
for safekeeping. Please.

1710
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:12,890
All right.

1711
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,090
Thank you.

1712
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:21,090
Vicky, safekeeping from what?
Hmm?

1713
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:27,860
Now, what is the connection
between purple

1714
01:42:27,895 --> 01:42:30,060
and Christmas
and things blowing up?

1715
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:32,060
Hmm?

1716
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,990
What did mother do
to make the purple?

1717
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,620
There are guards
around the palace.

1718
01:42:39,355 --> 01:42:42,160
Vicky, we've got to get past
the guards around the palace now.

1719
01:42:42,195 --> 01:42:44,190
I mean, we have to get down
to the bottom

1720
01:42:44,225 --> 01:42:47,420
where everybody is joined
together and remembers everything

1721
01:42:47,455 --> 01:42:49,390
and it's all right to say it.

1722
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,520
Now, you know
there is a way to do it.

1723
01:42:52,555 --> 01:42:53,960
We've discussed
the way before.

1724
01:42:53,995 --> 01:42:55,420
Yes, I know.

1725
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:58,220
Hypnosis.

1726
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:59,520
Yes.

1727
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,490
Sybil's daddy
wouldn't like it.

1728
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:06,460
Well, what about Sybil?

1729
01:43:06,495 --> 01:43:08,160
Is Sybil listening now?

1730
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,220
She- she's so awfully afraid,
doctor.

1731
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,390
I think she would
almost do anything

1732
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:21,860
if it would help make us
not be so afraid.

1733
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,860
Good.

1734
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,960
All right.

1735
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,960
Come on.

1736
01:43:30,995 --> 01:43:33,990
Just lie here,
put your feet up and relax.

1737
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,860
It's all right.
It's all right.

1738
01:43:39,895 --> 01:43:41,860
What would you
like to look at?

1739
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:46,520
Nehemiah, the little horse
that Peggy made you.

1740
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:48,820
All right.

1741
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:51,620
Here, come on, lie back.
Put your feet up.

1742
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,190
That's right.
Now you just relax.

1743
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,020
Relax.

1744
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:06,090
And when you're ready,
you look at Nehemiah.

1745
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:10,220
Here,
you will look at Nehemiah.

1746
01:44:10,255 --> 01:44:11,820
Sybil's heart is pounding so.

1747
01:44:11,855 --> 01:44:14,260
It's all right.
It's all right.

1748
01:44:14,295 --> 01:44:16,720
You will be with me, and we
will take this up together.

1749
01:44:16,755 --> 01:44:18,820
You'll be safe.

1750
01:44:18,855 --> 01:44:21,290
Now just relax.
Look at Nehemiah.

1751
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:24,290
Now, you're going to sleep.

1752
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,620
Deeply, deeply asleep.

1753
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,920
All right?

1754
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:36,360
Now, we will come
close to the purple.

1755
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,390
You will remember

1756
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,760
but you won't feel the hurt.

1757
01:44:43,795 --> 01:44:45,520
The hurt is in the past.

1758
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,090
Now, when did
the purple happen?

1759
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,820
5 years old.

1760
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:57,290
Any particular day?

1761
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:01,190
Day before Christmas,
like now.

1762
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,490
All right.

1763
01:45:04,525 --> 01:45:06,760
Now, when I touch
your left shoulder,

1764
01:45:06,795 --> 01:45:09,960
you will listen with the
others while I speak with Sybil.

1765
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:11,860
Sybil.

1766
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:14,120
Sybil.

1767
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:15,460
Yes.

1768
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,490
Are we going
to grandma's room?

1769
01:45:18,525 --> 01:45:20,190
Is that where you were?

1770
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,260
I like it there.

1771
01:45:23,295 --> 01:45:24,690
It's nice in grandma's room.

1772
01:45:24,725 --> 01:45:25,960
All right.

1773
01:45:25,995 --> 01:45:30,020
When I count to 5, you
will be in grandma's room.

1774
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:34,260
You count with me. 1.

1775
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:36,820
2.

1776
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:40,120
3. count with me.

1777
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,890
4.
4.

1778
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
5.
5.

1779
01:45:48,225 --> 01:45:51,320
I'm right here, Sybil.
You can go to her.

1780
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,690
What is it, dear heart?

1781
01:46:00,725 --> 01:46:02,160
My grandma.

1782
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,790
You can go to her.

1783
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,260
She's dead.

1784
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:10,190
This is a memory, sweetie.

1785
01:46:14,725 --> 01:46:17,320
Guess who's here, grandma?

1786
01:46:17,355 --> 01:46:18,920
Give me a hint.

1787
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:25,060
Sugar and spice
and everything nice.

1788
01:46:25,095 --> 01:46:29,260
Is this, by any chance, my
little downstairs neighbor?

1789
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:31,920
Is this my Sybil?

1790
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,460
You guessed right.

1791
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,290
Grandma.

1792
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:41,620
I love my grandma.

1793
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:45,790
You can say it to her
if you want to, sweetie.

1794
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,190
I love you, grandma.

1795
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:55,860
Little round scissors,
I found them.

1796
01:46:55,895 --> 01:46:58,260
Good! Hurray!

1797
01:46:58,295 --> 01:47:00,860
What are you doing
with the little scissors?

1798
01:47:00,895 --> 01:47:01,890
Cutting.

1799
01:47:01,925 --> 01:47:03,890
Cutting what?

1800
01:47:03,925 --> 01:47:05,890
Little picture of Santa Claus.

1801
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:09,860
And I stay inside
the lines real good.

1802
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,690
Like this.

1803
01:47:12,725 --> 01:47:16,820
And I make a little star
out of tinfoil. Like this.

1804
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,560
And my grandma's
real nice to me,

1805
01:47:20,595 --> 01:47:22,920
and she doesn't holler at me,

1806
01:47:22,955 --> 01:47:25,860
and I don't have to be afraid
in my grandma's room.

1807
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:27,360
No.

1808
01:47:29,655 --> 01:47:31,890
It's all right, sweetie.
You're still with your grandma.

1809
01:47:31,925 --> 01:47:34,690
A beautiful star.
See how it twinkles.

1810
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:38,120
I make a good Santa, too?

1811
01:47:38,155 --> 01:47:39,420
It all right?

1812
01:47:39,455 --> 01:47:41,060
Oh, my.

1813
01:47:41,095 --> 01:47:43,290
You didn't cut a whisker.

1814
01:47:43,325 --> 01:47:45,490
He looks so happy.

1815
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,890
I don't think he liked being
cooped up in that old magazine.

1816
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:52,660
Can I paste him on my star?

1817
01:47:52,695 --> 01:47:54,220
That a good idea?

1818
01:47:54,255 --> 01:47:56,420
Wonderful.

1819
01:47:56,455 --> 01:48:00,090
You show me.
You can show me.

1820
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:03,860
Then he can twinkle way up
high on my tree where he will-

1821
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:05,020
Sybil!

1822
01:48:05,055 --> 01:48:06,460
You come down here,
young lady!

1823
01:48:06,495 --> 01:48:10,360
You've been pestering
that old woman long enough!

1824
01:48:10,395 --> 01:48:12,090
I don't want
to go downstairs.

1825
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:14,390
You can face it, sweetie.

1826
01:48:14,425 --> 01:48:16,160
There's too much purple.

1827
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:20,690
We're gonna
go downstairs together

1828
01:48:20,725 --> 01:48:23,190
and you're gonna remember
the purple

1829
01:48:23,225 --> 01:48:27,020
and this is the way
you're gonna remember it.

1830
01:48:27,055 --> 01:48:29,760
Maybe there's
nothing to remember.

1831
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:31,990
Sweetie, you're going
down the stairs,

1832
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:33,690
and I'll be with you.

1833
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,520
Chocolate.

1834
01:48:43,555 --> 01:48:45,020
Chocolate chippie.

1835
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,720
That's right. Come on.

1836
01:48:50,755 --> 01:48:53,060
Watch your feet.
You know how clumsy you are.

1837
01:48:53,095 --> 01:48:54,360
Come on.

1838
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:57,320
Come on.

1839
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:03,060
Have a nice trip.
See you next fall.

1840
01:49:03,095 --> 01:49:05,560
Hattie, is Sybil all right?

1841
01:49:05,595 --> 01:49:07,990
It's just
one of her falls, grandma!

1842
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:12,760
Oh, grandma,
what big ears you have.

1843
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,860
Here.

1844
01:49:19,895 --> 01:49:23,420
Made 4 dozen for that poor
woebegone floyd family

1845
01:49:23,455 --> 01:49:27,190
'cause it'd be a bleak Christmas
if nobody helped them out.

1846
01:49:27,225 --> 01:49:29,360
Come on. Keep momma company.

1847

All these years,
I never noticed that.

Look what I made
for the Christmas tree.

1863
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,260
What do you mean made?

1864
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,460
Oh, that's just
a picture out of a magazine

1865
01:50:39,495 --> 01:50:42,360
with a piece of tinfoil
stuck to it.

1866
01:50:42,395 --> 01:50:44,390
Grandma says it's pretty.

1867
01:50:44,425 --> 01:50:46,590
I go hang it
on the Christmas tree.

1868
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:49,760
I told you not to
run through the house!

1869
01:50:49,795 --> 01:50:51,120
I'm sorry.

1870
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:53,360

momma, come see what I did.

1884
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,790
You didn't go hang that thing
on that tree after I said that?

1885
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:40,190
Said what?

1886
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,290
Take it off.

1887
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:53,260
Take it off!

1888
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,520
Take it off!

1889
01:51:55,555 --> 01:51:57,060
You go away first.

1890
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,390
Reach around me.

1891
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,790
Go on. I dare you.

1892
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:13,560
Come on. Come on,
reach around me.

1893
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:22,260
I told you not to
run in the house.

1894
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:33,690
Don't you cry.
Don't you make faces.

1895
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:36,660
Don't you get mad.

1896
01:52:36,695 --> 01:52:38,790
Mad dogs get mad, not people.

1897
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,220
Now, don't worry.

1898
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:44,620
I'm not gonna hit you
this time.

1899
01:52:44,655 --> 01:52:46,420
This time
I'm only gonna kick you.

1900
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,420
You are so adorable
when you do that.

1901
01:53:00,455 --> 01:53:03,220
You look just like
a little baby crab.

1902
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:18,790
What are you going to do?
Draw a picture?

1903
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:19,890
Uh-huh.

1904
01:53:19,925 --> 01:53:21,420
Who for?

01:53:21,455 --> 01:53:23,290
Momma's Christmas stocking.

1906
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:26,790
Oh, what a lovely thought.

1907
01:53:26,825 --> 01:53:30,820
Even if I don't like made-up
things as much as factory ones.

1908
01:53:30,855 --> 01:53:33,660
When I'm a big girl,
I go work in a factory

1909
01:53:33,695 --> 01:53:36,390
and make you
something real pretty.

1910
01:53:36,425 --> 01:53:40,160
oh, Christmas tree

1911
01:53:40,195 --> 01:53:43,720
how lovely are
thy branches

1912
01:53:43,755 --> 01:53:46,390
come on, sing.

1913
01:53:46,425 --> 01:53:51,220
not only green
when summer glows

1914
01:53:51,255 --> 01:53:55,360
but in the winter
when it snows

1915
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:02,690
well, who ever heard of a
green chicken with purple feet?

1916
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:07,420
Can you picture what
kind of eggs that lays?

1917
01:54:07,455 --> 01:54:11,420
Set a platter of them in front of
grandpa some fine sabbath morning,

1918
01:54:11,455 --> 01:54:14,190
he'd sure take that for
a sign now, wouldn't he?

1919
01:54:14,225 --> 01:54:16,560
"Armageddon!"

1920
01:54:18,225 --> 01:54:21,360
oh, Christmas tree
oh, Christmas tree

1921
01:54:21,395 --> 01:54:25,720
you are the tree
most loved

1922
01:54:25,755 --> 01:54:30,690
how oft
you've given me delight

1923
01:54:30,725 --> 01:54:33,290
when Christmas fires

1924
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:35,160
are burning bright

1925
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:38,590
you think it's just
sunshine and singing

1926
01:54:38,625 --> 01:54:41,160
and pretty colors
when you grow up?

1927
01:54:41,195 --> 01:54:43,920
Well, I should say not.

1928
01:54:43,955 --> 01:54:47,420
You are bad.
You are spoiled rotten.

1929
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,390
And you better learn quick.

1930
01:54:51,625 --> 01:54:54,160
Mine! Mine!

1931
01:54:54,195 --> 01:54:57,060
Wanna break glass. Wanna break
glass. Hey! Wait a minute. Here.

1932
01:54:57,095 --> 01:55:00,190
Here, you wanna tear something
up? Come on, tear it. That's it.

1933
01:55:00,225 --> 01:55:01,460
I loved my colors.

1934
01:55:01,495 --> 01:55:02,690
Of course you did.

1935
01:55:02,725 --> 01:55:04,720
My colors are me.
Those are my colors.

1936
01:55:04,755 --> 01:55:06,920
Sweetie, hasn't it
ever occurred to Sybil

1937
01:55:06,955 --> 01:55:08,790
that good mommies
don't hurt their girls?

1938
01:55:08,825 --> 01:55:10,820
Mommies put your fingers
in the meat grinder.

1939
01:55:10,855 --> 01:55:12,120
No, they don't.
Not good ones.

1940
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,090
Mommies are only good
when other people around

1941
01:55:14,125 --> 01:55:15,560
not when they get you alone.

1942
01:55:15,595 --> 01:55:18,060
Dr. Wilbur doesn't hurt you
when you're alone, does she?

1943
01:55:18,095 --> 01:55:20,720
No, Dr. Wilbur thinks that
little girls should be happy,

1944
01:55:20,755 --> 01:55:24,420
especially little girls who can
paint green chickens with purple feet.

1945
01:55:24,455 --> 01:55:25,790
Momma.

1946
01:55:25,825 --> 01:55:27,320
What's the matter, sweetie?

1947
01:55:27,355 --> 01:55:28,920
What's happening?

1948
01:55:28,955 --> 01:55:31,290
My wrists are going numb.

1949
01:55:31,325 --> 01:55:34,360
Can you tell Dr. Wilbur
about it? Tell me about it.

1950
01:55:39,995 --> 01:55:42,990
Well, tell me about it. Tell
me. What's happening? Tell me.

1951
01:55:43,025 --> 01:55:44,760
What's happening, Peggy?

1952
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,720
You better say,
"God is love," real quick.

1953
01:55:51,755 --> 01:55:52,990
God is love.

1954
01:55:53,025 --> 01:55:55,120
Because God hates bad girls.

1955
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:58,620
And if they're real bad, he
takes them before their time.

1956
01:55:58,655 --> 01:56:02,160
Where does God take
bad little girls, momma?

1957
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,490
Where, momma?

1958
01:56:24,425 --> 01:56:28,420
He takes them way up into the
dark and leaves them there.

1959
01:56:28,455 --> 01:56:30,660
He lets them
drown in the wheat.

1960
01:56:30,695 --> 01:56:33,760
They can't breathe
and they die.

1961
01:56:33,795 --> 01:56:36,190
And that's what's
gonna happen to you.

1962
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:44,220
Have to do it.
Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am.

1963
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,320
Have to.

1964
01:56:47,355 --> 01:56:48,660
God is love.

1965
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,990
Who got you out, Sybil?

1966
01:56:52,025 --> 01:56:53,720
Daddy.

1967
01:56:53,755 --> 01:56:55,420
Momma told him the little
boy down the street did it.

1968
01:56:55,455 --> 01:56:56,690
What did daddy say?

1969
01:56:56,725 --> 01:56:58,290
Daddy said, "oh."

1970
01:56:58,325 --> 01:56:59,990
Daddy always believed momma.

1971
01:57:00,025 --> 01:57:01,390
You didn't tell daddy
the truth?

1972
01:57:01,425 --> 01:57:02,720
No, not supposed to.

1973
01:57:02,755 --> 01:57:05,220
Momma would send me to God.

1974
01:57:05,255 --> 01:57:06,460
What are you doing?

1975
01:57:06,495 --> 01:57:08,160
Drawing with
my purple crayon.

1976
01:57:08,195 --> 01:57:10,920
Why? So someone will know I was here.

1977
01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:19,020
Sweetie, that bad end-of-the-world
feeling is not the end of the world.

1978
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:23,590
It's just the coming
of your own anger

1979
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:26,320
and the color
of that anger is purple.

1980
01:57:26,355 --> 01:57:29,060
I don't want it.
I'm afraid of it.

1981
01:57:29,095 --> 01:57:32,060
I know, but avoiding it is
just what's getting in the way

1982
01:57:32,095 --> 01:57:34,490
of your doing anything.

1983
01:57:34,525 --> 01:57:37,090
Don't you be mad at momma,
or she'll get you.

1984
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:39,860
No, sweetie.
She won't get me.

1985
01:57:39,895 --> 01:57:42,190
I'm stronger than she is.

1986
01:57:42,225 --> 01:57:44,690
And I'll get just as mad
at momma as I like

1987
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:47,190
and I'll stay
mad at her for you

1988
01:57:47,225 --> 01:57:49,660
until you are able
to do it for yourself.

1989
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:58,290
All right, we're gonna leave
Willow Corners now.

1990
01:57:58,325 --> 01:58:01,060
I don't ever wanna
go back there again.

1991
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:04,790
We're coming back
into the present.

1992
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:10,160
You're 6, 14, 21, 29.

1993
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:12,320
This is too fast.

1994
01:58:12,355 --> 01:58:14,520
It's all right to come into
the present, sweetie,

1995
01:58:14,555 --> 01:58:16,690
because I'm in the present.

1996
01:58:16,725 --> 01:58:19,860
Your mother is dead and buried
in a grave in kansas city.

1997
01:58:19,895 --> 01:58:21,020
Mother's dead?

1998
01:58:21,055 --> 01:58:22,220
She's dead.

1999
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:24,790
It's all right.

2000
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:32,590
Now you'll only remember
what it's safe to remember.

2001
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:42,690
I'm so anxious.

2002
01:58:42,725 --> 01:58:45,390
Sweetie, you've survived.

2003
01:58:45,425 --> 01:58:48,590
That you've found such a
creative alternative to insanity

2004
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,220
is miraculous

2005
01:58:50,255 --> 01:58:52,990
and it-it will protect you
till you don't need it anymore.

2006
01:58:53,025 --> 01:58:55,720
But what if I can't
cook dinner for Richard?

2007
01:58:55,755 --> 01:58:58,320
I'm so worried
about being embarrassed.

2008
01:58:58,355 --> 01:58:59,860
You're protected, sweetie.

2009
01:58:59,895 --> 01:59:01,620
Vicky wouldn't let
you be embarrassed.

2010
01:59:01,655 --> 01:59:03,220
She'll call on
one of the others.

2011
01:59:03,255 --> 01:59:06,620
Vanessa's more comfortable
with Richard than you are.

2012
01:59:06,655 --> 01:59:09,620
I envy her so.

2013
01:59:09,655 --> 01:59:13,190
And now I'm gonna suggest that
when you wake up in the morning,

2014
01:59:13,225 --> 01:59:14,760
and it's Christmas,

2015
01:59:14,795 --> 01:59:16,690
you will have
a beautiful day.

2016
01:59:16,725 --> 01:59:20,460
A day that's all yours, that you
can do anything you like with.

2017
01:59:20,495 --> 01:59:23,660
Paint pretty place cards
for Richard and Matthew

2018
01:59:23,695 --> 01:59:26,520
and put red candles
on the table.

2019
01:59:26,555 --> 01:59:28,820
Oh, it'll-it'll be so nice.

2020
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,860
Hands, please.

2021
01:59:33,125 --> 01:59:35,260
Can we reach? Yeah, I guess.

2022
01:59:36,595 --> 01:59:38,360
Ok, ladies first.

2023
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:43,560
Um, I wish...

2024
01:59:43,595 --> 01:59:46,690
well, my wish is taken care
of because you're both here

2025
01:59:46,725 --> 01:59:49,460
and that's my wish.

2026
01:59:49,495 --> 01:59:52,020
I wish for a red dump truck.

2027
01:59:53,795 --> 01:59:56,720
Love, joy,
and peace to us all.

2028
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:01,990
When in doubt, eat.

2029
02:00:02,025 --> 02:00:04,120
So let's begin.

2030
02:00:04,155 --> 02:00:06,520
I used to hate
Christmas at home.

2031
02:00:06,555 --> 02:00:10,020
All those aunts and uncles
sprawling around, too full to move

2032
02:00:10,055 --> 02:00:12,360
winding their watches
and saying,

2033
02:00:12,395 --> 02:00:13,990
"don't you think
it's about time

2034
02:00:14,025 --> 02:00:15,960
we got this show
on the road?"

2035
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:20,890
I think I'll see
about the chicken.

2036
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:25,490
Stay, please.
It won't run away.

2037
02:00:25,525 --> 02:00:28,860
You know, sometimes it's nice
to be quiet for a change.

2038
02:00:30,525 --> 02:00:33,520
I feel all out
here some place.

2039
02:00:33,555 --> 02:00:37,120
I feel like I'm floating
around outside myself.

2040
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:42,260
I think I'd feel closer
if we talked long distance.

2041
02:00:42,295 --> 02:00:45,360
We have time.
We'll get there.

2042
02:00:45,395 --> 02:00:48,520
Where are we going,
daddy?

2043
02:00:48,555 --> 02:00:51,220
Not that kind
of getting there, Matthew.

2044
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:55,890
Anybody interested in
a drumstick?

2045
02:00:55,925 --> 02:00:57,590
Me, please.

2046
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:02,020
Hello?

2047
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,290
Hello?

2048
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:08,290
This is long distance.

2049
02:01:08,325 --> 02:01:12,060
This is long distance
calling Miss Sybil Dorsett.

2050
02:01:12,095 --> 02:01:13,790
Hello.

2051
02:01:13,825 --> 02:01:17,720
Hiya, Slats.
Uh, my name is Lefty.

2052
02:01:17,755 --> 02:01:19,090
How do you do, Lefty?

2053
02:01:19,125 --> 02:01:21,190
Well, uh, I'll tell you.

2054
02:01:21,225 --> 02:01:26,320
Don't trace this call, see,
and don't ask no questions.

2055
02:01:26,355 --> 02:01:29,890
Before I go on the lam
with my sidekick here

2056
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:32,360
Matt the rat,

2057
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:34,920
I, uh...

2058
02:01:34,955 --> 02:01:38,420
I want you to slip me the key
to the downstairs door

2059
02:01:38,455 --> 02:01:40,760
so I can get back in.

2060
02:01:40,795 --> 02:01:42,660
Ok, Slats?

2061
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:45,190
'Cause I don't like
long distance.

2062
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:50,390
Slats?

2063
02:01:50,425 --> 02:01:52,120
You still there?

2064
02:01:52,155 --> 02:01:53,560
I think so.

2065
02:01:53,595 --> 02:01:56,460
Yeah, well, uh, you gotta
give me an answer quick.

2066
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:01,390
I don't want you
to be disappointed, Lefty.

2067
02:02:01,425 --> 02:02:03,960
I got no expectations, Slats.

2068
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:25,660
be right there.

2069
02:02:25,695 --> 02:02:27,860
Oh, Vanessa,
you look just fine.

2070
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:51,120
You know, a key wouldn't do
much good against all this.

2071
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:53,090
You need a scaling ladder.

2072
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:55,620
I guess it's called security.

2073
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,120
Open your Christmas present.

2074
02:02:58,155 --> 02:02:59,620
Oh, Richard.

2075
02:02:59,655 --> 02:03:01,320
"Oh, Richard."

2076
02:03:01,355 --> 02:03:03,890
I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna do this.

2077
02:03:03,925 --> 02:03:05,820
I'm a congenital liar.

2078
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:07,820
Oh!

2079
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:14,620
Remind me never to let you
take off a bandage.

2080
02:03:14,655 --> 02:03:17,890
Well, if I'm very careful
and don't tear it,

2081
02:03:17,925 --> 02:03:20,590
then I can draw
on the back of it.

2082
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:23,460
You draw on the whole thing.

2083
02:03:23,495 --> 02:03:25,420
It's only watercolor paper.

2084
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:28,690
Oh, Richard.

2085
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,760
It's the most beautiful paper.
Thank you.

2086
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:41,860
I want- I want you- you
don't have to say anything.

2087
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,660
The nightgown says it all.

2088
02:03:47,190 --> 02:03:49,890
You want closeness,
that's all.

2089
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,160
I never

2090
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,920
exactly had closeness.

2091
02:03:57,955 --> 02:04:02,690
Love, I told you one time,
you're only 12 years old.

2092
02:04:02,725 --> 02:04:04,890
Now, anything more
would be illegal.

2093
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:21,420
You mind if I undress?

2094
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:26,660
I'm really interesting.

2095
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:33,090
We had male models
in art school.

2096
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,360
Ok.

2097
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:19,320
Well, I don't think this bed
was made for masculine shoulders

2098
02:05:19,355 --> 02:05:21,290
because there's
no room for me.

2099
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:24,420
There's room.

2100
02:05:24,455 --> 02:05:25,660
There is.

2101
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:37,590
Well, well, well.

2102
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:05,720
I think I'm gonna fall out.

2103
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:24,690
Lefty.

2104
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:26,820
Slats.

2105
02:06:29,890 --> 02:06:33,820
This is a very
unexpected Christmas.

2106
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:39,020
Yeah. For me, too.

2107
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:42,160
When you talk,
your chest vibrates

2108
02:06:42,195 --> 02:06:44,760
like a piano
with the hood down.

2109
02:06:44,795 --> 02:06:49,290
o, tannenbaum,
o, tannenbaum

2110
02:06:49,325 --> 02:06:51,390
you're tickling my ear.

2111
02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:30,060
oh, Christmas tree

2112
02:07:30,095 --> 02:07:32,890
how lovely are
thy branches

2113
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:58,520
hey, come on. It's ok.

2114
02:09:58,555 --> 02:10:00,160
Wake up. You're dreaming.

2115
02:10:01,525 --> 02:10:04,190
Come-come- come on.
Let me help you down, ok?

2116
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:08,590
I don't want to see
the kitty cat.

2117
02:10:08,625 --> 02:10:10,020
There is no kitty cat.

2118
02:10:10,055 --> 02:10:12,490
I don't want to see it.
No, don't.

2119
02:10:12,525 --> 02:10:14,720
You got suction cups
on your toes or something?

2120
02:10:14,755 --> 02:10:18,360
It's not there? It's not there?
The kitty cat is not there?

2121
02:10:18,395 --> 02:10:19,920
No.

2122
02:10:19,955 --> 02:10:23,790
I don't wanna see it. I
don't wanna see it. No, don't.

2123
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:27,220
You're not Danny.

2124
02:10:27,255 --> 02:10:28,520
No.

2125
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:32,890
The people. The people.

2126
02:10:32,925 --> 02:10:34,690
They watch. They watch.

2127
02:10:35,925 --> 02:10:37,820
Now,
what're you talking about?

2128
02:10:39,725 --> 02:10:43,320
Out, I will get out. I will go
some place. I will go some place.

2129
02:10:43,355 --> 02:10:45,820
I'll go to- I'll go to
New York. I'll go to New York.

2130
02:10:45,855 --> 02:10:47,860
You're in New York.
I'll find my Dr. Wilbur.

2131
02:10:47,895 --> 02:10:49,760
She'll be glad to see me.
Who's Dr. Wilbur?

2132
02:10:49,795 --> 02:10:51,860
She'll know what to do.
I have to find purse.

2133
02:10:51,895 --> 02:10:53,460
Purse.
Who's Dr. Wilbur?

2134
02:10:53,495 --> 02:10:56,120
That's all right. I'll hitchhike.
I'll hitchhike. I want my suitcase.

2135
02:10:56,155 --> 02:10:57,960
You'll hitchhike where?
You can't go anywhere

2136
02:10:57,995 --> 02:11:00,190
unless you are somewhere and
you don't know where you are.

2137
02:11:00,225 --> 02:11:03,290
Suitcase. I want my suitcase. Sybil!

2138
02:11:03,325 --> 02:11:05,590
Sybil, who is Dr. Wilbur?
Don't do this to me!

2139
02:11:05,625 --> 02:11:07,290
Who is-
don't do this to me!

2140
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:21,490
They said not to
go to the movies.

2141
02:11:21,525 --> 02:11:23,220
The movies were...

2142
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:29,260
do I go to the movies? No.

2143
02:11:29,295 --> 02:11:31,890
We went to radio city
this morning.

2144
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:39,660
Sybil, is Dr. Wilbur
a psychiatrist?

2145
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:45,290
Were we talking about art?

2146
02:11:45,325 --> 02:11:47,760
Were we talking
about the ballet?

2147
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,190
I can't cook dinner.

2148
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:54,920
Oh!

2149
02:11:54,955 --> 02:11:58,090
Is this Marcia?
Is she doing this to me?

2150
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:01,860
It's not the end of the world.

2151
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,520
It's the end of me.

2152
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:06,720
Sybil.

2153
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,820
Stay. Don't leave!

2154
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:55,560
information, l-I need a-a
number for a Dr. Wilbur.

2155
02:12:55,595 --> 02:12:56,920
A psychiatrist.

2156
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:27,890
nothing matters now.

2157
02:13:47,895 --> 02:13:49,260
thank you.

2158
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:51,420
Hello.

2159
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:53,020
Who?

2160
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:56,490
Richard Loomis?

2161
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,590
What's the matter?

2162
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:02,260
Well, how did the dinner go?

2163
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,090
Yes, well, the thing
about it is, you see,

2164
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:12,960
you probably don't know
who you're dealing with.

2165
02:14:12,995 --> 02:14:14,820
So I'm gonna have to, uh...

2166
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:18,620
to break
a professional confidence.

2167
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:24,190
Oh, my god.

2168
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:29,460
My little boy tried to tell me
that, you know, in different words.

2169
02:14:29,495 --> 02:14:32,990
If she's feeling the way that you
say she is, she's probably Marcia.

2170
02:14:33,025 --> 02:14:36,060
So you can just feel free
to call her by her name.

2171
02:14:36,095 --> 02:14:37,660
But would you tell her
something for me?

2172
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:39,860
Tell her I said
it's perfectly ok

2173
02:14:39,895 --> 02:14:41,990
to think about
killing herself

2174
02:14:42,025 --> 02:14:44,760
but would she please just
wait until I get there.

2175
02:14:46,025 --> 02:14:47,960
She's on the roof.
I gotta go.

2176
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:05,420
Sybil.

2177
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:09,060
Sybil.

2178
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:12,590
There is no Sybil now.

2179
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:16,060
Don't you come near me.

2180
02:15:16,095 --> 02:15:18,360
I won't.

2181
02:15:18,395 --> 02:15:21,220
Hey, l-I don't think
we've met yet.

2182
02:15:21,255 --> 02:15:23,420
My name is Richard. Hi.

2183
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:27,290
Aren't you gonna tell me
who you are?

2184
02:15:27,325 --> 02:15:28,790
Well, I've been talking
to Dr. Wilbur

2185
02:15:28,825 --> 02:15:30,560
and she thought
that maybe you were Marcia

2186
02:15:30,595 --> 02:15:32,660
so I'm gonna
call you Marcia, ok?

2187
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:35,890
How-how are you,
Marcia?

2188
02:15:35,925 --> 02:15:38,260
That's a very pretty scarf
you have on.

2189
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:43,520
You're trying to get me to
wait until Dr. Wilbur gets here.

2190
02:15:43,555 --> 02:15:45,390
Well, it won't work.
Marcia!

2191
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,160
Marcia. Marcia, you know, that
- that's an awfully long fall down there.

2192
02:15:53,195 --> 02:15:55,520
It's 5 stories. Now,
I'm only considering Matthew.

2193
02:15:55,555 --> 02:15:58,090
D- d-do you know Matthew?
He likes you.

2194
02:15:59,355 --> 02:16:00,790
He loves Vanessa.

2195
02:16:00,825 --> 02:16:02,660
No, not-not-not
just Vanessa.

2196
02:16:02,695 --> 02:16:05,460
H- he knew about all of you long before
I ever did. I mean, he sensed it.

2197
02:16:05,495 --> 02:16:08,560
Anyway, he said to me, "daddy,
Sybil is just stuffed with people."

2198
02:16:08,595 --> 02:16:10,260
He did?
Yeah.

2199
02:16:10,295 --> 02:16:12,720
I guess that's because
we're all children, too.

2200
02:16:12,755 --> 02:16:14,620
Yeah, and-and you see,
the point-the point is

2201
02:16:14,655 --> 02:16:16,920
that- that's-that's Matt's
window right down there.

2202
02:16:16,955 --> 02:16:18,620
That's the lair
of Matt the rat, Slats,

2203
02:16:18,655 --> 02:16:21,060
and-and if- and if you land
down there in that courtyard,

2204
02:16:21,095 --> 02:16:23,260
that's what Matt is gonna
remember for the rest of his life.

2205
02:16:23,295 --> 02:16:24,960
His good friend
looking like-

2206
02:16:24,995 --> 02:16:27,860
then I'll go over there, on the
other side, where he can't see.

2207
02:16:27,895 --> 02:16:31,920
Where? Over there? That
- that's a street. You might hit somebody.

2208
02:16:31,955 --> 02:16:33,860
I won't know them.

2209
02:16:33,895 --> 02:16:35,390
Oh, yeah.

2210
02:16:35,425 --> 02:16:37,860
Yeah, yeah,
that-that-that makes sense.

2211
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:43,360
You move back over there.

2212
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,820
Where? Where? Here?

2213
02:16:45,855 --> 02:16:47,020
Further.

2214
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:49,090
Here?

2215
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:52,420
And promise me now, you promise
me you won't try to stop me.

2216
02:16:52,455 --> 02:16:53,860
Well, I promise.

2217
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:03,360
No! You promised.
You promised.

2218
02:17:03,395 --> 02:17:05,320
I told you
I was a congenital liar.

2219
02:17:05,355 --> 02:17:07,290
Don't. Don't trap me.
It will get worse.

2220
02:17:07,325 --> 02:17:09,220
It'll get worse.
Let me do it.

2221
02:17:09,255 --> 02:17:12,060
Oh, please. Please,
why won't you let me do it?

2222
02:17:12,095 --> 02:17:13,990
Why won't you let me do it?

2223
02:17:20,390 --> 02:17:21,860
The people, the hand.

2224
02:17:21,895 --> 02:17:23,260
And the people.
And the people.

2225
02:17:23,295 --> 02:17:25,620
Their hands, and the water.
The water, and the water.

2226
02:17:25,655 --> 02:17:27,220
You just lay still,
young lady.

2227
02:17:27,255 --> 02:17:28,560
You just lay still.

2228
02:17:28,595 --> 02:17:30,960
You move a muscle and...
you move a muscle and...

2229
02:17:30,995 --> 02:17:33,620
I can see it. I can see it.
In the kitchen. In the kitchen.

2230
02:17:33,655 --> 02:17:36,090
It's all green, and it's
dripping, and it's in the sink.

2231
02:17:36,125 --> 02:17:37,660
I can see it. I can see it.

2232
02:17:37,695 --> 02:17:39,520
It's not cold enough,
young lady.

2233
02:17:39,555 --> 02:17:41,220
It's not cold enough.
You just lay still.

2234
02:17:41,255 --> 02:17:43,260
Please, don't!

2235
02:17:43,295 --> 02:17:46,060
I know who you are. I know
who you are. You're Danny.

2236
02:17:46,095 --> 02:17:47,890
You're Danny. I know Danny.
Uh-huh.

2237
02:17:47,925 --> 02:17:49,660
Danny likes me.
I like Danny.

2238
02:17:49,695 --> 02:17:51,490
He dances for me,
and he sings.

2239
02:17:51,525 --> 02:17:53,290
He dances.
He sings like Fred astaire.

2240
02:17:53,325 --> 02:17:55,760
lovely I know him.
I know him. I know him.

2241
02:17:55,795 --> 02:17:58,490
never, ever change I know
him. I know him. I know him.

2242
02:17:58,525 --> 02:18:00,020
I know him.

2243
02:18:00,055 --> 02:18:01,620
keep that breathless charm I know him.

2244
02:18:03,225 --> 02:18:04,660
Don't touch me.
You're burning my skin off.

2245
02:18:04,695 --> 02:18:06,390
You're burning my skin off.

2246
02:18:06,425 --> 02:18:07,660
Sybil!

2247
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:10,660
Why are we here?

2248
02:18:10,695 --> 02:18:12,920
Marcia's trying to kill herself.
She's trying to kill you.

2249
02:18:12,955 --> 02:18:14,960
Don't hold me.
Don't hold on to me.

2250
02:18:14,995 --> 02:18:16,620
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.
Please let her do it.

2251
02:18:16,655 --> 02:18:18,490
Please let her do it.
Please let her do it.

2252
02:18:18,525 --> 02:18:20,160
It's all right.
I'm afraid to let her go.

2253
02:18:20,195 --> 02:18:21,990
Sybil. Sybil!

2254
02:18:22,025 --> 02:18:23,820
Dr. Wilbur. It's all right. It's all right.

2255
02:18:23,855 --> 02:18:25,460
Dr. Wilbur.
Ok, just hold on a minute.

2256
02:18:25,495 --> 02:18:27,660
Dr. Wilbur. Let me get...
dear, it's all right.

2257
02:18:27,695 --> 02:18:28,860
Oh, your coat is so pretty.

2258
02:18:28,895 --> 02:18:30,660
It's all right.
It's all right.

2259
02:18:30,695 --> 02:18:32,860
I'm gonna give you... you're gonna
get your dress dirty, Dr. Wilbur.

2260
02:18:32,895 --> 02:18:35,990
No, no. No. I'm gonna give you
some sedation is what I'm gonna do

2261
02:18:36,025 --> 02:18:38,790
and it's gonna make you feel
better and take away the hurt, ok?

2262
02:18:38,825 --> 02:18:41,620
Dr. Wilbur,
please let her do it.

2263
02:18:41,655 --> 02:18:43,060
No, no. No, no, no.

2264
02:18:43,095 --> 02:18:44,720
Please don't get
your dress dirty.

2265
02:18:44,755 --> 02:18:47,690
Don't get dirty, please.
You look so pretty.

2266
02:18:47,725 --> 02:18:50,160
Oh, I'm scared of that.
Scared.

2267
02:18:50,195 --> 02:18:51,720
It's ok.
I'm scared.

2268
02:18:51,755 --> 02:18:53,390
No, it's all right.

2269
02:18:53,425 --> 02:18:54,860
There, ok?

2270
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:06,060
You have 4 earrings.

2271
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:11,290
Yeah, I got 4 earrings,
but I only got 2 on.

2272
02:19:11,325 --> 02:19:14,120
That's just the medicine, ok?

2273
02:19:14,155 --> 02:19:15,790
Give me a hand.

2274
02:19:16,890 --> 02:19:18,660
Come on, sweetie.
All right.

2275
02:19:18,695 --> 02:19:19,990
All right?
Yeah.

2276
02:19:20,025 --> 02:19:21,120
Ok.

2277
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,020
Come on, sweetie.

2278
02:19:28,055 --> 02:19:30,520
Is he gone?
I don't want him to see me.

2279
02:19:30,555 --> 02:19:32,990
It's all right.
Here. Come on.

2280
02:19:33,025 --> 02:19:34,320
There you go.

2281
02:19:34,355 --> 02:19:35,790
He's so thoughtful.

2282
02:19:35,825 --> 02:19:39,720
You know, if he goes to get
a glass of water for himself

2283
02:19:39,755 --> 02:19:41,720
he never just brings one.

2284
02:19:41,755 --> 02:19:43,260
He brings 2,
and then he says,

2285
02:19:43,295 --> 02:19:45,190
"I thought maybe
you'd be thirsty."

2286
02:19:45,225 --> 02:19:46,960
Isn't that thoughtful?
Mmm-hmm.

2287
02:19:46,995 --> 02:19:48,290
Isn't that considerate?

2288
02:19:48,325 --> 02:19:50,160
That's quite considerate,
yes.

2289
02:19:50,195 --> 02:19:52,860
You don't find that
very often nowadays.

2290
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,460
What is it I felt
for my grandma?

2291
02:19:58,495 --> 02:19:59,790
Was that love?

2292
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:02,760
Yeah, that was love,
sweetie.

2293
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:06,560
And Danny, was that love?

2294
02:20:07,090 --> 02:20:08,360
Mmm-hmm.

2295
02:20:10,325 --> 02:20:12,520
That's what it is
with Richard then.

2296
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:16,760
Dr. Wilbur.

2297
02:20:16,795 --> 02:20:19,290
Mmm-hmm?

2298
02:20:19,325 --> 02:20:21,420
Is it all right if i
don't see him again

2299
02:20:21,455 --> 02:20:24,090
until after we pull
ourselves together?

2300
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:27,690
Mmm-hmm.

2301
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:32,260
I don't know how to tell him.

2302
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:42,760
I think he'll know
without you telling him.

2303
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:48,220
$0.21 a pound.
All right, I'll take it.

2304
02:21:48,255 --> 02:21:49,360
Pay the girl.
I'll go inside.

2305
02:21:49,395 --> 02:21:50,490
Go inside.

2306
02:21:50,525 --> 02:21:52,060
Ah, that's nice.

2307
02:21:52,095 --> 02:21:54,790
There, that should drive the
winter out of the corners.

2308
02:21:54,825 --> 02:21:58,490
Yeah. I, uh, I passed the park
on the way to work this morning.

2309
02:21:58,525 --> 02:22:00,960
There was a guy cutting
the grass. I got one whiff

2310
02:22:00,995 --> 02:22:03,620
and already I'm thinking about
2 weeks in the mountains, huh?

2311
02:22:03,655 --> 02:22:05,390
Have a care, Mr. Rizo.

2312
02:22:05,425 --> 02:22:07,860
Spring is the mischief in us,
as the poet says.

2313
02:22:07,895 --> 02:22:10,660
Yeah. Have a good day.

2314
02:22:19,355 --> 02:22:21,620
Richard moved away.
Did I tell you?

2315
02:22:21,655 --> 02:22:24,090
No, Marcia did.

2316
02:22:24,125 --> 02:22:25,960
How did that make you feel?

2317
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:29,660
My kitty bothers me.

2318
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:34,960
I ask you how it feels
to have Richard move

2319
02:22:34,995 --> 02:22:37,160
and you tell me
your kitty bothers you.

2320
02:22:37,195 --> 02:22:38,860
That's interesting.

2321
02:22:38,895 --> 02:22:42,420
Let's not talk about it. It'll
just open up a whole can of peas.

2322
02:22:42,455 --> 02:22:45,590
No, what it might open up
is a whole nest of kittens,

2323
02:22:45,625 --> 02:22:47,120
which is something
we've avoided

2324
02:22:47,155 --> 02:22:48,620
every time you've
dreamed about them.

2325
02:22:48,655 --> 02:22:50,190
Now, maybe there is
a connection

2326
02:22:50,225 --> 02:22:52,520
between your anger
at Richard moving

2327
02:22:52,555 --> 02:22:54,660
and your-
there isn't any anger.

2328
02:22:54,695 --> 02:22:57,090
Sweetie, your anger
at the headless cat.

2329
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:00,960
Curiosity killed the cat,
so don't wonder.

2330
02:23:03,455 --> 02:23:05,760
Curiosity didn't
tear its head off.

2331
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,220
Now, who did that?

2332
02:23:08,255 --> 02:23:10,560
You wanted to get
rid of momma, right?

2333
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:14,590
That's one theory.

2334
02:23:14,625 --> 02:23:16,490
There are a million theories.

2335
02:23:16,525 --> 02:23:19,220
You pick one.
I'll agree to anything.

2336
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:23,560
I see.

2337
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:25,420
You always say, "I see."

2338
02:23:25,455 --> 02:23:27,390
You know,
Marcia was so afraid

2339
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:29,820
of wanting to kill momma

2340
02:23:29,855 --> 02:23:32,790
that she almost killed herself
for just having the thought.

2341
02:23:32,825 --> 02:23:35,420
I don't know Marcia.
I'm not interested.

2342
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:42,460
Marcia told me about a memory
she had about a little box.

2343
02:23:42,495 --> 02:23:45,890
Why do I have to remember
something that didn't happen to me?

2344
02:23:45,925 --> 02:23:47,760
Why can't I blank out?

2345
02:23:47,795 --> 02:23:50,460
Because you can stand some of
those feelings now, sweetie.

2346
02:23:50,495 --> 02:23:52,120
You're getting stronger.

2347
02:23:52,155 --> 02:23:54,720
Now, can't you tell me
about the little box?

2348
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:58,560
It started to grow.
It got bigger.

2349
02:23:58,595 --> 02:24:00,390
That's right.

2350
02:24:00,425 --> 02:24:03,320
And it grew bigger until it
was big enough to put momma in.

2351
02:24:03,355 --> 02:24:05,320
In fact, it turned
into a coffin, didn't it?

2352
02:24:05,355 --> 02:24:07,920
I did not wanna
get rid of momma.

2353
02:24:07,955 --> 02:24:09,820
I wanted to get rid
of the hurt.

2354
02:24:09,855 --> 02:24:12,890
I wanted the hurt to
go away, not momma.

2355
02:24:12,925 --> 02:24:14,920
I didn't mean anything bad.

2356
02:24:14,955 --> 02:24:18,860
Sweetie, it's not bad to wanna
get rid of something that hurts.

2357
02:24:18,895 --> 02:24:20,820
And momma was
just one big hurt

2358
02:24:20,855 --> 02:24:22,190
with a name attached to it.

2359
02:24:22,225 --> 02:24:24,360
It was still my momma.

2360
02:24:24,395 --> 02:24:26,360
That was
an accident of nature.

2361
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:32,760
Sybil,
a wish can't kill people.

2362
02:24:32,795 --> 02:24:34,820
Now, if the world
has to turn purple

2363
02:24:34,855 --> 02:24:36,990
and little children
have to kill themselves

2364
02:24:37,025 --> 02:24:38,990
because they wish
their mothers were dead,

2365
02:24:39,025 --> 02:24:41,420
there wouldn't be
anybody left on earth.

2366
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:48,260
Sybil, you're not
listening to me.

2367
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:52,920
You're thinking about
suicide again, aren't you?

2368
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:55,590
Why do you
wanna kill yourself

2369
02:24:55,625 --> 02:24:57,420
instead of doing
what we have to do?

2370
02:24:57,455 --> 02:24:58,860
Why do you wanna kill this

2371
02:24:58,895 --> 02:25:00,590
wonderfully
creative organism

2372
02:25:00,625 --> 02:25:02,190
before you've
even begun to live?

2373
02:25:02,225 --> 02:25:03,560
I don't like it
when you're angry.

2374
02:25:03,595 --> 02:25:05,720
I'm not angry. I'm definite.

2375
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:08,390
You insult me, my dear.

2376
02:25:08,425 --> 02:25:10,060
You insult my heart.

2377
02:25:10,095 --> 02:25:12,490
Well, just look at me.
Can't you see what I am?

2378
02:25:12,525 --> 02:25:14,760
I have looked at you
and looked at you

2379
02:25:14,795 --> 02:25:17,960
for month after month after
month and I have seen you.

2380
02:25:17,995 --> 02:25:19,760
You haven't seen anything.

2381
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:23,860
And I wasn't thinking
about suicide.

2382
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:27,190
I was thinking about

2383
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,890
what a charade this is.

2384
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:35,720
Dr. Wilbur,
I can't go on like this.

2385
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:40,120
You better sit down.
I have a big shock for you.

2386
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:52,620
It's a lie.

2387
02:25:53,390 --> 02:25:55,060
The whole thing.

2388
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:58,760
I don't have
multiple personalities.

2389
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:01,660
Not even one.

2390
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:04,160
It's just me.

2391
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,660
I don't- I don't even know

2392
02:26:07,695 --> 02:26:09,460
why I got started.

2393
02:26:09,495 --> 02:26:11,890
All the things
I told you about my mother,

2394
02:26:11,925 --> 02:26:14,390
they're all lies,
every one of them.

2395
02:26:14,425 --> 02:26:16,820
She spoiled me rotten,
watched me every single second.

2396
02:26:16,855 --> 02:26:18,260
You know,
it interests me, Sybil

2397
02:26:18,295 --> 02:26:20,620
that the denial comes at
this particular time.

2398
02:26:20,655 --> 02:26:21,920
This is not a denial.

2399
02:26:21,955 --> 02:26:23,220
Excuse me, sweetie,

2400
02:26:23,255 --> 02:26:26,260
but it comes on the eve
of my Chicago lectures

2401
02:26:26,295 --> 02:26:28,560
which must seem like some
kind of abandonment to you

2402
02:26:28,595 --> 02:26:30,160
the way Richard
abandoned you.

2403
02:26:30,195 --> 02:26:31,620
No, it's nothing like that.

2404
02:26:31,655 --> 02:26:33,260
And 2, we are at a place

2405
02:26:33,295 --> 02:26:35,390
where the most
terrifying memories of all

2406
02:26:35,425 --> 02:26:37,260
are just below the surface.

2407
02:26:37,295 --> 02:26:39,560
Dr. Wilbur, excuse me,

2408
02:26:39,595 --> 02:26:43,060
but this simply is not
denial or resistance

2409
02:26:43,095 --> 02:26:45,320
or any of those
patient tricks.

2410
02:26:45,355 --> 02:26:47,820
It is an admission
of culpability.

2411
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:52,490
I'm sorry.

2412
02:26:52,525 --> 02:26:55,460
I know I owe you a fortune,
and you'll be paid.

2413
02:26:55,495 --> 02:26:58,360
But to go on like this
would be very cruel.

2414
02:26:58,395 --> 02:27:00,520
You're too good
a person for that.

2415
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:09,860
So I think what I should do is
take my father up on his offer

2416
02:27:09,895 --> 02:27:11,660
and stay in that
sunny little room

2417
02:27:11,695 --> 02:27:13,520
where all my things
will fit just perfect

2418
02:27:13,555 --> 02:27:15,320
as the famous frieda says.

2419
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,760
Are you Sybil?

2420
02:27:19,795 --> 02:27:21,960
Of course I'm Sybil.
Who else would I be?

2421
02:27:21,995 --> 02:27:24,960
What happened in
the green kitchen?

2422
02:27:24,995 --> 02:27:27,520
That's my cue to
turn into Peggy, right?

2423
02:27:27,555 --> 02:27:30,620
Dr. Wilbur, there is
no Peggy to turn into.

2424
02:27:30,655 --> 02:27:32,260
Do you mind if I test that?

2425
02:27:32,295 --> 02:27:33,920
Hypnosis? Be my guest.

2426
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:39,020
All right, would you
lie down on the sofa?

2427
02:27:39,055 --> 02:27:40,720
Sur le couch?

2428
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:44,460
Only Vicky's supposed
to know that, right?

2429
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:49,090
"Now, dear heart,

2430
02:27:49,125 --> 02:27:51,190
"I want you to
look at Nehemiah.

2431
02:27:51,225 --> 02:27:52,990
"You will look at
Nehemiah, sweetie,

2432
02:27:53,025 --> 02:27:55,360
and I will ask to
speak to the others."

2433
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:59,860
I've really gotten it down,
haven't i, doctor?

2434
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:11,990
In my Chicago hotel room,

2435
02:28:12,025 --> 02:28:13,860
I started to think
that Sybil's denial

2436
02:28:13,895 --> 02:28:16,190
might actually have been
her first breakthrough.

2437
02:28:16,225 --> 02:28:17,990
Maybe the selves
had banded together

2438
02:28:18,025 --> 02:28:19,820
to stop me from
taking Sybil down

2439
02:28:19,855 --> 02:28:22,020
to the most
dangerous place of all.

2440
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:39,960
Hello. Yeah, I'd like another
Chicago number, please.

2441
02:28:42,460 --> 02:28:44,960
Well, I'm sorry, but I'll
just have to keep on asking

2442
02:28:44,995 --> 02:28:46,660
until somebody puts
a phone book in here.

2443
02:28:46,695 --> 02:28:49,020
I've got 2 bibles
and no phone book.

2444
02:28:49,055 --> 02:28:52,220
The person I'm looking for
isn't in the bible.

2445
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:55,520
A Dorsett, willard Dorsett.

2446
02:28:55,555 --> 02:28:57,990
You understand,
Mr. Dorsett, I just wanna

2447
02:28:58,025 --> 02:29:00,060
tie up some loose ends,
so to speak.

2448
02:29:00,095 --> 02:29:01,760
So you came to
the horse's mouth.

2449
02:29:01,795 --> 02:29:02,920
Is that it?

2450
02:29:02,955 --> 02:29:05,120
It seemed
the sensible thing to do.

2451
02:29:05,155 --> 02:29:06,360
I, uh...

2452
02:29:06,395 --> 02:29:09,290
I do recall a bruise or 2

2453
02:29:09,325 --> 02:29:10,660
from time to time.

2454
02:29:10,695 --> 02:29:12,390
I see.

2455
02:29:12,425 --> 02:29:16,720
Well, tell me, do you recall
a broken larynx?

2456
02:29:22,390 --> 02:29:24,990
Well, now you say it,
it seems I do.

2457
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:29,090
Ran into a clothesline,
I believe.

2458
02:29:29,125 --> 02:29:30,460
Oh, who said that?

2459
02:29:30,495 --> 02:29:31,720
My wife, I suppose.

2460
02:29:31,755 --> 02:29:34,360
She dried the wash out back.

2461
02:29:34,395 --> 02:29:37,960
Now, by wash, you mean, uh,
things like-like sheets and towels

2462
02:29:37,995 --> 02:29:39,390
and things like that?
Sure.

2463
02:29:39,425 --> 02:29:42,460
Something... so you'd have
to hang them up pretty high

2464
02:29:42,495 --> 02:29:44,690
in order to keep them
off the ground. Hmm?

2465
02:29:44,725 --> 02:29:46,020
Is that right?
That's right.

2466
02:29:46,055 --> 02:29:47,760
Yeah.

2467
02:29:47,795 --> 02:29:50,890
Well, it seems to me it would
take an awful lot of determination

2468
02:29:50,925 --> 02:29:54,460
for a little 4-year-old
to get her throat up,

2469
02:29:54,495 --> 02:29:57,290
you know, high enough
to break her larynx.

2470
02:29:57,325 --> 02:29:58,720
Wouldn't you say?

2471
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,590
When you stop to
think about it.

2472
02:30:09,690 --> 02:30:11,860
You know, Mr. Dorsett,
I have here

2473
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,460
a catalog of

2474
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:18,620
hurts.

2475
02:30:18,655 --> 02:30:21,520
And what I'd like to stop
and think about is, uh,

2476
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:26,420
how Mrs. Dorsett explained
the rest of these.

2477
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:29,560
Or perhaps even if, uh...

2478
02:30:29,595 --> 02:30:31,820
did you ever ask Sybil?

2479
02:30:31,855 --> 02:30:34,420
Uh, sometime when you
were alone together with her

2480
02:30:34,455 --> 02:30:37,720
and she maybe felt
a little freer to confide?

2481
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:43,520
Did you? I don't get the
drift of this conversation.

2482
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:49,320
Well, I'll give it to you.
I... what I'd like to know is

2483
02:30:49,355 --> 02:30:50,790
do you think it's possible

2484
02:30:50,825 --> 02:30:53,360
that your wife inflicted
these injuries herself?

2485
02:30:53,395 --> 02:30:56,190
Absolutely not.

2486
02:30:56,225 --> 02:30:58,160
You understand,
what I mean is,

2487
02:30:58,195 --> 02:31:00,960
do you think there was
anything in her personality,

2488
02:31:00,995 --> 02:31:02,120
in her character-

2489
02:31:02,155 --> 02:31:03,890
absolutely not.

2490
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:09,020
That was a fine woman.

2491
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,960
I'm sure she was
a fine woman,

2492
02:31:11,995 --> 02:31:13,720
but even the finest people

2493
02:31:13,755 --> 02:31:16,590
can get very sick,
Mr. Dorsett

2494
02:31:16,625 --> 02:31:19,190
and what I'm talking about
here is sickness.

2495
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,720
Now, was she ever sick?

2496
02:31:22,755 --> 02:31:24,620
Uh, emotionally sick,
I mean, not-

2497
02:31:24,655 --> 02:31:26,360
I know what you mean.

2498
02:31:26,395 --> 02:31:28,760
I live in the same century you
do. I beg your pardon. I'm sorry.

2499
02:31:28,795 --> 02:31:30,560
She was nervous.

2500
02:31:30,595 --> 02:31:33,120
Not sick, just nervous.

2501
02:31:34,690 --> 02:31:37,760
She just talked so much,
that's all.

2502
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:41,690
She'd tell poems out loud,

2503
02:31:41,725 --> 02:31:45,560
and get up and dance in
restaurants, things like that.

2504
02:31:45,595 --> 02:31:49,260
Just too big a head
of steam, that's all.

2505
02:31:49,295 --> 02:31:52,660
Frustrated with
the small-town life

2506
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:56,620
or me or something.
I don't know.

2507
02:31:58,060 --> 02:32:00,760
She'd get
real low sometimes.

2508
02:32:00,795 --> 02:32:03,690
"Low down and blue,"
she'd call it.

2509
02:32:03,725 --> 02:32:07,220
One year, she just sat

2510
02:32:07,255 --> 02:32:09,690
quiet that whole winter.

2511
02:32:09,725 --> 02:32:12,520
Wouldn't even feed herself.

2512
02:32:12,555 --> 02:32:15,620
Got so bad I drove her up
to the state hospital.

2513
02:32:18,190 --> 02:32:19,760
Well, then what happened?

2514
02:32:19,795 --> 02:32:21,090
What did they say?

2515
02:32:21,125 --> 02:32:22,960
Oh, they

2516
02:32:22,995 --> 02:32:26,520
said she had
the paranoid schizophrenia.

2517
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:31,720
Well, Mr. Dorsett, that's...

2518
02:32:31,755 --> 02:32:33,520
that's very sick.

2519
02:32:33,555 --> 02:32:34,920
It's-it's...

2520
02:32:34,955 --> 02:32:37,190
it's certainly too sick
to be raising a little girl.

2521
02:32:37,225 --> 02:32:39,690
They-they were wrong,
you see.

2522
02:32:39,725 --> 02:32:43,620
Well, Hattie told me herself
a- after I got her home

2523
02:32:43,655 --> 02:32:46,620
that all that doctor did
was sit and stare at her

2524
02:32:46,655 --> 02:32:49,120
the whole time
she was with him.

2525
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:55,620
Said if anyone was gonna
tell her she was a loony,

2526
02:32:55,655 --> 02:32:58,720
he better get someone to do
it beside one of the loons.

2527
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:03,460
Well, you can't argue with
the logic of that, now can you?

2528
02:33:03,495 --> 02:33:04,990
You call that sick?

2529
02:33:21,490 --> 02:33:23,390
Excuse me.

2530
02:33:23,425 --> 02:33:26,420
Could you tell me
if Dr. Quinoness

2531
02:33:26,455 --> 02:33:29,260
still is, uh, living in
Willow Corners, in town?

2532
02:33:29,295 --> 02:33:31,660
You bet.
Straight on into town.

2533
02:33:31,695 --> 02:33:33,090
Corner of 4th and Maple.

2534
02:33:33,125 --> 02:33:35,090
4th and Maple? Thank you.

2535
02:33:35,125 --> 02:33:36,320
Yeah.

2536
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:44,490
I hope you don't mind
carrying the oatmeal cookies

2537
02:33:44,525 --> 02:33:47,420
but Julia gets pooped
on these stairs now.

2538
02:33:47,455 --> 02:33:49,390
Old places are
built for goats anyway.

2539
02:33:49,425 --> 02:33:52,420
Well, I appreciate your taking
time out to see me, Dr. Quinoness.

2540
02:33:52,455 --> 02:33:54,160
Not taking time out
from much.

2541
02:33:56,060 --> 02:33:58,260
Well, here we be.

2542
02:33:58,790 --> 02:33:59,990
The museum.

2543
02:34:00,025 --> 02:34:02,960
Used to be the only surgery
for 40 miles

2544
02:34:02,995 --> 02:34:05,560
till they built the hospital
out on route 9.

2545
02:34:05,595 --> 02:34:08,220
I use it now mainly because
the sun lasts longer

2546
02:34:08,255 --> 02:34:10,390
than any other room
in the house.

2547
02:34:10,425 --> 02:34:13,820
Lately, I've become
greedy about sunlight.

2548
02:34:13,855 --> 02:34:16,060
Please sit.
Thank you.

2549
02:34:16,095 --> 02:34:19,520
Yes, I seem to
remember hearing

2550
02:34:19,555 --> 02:34:22,320
that Sybil was
in New York City.

2551
02:34:22,355 --> 02:34:26,160
Of course, nowadays, with all the
family either dead or moved away,

2552
02:34:26,195 --> 02:34:28,660
don't keep tabs like I used to. Thank you.

2553
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:32,520
She, uh,

2554
02:34:32,555 --> 02:34:34,490
has a nervous condition,
has she?

2555
02:34:34,525 --> 02:34:36,590
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

2556
02:34:36,625 --> 02:34:38,460
Ah, little Sybil.

2557
02:34:38,495 --> 02:34:41,090
Little sparrow of a thing.

2558
02:34:41,125 --> 02:34:42,620
Not surprised
it's come to that.

2559
02:34:42,655 --> 02:34:44,520
You know,
she had a nervous mother.

2560
02:34:44,555 --> 02:34:46,420
So I understand.

2561
02:34:46,455 --> 02:34:49,220
Hattie. Pillar of the town.
Did everything.

2562
02:34:49,255 --> 02:34:52,590
Well, I would appreciate it if i
could see Sybil's records, doctor.

2563
02:34:52,625 --> 02:34:54,690
Well, I don't know
what light that would shed.

2564
02:34:54,725 --> 02:34:57,120
You see, l-I never,
never treated her for nerves

2565
02:34:57,155 --> 02:34:59,590
only for the usual
childhood aches and pains.

2566
02:34:59,625 --> 02:35:03,360
I understand, but l-I would
consider it a great courtesy.

2567
02:35:03,395 --> 02:35:05,190
I don't know that
I have anything.

2568
02:35:05,225 --> 02:35:06,360
Let me see.

2569
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:09,660
Dorsetts.

2570
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:12,620
Dorsetts. Oh, yes.

2571
02:35:13,820 --> 02:35:16,090
Here we are. Sybil.

2572
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,060
Tonsillectomy.

2573
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,190
I remember that.

2574
02:35:21,225 --> 02:35:23,990
She fought so hard
we could hardly get them out.

2575
02:35:26,890 --> 02:35:28,890
Torn ligaments,
right shoulder.

2576
02:35:28,925 --> 02:35:30,920
Fractured clavicle.

2577
02:35:30,955 --> 02:35:33,320
Palm of right hand
burned on stove.

2578
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:35,990
Fractured larynx.

2579
02:35:36,025 --> 02:35:37,760
Beans stuck up her nose.

2580
02:35:38,490 --> 02:35:39,860
Gas inhalation.

2581
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:44,860
Usual childhood
aches and pains, huh?

2582
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:48,390
Did you ever speculate?

2583
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:50,620
You know,

2584
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:53,320
you can live too long, doctor.

2585
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:56,960
I never told anyone this.

2586
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:01,490
Sybil came to me
with a bladder complaint.

2587
02:36:01,525 --> 02:36:03,420
Very unusual in
a little girl.

2588
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:09,690
Couldn't pass her water.
I had to catheterize her.

2589
02:36:09,725 --> 02:36:11,760
If you did a gynecological
on her right now,

2590
02:36:11,795 --> 02:36:14,120
I'd wager you'd see
what I saw.

2591
02:36:14,155 --> 02:36:16,220
Scarification of
the inner wall,

2592
02:36:16,255 --> 02:36:18,890
destruction of
certain tissues.

2593
02:36:18,925 --> 02:36:21,520
I don't believe
she can ever become a mother.

2594
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:28,820
You know, the good Lord
ships us into this world

2595
02:36:28,855 --> 02:36:31,790
not a whole heck of a lot
better than the U.S. mails.

2596
02:36:33,090 --> 02:36:35,190
But the hand of the Almighty
had nothing to do

2597
02:36:35,225 --> 02:36:37,420
with what I found
inside that child.

2598
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:43,090
You've been very generous,
doctor.

2599
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:50,060
You wanna give me
a tip, doctor?

2600
02:36:50,095 --> 02:36:51,360
If I can.

2601
02:36:51,890 --> 02:36:53,190
In your...

2602
02:36:53,225 --> 02:36:55,690
in your trade, you hear
a lot of confessions.

2603
02:36:57,260 --> 02:37:00,220
Dr. Quinoness,
it was a long, long time ago.

2604
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:03,120
How do I find absolution?

2605
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:12,590
it happened, sweetie.

2606
02:41:12,625 --> 02:41:14,620
Those are
the crayon scratches you made

2607
02:41:14,655 --> 02:41:16,920
when momma put you
in the wheat bin.

2608
02:41:16,955 --> 02:41:18,790
They were your cry for help.

2609
02:41:18,825 --> 02:41:20,820
Your purple anger.

2610
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:25,990
It doesn't seem real.

2611
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:27,820
Well,

2612
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:30,060
it happened.

2613
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:39,860
I can't believe you went to
all this trouble after I...

2614
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:44,020
I didn't mean to
be mean to you.

2615
02:41:44,055 --> 02:41:46,490
Oh, I know that.

2616
02:41:46,525 --> 02:41:48,260
It's just I was afraid.

2617
02:41:49,620 --> 02:41:52,190
Not of what we
talked about so much.

2618
02:41:52,225 --> 02:41:53,690
Can you tell me now?

2619
02:41:53,725 --> 02:41:55,490
I was afraid of the hope.

2620
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:58,960
The hope?

2621
02:42:00,990 --> 02:42:02,990
The hope that I
might get well.

2622
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:09,920
You began

2623
02:42:09,955 --> 02:42:12,090
to make me believe
I could, almost.

2624
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:17,290
For a while,
I could see myself

2625
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:19,560
painting,

2626
02:42:21,790 --> 02:42:23,760
or playing the piano or...

2627
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:29,420
yes?

2628
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:32,820
Being with people.

2629
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:42,860
Then I realize

2630
02:42:42,895 --> 02:42:45,990
that the only way
that hope can ever be real

2631
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:49,360
is you.

2632
02:42:49,395 --> 02:42:51,120
And if you're the only hope,

2633
02:42:51,155 --> 02:42:53,220
and this is the only way,

2634
02:42:53,255 --> 02:42:56,560
and if it doesn't work,
then I'm a goner.

2635
02:43:00,290 --> 02:43:01,620
I just...

2636
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:06,260
I have to be with people,
Dr. Wilbur.

2637
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:09,160
I know that.

2638
02:43:09,195 --> 02:43:11,860
I've never really
been let in most places.

2639
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:16,520
Well,
Richard let me in for a while

2640
02:43:16,555 --> 02:43:19,290
and you let me in a little
because you have to.

2641
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,390
But then,

2642
02:43:22,425 --> 02:43:24,360
when he left
and you were gone

2643
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:27,790
I realized that
there wasn't a house

2644
02:43:27,825 --> 02:43:30,120
in all of New York
that I could go in.

2645
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:35,320
Quite honestly,

2646
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:39,620
I...

2647
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:43,690
I hailed a cab
a couple of times.

2648
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:47,260
I thought I'd make
up for it somehow.

2649
02:43:47,295 --> 02:43:49,060
I'd eat less or something.

2650
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:54,520
Because I had to
talk to somebody.

2651
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:59,460
And one cab driver
talked to me.

2652
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,190
He was very interesting.

2653
02:44:05,190 --> 02:44:07,460
We drove around
for about 15 minutes.

2654
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:14,020
Yes?

2655
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:17,490
And he drove me by here.

2656
02:44:17,525 --> 02:44:19,460
And I looked up
in your apartment

2657
02:44:19,495 --> 02:44:21,960
to see if there
was a light on.

2658
02:44:21,995 --> 02:44:23,590
I know that was wrong.

2659
02:44:23,625 --> 02:44:24,760
Why?

2660
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:33,520
I don't know. It seemed like an
invasion of your privacy somehow.

2661
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,760
With a look?

2662
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:39,320
I know it's silly.

2663
02:44:39,355 --> 02:44:41,860
No, it only means
there was

2664
02:44:41,895 --> 02:44:43,720
a wish that went along
with the look

2665
02:44:43,755 --> 02:44:45,960
that you think
it was wrong to have.

2666
02:44:45,995 --> 02:44:47,490
Maybe somebody else

2667
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:50,220
had a wish
just for a second.

2668
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:56,760
Would you look
the other way, please?

2669
02:44:56,795 --> 02:44:59,090
Sweetie,
it helps me if I can see you.

2670
02:44:59,125 --> 02:45:01,060
Then I'll look the other way.

2671
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:13,120
It has to do with a dream.

2672
02:45:16,320 --> 02:45:18,260
It has to do with you.

2673
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:20,760
Mmm-hmm.

2674
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:25,690
You and this little girl.

2675
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:30,990
This funny little girl
with a scrunched-up face.

2676
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:36,090
And she's very young,
so what she feels is...

2677
02:45:37,090 --> 02:45:39,720
well, maybe it's excusable.

2678
02:45:39,755 --> 02:45:41,260
What does she feel?

2679
02:45:43,590 --> 02:45:46,790
She's too young to realize
that you're a doctor,

2680
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:49,560
not her friend.

2681
02:45:51,320 --> 02:45:52,560
Go on.

2682
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:56,090
Well

2683
02:45:58,960 --> 02:46:02,090
she wants to sit beside you

2684
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:07,360
in your big chair.

2685
02:46:08,690 --> 02:46:10,220
And she asks.

2686
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:12,590
And she does.

2687
02:46:13,790 --> 02:46:16,290
But she's just
a little girl, understand,

2688
02:46:16,325 --> 02:46:17,960
and it's just a dream.

2689
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:22,260
What worries you about her?

2690
02:46:25,890 --> 02:46:27,620
I'm afraid to tell you.

2691
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:31,990
That you feel
satisfaction in the dream?

2692
02:46:35,890 --> 02:46:38,590
It's not a dream, Sybil.

2693
02:46:38,625 --> 02:46:40,460
Every time you
come here as Peggy,

2694
02:46:40,495 --> 02:46:42,690
you sit here in
this chair beside me

2695
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:45,760
and you put my arm
around you,

2696
02:46:45,795 --> 02:46:47,720
and you rest your head
on my shoulder

2697
02:46:47,755 --> 02:46:49,490
and you feel satisfaction.

2698
02:46:51,590 --> 02:46:53,390
Oh, I couldn't.

2699
02:46:53,425 --> 02:46:55,560
I know you couldn't,
but Peggy can.

2700
02:46:59,220 --> 02:47:01,020
And you allow it?

2701
02:47:01,055 --> 02:47:03,820
Of course I allow it.

2702
02:47:03,855 --> 02:47:07,560
Sometimes being close is the
only nourishment that counts.

2703
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:12,960
It seems like too much
to do for her.

2704
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:16,120
Well...

2705
02:47:16,155 --> 02:47:20,420
don't you think I might be
doing it for myself also?

2706
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:24,520
Don't you think, uh,
I might do it

2707
02:47:24,555 --> 02:47:27,020
because I enjoy
being allowed

2708
02:47:27,055 --> 02:47:29,320
to express
my affection for you?

2709
02:47:34,290 --> 02:47:35,490
You mean for her.

2710
02:47:35,525 --> 02:47:37,590
No, for you.

2711
02:47:37,625 --> 02:47:40,820
For Sybil,
for the totality of you.

2712
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:43,920
Don't you know that?

2713
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:50,560
I love your courage.
I love your humor.

2714
02:47:50,595 --> 02:47:52,420
I love your talent.

2715
02:47:52,455 --> 02:47:54,760
I love your tenderness
with other people.

2716
02:47:54,795 --> 02:47:56,120
I love your quickness.

2717
02:47:56,155 --> 02:47:58,890
I love your company.
I love you.

2718
02:48:03,190 --> 02:48:05,990
Now the only thing that's
holding you on that chair

2719
02:48:06,025 --> 02:48:08,020
is the law of gravity.

2720
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:28,360
Sybil, do you know what those
wet things are on your face?

2721
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:30,290
Oh.

2722
02:48:30,325 --> 02:48:31,960
Those are
Sybil's first tears.

2723
02:48:33,495 --> 02:48:36,920
The first ones you've had
since grandma died.

2724
02:48:36,955 --> 02:48:38,660
I loved my grandmother.

2725
02:48:39,390 --> 02:48:40,760
I know you did.

2726
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:43,820
I love you, too.

2727
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:49,790
Would you like me to
tell you a true story?

2728
02:48:51,890 --> 02:48:53,820
Well,

2729
02:48:53,855 --> 02:48:57,120
once, a long time ago, when i
was a little girl in Montana,

2730
02:48:58,160 --> 02:49:01,690
I was lying out on
the grass one day

2731
02:49:01,725 --> 02:49:04,660
just looking at the ants.

2732
02:49:06,795 --> 02:49:11,320
And the grass was sweet
and deep and soft,

2733
02:49:11,355 --> 02:49:13,490
and the sun was
warm on my back,

2734
02:49:13,525 --> 02:49:16,720
and the insects were
buzzing and it was...

2735
02:49:16,755 --> 02:49:18,660
everything was drowsy.

2736
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:21,620
And all of a sudden,

2737
02:49:21,655 --> 02:49:23,920
I saw one ant

2738
02:49:23,955 --> 02:49:28,390
who was struggling to pick up
this grain of sand

2739
02:49:28,425 --> 02:49:31,920
that was far too heavy
for it to lift.

2740
02:49:31,955 --> 02:49:35,120
And he struggled
and he struggled.

2741
02:49:35,155 --> 02:49:38,220
And pretty soon,
another ant came by

2742
02:49:39,290 --> 02:49:42,020
and together, the 2 of them

2743
02:49:42,055 --> 02:49:45,460
lifted the grain of sand
and started to carry it away.

2744
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:48,790
Well, I got so excited

2745
02:49:48,825 --> 02:49:51,820
that I hollered to my momma,
and she ran out

2746
02:49:51,855 --> 02:49:55,460
and she flopped down in the
grass beside me and she said

2747
02:49:55,495 --> 02:49:58,090
"now, isn't that miraculous

2748
02:49:58,125 --> 02:50:01,420
"how much 2 creatures
can accomplish together

2749
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:04,860
when they care
about each other."

2750
02:50:05,960 --> 02:50:07,660
And your mother
was beside you?

2751
02:50:07,695 --> 02:50:09,760
Mmm-hmm. In the grass.

2752
02:50:09,795 --> 02:50:11,060
Watching ants?

2753
02:50:11,095 --> 02:50:12,520
On a summer's day.

2754
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:15,890
Helping each other.

2755
02:50:28,290 --> 02:50:29,890
It's too green.

2756
02:50:29,925 --> 02:50:32,120
Why did God have to make
everything green?

2757
02:50:32,155 --> 02:50:33,920
Green trees, green grass.

2758
02:50:33,955 --> 02:50:35,760
Green kitchens.

2759
02:50:35,795 --> 02:50:38,020
I'm not even gonna
look at the green.

2760
02:50:38,055 --> 02:50:40,260
I'm just gonna
look at the blossoms.

2761
02:50:40,295 --> 02:50:41,520
Sweetie, I know

2762
02:50:41,555 --> 02:50:43,520
this is the most
difficult hurdle of all,

2763
02:50:43,555 --> 02:50:47,520
but we've gotta get into that kitchen
now and face what went on there.

2764
02:50:47,555 --> 02:50:49,520
I'm too scared of that.

2765
02:50:49,555 --> 02:50:51,520
You're just scared
of being scared.

2766
02:50:51,555 --> 02:50:53,160
You survived it
when it happened,

2767
02:50:53,195 --> 02:50:54,990
and you'll survive
remembering it.

2768
02:50:55,025 --> 02:50:56,490
You know how much
relief you felt

2769
02:50:56,525 --> 02:50:57,820
when we faced
the other things,

2770
02:50:57,855 --> 02:51:01,020
the hands, the-the people,
and Christmas?

2771
02:51:01,055 --> 02:51:03,520
So we will face this,
too, finally,

2772
02:51:03,555 --> 02:51:05,920
and-and-and
leave it behind forever.

2773
02:51:05,955 --> 02:51:08,460
Leave all that pain behind.

2774
02:51:08,495 --> 02:51:11,090
And we'll find a nice
quiet place for a picnic,

2775
02:51:11,125 --> 02:51:12,990
and we've got all
your painting things,

2776
02:51:13,025 --> 02:51:15,420
and we're just
gonna let it happen, ok?

2777
02:51:15,455 --> 02:51:17,120
Ok.

2778
02:51:17,155 --> 02:51:19,690
Did we bring Nehemiah
in case we need his help?

2779
02:51:19,725 --> 02:51:21,490
Mmm-hmm. He's with us.

2780
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:32,560
What is it, sweetie?
What's in the way?

2781
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:41,020
I don't know. I can't see it.

2782
02:51:41,890 --> 02:51:43,660
I can feel it. It's

2783
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:46,620
fear.

2784
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:51,160
Peggy's petrified right now.

2785
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:56,660
This is the first stroke
I've dared to paint.

2786
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:01,660
Oh, Dr. Wilbur.

2787
02:52:01,695 --> 02:52:02,920
What?

2788
02:52:02,955 --> 02:52:05,020
This is coming.

2789
02:52:05,055 --> 02:52:07,890
Just allow it, sweetie.
Just allow it.

2790
02:52:07,925 --> 02:52:09,390
Oh, it's like

2791
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:11,290
waves,

2792
02:52:11,325 --> 02:52:12,920
waves through me.

2793
02:52:12,955 --> 02:52:14,090
It's awful.

2794
02:52:14,125 --> 02:52:16,590
Allow it. Go with it.

2795
02:52:16,625 --> 02:52:19,060
Oh, no, no.

2796
02:52:19,095 --> 02:52:20,920
Go with it.
Just allow it, sweetie.

2797
02:52:20,955 --> 02:52:22,820
Oh, is this Peggy?

2798
02:52:22,855 --> 02:52:24,620
It's only a hint of
what she feels, sweetie.

2799
02:52:24,655 --> 02:52:26,120
She feels much
more than that.

2800
02:52:26,155 --> 02:52:28,860
Oh, it's the worst feeling.
Oh, it's so awful.

2801
02:52:28,895 --> 02:52:31,060
Just go with it. Try to
go with it. Stay with it

2802
02:52:31,095 --> 02:52:33,060
and see if you can find out
what's underneath.

2803
02:52:33,095 --> 02:52:34,490
Can you remember?

2804
02:52:34,525 --> 02:52:36,020
What's underneath it,
sweetie?

2805
02:52:36,055 --> 02:52:37,190
I'm scared.

2806
02:52:38,495 --> 02:52:39,620
I'm scared.

2807
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:49,690
No.

2808
02:52:49,725 --> 02:52:51,290
What is it?
What are you looking at?

2809
02:52:51,325 --> 02:52:52,860
It's all green.

2810
02:52:52,895 --> 02:52:55,860
And the people, the people.

2811
02:52:55,895 --> 02:52:58,560
Peggy, where are you?
Are you in the kitchen?

2812
02:53:10,090 --> 02:53:11,760
Have to do it.

2813
02:53:11,795 --> 02:53:13,090
It's dripping.

2814
02:53:13,125 --> 02:53:15,420
It's dripping.
You can hear it dripping.

2815
02:53:15,455 --> 02:53:17,890
I know. There's even
a rust spot under the tap.

2816
02:53:17,925 --> 02:53:19,490
Have to do it.

2817
02:53:19,525 --> 02:53:21,660
What does momma
have to do?

2818
02:53:21,695 --> 02:53:24,720
Every morning. Every
morning, after I eat my prunes

2819
02:53:24,755 --> 02:53:27,490
and everybody's gone,
she pulls down the shades.

2820
02:53:27,525 --> 02:53:30,060
She pulls down the shades
so nobody will see.

2821
02:53:30,095 --> 02:53:31,860
And she's got me
tied up on the table.

2822
02:53:31,895 --> 02:53:33,620
Oh, it's so cold.

2823
02:53:33,655 --> 02:53:36,620
That's because
it's metal, sweetie.

2824
02:53:36,655 --> 02:53:39,590
And the water, the water's
running. The water's running.

2825
02:53:39,625 --> 02:53:41,860
It has to run a long time
till it's cold enough.

2826
02:53:41,895 --> 02:53:43,890
What does she
need cold water for?

2827
02:53:43,925 --> 02:53:45,890
She gives me an enema.

2828
02:53:47,355 --> 02:53:48,960
It smells all disinfectanny.

2829
02:53:48,995 --> 02:53:50,520
Oh, my god.

2830
02:53:52,955 --> 02:53:55,320
And my feet, my feet are
tied to the broom handle.

2831
02:53:55,355 --> 02:53:57,020
Why? They're tied to the broom handle.

2832
02:53:57,055 --> 02:53:58,890
Why?
So she can pull me up

2833
02:53:58,925 --> 02:54:01,690
and pull me up and
tie me to the light.

2834
02:54:01,725 --> 02:54:04,120
To the light. To the light.

2835
02:54:04,155 --> 02:54:07,160
She's gonna bring it.
Oh, no. No, please.

2836
02:54:07,195 --> 02:54:08,490
Please, it'll tear me.

2837
02:54:08,525 --> 02:54:10,290
It'll tear me.
Oh, get it away.

2838
02:54:10,325 --> 02:54:12,720
What will tear?
What's she bringing, sweetie?

2839
02:54:12,755 --> 02:54:14,320
What's she bringing?

2840
02:54:16,055 --> 02:54:18,790
What is it? What will tear?
What is she bringing?

2841
02:54:18,825 --> 02:54:21,020
What is she bringing?

2842
02:54:21,055 --> 02:54:24,690
The knife and the buttonhook.

2843
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:27,360
The knives.

2844
02:54:27,395 --> 02:54:30,120
I can see them.
I can see them.

2845
02:54:30,155 --> 02:54:31,460
Oh, please.

2846
02:54:31,495 --> 02:54:33,660
It's all right, sweetie.
It's all right.

2847
02:54:33,695 --> 02:54:34,990
Once we're through this,

2848
02:54:35,025 --> 02:54:37,020
you'll be at the beginning
of everything good.

2849
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:38,720
But we've got to
get through this.

2850
02:54:38,755 --> 02:54:41,720
It's all right, sweetie.
It's all right.

2851
02:54:41,755 --> 02:54:44,120
Oh, oh. Oh, dear lord.

2852
02:54:44,155 --> 02:54:46,060
Oh, dear lord.
Oh, dear lord.

2853
02:54:46,095 --> 02:54:48,160
When I grow up, I will have
lots and lots of children

2854
02:54:48,195 --> 02:54:49,320
and I will be good to them.

2855
02:54:49,355 --> 02:54:51,160
Go away. Go away.

2856
02:54:51,195 --> 02:54:53,090
Oh, and I will let them do
what they want to do.

2857
02:54:53,125 --> 02:54:55,290
And they can bring the
neighborhood children over to play.

2858
02:54:55,325 --> 02:54:56,590
And they can play
all over the house

2859
02:54:56,625 --> 02:54:57,820
if they want to.
I don't care.

2860
02:54:57,855 --> 02:54:59,520
They can play in the sunroom.

2861
02:54:59,555 --> 02:55:01,260
Oh, please, don't do this!

2862
02:55:01,295 --> 02:55:04,220
And they can run in the house
if they want to. I don't care.

2863
02:55:04,255 --> 02:55:06,590
And my children can make any
color chickens they want to.

2864
02:55:06,625 --> 02:55:09,060
And I won't put their heads in
the oven and turn on the gas.

2865
02:55:09,095 --> 02:55:10,860
And I won't burn their hands
with the hot iron.

2866
02:55:10,895 --> 02:55:13,090
And I won't throw the shoe
and hit them in the throat.

2867
02:55:13,125 --> 02:55:14,920
I won't hurt them
with the buttonhook

2868
02:55:14,955 --> 02:55:16,690
and the knives and
the rubber tubes.

2869
02:55:16,725 --> 02:55:18,290
And I won't put
a flashlight inside of them

2870
02:55:18,325 --> 02:55:19,820
and say,
"you better get used to it

2871
02:55:19,855 --> 02:55:21,890
"because that's what men
will do when you get older.

2872
02:55:21,925 --> 02:55:24,290
"They'll put things inside of
you, and they will hurt you."

2873
02:55:24,325 --> 02:55:27,060
I don't wanna grow up, and
I don't wanna be like that.

2874
02:55:27,095 --> 02:55:30,060
No, no, no.
No, no. No, please.

2875
02:55:30,095 --> 02:55:31,290
Please put me down.

2876
02:55:31,325 --> 02:55:33,090
Please put me down.
Don't take me in there.

2877
02:55:33,125 --> 02:55:34,690
Don't take me in there.
Please. Please.

2878
02:55:34,725 --> 02:55:36,890
Where is she taking you,
sweetie? Where is she taking you?

2879
02:55:36,925 --> 02:55:38,660
Oh, it hurts me.

2880
02:55:38,695 --> 02:55:42,960
And the music, and Brahms and
Beethoven and Bach and-and Dvorak.

2881
02:55:42,995 --> 02:55:45,560
Dvorak and the New World
Symphony, and you can't get away.

2882
02:55:45,595 --> 02:55:48,360
And they're coming closer,
and they're marching.

2883
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:55,920
Don't you let go, young lady.

2884
02:55:55,955 --> 02:55:57,460
You hold your water.

2885
02:55:57,495 --> 02:56:00,090
Hold your water till
the very last note.

2886
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:33,990
I am Sybil.

2887
02:56:37,490 --> 02:56:39,190
And I remember.

2888
02:56:41,090 --> 02:56:43,560
And I hate her.

2889
02:56:43,595 --> 02:56:45,520
I hate her.

2890
02:56:45,555 --> 02:56:47,890
I want to hurt her.

2891
02:56:47,925 --> 02:56:51,220
I want to stomp on her
and tear her apart

2892
02:56:51,255 --> 02:56:54,120
and cut her arms off
and put things inside her

2893
02:56:54,155 --> 02:56:55,720
and kill her.

2894
02:56:55,755 --> 02:56:57,660
How could she do that to me?

2895
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:01,520
Oh, god.

2896
02:57:01,555 --> 02:57:03,320
I hated her so much.

2897
02:57:03,355 --> 02:57:05,720
I wanted her dead.

2898
02:57:05,755 --> 02:57:07,190
I still do.

2899
02:57:07,225 --> 02:57:09,760
I do. I want her dead.

2900
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:14,290
Oh, Dr. Wilbur, help me.

2901
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:17,420
Help me. This scares me.

2902
02:57:21,690 --> 02:57:24,520
She had reached
the center of the maze

2903
02:57:24,555 --> 02:57:26,460
and come out whole.

2904
02:57:26,495 --> 02:57:29,490
Anger could be
her friend now.

2905
02:57:29,525 --> 02:57:32,060
Green and purple
were only colors.

2906
02:57:32,095 --> 02:57:34,520
She didn't need to
fear them anymore.

2907
02:57:41,790 --> 02:57:43,960
You can remember
without pain now.

2908
02:57:44,590 --> 02:57:45,860
Without pain?

2909
02:57:48,790 --> 02:57:51,690
None of you will ever
have to feel the pain again.

2910
02:57:53,895 --> 02:57:56,190
I think it's time
you meet the others.

2911
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,860
1.

2912
02:58:00,690 --> 02:58:01,820
2.

2913
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:04,690
3.

2914
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,190
Falling asleep.

2915
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:09,390
4.

2916
02:58:10,190 --> 02:58:12,690
Deeply, deeply asleep.

2917
02:58:13,990 --> 02:58:15,290
5.

2918
02:58:17,290 --> 02:58:20,590
Now, I'd like to speak to all
of you, and Sybil can listen.

2919
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:24,220
How do you all feel
about meeting Sybil?

2920
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:27,060
Hmm?

2921
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:30,560
Well, is anybody there?

2922
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:32,920
Vicky?

2923
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:35,160
Yes.

2924
02:58:35,820 --> 02:58:36,920
Peggy?

2925
02:58:39,190 --> 02:58:41,890
I'm here,
but I don't wanna be.

2926
02:58:43,290 --> 02:58:45,090
How about the rest of you?

2927
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:48,460
Dr. Wilbur,

2928
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:51,390
we wanna know,
if we meet Sybil

2929
02:58:51,425 --> 02:58:53,490
will we still be able to give

2930
02:58:53,525 --> 02:58:56,290
a baby to a girl
like daddy did?

2931
02:58:56,325 --> 02:58:57,420
Who is that?

2932
02:58:57,455 --> 02:58:58,960
I'm Mike,
and sid's here, too.

2933
02:58:58,995 --> 02:59:01,690
And we wanna know if we'll
be able to do that like dad.

2934
02:59:01,725 --> 02:59:04,560
Well, you boys have a problem
because you live in a woman's body.

2935
02:59:04,595 --> 02:59:06,120
You're not built like that.

2936
02:59:06,155 --> 02:59:07,660
We will be
when we're big.

2937
02:59:07,695 --> 02:59:09,060
Well, how are you
gonna manage that?

2938
02:59:09,095 --> 02:59:10,390
We'll push it out.

2939
02:59:10,425 --> 02:59:12,220
Well, I think that's
easier said than done.

2940
02:59:12,255 --> 02:59:13,520
Well, you can help.

2941
02:59:13,555 --> 02:59:15,790
Mike, can we set
this problem aside,

2942
02:59:15,825 --> 02:59:18,120
sweetie,
until you all meet Sybil?

2943
02:59:18,155 --> 02:59:21,420
'Cause what she needs right
now is to know all of you

2944
02:59:21,455 --> 02:59:24,120
and to understand how much
you've all been helping her

2945
02:59:24,155 --> 02:59:25,690
and how much more
you can help her

2946
02:59:25,725 --> 02:59:28,290
when you all
join hands together.

2947
02:59:28,325 --> 02:59:30,860
All for one and one for all?

2948
02:59:30,895 --> 02:59:32,790
Mmm-hmm.

2949
02:59:32,825 --> 02:59:34,720
Will you still like us then?

2950
02:59:35,690 --> 02:59:38,020
I'll love you.

2951
02:59:38,055 --> 02:59:40,120
Would you put
your arm around us?

2952
02:59:42,860 --> 02:59:44,720
Sybil, are you ready?

2953
02:59:44,755 --> 02:59:46,520
You're the doctor.

2954
02:59:51,290 --> 02:59:54,120
Who would you
like to meet first?

2955
02:59:54,155 --> 02:59:58,260
Well, I've always
wanted to meet Vicky.

2956
02:59:58,295 --> 03:00:00,020
All right.

2957
03:00:00,055 --> 03:00:03,620
Vicky.
Vicky come on out, sweetie.

2958
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:28,260
bonjour.

2959
03:00:28,295 --> 03:00:29,590
Vicky, here's Sybil.

2960
03:00:29,625 --> 03:00:31,920
Look, she has her arms
out to me.

2961
03:00:31,955 --> 03:00:34,090
She's smiling.

2962
03:00:34,125 --> 03:00:36,590
Look how pretty her hair is.

2963
03:00:36,625 --> 03:00:38,290
Does she wanna be friends?

2964
03:00:38,325 --> 03:00:41,060
Vicky, do you wanna
be friends with Sybil?

2965
03:00:41,095 --> 03:00:42,490
Uh-huh.

2966
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:55,990
You think you'd like to
have Vicky with you always?

2967
03:00:56,660 --> 03:00:58,690
Yes.

2968
03:00:58,725 --> 03:01:01,290
I've always needed
someone like Vicky.

2969
03:01:02,390 --> 03:01:04,420
You went on ahead for me.

2970
03:01:04,455 --> 03:01:06,790
Whenever I didn't have
the strength to do something,

2971
03:01:06,825 --> 03:01:08,760
you'd go on and do it for me.

2972
03:01:13,390 --> 03:01:15,190
I like her, Dr. Wilbur.

2973
03:01:15,225 --> 03:01:18,090
Yes, she's a part of you
that's very steady

2974
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:21,060
and very likeable.

2975
03:01:21,095 --> 03:01:23,290
Will she be with me always?
Mmm-hmm.

2976
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:27,420
Vicky will be
with you always.

2977
03:01:27,455 --> 03:01:29,360
You and she

2978
03:01:31,590 --> 03:01:33,760
Let's don't say
anything to spoil it.

2979
03:01:33,795 --> 03:01:35,790
It's so nice like this.

2980
03:01:35,825 --> 03:01:37,520
It's so nice to
have a friend.

2981
03:01:37,555 --> 03:01:39,190
And she came right to me.

2982
03:01:39,225 --> 03:01:41,090
The others will come to you.

2983
03:01:43,290 --> 03:01:45,120
Now the others
are right here,

2984
03:01:45,155 --> 03:01:47,120
and they will
come to you also.

2985
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:50,360
Here's Marcia, dear.

2986
03:01:56,190 --> 03:01:59,490
Come, girls.
Clara, helen, margie.

2987
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:10,620
And this is Vanessa,
who kept your music for you.

2988
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:18,520
Sid, Mike, hop out, boys.

2989
03:02:21,760 --> 03:02:23,520
Nancy.

2990
03:02:23,555 --> 03:02:26,920
Nancy kept waiting
for the end of the world

2991
03:02:26,955 --> 03:02:29,390
and she's the one
who dreaded armageddon.

2992
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:34,060
And Mary,

2993
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:38,190
the memory of grandma.

2994
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:42,090
Sybil Ann.

2995
03:02:42,125 --> 03:02:44,590
Sybil Ann,
don't be shy, sweetie.

2996
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:48,020
Here's Sybil.

2997
03:02:48,860 --> 03:02:51,220
Come on, Peggy.

2998
03:02:51,255 --> 03:02:53,720
I'm afraid to
meet Peggy right now.

2999
03:02:53,755 --> 03:02:56,190
She's afraid of scaring you.

3000
03:02:57,760 --> 03:03:00,090
She didn't mean to
break the windows.

3001
03:03:00,125 --> 03:03:02,620
She got it confused
with something else,

3002
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:04,690
with getting out
of the kitchen.

3003
03:03:04,725 --> 03:03:06,890
How do you know that?

3004
03:03:06,925 --> 03:03:09,490
She's speaking
to you, isn't she?

3005
03:03:09,525 --> 03:03:12,020
Where is she? Is she there?

3006
03:03:12,055 --> 03:03:13,320
Of course.

3007
03:03:13,355 --> 03:03:16,520
Peggy.

3008
03:03:16,555 --> 03:03:20,220
Oh, come now, Peggy.
Don't be silly.

3009
03:03:20,255 --> 03:03:22,420
I don't think I'm ready yet.

3010
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:25,460
Dr. Wilbur?

3011
03:03:25,495 --> 03:03:28,220
It's all right, sweetie.
I'm still here.

3012
03:03:35,820 --> 03:03:37,690
Is that all she is?

3013
03:03:39,490 --> 03:03:42,090
Just that little thing?

3014
03:03:42,125 --> 03:03:45,220
I'm not a little thing.
I'm a person.

3015
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:49,490
I'm sorry.

3016
03:03:49,525 --> 03:03:53,520
You don't be afraid of me,
and I wont' be afraid of you.

3017
03:04:00,160 --> 03:04:02,320
What have you got
behind your back, Peggy?

3018
03:04:02,355 --> 03:04:03,960
Haven't you got any hands?

3019
03:04:03,995 --> 03:04:05,420
I got fists.

3020
03:04:06,590 --> 03:04:09,220
Oh, my.

3021
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:12,720
Look at those knuckles.

3022
03:04:13,760 --> 03:04:15,490
They're so white.

3023
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:46,690
It's all right, sweetie.

3024
03:04:47,890 --> 03:04:49,490
It's all right, sweetie.

3025
03:04:51,890 --> 03:04:53,560
It's all right.

3026
03:04:55,620 --> 03:04:57,260
It's all right.

3027
03:04:58,790 --> 03:05:01,790
In accepting
Peggy into her arms,

3028
03:05:01,825 --> 03:05:05,620
Sybil began the deepest
healing of her selves.

3029
03:05:05,655 --> 03:05:09,820
In embracing Peggy,
she embraced herself.

3030
03:05:09,855 --> 03:05:12,960
In calming her, she was
calming her own heart.

3031
03:05:14,390 --> 03:05:17,360
As I watched her
becoming mother to herself

3032
03:05:17,395 --> 03:05:21,060
I felt my own long
motherhood ending.

3033
03:05:21,095 --> 03:05:23,960
I released what
I had held so long.

3034
03:05:23,995 --> 03:05:27,320
I celebrated the beginning
of her emancipation.

3035
03:05:28,190 --> 03:05:29,520
I let go.

3036
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:34,390
Our work together
lasted 11 years.

3037
03:05:34,425 --> 03:05:37,420
Today Sybil lives peacefully
in a small college town

3038
03:05:37,455 --> 03:05:39,320
where she's
a professor of art.

3039
03:05:39,355 --> 03:05:40,990
There's not
enough time in the day

3040
03:05:41,025 --> 03:05:42,590
for her to do
everything she wants

3041
03:05:42,625 --> 03:05:46,160
but that time,
in every sense, is her own.

3042
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:49,160
She tells me she's happy.

3043
03:05:49,960 --> 03:05:51,690
I know she's free.

3044
03:05:57,260 --> 03:05:59,820
colors of dreams

3045
03:05:59,855 --> 03:06:02,820
ribbons of rhyme

3046
03:06:02,855 --> 03:06:06,420
come out, come out

3047
03:06:06,455 --> 03:06:10,220
wherever you are

3048
03:06:10,255 --> 03:06:13,520
willows and winds

3049
03:06:13,555 --> 03:06:15,890
that whisper words

3050
03:06:15,925 --> 03:06:20,120
of a spring so near

3051
03:06:20,155 --> 03:06:23,390
a summer so far

3052
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:27,790
mirror, mirror

3053
03:06:27,825 --> 03:06:31,590
in my mind

3054
03:06:31,625 --> 03:06:35,520
there's so much to see

3055
03:06:38,020 --> 03:06:40,960
walking through

3056
03:06:40,995 --> 03:06:44,960
your silver rooms

3057
03:06:46,120 --> 03:06:49,660
I remember

3058
03:06:50,290 --> 03:06:52,590
me
