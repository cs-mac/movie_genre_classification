1
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,960
Things are never
gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,174
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,385
- You got aliens.
- Mm.

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,800
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,801
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

6
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,847
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,983
Um, actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,940
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

9
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,530
It ain't bad, is it?

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,441
No. Yeah.

11
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,484
Kid's got a future.

12
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,449
Yeah, well...

13
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,747
...we'll see, I guess.

14
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,356
No, hey! Uh-uh!

15
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,108
You can't saw through that stuff.

16
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,107
These alien bastards are tough.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,238
You gotta use the stuff they use.

18
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,236
- See? All right.
- All right.

19
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,739
Oh, hey!

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,200
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,619
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,504
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.

23
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,461
This is a huge deal for us.

24
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,092
Attention, please!

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,094
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...

26
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,803
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,059
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

28
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,514
Who the hell are you?

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,145
Qualified personnel.

30
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,650
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so...

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,405
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

32
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,863
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...

33
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,368
...or you will be prosecuted.

34
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,487
Ma'am, what am...?

35
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,533
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

36
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,291
Look...

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,957
...I bought trucks for this job.

38
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,496
I brought in a whole new crew.

39
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,166
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

40
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

41
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,971
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,257
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,580
What'd you say?

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,017
Yeah.

45
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,808
He's right. I overextended myself.

46
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,118
- Unh!
- Hey, hey, hey.

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,440
- Don't do it.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

48
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,355
Put them down.

49
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,444
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

50
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,413
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

51
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,341
<i>A joint venture
between Stark Industries...</i>

52
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,366
<i>...and the government...</i>

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,129
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

56
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,543
Yeah, it's all rigged.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,305

59
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,977
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.

60
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,114
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

61
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,185
I ain't hauling it.

62
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,564
It's too bad.

63
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,648
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.

64
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,947
I tell you what.

65
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,191
Let's keep it.

66
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,366
The world's changing.

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,914
It's time we change, too.

New York. Queens.

78
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,933
- It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?

79
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,403
No one.
Just making a little video of the trip.

80
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,780
You know
you can't show it to anyone.

81
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,896
Yeah, I know.

82
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,574
Then why are you narrating in that voice?

83
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,602
- Um... Because it's fun.
- Fun.

84
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,772
So, uh, why do they call you Happy?

85
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,617
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

86
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,699
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?

87
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,102
There's a bathroom on it.

88
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,290
Whoa, no pilot? That's awesome.

89
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,968
- Ahh.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?

90
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,084
Yeah.

91
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,245
This is your first time
on a private plane?

92
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,959
My first time on any plane.

93
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,875
Should it...? Should it be...?
Should it be making that noise?

94
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,509
Shh. Shh.

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,850
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

96
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,233
<i>Something about
Captain America going crazy.</i>

97
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,189
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

98
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,445
We're not roommates. Suit up.

99
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,947
Okay, Peter, you got this.

100
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,200
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.

101
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,156
- Where's the case?
- What case?

102
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,912
What? I thought that was a closet.

103
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,322
- This is still my room?
- Go.

104
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,286
- My room is way bigger than...
- There.

105
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,167
I found the case. I found the case.

106
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,620
"A minor upgrade"?

107
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,254
Whoa.

108
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,423
- Put it on.
- What the...?

110
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,506
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen...

111
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,012
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

112
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,549
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

113
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,597
This is insane. Insane.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,888
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.

115
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,352
- This is the greatest day of my life. Okay.
- Let's go.

116
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,868
Okay,
there's Captain America, Iron Man...

117
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,644
...Black Widow.
Whoa, who's that new guy?

118
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,654
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

119
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,918
Hey, everyone.

120
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,865
The craziest thing just happened.

121
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,703
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...

122
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,163
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

123
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,549
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

124
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,827
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?" And...

125
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,881
Hey, just a second! Coming!

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,308
Hey.

127
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,261
We have thin walls here.

128
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,227
What are you doing, a little video diary?

129
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,191
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

130
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,036
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,233
- He was filming everything. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.

132
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,443
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You know what?

133
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,950
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

134
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,532
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

135
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,535
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

136
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,033
Ha-ha-ha.

137
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,999
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over.

138
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,123
- You can edit it.
- Mm-hm.

139
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,208
- Three, two, one. Hey, May.
- Ha-ha-ha.

140
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:21,878
My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...

141
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,923
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.

142
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,090
Everyone was impressed.

143
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,152
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

144
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,862
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.

145
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,890
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

146
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,684
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

147
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,819
That was a private conversation.

148
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,458
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

149
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,916
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?

150
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
All right, here we are. End of the line. Whoops.

151
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,579
Happy, can you give us a moment?

152
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,133
- You want me to leave?
- Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

153
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,163
I can keep the suit?

154
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,420
Yes, we were just talking about it.

155
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,587
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

156
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,751
Don't stress him out.

157
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,917
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.

158
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,764
- All right?
- Yes.

159
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,301
Don't do anything I would do,
and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

160
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,438
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

161
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,316
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

162
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,983
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

163
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,565
- I can take that. You don't have to take.
- You'll take it?

164
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,106
- Okay, yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,069
So when's our next, uh...?
When's our next "retreat," you know?

166
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,862
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.

167
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,872
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

168
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,248
No, I mean, we'll call you.

169
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,576
- Like, someone will call you. All right?
- Oh.

170
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,996
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

171
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,008
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

172
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,719
Bye.

173
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,639
They're gonna call me.

174
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,728
What's up, Penis Parker?

175
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,446
<i>Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.</i>

176
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,576
<i>Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

177
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,362
<i>Do you have a date for homecoming?</i>

178
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,657
<i>Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.</i>

179
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,791
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

180
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,044
Morning.

181
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,551
Ahh, damn it.
You, in my office right now.

182
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,480
Hi!

183
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,623
Join me, and together...

184
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,945
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

185
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,869
- What?
- So lame.

186
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,621
That's awesome. How many pieces?

187
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,757
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

188
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,035
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?

189
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,882
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

190
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,960
- Mm-hm. Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

191
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,374
Always got that internship.

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,464
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

193
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,129
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

194
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,673
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

195
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,512
Here's a gold coin."

196
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,241
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

197
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,849
Oh, heh.

198
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,060
And then I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star at my place.

199
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,148
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.

200
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,776
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

201
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,782
That'd be great.

202
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,319
I'm gonna be late.

203
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,829
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...

204
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,082
...between points A and B?

205
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,288
Flash.

206
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,499
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

207
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,962
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

208
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,968
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.

209
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,628
Uh...

210
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,881
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

211
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:41,224
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

212
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,729
You're dead.

213
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,441
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

214
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,231
...but trust me,
there's nothing Bohr-ing...

215
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,693
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

216
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,713
Did Liz get a new top?

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,626
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

218
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,636
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

219
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,423
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy, though.

220
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,841
Too late.

221
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,680
You guys are losers.

222
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054
Well, then why do you sit with us?

223
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,767
Because I don't have any friends.

224
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,772
Let's move to next question.

225
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,437
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

226
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,693
Hydrogen's the lightest.

227
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,324
That's not the question. Okay.

228
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,699
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

229
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,952
That's correct. Thank you, Abraham.

230
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,159
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.

231
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,541
Peter, it's nationals.

232
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,918
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

233
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,047
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, then I have to make sure I'm here.

234
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,583
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

235
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,002
Wait. What's happening?

236
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,136
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.

237
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,468
- No, no, no.
- Why not?

238
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,348
Really? Right before nationals?

239
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,726
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

240
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,601
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

241
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,020
Flash, you're in for Peter.

242
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,311
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

243
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,696
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.

244
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,652
That is false.

245
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,193
Alright, what'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

246
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,587
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

247
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,885
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

248
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,595
Hey, Mr. Parker.

249
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,975
Number five, right?

250
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,638
Yeah, um, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

251
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,273
You got it, boss.

252
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,978
How's your aunt?

253
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,644
Yeah, she's all right.

254
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,356
She's a very hot Italian woman.

255
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,566
How's your daughter?

256
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,335
You know what?

257
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,338
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.

258
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,083
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

259
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,581
Here's 5 dollars.

260
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,628

261
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,377
How you doing, buddy?

262
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,631
So how's school?

263
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,761
Ah, you know, it's boring. Got better things to do.

264
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,174
Stay in school, kid. Stay in school.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

265
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,894

- Best sandwiches in Queens.

Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.

303
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

304
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,723
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note, um...

305
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,229
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

306
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,271
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

I just, um,
feel like I could be doing more.

when the next real mission's gonna be.

Why would I tell him about the churro?

312
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,011
Hey, hey. Aah.

313
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,842
Okay.

314
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,097
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.

315
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,853
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

316
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,863
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

317
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,736
Oh, nice.

318
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,452
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

319
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,511
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

320
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,922
Whoa, you're the Avengers.

321
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,007
What are you guys doing here?

322
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,765
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.

323
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,016
Unh!

324
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,432
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.

325
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,522
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

326
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,359
Hey...

327
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,524
Oh, this feels so weird.

328
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,619
What is that thing?

329
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm starting
to think you're not the Avengers.

330
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,889
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

331
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,510
Uh, Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

332
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,511
Alright guys. Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.

333
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,758
Aah!

334
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,052
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

335
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,014
No. Wait, wait, wait!

336
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,944
Mr. Delmar.

337
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,858
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

338
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,873
Oh, come on.

339
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,751
I gotta...

340
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,883
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

341
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,382
Okay. Good. Yes.

342
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,922
Yes... No. No, put that down.

343
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,431
That's worth more than you or me.

344
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,843
- Yeah?
- Happy, the craziest thing just happened.

345
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,478
These guys were robbing an ATM...

346
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,990
- ...with high-tech weapons...
- Take a breath. I don't have time...

347
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,891
- ...for ATM robberies...
<i>- Yeah, but...</i>

348
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,311
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

349
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,196
<i>Everything's gotta be out next week.</i>

350
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,984
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

351
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,450
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...

352
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,832
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?

353
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,746
- What about you?
- Unh!

354
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,958
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or I don't know, something big goes down?

355
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,583
<i>- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?</i>
- Stay away from anything too dangerous.

356
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,502
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

357
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,885
I am responsible. I... Oh, crap.

358
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,471
<i>- My backpack's gone.</i>
- That doesn't sound responsible.

359
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,638
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>
- Feel free not to.

360
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,782
What was that?

361
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,327
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

362
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,211
You're the Spider-Man.

363
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,214
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

364
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,810
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?

365
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,834
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

366
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,138
You can't just bust into my room!

367
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,016
Ha-ha. That turkey meatloaf recipe
is a disaster.

368
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,802
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

369
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,221
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

370
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,981
A thing to do after.

371
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,021
Okay.

372
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,857
Maybe put on some clothes.

373
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,356
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

374
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,776
I mean Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.

375
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,162
Tony Stark
made you that? Are you an Avenger?

376
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,915
Yeah, basically.

377
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,332
Whoa...

378
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,370
You can't tell anybody
about this. You gotta keep it a secret.

379
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,514
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

380
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,618
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this anymore.

381
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,925
Come on, Ned, please.

382
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,802
Okay, okay. okay.

383
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,680
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

384
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,734
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

385
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,432
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

386
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,349
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I... Please.

387
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,399
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

388
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,900
I swear.

389
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,111
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

390
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,196
I can't believe this is happening now.

391
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,611
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

392
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,755
How's it work? Is it magnet?
How do you shoot the strings?

393
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,998
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

394
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,124
Okay, well, wait, then.

395
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,787
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

396
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,044
This is the Stark internship.

397
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,252
- Oh.
- Just get out of here.

398
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,472
<i>What's the matter?</i>

399
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,550
Thought you loved larb.

400
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,890
It's too larby?

401
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,771
Not larby enough.

402
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,527
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?

403
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,858
You know I larb you.

404
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,069
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

405
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,279
A lot of work.

406
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,694
The Stark internship.

407
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,490
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

408
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,918
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

409
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,846
<i>Delmar's Sandwiches...</i>

410
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,167
What does he have you doing?

411
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,058
<i>- ...was detroyed in an explosion earlier tonight...</i>
- You need to use your instincts.

412
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,211
<i>...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own local crime stopper...</i>

413
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,469
What?

414
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,175
<i>...the Spider-Man.</i>

415
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,682
<i>As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...</i>

416
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,516
<i>...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.</i>

417
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,726
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

418
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,984
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

419
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,895
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

420
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,358
Six blocks away from us.

421
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,523
I, uh, need a new backpack.

422
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,152
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

423
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,827
That's five.

424
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,374
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

425
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,375
It's on the house.

426
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,419
Oh, thanks.

427
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,465
That's nice of him.

428
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,502
I think he larbs you, heh.

429
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,346
<i>You got bit by a spider?</i>

430
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,972
Can it bite me?

431
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,974
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

432
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,431
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

433
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,187
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

434
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,564
The spider's dead, Ned.

435
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,270
Whoa.

436
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,900
You were here?

437
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,027
Yeah.

438
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,821
You could've died.

439
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,910
- Do you lay eggs?
- What?

440
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,078
No. Ha-ha.

441
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,296
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

442
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,756
Can you summon an army of spiders?

443
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,011
No, Ned.

444
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,094
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...

445
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,554
How far can you shoot your webs?

446
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,070
It's unknown. Shut up.

447
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,346
--to begin regulating...

448
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,856
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...

449
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,393
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could...
- Shut up, Ned.

450
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,439
<i>Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're

456
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,416
Thank you, Captain.

457
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,624
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

458
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,006
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

459
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,809
- Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
- Shh!

460
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,513
- What does Hulk smell like?
- Shh!

461
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,746
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

462
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,514
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

463
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,596
Ned, just, shh, okay?

464
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,262
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

465
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,977
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...

466
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,983
...telling the other guy where to go?

467
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,986
Like if you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

468
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,739
Because there'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

469
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,992
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- Ned, I don't need a guy in the chair.

470
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,824
Looking good, Parker.

471
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,492
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...

472
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,535
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

473
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,545
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

474
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,921
It's just "Spider-Man."

475
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,300
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

476
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,301
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.

477
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,552
No way.

478
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,760
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

479
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,985
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

480
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,977
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

481
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,855
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

482
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,891
Peter knows Spider-Man.

483
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,858
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

484
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,361
They're friends.

485
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,493
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends. Heh.

486
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,371
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

487
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,910
But it's, um...

488
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,955
...through the Stark internship.
Mm-hm.

489
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,583
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

490
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,623
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

491
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,463
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

492
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,926
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

493
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,510
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

494
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,902
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.

495
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,179
- Um...
- It's okay.

496
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,064
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

497
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,066
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?

498
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,903
What are you doing?

499
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,568
Helping you out.

500
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,327
Did you not hear her?

501
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,955
Liz has a crush on you.

502
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,451
Dude, you're an Avenger.

503
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,498
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

504
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,302
House party in the suburbs.

505
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,840
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

506
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,634
- It'll be a night to remember.
- Oh, ha-ha-ha.

507
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,520
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

508
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,647
- Yeah, it gives me confidence.
- Heh.

509
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,023
This is a mistake.

510
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,434
Hey, let's just go home.

511
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,068
Oh, Peter.

512
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,980
I know. I know it's really hard...

513
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,400
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

514
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,613
It's flowering now.

515
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,195
Uh-huh. Heh, heh.

516
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,863
He's so stressed out lately.

517
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,623
What helps with stress is a party.

518
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,661
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

519
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,713
Peter.

520
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,633
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.

521
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,792
Bye, May.

522
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,753
Come dance with me!

523
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,763
Dude, you have the suit, right?

524
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,175
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.

525
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,019
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

526
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,353
Hey.

527
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,106
<i>DJ Flash.</i>

528
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,491
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...

529
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,620
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

530
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,906
Can't believe you guys at this lame party.

531
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,289
But you're here too.

532
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,997
Am I?

533
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,749
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

534
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,667
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

535
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,711
I'm so happy you guys came.

536
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,381
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

537
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,850
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

538
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,763
Oh, I...

539
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,603
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

540
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,234
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

541
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

542
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,521
Dude, what are you doing?

543
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,782
She's here. Spider it up.

544
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,568
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

545
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,988
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

546
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,828
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

547
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,292
Peter, no one wants that.

548
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,252
Dude.

549
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,540
Penis Parker, what's up?

550
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,542
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

551
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,257
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

552
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,966
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

553
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,605
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

554
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,817
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

555
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,152
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

556
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,612
He must be around..."

557
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,575
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

558
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,793
What the hell?

559
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,061
Whoo! Unh!

560
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,361
This sucks.

561
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,655
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

562
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,917
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

563
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,372
Here. You try.

564
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,336
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

565
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,592
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

566
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,549
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

567
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,767
Okay, I got, uh, black-hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...

568
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,085
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

569
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,808
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.

570
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,235
Oh, this must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

571
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,773
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

572
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,158
I got antigrav climbers.

573
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,443
Yo, climbers?

574
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,201
Okay, what the hell is that?

575
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,375
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

576
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,716
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

577
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,000
All right.

578
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,211
Unh!

579
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,924
Aah! Aah!

580
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,641
What was that?

581
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,192
Oh, no, no! Unh!

582
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,156
What...? Aah!

583
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,954
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.

584
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,872
Aah! Unh!

585
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,054
Did you just do it again?

586
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,251
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

587
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,215
Toomes' phone.

588
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,889
Boss.

589
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,271
Oh, my butt! Unh!

590
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,042
Great. Guess I'm gonna
have to take a shortcut.

591
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,835
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

592
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,750
Hey, hey, buddy.

593
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,419
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

594
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,097
Whoo! Now, this is more like it.

595
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,553
Whoa!

596
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,894
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

597
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,562
Smells really good.

598
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,273
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪♪</i>

599
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,734
Great movie!

600
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,242
Ugh... on, hey, guys.

601
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,378
- Aah!
- No! No!

602
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,347
<i>Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.</i>

603
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,924
Peter, where are you?

604
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,959
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

605
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,379
Almost got you.

606
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,477
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?

607
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,609
I got you right where I want you.

608
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,857
Surprise!

609
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,950
What the hell?

610
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,496
Huh?

611
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,957
Oh, hey.

612
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,464
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

613
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,176
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

614
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,175
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?

615
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,184
I put everything in your suit.

616
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,686
Including this heater.

617
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,231
Whoa!

618
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,232
Whew, that's better. Thanks.

619
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,685
What were you thinking?

620
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,152
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

621
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,986
Take him down now, huh?

622
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,948
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

623
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,954
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.

624
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,115
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.

625
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,704
I had that. I was fine.

626
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,295
<i>Oh, I'm not here.</i>

627
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,961
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

628
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,966
...or you would be toast right now.

629
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,095
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

630
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,426
<i>Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.</i>

631
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,636
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

632
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,846
Because I said so!

633
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,013
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

634
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,647
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

635
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:49,855
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.

636
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,401
Can't you just be a friendly...

637
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,399
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

638
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,283
But I'm ready for more than that now.

639
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,823
<i>No, you're not.</i>

640
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,305
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

641
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,074
<i>Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.</i>

642
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,711
<i>Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

643
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,626
Are you driving?

644
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,793
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

645
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,710
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

646
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,592
No, I don't need to go to...

647
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,803
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

648
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,353
That's awesome.

649
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,442
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

650
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,746
Whoa.

651
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,164
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.

652
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,550
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

653
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,927
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

654
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,087
- Penis!
- Parker!

655
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,471
- Penis!
- Parker!

656
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,183
<i>Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.</i>

657
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,311
<i>- I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.

658
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,547
Whoa.

659
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,707
Whoa, whoa.

660
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,060
Idiots.

661
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,013
Idiots.

662
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,726
Idiots!

663
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,604
Boss?

664
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,233
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

665
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,818
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

666
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,233
Oh. Sorry. You left it out.

667
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,242
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

668
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,282
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

669
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,490
Huh?

670
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,536
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

671
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,750
You're still on that? I told you, no.

672
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,460
The answer's no. Forget it.

673
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,179
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

674
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,600
Ha-ha.

675
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,603
I mean, that was badass. Ha.

676
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,102
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

677
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,817
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

678
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,196
Under the radar!

679
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,108
That's how we survive.

680
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,619
If you bring Damage Control or
the Avengers down here, we're through.

681
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,206
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...

682
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,867
...calling yourself the Shocker.

683
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,162
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

684
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,126
Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.

685
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,003
Look.

686
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,588
Look.

687
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,425
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.

688
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,214
But I do.

689
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,510
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.

690
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,896
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

691
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,561
You know what?

692
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,398
I can't afford your bullshit.

693
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,028
- Get out of here.
- What?

694
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,487
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.

695
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,405
All right. Heh.

696
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,990
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

697
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,996
With everything I know.

698
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,792
- Excuse me?
- Uh, I'm just saying...

699
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,793
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

700
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
- You know what?
- What?

701
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,754
You're right.

702
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,385
- That work?
- I don't know.

703
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,217
I can't afford that.

704
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,925
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

705
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,058
Damn.

706
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,021
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

707
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,279
No, that's that one.

708
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,791
Here.

709
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,959
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.

710
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,172
All right.

711
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,929
Oh.

712
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,392
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

713
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,522
Yeah, well, something came up.

714
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,898
What is that?

715
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,857
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

716
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,487
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

717
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,113
Awesome.

718
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,367
I mean, not awesome.
Heh, totally uncool of that guy.

719
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,323
So scary.

720
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,326
Well, look, I think it's...

721
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,957
...a power source.

722
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,709
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

723
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,088
That's an inductive charging plate.
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

724
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,295
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

725
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,338
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

726
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,553
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...

727
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,093
...into this amazing...

728
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,727
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

729
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,978
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

730
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,363
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.

731
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,819
Let's do it.

732
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,578
First, I say we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

733
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,210
First, we gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."

734
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,461
You're right.

735
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,081
Crap.

736
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,925
Come on, come on, come on.

737
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,385
High schools creep me out.

738
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,058
They got this funny smell, you know?

739
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,515
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

740
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,725
What?

741
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,389
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

742
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,433
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

743
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,193
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

744
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,605
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

745
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,028
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

746
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,784
Peter.

747
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,076
What are you doing?

748
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,439
Nothing. Heh.

749
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,827
- Oh.
- Yeah. You good?

750
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,040
Chess.

751
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,422
Can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

752
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,678
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

753
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,304
There's no sign of the weapon.

754
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,386
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.

755
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,922
This is so awesome.

756
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,927
I know, right?

757
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,929
They're in Brooklyn.

758
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,063
Staten Island.

759
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,693
Leaving Jersey.

760
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,906
They stopped.

761
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,037
Huh.

762
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,751
Maryland?

763
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,163
- What's there?
- I don't know.

764
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,376
Evil lair? Heh.

765
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,962
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...

766
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,922
...run by a guy with wings? 
Yeah, they have a lair.

767
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,507
Badass.

768
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,549
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

769
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,394
It's not too far from D.C.

770
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,596
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

771
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,810
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

772
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,850
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

773
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,643
No, no way. You can't quit on us...

774
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,438
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.

775
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,483
Hey, welcome back, Peter!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

776
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,992
- What?
- He's taking your place.

777
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,527
Excuse me, can we go already?

778
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,494
Because I was hoping to get in some light protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

779
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,125
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

780
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,672
<i>Focus up, everyone.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.</i>

781
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,458
The second law of thermodynamics.

782
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,923
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.

783
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,925
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.

784
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,431
Liz, don't overwork them.

785
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,641
Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.

786
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,519
- Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
- Glad to be back.

787
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,142
- What is the current standard unit of...?
- Can I take this real quick?

788
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,810
Yeah, fine.

789
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,774
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.

790
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,983
You left New York?

791
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,989
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker. Uh...

792
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,071
Yeah, no, it's just a school trip.
It's, uh, nothing.

793
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,656
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...

794
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,617
...is a complete violation of my privacy.

795
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,123
- That's different.
- What's different?

796
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,751
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.

797
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,004
<i>- It's no big deal.</i>
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

798
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,759
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

799
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,728
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

800
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,066
You kidding me? This place is huge.

801
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,819
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

802
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,232
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

803
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,658
Peter...

804
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,828
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

805
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,204
Uh...

806
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,500
...I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...

807
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,589
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.

808
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,595
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

809
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,381
No, I'm not lying.

810
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,175
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

811
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,224
Ah...

812
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,265
Gotcha.

813
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,607
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

814
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,986
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...

815
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,026
- Hmm?
- ...but they're all disabled...

816
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,412
...by the Training Wheels Protocol.

817
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,696
What?

818
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,493
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.

819
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,583
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

820
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,339
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.

821
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,876
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

822
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,340
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

823
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,597
Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.

824
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,510
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?

825
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,646
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

826
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,556
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

827
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,441
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.

828
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,065
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

829
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,082
Yeah ,the glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

830
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,837
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

831
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,003
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

832
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,762
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

833
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,298
We're gonna go swimming.

834
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,385
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

835
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,552
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

836
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,563
Hey.

837
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,027
I was, uh... I was
gonna go study in the business center.

838
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,663
Peter, you don't need to study.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

839
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,984
And besides...

840
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,947
...um, a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

841
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,110
Hmm?

842
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,496
Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

843
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,907
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

844
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,996
And I read a coaching book.

845
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,170
Wow, you really...
This is really important to you.

846
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,206
Yeah. It's our future.

847
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,794
I'm not gonna screw it up.

848
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,713
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

849
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,133
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

850
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,427
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

851
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,640
Let's go.

852
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,788
<i>- Good evening, Peter.</i>
- Hello? Hello?

853
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,878
<i>Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...</i>

854

Ah, thank you.

00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,346
<i>Where would you like
to take me tonight?</i>

857
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,224
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

858
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,431
<i>Tracker located.</i>

859
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,138
<i>Plotting course to intercept target.</i>

860
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,399
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

861
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,118
<i>One hundred meters

<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

864
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,999
Why is their secret
lair in a gas station? That's so lame.

865
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,896
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

866
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,356
<i>Do you want to hear
what they're saying?</i>

867
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,849
I can hear what they're saying? Uh, yeah.

868
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,931
<i>Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.</i>

869
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,013
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.

870
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,054
The rest is my design.

871
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,518
Whoa, that's so cool.

872
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:41,825
Can't believe they're still cleaning up...

873
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,493
- ...that Triskelion mess.
- I love it.

874
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,111
They keep making messes,
we keep getting rich.

875
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,271
Target inbound.

876
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,165
Whoa, they're in the middle of a heist.

877
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,362
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

878
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,962
Okay,
I'll get closer to see what's happening.

879

00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,671
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

887

What's wrong with my web-shooters?

888
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,605
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.</i>

889
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,483
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
<i>- Would you like to see more options?</i>

890

<i>You have 576 possible

You two wait right here.

893
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,151
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

894
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,617
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?

895
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,497
- That one.
<i>- Great choice.</i>

<i>Would you like me to set this

No, no, no.

898
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,501
- Push that in. No, the other...
- Here? This one here?

899

- What was that?
<i>- Taser webs.</i>

900

Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

901

<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

deep-storage vault.</i>

934
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,171
No. Seriously? Argh!

935
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,796
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

936
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,256
Morning?

937
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:43,515
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

938
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,972
I think I should probably give you a name.

939
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,478
Like Liz. No, no, no.

940
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,639
God, that's... That's weird.

941
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,184
What about Karen?

942
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,578
<i>You can call me Karen
if you would like.</i>

943
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,731
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

944
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,816
What?

945
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,906
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

946
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,661
<i>- Ricochet web.</i>
- Ricochet web.

947
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,290
- Whoa. Cool.
<i>- Splitter web.</i>

948
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,328
<i>- Web grenade.</i>
- Web grenade!

949
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,753
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

950
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,007
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

951
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,794
Who's Liz? Heh. She's... Heh, heh.

952
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,429
She's the best. She's awesome.

953
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,307
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

954
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,512
And, uh...

955
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,600
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

956
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,982
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

957
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,267
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

958
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,482
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

959
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,646
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

960
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,363
<i>Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.</i>

961
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,027
Thanks, Karen.

962
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,946
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

963
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,956
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

964
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,992
<i>- Thirty-seven minutes.</i>
- What?!

965
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,877
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

966
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,711
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

967
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,469
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

968
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,255
Okay, let's see.

969
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,969
Nope.

970
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,347
That's awesome.

971
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,053
Oh.

972
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,459
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

973
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,600
<i>That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.</i>

974
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,768
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

975
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,656
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.</i>

976
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,487
No, no, no.

977
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,241
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

978
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,406
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

979
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,078
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

980
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,746
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

981
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,873
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

982
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,297
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

983
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,682
Okay. Uh, hold on, hold on.

984
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,647
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

985
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,558
It worked. It works.

986
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,623
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

987
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,829
Thank you.

988
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,011
Karen, get me to
decathlon as fast as possible.

989
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,304
<i>Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.</i>

990
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,098
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.

991
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,265
<i>It's Ned. Leave a message.</i>

992
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,132
Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!

993
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,099
<i>There's a vehicle
approaching on your right.</i>

994
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,477
We have now entered sudden death.

995
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,434
The next correct answer wins
the championship.

996
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,690
Midtown Tech?

997
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,480
Zero.

998
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,693
That is correct.

999
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,738
Midtown takes the championship.

1000
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,242
Woo-hoo! We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

1001
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,578
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.

1002
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,711
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just, um...

1003
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,269
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

1004
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,840
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

1005
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,341
Okay.

1006
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,968
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

1007
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,019
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

1008
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,778
Hey Ned, Ned, where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

1009
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,524
- Don't worry, it's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, no Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.

1010
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,403
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

1011
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,358
- Listen to me.
- We're at the Washington Monument.

1012
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,897
- Peter, is that you?
- Oh, hey, Liz.

1013
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,624
<i>- Is that Liz?</i>
- Put Ned back on the phone.

1014
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,777
<i>- You should tell her how you feel.</i>
- You flake. You are so lucky we won.

1015
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,538
You know, I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

1016
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,217
Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It's important.

1017
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,565
All items on the belt, please.

1018
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,844
<i>There's something in Ned's backpack.</i>

1019
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,870
<i>It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through an x-ray.</i>

1020
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,963
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

1021
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,760
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

1022
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:02,725
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

1023
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,480
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

1024
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,326
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

1025
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,923
<i>The Chitauri core has detonated...</i>

1026
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,136
<i>...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.</i>

1027
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,513
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

1028
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,086
What? Uh, don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

1029
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,342
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

1030
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,924
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

1031
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,593
Just stay calm, everyone.

1032
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,432
Oh, we are all going to die here.

1033
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,729
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

1034
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,393
We're freaking screwed.

1035
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,689
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

1036
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,278
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

1037
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,113
We're very safe in here.

1038
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,870
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

1039
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,120
Going as fast as I can!

1040
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,471
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

1041
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,904
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

1042
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,091
What?! Why?

1043
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,592
<i>Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.</i>

1044
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,227
- How do I get in there?
<i>- Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

1045
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,979
Whoa. Has that been there
this whole time? That's awesome.

1046
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,686
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

1047
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,068
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

1048
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,982
Karen, I'm on my way.

1049
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,568
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

1050
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,914
Keep coming, keep coming.

1051
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,964
Okay. Oh, my God.

1052
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,804
Okay.

1053
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,654
<i>What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.</i>

1054
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,430
<i>- Why are you hesitating?</i>
- It's fine.

1055
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,315
I've just never been this high before.

1056
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,647
<i>You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...</i>

1057
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,528
<i>...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

1058
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,981
Oh.

1059
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,615
Alright, Perfect.

1060
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,367
Oh, my God.

1061
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,028
Why is it not breaking?

1062
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,870
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.</i>

1063
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,437
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

1064
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,188
My friends are in there! Stop!

1065
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,099
Return to the ground immediately.

1066
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,268
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

1067
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,277
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

1068
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,406
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1069
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,035
Stand down!

1070
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,951
Return to the ground immediately.

1071
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,124
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

1072
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,134
Go up, go up.

1073
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,337
I got this.

1074
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,176
Take my trophy.

1075
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,226
This is your last chance.

1076
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,432
I'm gonna die.

1077
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,563
Look out!

1078
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,738
Break!

1079
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,000
I did it. Whoa!

1080
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,987
Hey,
how you doing? Don't worry. I got you.

1081
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,560
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey..

1082
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,816
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- Sorry, sir. I'm so sorry.

1083
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,483
Let's go, let's go!

1084
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,407
Okay, okay.

1085
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,537
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

1086
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,494
- Alright, this is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1087
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,580
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1088
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,503
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

1089
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,379
Liz!

1090
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,257
You're okay. You're okay.

1091
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,133
Okay.

1092
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,971
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

1093
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,011
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1094
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,180
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1095
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,947
So is everyone okay?

1096
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,185
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1097
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,195
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1098
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,614
Thank you.

1099
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,161
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1100
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:22,003
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...

1101
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,758
Yeah, damn it.

1102
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,495
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1103
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,634
Yeah, but then that's it.

1104
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,225
Oh.

1105
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,857
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1106
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,743
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1107
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,269
No.

1108
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,024
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...

1109
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,240
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.

1110
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:53,125
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1111
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,958
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1112
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,002
Really?

1113
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,338
I'm gonna kill him.

1114
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,548
- I'm gonna find him...
- I found him.

1115
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,147
<i>The Spider-Man swooped in...</i>

1116
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,095
<i>...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.</i>

1117
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,476
<i>The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.</i>

1118
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,478
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

1119
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,143
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.

1120
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,566
<i>This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...</i>

1121
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,703
<i>...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.</i>

1122
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,534
<i>Later that day,
they also defeated death.</i>

1123
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,119
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.</i>

1124
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,082
<i>There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

1125
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,623
<i>As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.</i>

1126
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,884
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1127
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,174
<i>Not again.</i>

1128
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:51,467
<i>Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.</i>

1129
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,594
<i>- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

1130
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,559
<i>Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1131
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,349
<i>How can you show your spider spirit?</i>

1132
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,192
Dude, dude, dude.

1133
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,074
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1134
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,701
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1135
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,702
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

1136
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,660
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1137
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:18,168
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.

1138
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,221
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1139
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,792
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
Right?

1140
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,878
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1141
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,044
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

1142
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,134
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.

1143
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,515
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.

1144
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,723
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...

1145
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,853
- ...so when I bring this guy in...
- Dude.

1146
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,935
You want to be a high school dropout?

1147
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,772
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1148
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,653
Parker, my office.

1149
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,941
<i>So...</i>

1150
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,610
<i>...you got detention.</i>

1151
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,949
<i>You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.</i>

1152
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,490
<i>The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?</i>

1153
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,976
<i>Maybe you were trying to be cool.</i>

1154
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,207
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...</i>

1155
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,498
<i>...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.</i>

1156
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,126
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1157
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,842
<i>Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...</i>

1158
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,364
<i>- ... you know is wrong...</i>
- Where you going? Get back here.

1159
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,801
<i>...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?</i>

1160
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,765
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

1161
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,522
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.

1162
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,273
It's you.

1163
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,524
<i>So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.</i>

1164
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,791
May?

1165
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,337
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1166
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,297
<i>Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1167
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,687
I was wondering if you could help me.

1168
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,356
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

1169
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,849
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1170
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,807
<i>I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.</i>

1171
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,471
- Footage?
<i>- Yes, Peter.</i>

1172
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,515
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1173
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,807
- Everything?
<i>- Everything.</i>

1174
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,318
- All the time?
<i>- It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.</i>

1175
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,026
Yeah, of course it is. Um...

1176
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,074
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
<i>- With pleasure.</i>

1177
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,253
<i>Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1178
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,871
<i>Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.</i>

1179
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,998
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1180
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,875
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1181
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,207
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin.</i>

1182
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,838
No, no, no. That's definitely...

1183
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,724
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1184
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:32,252
<i>- Your impressions are funny.</i>
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1185
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,715
Okay.

1186
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,505
The two on the right, who are they?

1187
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,390
<i>Searching law-enforcement databases.</i>

1188
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,259
<i>No records found
for two of the individuals.</i>

1189
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,520
- Nothing?
<i>- One individual identified.</i>

1190
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,807
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1191
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,816
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.</i>

1192
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,227
Let's pay him a visit.

1193
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,739
<i>Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?</i>

1194
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,989
Uh, yeah.

1195
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,957
- Remember me?
- Hey...

1196
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,967
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1197
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,844
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1198
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,214
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?

1199
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,609
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1200
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,603
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1201
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,604
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1202
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,436
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1203
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,942
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1204
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,403
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1205
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:40,366
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1206
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,818
Look, man.

1207
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,167
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1208
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,747
They can't be out on the streets.

1209
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,083
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half...

1210
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,840
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1211
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,218
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- Eh, it's too much bread.

1212
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,504
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

1213
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,558
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1214
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,187
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1215
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,813
It's pretty ballsy.

1216
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,020
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1217
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,560
I got a nephew who live here.

1218
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,021
Who are these guys?

1219
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,147
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1220
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,592
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1221
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,659
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1222
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:27,121
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

1223
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,536
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...

1224
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,125
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1225
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,915
Yes! Yes.

1226
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,674
- Thank...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1227
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,131
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1228
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,797
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1229
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,215
Yeah.

1230
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,554
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

1231
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,763
- Hmm?
- You gotta get better at this part of the job.

1232
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,397
I don't understand.

1233
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,932
I'm intimidating.

1234
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,977
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1235
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,861
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1236
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,614
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1237
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,584
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1238
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,202
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1239
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,131
Nice.

1240
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,049
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1241
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,263
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1242
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,762
He's up front, main deck.

1243
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,350
I hate this guy.

1244
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,857
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1245
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,642
Just keep me posted.

1246
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,829
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1247
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,665
<i>Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?</i>

1248
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,112
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1249
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:47,364
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1250
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,715
- Who's the guy on the left?
<i>- Mac Gargan.</i>

1251
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,297
<i>Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.</i>

1252
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,302
<i>Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?</i>

1253
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,886
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1254
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,389
White pickup truck.

1255
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,021
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1256
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,165
Oh, this is too perfect.

1257
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,675
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1258
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,803
<i>- Incoming call from Tony Stark.</i>
- No, no, no.

1259
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,134
- Don't answer.
<i>- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?</i>

1260
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,720
- Uh, I'm actually at school.
<i>- No, you're not.</i>

1261
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,760
<i>- Nice work in D. C.</i>
- Okay.

1262
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,646
<i>My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...</i>

1263
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,977
<i>...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.</i>

1264
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,451
Uh, I'm in the middle of something.

1265
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,994
<i>Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.</i>

1266
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,645
<i>Anyway, great things are about to happen...</i>

1267
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,778
<i>- What is that?</i>
- Uh, I'm at band practice.

1268
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:09,617
<i>That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?</i>

1269
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,998
- I gotta go. Uh, end call.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1270
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,282
I'll take those!

1271
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,330
Yoink.

1272
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:20,256
Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.

1273
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,883
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1274
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

1275
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,189
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1276
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,900
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.

1277
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,572
I'm honestly...

1278
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,699
I'm... I'm shocked.

1279
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,713
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

1280
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,670
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

1281
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:04,880
What do you mean, FBI?

1282
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,467
<i>- Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>
- I know, but what are they doing here?

1283
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,523
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1284
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No.

1285
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,526
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1286
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,552
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

1287
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,242
We're getting out of here.

1288
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,413
Activate Taser web!

1289
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,881
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1290
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,048
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...

1291
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,464
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1292
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,347
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1293
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,397
Splitter web, go.

1294
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,587
<i>Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1295
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,007
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!

1296
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,769
No, no, no.

1297
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,326
No!

1298
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,005
What the hell?

1299
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,302
What the hell?

1300
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,813
<i>Hi, Spider-Man.</i>

1301
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,350
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1302
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,215
Yeah, Iron Man!

1303
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,391
Uh, Mr. Stark.

1304
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:27,396
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1305
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,433
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1306
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,825
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1307
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,671
Feds were waiting for us.

1308
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,504
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1309
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,923
Yeah, I'm running.

1310
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,883
You should too.

1311
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,264
You know I can't do that.

1312
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,640
So now what?

1313
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,771
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1314
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,932
Seriously?

1315
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,271
Yes. You will not regret this.

1316
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,231
You in?

1317
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,960
<i>Previously on</i> Peter Screws the Pooch...

1318
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,836
<i>...I tell you to stay away from this.</i>

1319
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,623
<i>Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...</i>

1320
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,042
<i>...so you could sneak around
behind my back...</i>

1321
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:42,213
<i>- ...doing the one thing I told you not to do.</i>
- Is everyone okay?

1322
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,591
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1323
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,385
No thanks to me?

1324
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,556
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

1325
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,100
...but you didn't listen.

1326
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,691
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1327
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,901
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1328
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,538
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1329
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,283
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1330
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,249
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1331
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,709
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1332
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,466
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

1333
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,720
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1334
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,221
And if you died...

1335
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,599
...I feel like that's on me.

1336
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,844
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

1337
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,595
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

1338
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,144
I just wanted to be like you.

1339
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,853
And I wanted you to be better.

1340
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,979
Okay, it's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1341
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,364
- For how long?
- Forever.

1342
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,571
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no, no, no. Please, please.

1343
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,656
- Let's have it.
- Please, you need to understand this is all I have.

1344
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,196
I'm nothing without this suit.

1345
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,466
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1346
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,704
Okay?

1347
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,085
God, I sound like my dad.

1348
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,998
I don't have any other clothes.

1349
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,667
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1350
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,221
Hey.

1351
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,361
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1352
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,988
You can't do that.

1353
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:25,775
Then this ferry thing happens.

1354
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,615
I've called five police stations.

1355
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:29,994
Five.

1356
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,090
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1357
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,744
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1358
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,707
Cut the bullshit.

1359
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,543
I know you left detention.

1360
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:42,208
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1361
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,297
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1362
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,757
That's not fine.

1363
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:49,549
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.

1364
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:50,762
It's just me and you.

1365
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,261
I lost the Stark internship.

1366
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,438
- What?
- Yeah.

1367
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,015
What happened?

1368
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:02,653
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could... He would... You know.

1369
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,947
But I screwed it up.

1370
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,904
It's okay, it's okay.

1371
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,237
It's okay.

1372
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,535
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1373
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,541
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1374
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,997
Yeah, I know.

1375
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,457
Just...

1376
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,998
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

1377
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,173
And take a shower. You smell.

1378
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,214
You smell like garbage.

1379
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,007
I know.

1380
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,396
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

1381
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,182
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1382
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,275
Okay.

1383
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,277
All right, get out of here.

1384
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,278
Are you expelled?

1385
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,449
Do you have to go to that high school on 46
where the principal has a crossbow?

1386
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,960
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1387
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,792
You're so lucky.

1388
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,296
Hey.

1389
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,591
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1390
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,135
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1391
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,020
Hey, look, I, uh...

1392
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,606
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.

1393
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,857
It's fine.

1394
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:09,067
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1395
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,152
No, I'm...

1396
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:13,317
I just mean that...

1397
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,366
...it was not cool, especially...

1398
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,865
...because...

1399
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,710
...I like you.

1400
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,704
I know.

1401
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,379
You do?

1402
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,170
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1403
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,009
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1404
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,680
I got to get to class, but, um...

1405
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:43,313
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention for...

1406
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,438
- Uh-huh.
- ...ever, but, um...

1407
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,945
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1408
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,825
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...

1409
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,744
Uh, do you want to...

1410
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,950
...go with me?

1411
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,748
Yeah. Sure.

1412
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,535
Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.

1413
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,332
Cool.

1414
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,422
I'm actually going that way.

1415
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,254
Um...

1416
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,476
May, I need your help.

Yeah.

1443
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,209

1444
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,339
Hell of a grip.

1445
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,800
Come on in here. Come on.

1446
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,572
Hi, Peter.

1447
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,831
You look very handsome.

1448
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,492
Thank you.

1449
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,786
You got his name right?

1450
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,329
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1451
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,713
- Peter. Peter.
- Heh.

1452
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,832
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1453
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,796
Okay.

1454
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,974
You all right, Pete?

1455
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,259
Yeah.

1456
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,013
Because you look pale.

1457
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,315
You want something to drink?

1458
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,727
Like a bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1459
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,190
I'm not old enough to drink.

1460
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,150
That's the right answer.

1461
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,274
Wow.

1462
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:45,370
- Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1463
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,951
Doesn't she, Pete?

1464
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,491
Yeah, you look really good.

1465
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,877
Once again, that's the right answer.

1466
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,083
Is that a corsage?

1467
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,333
Thanks.

1468
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:00,719
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so, uh,
let's get this show on the road.

1469
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,051
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

1470
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,467
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1471
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,101
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1472
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,938
Peter, closer.

1473
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,557
Smile.

1474
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,314
There you go.

1475
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,019
Oh...

1476
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,281
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

1477
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,662
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1478
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,744
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.

1479
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,283
- Thank you.
- Promise.

1480
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,871
- He's cute.
- Shh.

1481
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,547
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

1482
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,299
Come on, Pedro.

1483
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,380
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1484
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,348
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

1485
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,646
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1486
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,319
- Oh, um, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1487
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,063
Just saying, you know.

1488
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,982
All you guys who go to that school...

1489
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,572
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1490
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,283
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1491
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:12,871
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
So I think he doesn't have to worry.

1492
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,327
- Really? Stark?
- Mm-hm.

1493
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,211
So cool.

1494
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,418
What do you do?

1495
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,801
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1496
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,963
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got, um...

1497
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,176
...boring.

1498
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:30,309
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

1499
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,390
Really? Spider-Man?

1500
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,434
Wow. What's he like?

1501
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,061
Yeah, he's nice.

1502
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,067
Nice man.

1503
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,069
Solid dude.

1504
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,904
Hmm.

1505
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,075
Look. So cute.

1506
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,868
Aww...

1507
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,666
I've seen you around, right? I mean...

1508
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,534
...somewhere. We've, uh...

1509
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,544
Have we ever...?
Because even the voice...

1510
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,040
Um, he does Academic Decathlon
with me.

1511
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,625
- Oh.
- And he was at my party.

1512
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,170
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1513
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:10,557
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows. Heh.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.

1514
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,470
That was... I was there longer
than two seconds.

1515
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:18,140
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1516
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:22,482
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1517
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:33,405
Whew. That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C., though.

1518
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,198
Were you scared?

1519
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,535
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...

1520
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,796
...showed up in the elevator,
though, huh?

1521
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,299
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.

1522
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,210
I saw it all from the ground.

1523
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,554
Yeah.

1524
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,223
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1525
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,934
Good old Spider-Man.

1526
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,439
Dad, the light.

1527
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,044
Here we are. End of the line.

1528
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,624
Thanks, Dad.

1529
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,626
You head in there, gumdrop.

1530
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:27,542
I'm gonna give Peter the, uh, "dad" talk.

1531
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,387
Don't let him intimidate you.

1532
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,763
Love you.

1533
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,391
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1534
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,767
Hi.

1535
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,100
You guys look so pretty.

1536
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,981
Does she know?

1537
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,317
Know what?

1538
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,232
So she doesn't. Good.

1539
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,071
Close to the vest.

1540
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,405
I admire that.

1541
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,696
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1542
01:32:56,321 --> 01:33:00,167
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...

1543
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,749
Peter...

1544
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,131
...nothing is more important than family.

1545
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,087
You saved my daughter's life.

1546
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,092
I could never forget something like that.

1547
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,003
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1548
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,296
Are you ready?

1549
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:17,009
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1550
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,804
...and don't you ever, ever...

1551
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,564
...interfere with my business again.

1552
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,646
Because if you do...

1553
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,062
...I'll kill you...

1554
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,821
...and everybody you love.

1555
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,907
I'll kill you dead.

1556
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,865
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1557
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,201
Hey.

1558
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,957
I just saved your life.
Now, what do you say?

1559
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,505
Thank you.

1560
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,416
You're welcome.

1561
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:55,134
Now, you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?

1562
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,757
Just not too good.

I'm sorry.

You don't deserve this.

1576
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,650
He gave you a choice.

1577
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,902
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1578
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,734
What's with the crappy costume?

1579
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,365
My web-shooters.

1580
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:51,880
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.

1581
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,424
Ugh. Gross.

1582
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,851
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1583
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,191
Nice shot!

1584
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,655
Yes!

1585
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,665
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1586
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:29,701
- What?
- I know, I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1587
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:32,711
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1588
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,230
And get a computer and track my phone.

1589
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,392
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...

1590
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,714
...before he leaves town.

1591
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,095
I'm sorry about dinner...

1592
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:44,804
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So...

1593
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:47,987
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1594
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,764
Uh, sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't...

1595
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,417
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1596
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,443
- Go for Ned.
<i>- Ned, I need you...</i>

1597
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:05,949
- ...to track my phone for me.
- Yeah, but where is it?

1598
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,429
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1599
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,673
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1600
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,175
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1601
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,304
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1602
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,844
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move! Move!

1603
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,767
- Are you okay?
<i>- I've never driven before...</i>

1604
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,475
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1605
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,034
<i>Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?</i>

1606
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:38,403
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1607
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,532
Guy in the chair.

1608
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,174
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1609
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,371
<i>- Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>
- Uh...

1610
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:53,653
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
<i>- Who?</i>

1611
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:56,180
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you...

1612
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,751
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

1613
01:37:58,456 --> 01:37:59,503
Damn.

1614
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,043
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1615
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,472
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1616
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:07,928
Left, okay.

1617
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,889
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1618
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:11,265
Um...

1619
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,197
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1620
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,020
What? That makes no sense.
I thought he said he was going out of town.

1621
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,607
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1622
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,442
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1623
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,873
<i>He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.</i>

1624
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,899
- What?
- He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.

1625
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:26,613
Boxes? It's moving day.

1626
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,744
It's moving day. It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1627
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,780
I gotta stop him!

1628
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,748
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1629
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,504
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster armor...

1630
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,088
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging...

1631
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,797
The Meg... The...

1632
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,132
Thor's magic belt.

1633
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:49,136
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

1634
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:50,550
- What?
<i>- Turn right.</i>

1635
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,691
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1636
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,277
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1637
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:07,904
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1638
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:10,787
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1639
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,580
Uh...

1640
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:15,621
I'm...

1641
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,080
...looking...

1642
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,416
...at porn.

1643
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,747
Hey!

1644
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,663
Surprised?

1645
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,706
Oh, hey, Pete.

1646
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,712
I didn't hear you come in.

1647
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,969
It's over. I've got you.

1648
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,129
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1649
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,637
...I really, really admire your grit.

1650
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,390
I see why Liz likes you.

1651
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,519
I do. When you first came to the house...

1652
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,810
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.

1653
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,396
How could you do this to her?

1654
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,564
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.

1655
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:31,075
I'm doing this for her.

1656
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:32,618
Hm. Yeah.

1657
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,124
Peter...

1658
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:40,038
...you're young.

1659
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,454
You don't understand
how the world works.

1660
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,373
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1661
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,293
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?

1662
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,927
Or any of his little toys?

1663
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,838
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...

1664
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:54,302
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1665
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,217
Guys like us...

1666
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,261
...like you and me...

1667
01:40:58,427 --> 01:40:59,895
...they don't care about us.

1668
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:02,523
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

1669
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,980
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.

1670
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:09,318
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1671
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,567
That's how it is.

1672
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,036
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1673
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,946
Why are you telling me this?

1674
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,582
Because I want you to understand.

1675
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,162
And...

1676
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,329
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1677
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,347
I'm sorry, Peter.

1678
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,479
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1679
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,186
True. Then again...

1680
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:50,070
...wasn't really trying to.

1681
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,458
<i>Chief, they're powering up engines.</i>

1682
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:00,456
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1683
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,714
Okay, ready?

1684
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,603
Hello?

1685
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,440
Hello!

1686
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,192
Please, hey.

1687
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,899
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1688
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:15,030
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1689
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,988
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1690
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,846
<i>If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1691
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:46,561
Come on, Peter.

1692
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,268
Come on, Spider-Man.

1693
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,399
Come on, Spider-Man.

1694
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,777
Come on, Spider-Man.

1695
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,023
Come on, Spider-Man!

1696
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,039
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1697
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:51,748
Oh, yeah.

1698
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,932
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1699
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,864
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1700
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:26,700
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1701
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,590
<i>Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1702
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,848
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1703
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,604
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1704
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,019
This better work, Mason.

1705
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:06,907
<i>Trust me, boss, even one of
those boxes and we are set for life.</i>

1706
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,366
Yeah.

1707
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,394
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...</i>

1708
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,216
<i>...and override their security.</i>

1709
01:46:35,764 --> 01:46:37,311
Cloning transponder signal.

1710
01:46:37,474 --> 01:46:39,147
Launching decoy drone.

1711
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,196
Whoa.

1712
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,400
Entering new coordinates.

1713
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:52,645
Good, so it's on its way.

1714
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,584
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

1715
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,832
All right.

1716
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,968
Hot dog.

1717
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,443
Just a typical homecoming...

1718
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:06,321
...on the outside of an invisible jet...

1719
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:08,740
...fighting my girlfriend's dad. Oh!

1720
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,375
Oh, God!

1721
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:29,053
I can't believe that worked. Whoa!

1722
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:07,792
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1723
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,238
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1724
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:21,184
Oh, my God.

1725
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:38,538
<i>- Get out. What are you doing?</i>
- Please turn, please turn!

1726
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,218
Hey, Pedro.

1727
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:03,680
Bingo.

1728
01:52:19,858 --> 01:52:21,656
Your wingsuit.

1729
01:52:21,818 --> 01:52:23,912
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1730
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:32,754
Time to go home, Pete.

1731
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,381
I'm trying to save you!

1732
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,973
No.

1733
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,187
No.

1734
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,664
It looked so insane. That whole...

1735
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,169
Like, it was just crazy.

1736
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:37,500
He... He was just, like:

1737
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,874
- And you were like, "Aah!"
- Shh.

1738
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,918
And then I just hit him
with the: whoosh.

1739
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:44,962
It was so... Oh, my God.

1740
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:47,130
I mean, you saved me.

1741
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:49,091
It was awesome.

1742
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:56,807
Hey, Liz.

1743
01:54:58,308 --> 01:54:59,480
I'm gonna miss you.

1744
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,569
Bye.

1745
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:03,655
Liz.

1746
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,704
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1747
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:15,743
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1748
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,207
The dance?

1749
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,291
That, um, was a pretty
crappy thing to do.

1750
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:23,799
Well, yeah, but I...

1751
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,803
I mean, your dad... I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1752
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:29,135
If there's anything I can do to help...

1753
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:31,800
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1754
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,221
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1755
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:40,230
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...

1756
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:44,317
Liz, I... I...

1757
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:46,152
Bye, Peter.

1758
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,527
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1759
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:06,589
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1760
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:08,799
- Yeah!
- Ha-ha.

1761
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,385
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

1762
01:56:11,548 --> 01:56:14,051
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1763
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,890
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...

1764
01:56:16,052 --> 01:56:17,599
...a new team captain next year.

1765
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:20,436
So I am appointing Michelle.

1766
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,106
Yeah!

1767
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:26,529
Uh, thank you.

1768
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:28,156
My... My friends call me MJ.

1769
01:56:28,773 --> 01:56:30,821
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1770
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,907
I didn't.

1771
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,784
- I, uh, gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

1772
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,624
What are you hiding, Peter?

1773
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,510
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1774
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:51,342
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

1775
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:03,108
Hey, Happy. What, uh...?
What are you doing here?

1776
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:05,311
I really owe you one.

1777
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:09,693
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1778
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:11,654
I mean, before I met Tony...

1779
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,473
So, uh, how long you been here?

1780
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,813
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1781
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:49,647
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1782
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,832
Upstate... Like, "upstate" upstate?

1783
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,449
Yeah, let's go.

1784
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:55,944
Take a look.

1785
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:58,159
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1786
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:01,992
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.

1787
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:31,275
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

1788
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:33,565
How was the ride up?

1789
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:36,610
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.

1790
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,203
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1791
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,990
I gotta talk to the kid.

1792
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,665
I'll be close behind.

1793
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:46,579
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1794
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,800
Sorry I took your suit.

1795
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:55,462
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

1796
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:57,631
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.

1797
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:00,641
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1798
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,598
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

1799
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:07,691
- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1800
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:09,981
But then you did the right thing.

1801
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:13,317
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...

1802
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,357
All right, not my best analogy.

1803
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:18,489
I was wrong about you.

1804
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,280
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1805
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:23,915
...you could be a real asset to the team.

1806
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,543
- To the...? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

1807
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:30,751
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1808
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:33,090
When you're ready...

1809
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,176
...why don't you try that on?

1810
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:39,260
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:

1811
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:41,095
Spider-Man.

1812
01:59:43,551 --> 01:59:44,552
I...

1813
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:49,058
Yeah, give that a look.

1814
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,874
So after the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

1815
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:57,990
...your new quarters.

1816
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:00,402
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

1817
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,821
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

1818
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:04,330
Or walls.

1819
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,366
You'll fit right in.

1820
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:14,791
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1821
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,502
But I'm good.

1822
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:20,047
You're good? Good...?
How are you good?

1823
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:24,389
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1824
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,724
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1825
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,966
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1826
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,773
You're turning me down?

1827
02:00:30,932 --> 02:00:33,026
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1828
02:00:33,184 --> 02:00:34,436
Look at me.

1829
02:00:35,186 --> 02:00:36,278
Last chance. Yes or no?

1830
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:37,735
- No.
- Okay.

1831
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:41,401
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1832
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:43,570
Uh, Happy will take you home.

1833
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,239
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1834
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:47,578
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

1835
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:51,791
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1836
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,671
- See you around.
- Okay.

1837
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,097
That was a test, right?

1838
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,351
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

1839
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:10,097
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1840
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,981
Yeah, thank you.

1841
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:15,935
Told you he's a good kid.

1842
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,660
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1843
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,742
- Everybody's waiting.
- You know he actually made a really mature choice.

1844
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:29,909
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you guys screw this up?

1845
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:32,303
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding me?

1846
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:34,500
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

1847
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,599
...for some big announcement.
What will I gonna tell them?

1848
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:39,126
Think of something. How about, um...?

1849
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:41,840
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I...? I...?

1850
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,314
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

1851
02:01:43,338 --> 02:01:46,558
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1852
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,345
Okay.

1853
02:01:50,512 --> 02:01:52,239
I think I can think
of something better than that.

1854
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:54,641
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1855
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:58,062
Like we need time.

1856
02:01:58,228 --> 02:02:00,039
I can't believe you have that
thing  in your pocket.

1857
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:02,566
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

1858
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:21,217
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1859
02:02:31,469 --> 02:02:33,142
May?

1860
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:55,956
What the fu...?!

Look who it is.

1910
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:17,097
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1911
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,557
Relax.

1912
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:21,180
This? It's not on you.

1913
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:24,442
It's on our, uh, little spider friend.

1914
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,195
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

1915
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,824
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1916
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,611
And I heard a rumor.

1917
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,457
You know who he is.

1918
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,546
If I knew who he was...

1919
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,298
...he'd already be dead.

1920
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,715
Toomes, your family's here!

1921
02:12:33,821 --> 02:12:36,665
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

1922
02:12:36,824 --> 02:12:40,795
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

1923
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,626
Patience.

1924
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:44,916
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1925
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:47,130
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1926
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:49,637
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

1927
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,297
And you wonder...

1928
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:55,310
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

1929
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:01,015
How many more of these?
