1
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,392
Such was McTeague.

2
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:32,740
Such was Mother
McTeague.

3
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:16,297
Filled with the one idea of
having her son enter a
profession and rise in life ...
the chance came at last to
Mother McTeague.

4
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:13,424
His mother's ambition
was fired ... and Mac
went away with the
dentist to learn his
profession.

5
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mac learned dentistry, after
a fashion, through
assisting the charlatan ....
and, years later, on Polk
Street in San Francisco, "Doc"
McTeague was established.

6
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
"Have a seat, Marcus."

7
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
"Trina, Mac's the strongest
duck you ever seen --
by damn!"

8
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
"That's Maria ... she
keeps Mac's place
clean. She's cuckoo
in the head."

9
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
"Buy a ticket in the
lottery?"

10
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
"-- just a dollar!"

11
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
"Go 'long with you!
Lotteries is against
the law!"

12
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
"-- the butcher in the
next block won twenty
dollars the last drawing!"

13
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
"Mac, old pal, I wantcha
to shake hands with
my cousin, Trina Sieppe.
She's my sweetie!"

14
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
"Don't you hurt her
too much, Mac."

15
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
"So long, Mac, I got to
do some work yet ...
at the dog hospital."

16
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
"Don't do anything I
wouldn't do .... you
know!"

17
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
"I guess I'll have to pull
them three teeth and
make you a bridge."

18
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
"Oh no! That will cost
too much, won't it?"

19
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
For the first time in his
life, McTeague felt an
inkling of ambition to
please a woman.

20
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
During the next two
weeks Trina was
a daily patient.

21
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
"Ether ... not so
dangerous as
gas."

22
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So Mac administered
the ether.

23
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But below the fine fabric
bred of his mother, ran
the foul stream of hereditary
evil ... the taint of generations
given through his father.

24
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Terrified at his weakness,
McTeague threw himself
once more into his work with
desperate energy ... until he
finished.

25
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
"Oh, Mac's all right ...
by damn!"

26
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Trina was to come
no more.

27
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His dream was gone.

28
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The following Sunday,
Marcus took Mac to
the Cliff House.

29
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
"What's the matter with
you these days, Mac ...
huh?"

30
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
"It's ... it's ... Miss Sieppe!"

31
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
"You mean ... that you,
too --"

32
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
"She's been the first
girl I've ever known.
I couldn't help myself!"

33
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
"-- I was so close
to her -- "

34
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
"-- an' smelled her
hair --"

35
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
"-- an' felt her
breath!"

36
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
"Oh! ... you don't
know!"

37
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
"Well ... what are we
goin' to do 'bout it?"

38
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
"I'll give her up to you,
old man --"

39
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
"-- by damn!"

40
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
"Friends for life --"

41
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
"-- or ... death!"

42
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:04,000
"I'm ... much ... obliged,
Marcus. I'm much ...
obliged!"

43
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Then, with unselfish friend-
ship for his "pal", Marcus
took Mac to Oakland the
next Sunday ... that he
might again be with Trina
and meet her folks.

44
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
"Mac, this is Trina's
father!"

45
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
"Sure glad t' know
ya, Mr. Sieppe."

46
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
"Mommer!"

47
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
"Doc,...shake hands
with my cousin, Selina."

48
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
"Here's where we shell
out, Mac."

49
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
"Gimme four bits!"

50
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
"I ain't got no money
with me ... only a dime!"

51
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What a day that was
for McTeague ... what
a never-to-be-forgotten
day!

52
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Weeks passed and March
rains put a stop to their
picnics ... but Mac saw
Trina every Wednesday and
Sunday.

53
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
"Let's go over and
sit on the sewer."

54
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
"-- 'Hearts and
Flowers'?"

55
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
"No ... but, 'Nearer My
God to Thee'."

56
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
"Say, Miss Trina,...
why can't us two get
married?"

57
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
"Why not? Dontcher
like me well enough?"

58
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
"Then ... why not?"

59
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
"Because!"

60
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:16,000
First .... chance had brought
them face to face; now ....
mysterious instincts, as
ungovernable as the winds
of the heavens, were knitting
their lives together.

61
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
"Let me go alone ....
please!"

62
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
"-- you may ... you
may come Sunday!"

63
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
"Can't I kiss ya again?"

64
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
"I've got her! By God ...
I've got her!!"

65
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Trina and Mac became
engaged. The event
was celebrated with a
theatre party.

66
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
"I liked the lady best ...
who sang those sad
songs."

67
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
"I liked pest ... der
yodlers!"

68
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
"I liked best ... the fellow
who played 'Nearer My
God to Thee' ... on the
beer bottles."

69
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
"Behave!"

70
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And afterwards, there
was to be "some-
thing to eat" at Mac's
dental parlors.

71
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
"Your lottery ticket has
won five thousand
dollars!"

72
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,967
"Oh! .... there's
a mistake!"

73
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
"On presentation of your
ticket .... you will receive
a check for five thousand
dollars!"

74
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
"What will you do
with all this money,
Trina?"

75
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
"Get married on it ....
for one thing!"

76
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
"Can't we go into your
parlors and celebrate?"

77
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The party ended late. Mac
and Marcus gave up their
rooms to Trina, "Der
Mommer" and little
"Owgooste".

78
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
"Oh, Mac! Think of all
this money coming to
us .... just at this
moment."

79
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
"Come along, Mac. We've
gotta sleep with the
dogs tonight you know."

80
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
"What a damn fool
I was --"

81
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
"-- if I'd a' kept
Trina, I'd a' had ...
five thousand
bucks!"

82
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
"-- damn the luck!"

83
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Trina and Mac were married
a month later in the
photographer's rooms that
Mac rented for their future
home.

84
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
-- and then they
viewed the gifts.

85
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
-- and then, for two
full hours, they gorged
themselves.

86
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
-- then, came the
farewell.

87
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
"Doctor ... be good to
her! Be very good
to her ... won't you?"

88
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
"Der's nuttin' to pe
'fraid of! Go to your
husban'."

89
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The early months of married
life wrought changes.
Since her lottery winning,
Trina feared their good luck
might lead to extravagance;
and her normal instinct for
saving became a passion.

90
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
"I haven't no small
change, Mac."

91
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:41,000
For quite some time,
McTeague had his
eye on a little house ....
that they might be by
themselves.

92
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
"What d'yer think?"

93
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:39,000
"We can't afford such
extravagance. Thirty-
five dollars ... and the
water extra!"

94
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:51,000
In the new order of
life, Trina reduced
Mac's visits to Frenna's
Saloon to one night
a week.

95
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
"Say, Mac .... when are
ya gonna pay me that
money you owe me?"

96
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
"Huh? Do ... I ... owe ...
you ... any money?"

97
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:51,588
"Well, you owe me ...
four bits! I paid for
you and Trina that
day ... at the picnic!"

98
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
"You oughta have told
me before."

99
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
"I'm ... I'm much obliged
to you, Marcus."

100
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
"-- and you never paid
me for sleepin' in my
dog hospital the night
you was engaged, either!"

101
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
"Do you mean ... I ....
I shoulda paid for that,
too?"

102
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
"Well,... you'd a' had
to pay four bits for
a bed anywheres!"

103
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
"What's the matter with
you lately, Marcus?
Is there somethin' I've
done?"

104
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
"All I know is ... that
I been soldiered out of
my girl --"

105
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
"-- an' out o' my
money!"

106
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
"Do I get any o' them
five thousand bucks
from the lottery?"

107
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
"It ain't mine to give!"

108
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
"You're drunk! ... that's
what you are!"

109
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
"Am I gonna get some
o' that money?"

110
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
"-- I'm through with
you!!"

111
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
"He broke my pipe!!"

112
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
"-- he can't make
small o' me!"

113
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
"He broke my
pipe! --"

114
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Marcus' attack was soon a
forgotten incident. Mac's
moods of wrath always faded
in Trina's company.

115
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,312
"-- Mommer wants ...
me --"

116
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:20,818
"-- wants ... US --"

117
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:23,000
"-- to send her fifty
dollars."

118
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
"Well, I guess we
can send it ......
can't we?"

119
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
"I wonder if Mommer
thinks we're millionaires?"

120
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
"Trina, you're gettin' to
be a regular stingy!
You're gettin' worse and
worse every day!"

121
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
"But .... fifty dollars
is fifty dollars!"

122
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
"Well, you got a lot
saved up ... and besides,
you still got all o'
your five thousand."

123
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
"Don't talk that way,
Mac! That money is
never ... never going
to be touched!"

124
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
"If Mommer really needs
the money so badly ....
she'll write again."

125
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Trina's miserly attitude grew
steadily through the
following months ... but her
brusque outbursts of affection
kept her tolerable to the
slow-thinking McTeague.

126
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
"Well .... bygones is
bygones, ain't they,
Mac?

127
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
"Sure!"

128
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
"Well ... how's business,
Doc?"

129
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
"-- plenty o' money?"

130
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
"-- lots to do?"

131
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
"Everythin' just fine ....
huh?"

132
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
"We've got lots to do -"

133
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
"-- but we haven't got
no money!"

134
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
"Well,... I'm goin' away.
Goin' in cattle ranchin
with a English duck."

135
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
"Comin' back? Why,...
I ain't never comin' back."

136
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
"I came t' say
'goodbye'."

137
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
"I guess we won't never
see each other again."

138
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
"I guess so."

139
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
"Good luck .... t' you
both!"

140
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
"Goodbye! That's the
best thing I ever heard
Marcus say."

141
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So Marcus had left ....
left for good. Never
again should they be
disturbed by him.

142
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
"Why .... it isn't
possible!"

143
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
"Well .... I ain't gonna
quit for just a piece
o' paper!"

144
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
"Go on, Mac! Get all
the money you can
before they make
you stop."

145
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
"It's MARCUS .... that's
done it! --"

146
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
"-- damn his soul!!"

147
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Only little by little did
the McTeagues
understand the calamity
that had befallen them.

148
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
"I got ev'rythin' fixed,
an' ready an' waitin' ...
an' nobody's ever
gonna come any
more."

149
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
"That's the way to
rub it out ... by me
crying on it."

150
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
"If...I...ever...meet...
MARCUS SCHOULER!"

151
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
"If...you...ever...do!"

152
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:15,000
With the stopping of
McTeague's practice, the
grind began. Trina sold
everything; she worked at
toy whittling that her money
might remain untouched.

153
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
"They fired me!"

154
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
"Isn't there another
surgical instrument
factory in town?"

155
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
"Yes...there's...there's
two more."

156
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
"We're losing money
every second you sit
here! --"

157
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
"-- and we cannot
afford it!"

158
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
"They paid you ...
didn't they?"

159
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
"-- always money!"

160
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,327
"Better gimme a nickel
for carfare --"

161
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
"-- it's a long walk --"

162
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
"-- an' it's gonna rain."

163
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
"A big fellow like
you ... 'fraid of a little
walk!"

164
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
"You oughta taken
a car."

165
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
"You're goin' to catch
your death o' cold!"

166
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
"Two straight, Joe."

167
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
"It kind o' disagrees
with me."

168
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
"Aw ... hell! You'll die ...
if you stand 'round
soaked like that."

169
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Gold was her master ....
a passion with her,
a mania, a veritable
mental disease.

170
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
"Did you get a place?"

171
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
"Did you ... get caught ...
in the rain?"

172
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
"Wouldn't even gimme
a nickel ... for carfare!"

173
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
"I didn't know it was
going to rain."

174
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
"Didn't I tell you
it was?"

175
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
"You ain't gonna make
small o' me .... all the
time!"

176
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
"Did you ... get
a place?"

177
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
"Gimme back the money
I gave ya!"

178
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
"I ... paid ... the grocery
bill with it."

179
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
"I don't believe ya!"

180
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
"Why, Mac ... do you think
I'd lie to you?"

181
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
"Did you ... get
a place?"

182
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
"Ain't that fine?"

183
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
"Ain't it lovely?"

184
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
"I won't have you yell
at me ... like that!"

185
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
"You're gonna do ... just
as I tell you ... after
this ... Trina McTeague!"

186
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
"Yes! ... I been drinkin'
whiskey!"

187
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
"I'm beat out ... an'
I don't wanta be
bothered!"

188
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
"I wonder where he
got the money ... to
buy the whiskey?"

189
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:10,000
As time went on, Mac's
idleness became habitual.
His dislike for Trina increased
with every day of her
persistent stinginess.

190
01:12:23,824 --> 01:12:26,248
"I'll get some money
and come back."

191
01:13:02,972 --> 01:13:07,005
"You with all that
money .... an' me
with nothin'. Come'n!"

192
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,580
"Don't you love me
any more, Mac?"

193
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:11,906
"Sure I do!"

194
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:35,719
As Trina's greed grew, Mac's
ambition waned .... and
died. They sank lower and
lower that Trina might still
save from her meager
earnings.

195
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:22,664
"That's three days old.
It's hardly fit for dogs."

196
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:55,792
"Where's my change?"

197
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,020
"Two bits ... out o'
a dollar?"

198
01:17:13,188 --> 01:17:15,123
"Do you think I'd ...
cheat you?"

199
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:36,701
Mac's meal was eaten
and finished in silence.
For the first time in his
life he had thoughts.

200
01:17:52,428 --> 01:17:53,247
"So long!"

201
01:18:06,422 --> 01:18:08,419
"Kiss me goodbye, Mac?"

202
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:30,914
"Why don't you bring
some of your fish
home sometimes?"

203
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:37,119
"It might save you
a nickel."

204
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:53,733
"I think I'll take
them birds o' mine
along."

205
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:55,383
"Sell 'em?"

206
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:03,368
"You ought to get
at least five dollars
for them."

207
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:08,622
"Maybe ... six dollars!"

208
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,900
"Well ... so long!"

209
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,984
"- how I've slaved, and
starved for you."

210
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:25,443
Mac never returned
after that day .... so
Trina took employment
as a scrub-women.

211
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And with all her gold,
she was alone ....
a solitary, abandoned
woman.

212
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,395
"Say, Trina ... lemme
in, will ya?"

213
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:07,988
"I ain't had nothin' t'
eat since yesterday
mornin'."

214
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:13,800
"I'll see you starve before
you get another penny ...
of my money!"

215
01:23:16,346 --> 01:23:18,992
"I wouldn't let a dog
go hungry!"

216
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:31,877
"Not ... if he'd bitten
you?"

217
01:23:40,654 --> 01:23:43,276
"If I had hold
o' you, I'd --"

218
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:36,885
"I want that five
thousand!"

219
01:26:53,596 --> 01:26:55,521
"I bet ... it'll rain
tomorrow."

220
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:17,125
McTeague had been missing
from San Francisco for
weeks, when --

221
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,558
The Fugitive.

222
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:23,019
"-- I know 'um well!
I can identify 'um!"

223
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:30,419
"-- an' that five thousand
he got away with ....
belongs to me!"

224
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:40,898
"There ain't a man o'
you big enough t'
stop me from goin'!"

225
01:28:42,004 --> 01:28:47,710
"Lord love you, come
'long then. He's been
reported headin' for
Death Valley."

226
01:28:55,625 --> 01:29:08,015
That night desolation lay still
around Mac. Every nerve
cried aloud for rest, yet every
instinct seemed goading him
to hurry on.

227
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,291
"Damn you! Come on,
will ya .... an' have
it out!"

228
01:30:33,998 --> 01:30:36,185
"If it gets much hotter ...
I don't know!"

229
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:25,499
"God! .... what a country!"

230
01:31:48,678 --> 01:31:57,799
And for days, on Mac
went .... chasing the
receding horizon that
always fled before him.

231
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,240
The last water hole.

232
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:42,905
"It's impossible to cross
Death Valley! There
ain't enough water for
one man an' his
mount .... let alone
eight!"

233
01:32:54,943 --> 01:32:57,076
"We've got to circle
'round the Valley."

234
01:32:58,354 --> 01:33:01,836
"Like hell I will! I ain't
sworn in."

235
01:33:03,599 --> 01:33:05,192
"I'll do ... as I please!"

236
01:33:09,182 --> 01:33:15,030
"Go on then ... you damn
fool! But I ain't got
nothin' t' do with it!"

237
01:33:16,796 --> 01:33:22,575
"If you catch him, put
these bracelets on him
an' bring him in!"

238
01:33:40,909 --> 01:33:51,855
McTeague was headed for
the very heart of Death
Valley .... that horrible
wilderness of which even
beasts were afraid.

239
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:22,185
"It's goin' to be worse
than ever today."

240
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:55,090
"By damn ... if he ain't
got no water with
'um, I'll be in a bad
way."

241
01:36:10,321 --> 01:36:18,770
But hatred and the
greed for gold kept
Marcus up .... and closer
and closer he came.

242
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:27,058
"What did ya do with
that five thousand?"

243
01:37:39,946 --> 01:37:41,195
"Got any water?"

244
01:37:53,245 --> 01:37:57,180
"Is all the water we
got ... on the saddle?"

245
01:38:03,722 --> 01:38:12,677
"He ate some loco-weed.
We'd better finish him ...
t'ain't right to let 'um
suffer."

246
01:38:58,086 --> 01:39:02,069
"There's no water ...
within a hundred
miles o' here!"

247
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:09,171
"We...are...dead...men!"

248
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:34,509
"Even if we're done
for, I'll take some o'
my truck along."

249
01:39:38,081 --> 01:39:41,775
"I ain't so sure 'bout who
that money belongs to!"

250
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:46,207
"-- an' don't try and
load that gun either!"

251
01:39:55,608 --> 01:39:58,674
"Don't you lay your
fingers on that
sack!"
