00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:00,171
I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

481
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:03,443
Just, uh, tell me
how far I have to crawl.

482
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,609
<i>- Oh, no, no, no. We were both wrong.
- [Flesh Smacking, Groaning]</i>

483
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:09,781
- I'm sorry too.
- So, uh, will I see you in the office?

484
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:15,055
- [Woman] I got that paper.
- I just can't stop things
here, Mitch. I-I gotta know.

485
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,688
<i>[Flesh Smacking, Morrie Groaning]</i>

486
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:20,995
Yeah. I'll see ya
in the office, Walter.

487
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:28,734
- Good.
- [Groans]

488
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,901
[Groans]

489
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,343
[Groaning, Slapping Continue]

490
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:36,177
Show me how to do this?

491
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:40,185
- Okay with you, Morrie?
- Yeah.

492
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:42,448
[Aldo]
Okay, it has to be hard.

493
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:45,958
It's the only way to break up
all that wicked congestion
so his body can eliminate it.

494
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,323
- Okay. [Clears Throat]
- All right.

495
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,391
- No. A little harder than that.
- Harder than that?

496
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,265
- Yeah. There. Under the shoulder
- Okay.

497
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,202
<i>- [Morrie Grunting]
- That's it. Little bit harder.</i>

498
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:07,673
Good. Knock the poison loose.
Knock it loose.

499
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:12,775
Oh, you... You wanted to hit me.
[Groans]

500
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:16,219
- This is for that " B" you gave
me sophomore year, Morrie.
- [Laughing]

501
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,223
When did I ever...

502
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,226
give you... a " B"?

503
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:31,430
[Together]
Six, seven, eight, nine...

504
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,869
<i>[Mitch] The large lessons
oflife... We're sometimes...</i>

505
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,101
given the opportunity
to learn them.

506
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:39,406
But how do we know we're
gonna be able to keep them?

507
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,913
I know I will, Mr. Albom.

508
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:45,417
I've had real excellent counseling,
and I've learned from my mistakes.

509
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,385
It's like I had
my whole life given back to me.

510
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,820
- When they dropped the drug charges?
- Yes, sir.

511
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,085
<i>- And let me keep my scholarship...
- [Man Whistles]</i>

512
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,821
[Coach Shouting] Hey, Daley!
We need you down here!

513
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:58,227
How can we ever be sure
we've learned anything, though?

514
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:02,734
Well, like I said, I learned my lesson.
I'm never gonna forget.

515
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:05,566
<i>- [Coach] Hey, Shawn,
we need you down here now.!
- I gotta go, sir.</i>

516
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:07,572
Thanks for your time.

517
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,507
Hey, Shawn.
Hope you're right, man.

518
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:15,878
<i>[Players]... nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen...</i>

519
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:24,785
<i>- [Mitch]
I was glad to be writing again...
- [Chuckling]</i>

520
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:28,315
<i>Even if it meant Walter
screaming about deadlines.</i>

521
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:32,888
<i>He screamed louder when I asked
for two weeks off to go to the islands.</i>

522
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,098
<i>I got one.
We made the best of it.</i>

523
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,482
<i>We called Morrie.
He cried, of course...</i>

524
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:55,350
<i>which I took as a sign
that things were still normal.</i>

525
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:03,754
<i>When we got home, I got
another day off from Walter, Tuesday.</i>

526
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,924
<i>I told him I was gonna need
all my Tuesdays for awhile.</i>

527
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,766
<i>[Clears Throat]
So, I'm typing up the thesis.</i>

528
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:13,772
What there is of it, anyway.

529
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,298
- Thought you might want
to read it over.
- Okay.

530
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,004
- 'Course we're not finished yet.
- No.

531
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,974
So I had a thought.
It was kind of weird.

532
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:30,250
- Wait-Wait, I don't think
the tape is rolling.
- Oh.

533
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,685
Okay, so, weird thought.

534
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:38,162
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, if somebody could
wave a magic wand...

535
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:43,999
and give you one day...
24 hours of perfect health...

536
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,131
- how would you spend it?
- That's a weird thought?

537
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:51,438
That's a good thought.
[Laughs] Oh... [Inhales]

538
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,411
Twenty-four hours?

539
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:03,383
<i>- Care to share it with the world?
- Well...</i>

540
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:06,220
I'd have a lovely breakfast:

541
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:09,318
Sweet rolls and tea.

542
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:13,195
Then a good swim.

543
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:17,100
I'd ask my friends for lunch,
a great lunch. You know, but...

544
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:20,969
A salad or something simple.

545
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,201
And then we'd take
a walk in a park...

546
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:27,474
with trees,
so we could watch the birds.

547
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:32,677
And we'd talk about how much
we meant to each other.

548
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:38,590
And for dinner, I'd take 'em
to a place that had great pasta.

549
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,126
Oh, boy.

550
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:44,253
And a little duck. Yeah, I love duck.
Do you like duck?

551
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,629
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

552
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,134
And then I would dance.

553
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:55,299
Oh, I'd dance
with my lovely partners...

554
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:58,309
till I was exhausted.

555
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,404
Then go home,
and I'd have a great sleep.

556
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,112
That's it?
That's your perfect day, huh?

557
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,587
- Uh...
- Sounds pretty simple.

558
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,590
Oh, yeah.

559
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:16,957
What about Charlotte and your sons?
You didn't mention them.

560
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,497
Well, I don't
have to mention them.

561
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:24,093
I mean, if they weren't there, how
could it be a perfect day? [Chuckles]

562
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,901
Oh, I-I picked
the spot to be buried.

563
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:30,772
<i>It's on a hill under a tree.</i>

564
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:34,176
It's got a pond.
Great place to think.

565
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,807
[Chuckles] You plannin' on doin'
a lot of thinkin' there?

566
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,409
I plan on being dead there.

567
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:46,116
<i>Will you come and visit,
tell me your problems?</i>

568
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:51,219
Won't be quite the same,
not hearing you talk.

569
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:54,061
Well, I'll tell you what...

570
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:58,126
when I'm dead,
you talk, I'll listen.

571
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:03,141
What if, uh, you know,
after you're, uh...

572
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,811
What if all this was just...
What if...

573
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:10,815
What if all this was
just wasted on me?

574
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:13,181
Well, you think
that could happen?

575
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:18,383
Well, out in the world...
you know, outside this room...
things aren't so clear.

576
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,483
Your wisdom and your aphorisms...

577
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,120
"Once you learn how to die,
you learn how to live."

578
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,596
What if you can't learn that?

579
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:30,362
What if you just want to run like hell
when you see death coming?

580
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,530
What if, uh, we're like
your father, you know?

581
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:37,599
What if we can't learn it
because we're not really like you?

582
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:42,943
- Yeah, but you are like me.
Everybody is.
- Nobody's like you.

583
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:48,317
And if it took your death
to teach me these things,
then I'd rather not learn 'em.

584
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,948
All the things you said, I'd give
'em back in one minute. [Sniffles]

585
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:57,194
- If this wasn't happening to you...
- It's happening.

586
00:39:57,263 --> 00:40:00,858
- It's-It's going to happen.
- Yeah, well, I don't want it to happen.

587
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,867
I don't want you to die.

588
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:07,167
That poem you're always quoting,
"We have to love one another or die"?

589
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,434
We die anyway, don't we?

590
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:13,205
We learn to love somebody
and they die, or-or we die or it dies.

591
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,716
What's the point? Wha... What do we
learn really from all that suffering?

592
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:21,413
Hold.

593
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,123
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,228
I just can't accept it.
I don't want you to die.

595
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,893
I guess I flunked
the course, huh?

596
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:42,271
Death ends a life,
not a relationship.

597
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:50,071
Poor Mitch, you still don't know
how to say good-bye, do you?

598
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:53,676
<i>Look at me.</i>

599
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,720
[Sighs]

600
00:40:55,788 --> 00:41:00,725
Don't you understand?
You touched me.

601
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:06,497
What if you hadn't
come back to see me? Huh?

602
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:12,730
This is the way
we say good-bye.

603
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:25,876
- Love you.
- [Shudders] I love you too, Coach.

604
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:30,320
I know. You wanna
know something else?

605
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,153
You always will.

606
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:37,662
[Sniffling]

607
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,960
I'm gonna come back
next Tuesday, okay?

608
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:44,560
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna bring, Janine
with me, okay, next Tuesday.

609
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:49,973
- Yeah.
- [Weeping]

610
00:41:55,414 --> 00:42:01,046
Of course, next Tuesday.
We're Tuesday people.

611
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,714
[Mitch Weeping]

612
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:08,151
<i>[Mitch] Morrie died
on a Saturday morning.</i>

613
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:12,163
<i>- [Phone Ringing]
- We got the call that afternoon.</i>

614
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:16,895
Hello? Oh.

615
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,029
<i>He had died peacefully and simply,

<i>****[Continues]</i>

617
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,438
<i>Just the way he wanted it.</i>

618
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,684
<i>Charlotte kept it small,
just family and friends...</i>

619
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,653
<i>- [Rabbi Reading In Hebrew]

dancing on his perfect day.</i>

<i>[Rabbi Continues]</i>

621
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,728
<i>- [Rabbi] Amen.
- Of course, there was poetry.</i>

622
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:49,132
"When he shall die take him
and cut him out in little stars.

623
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:53,137
<i>"And he will make
the face ofheaven so fine...</i>

624
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:57,073
<i>"that all the world will be
in love with night...</i>

625
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,576
<i>and worship not the garish sun. "</i>

626
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:03,547
<i>[Mitch]
When I'm dead, you talk. I'll listen.</i>

627
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:06,050
<i>It wasn't that hard
to hear his voice.</i>

628
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:09,554
<i>It was Tuesday.</i>

629
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,915
<i>Have you ever had
a special teacher?</i>

630
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:17,759
<i>One who taught you things you may not
understand, but who never gives up?</i>

631
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:22,460
<i>Who knows the really tough
lessons take a lifetime to learn?</i>

632
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:26,334
<i>The last class of my old professor's
life took place once a week on Tuesdays.</i>

633
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:29,238
<i>The subject was
the meaning oflife.</i>

634
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:35,846
<i>The teaching goes on.</i>
