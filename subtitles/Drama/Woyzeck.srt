1
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:44,077
In a small town,
on a wide, still pond...

2
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,251
Slowly, Woyzeck. Slowly.

3
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:40,461
One thing at a time!
You are making me dizzy.

4
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:46,561
What am I supposed to do with
those extra ten minutes?

5
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:53,331
Woyzeck, you still have thirty
nice years to live, thirty years.

6
00:04:53,441 --> 00:05:00,111
That is 360 months and
days, hours, minutes...

7
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,681
What are you going to do with
that awful amount of time?

8
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:05,911
Spread it out, Woyzeck.

9
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,421
Yes sir, Captain.

10
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:19,821
I start to fear for the world...

11
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:23,061
...when I think about eternity.

12
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,611
Occupation, Woyzeck,
occupation!

13
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,541
Eternal... it's eternal...

14
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:36,481
... it's forever, you will agree.

15
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:42,481
But then again it's not forever.
And it's a blink of an eye!

16
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,251
A blink of an eye.

17
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:51,721
Woyzeck, it scares me to think
the world revolves in one day...

18
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:55,231
What a waste of time.
And where does it all lead to?

19
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:01,131
Woyzeck, I can't see another mill
wheel or I will get melancholy.

20
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,611
Yes sir, Captain.

21
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:11,781
Woyzeck, you always have that
hunted look in your eye.

22
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,621
A good man doesn't have that.

23
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,591
A good man who has
a clear conscience.

24
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:25,331
Say something!
How is the weather today?

25
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,761
Bad, Captain.

26
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:31,701
Bad.

27
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,311
- Windy.
- Yes, I feel it already.

28
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,771
There's something swift out there.

29
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:44,611
I think it is coming from
the south-north.

30
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,691
Yes sir, Captain.

31
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,321
South-north.

32
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,031
Oh, you are dumb.
So incredibly dumb!

33
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:02,461
Woyzeck, you are a good person.

34
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:06,171
But, Woyzeck, you have no morals.

35
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,641
Morals... that means...

36
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,851
... being moral, understand?

37
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,771
It is a good word.

38
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:20,411
You have a child without
the church's blessing.

39
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:25,791
As our honorable chaplain puts it...

40
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,991
... "Without the church's blessing."

41
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,661
Captain, sir...

42
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:36,601
...the Lord won't mind the little bundle
having no Amen before he was made.

43
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,331
The Lord said, "Suffer the little
children to come unto me."

44
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,971
What? What kind of a
strange answer is that?

45
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:49,521
Are you trying to confuse me?
When I say you, I mean you, you!

46
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,451
Us poor people, you see, Captain...

47
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,221
... money... money.

48
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:10,901
A penniless man has no use
for morals in this world.

49
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,671
One is made of flesh and blood, also.

50
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,041
Our kind is suffering,
in this world and the next.

51
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:24,071
If we ever got to heaven...
they'd make us work the thunder.

52
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:28,521
Woyzeck, you have no virtue.
You are not a virtuous man.

53
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,221
Flesh and blood.

54
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:33,361
When I look out
the window after the rain...

55
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:36,521
... and watch those white
stockings gallivanting along...

56
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:39,391
Damn, Woyzeck,
love's coming over me.

57
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,901
I'm also made of flesh and blood...
But the virtue, the virtue!

58
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:47,071
How should I pass the time?
I always say to myself...

59
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,681
You are a virtuous man, a good man.

60
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,281
A good man.

61
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,911
Yes, sir, Captain.

62
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,651
The virtue.

63
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:11,291
You see, us common folk,
we don't have virtue...

64
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,801
...we do what comes naturally.

65
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:18,461
Yes, if I was a gentleman
with a hat and a watch...

66
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,001
... I would like to be virtuous.

67
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,611
Must be a fine thing,
that virtue, Captain.

68
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,051
Good, Woyzeck.

69
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:37,261
You are a good man, a good man,
but you think too much...

70
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,761
... and that wears on you.
You always look so hunted.

71
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,961
Our little talk has really
taken it out of me.

72
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,861
Go now.

73
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:53,371
And don't run! Slowly!
Nice and slow down the street.

74
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:22,071
Yes, Andres, the place is cursed.

75
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,531
See that light streak?

76
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,211
That's where the heads roll at night.

77
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,621
Two little rabbits there did sit...

78
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,251
nibbling the green, green grass...

79
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:43,881
Quiet.

80
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:45,791
Andres...

81
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,831
... hear that?

82
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:51,491
It's coming.

83
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:54,291
Nibbling the green, green...

84
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,931
It's coming up behind me.

85
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,741
Beneath me.

86
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,011
Hollow. Hear that?

87
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,011
It's all hollow down there!

88
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,421
I'm scared.

89
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:26,731
It is a strange silence.
You want to hold your breath.

90
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,231
Andres!

91
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,001
What?

92
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:34,911
Say something!

93
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:47,121
How it rises over the town...

94
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,161
- Run! Don't look back.
- Okay.

95
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,361
Woyzeck...

96
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,691
... can you still hear it?

97
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,471
Still.

98
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,701
All is still.

99
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,081
As if the world was dead.

100
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,871
We have to get away!

101
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:31,591
You hear that?

102
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,561
Look, here they come.

103
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,081
What a man!
Like a tree...

104
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,591
He stands on his feet like a lion.

105
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:32,681
Well, what friendly eye,
Mrs. neighbor.

106
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,161
You rarely see that on her.

107
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,631
Soldiers, those are handsome men...

108
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:41,861
Your eyes still do shine...

109
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:47,071
What if? Take your eyes to the
Jew and have them polished...

110
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:50,701
... maybe they will shine, so you
can sell them for two buttons.

111
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,771
Well, hear, hear! Ms. Virgin!
I'm an honorable person.

112
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,811
But you... you look
through leather pants!

113
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,721
Tramp! Come on, boy.
What do people want?

114
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,291
You're but the son of a whore...

115
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:11,731
...who makes his mom happy with
your dishonest face.

116
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,061
Who's there?

117
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,971
Is it you, Franz?

118
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,671
Come in.

119
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,741
I can't. Got roll call.

120
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,341
Been out cutting branches
for the Captain?

121
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:29,541
Yes, Marie.

122
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:33,281
What's the matter, Franz?
You look upset.

123
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:37,651
Marie, it was there again.
There's not much written about it:

124
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,351
The smoke arose from the land,
like smoke from an oven...

125
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:41,451
Man!

126
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,401
It followed me all the way to town.
What is going to happen?

127
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,491
Franz!

128
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,931
Tonight I have to go to mass.
I saved up a little bit again.

129
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,401
That man! So absent.

130
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:59,941
He didn't look at his child.

131
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,071
He might go crazy with
these thoughts.

132
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,321
Why so silent, boy?
Are you frightened?

133
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,431
What must I witness, Woyzeck?

134
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,131
You! A man of your word!

135
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,321
You!

136
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:26,191
You.

137
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,571
- What do you mean, Doctor?
- I saw it, Woyzeck.

138
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:34,081
I saw you pissing in the street,
on the wall like a dog!

139
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,881
And that with three dimes
a day plus board!

140
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,251
Woyzeck, that is bad.

141
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,121
The world is going bad, very bad.

142
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,421
But sir, the call of nature...

143
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:53,861
Call of nature? Call of nature?
Superstition, awful superstition!

144
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,261
Nature.

145
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,001
Woyzeck...

146
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:03,041
Haven't I shown that the
musculus constrictor vesicae...

147
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:04,911
... is subject to the will?

148
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,041
Nature?

149
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,341
Woyzeck... mankind is free.

150
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,191
Couldn't hold your water.

151
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,121
That's betrayal, Woyzeck!

152
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:29,631
Have you had your peas, Woyzeck?
Nothing but peas, remember!

153
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,901
Next week, we'll start with mutton.

154
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:39,111
This is going to
revolutionize science.

155
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:44,681
0.1 0 urea, hydrochloric
ammonium, hyperosydul...

156
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:51,961
Woyzeck...

157
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,231
... don't you have to piss again?

158
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,931
Why don't you go in there and try it.

159
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,791
I can't, Doctor.

160
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:30,231
But you can on a wall!
I saw it with my own two eyes!

161
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:34,961
I had my nose out the window
to verify a sneeze hypothesis!

162
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:40,801
No, Woyzeck, I will not get angry.

163
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,071
Anger is unhealthy, unscientific.

164
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,941
I am calm.

165
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,211
Perfectly calm.

166
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,821
My pulse is at its usual 60.

167
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:00,821
And I say this most insensitively.

168
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:07,261
Who would want to get angry
about a mere human being?

169
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:12,841
If it would have been one of
my test animals that had died...

170
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:18,911
But Woyzeck... you shouldn't
have pissed on that wall.

171
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,011
You see, Doctor...

172
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,791
Sometimes, one has such...

173
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:37,431
... a character, or structure...

174
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:43,461
Nature... that is so...

175
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:51,511
... Like... for example...

176
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:55,201
Woyzeck, you're
philosophizing again.

177
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:02,081
Have you ever seen any
double nature, Doctor?

178
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:09,921
When the sun was high at noon
as if the world's on fire...

179
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:15,391
... a frightful voice spoke to me.

180
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,131
Woyzeck, you had an aberration.

181
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:26,211
But nature, Doctor,
when nature is over...

182
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:30,411
What is that, when nature is over?

183
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:35,711
When nature is over, it's...
when nature is over.

184
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:40,691
That's when...

185
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,591
...the world gets so dark...

186
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,901
...that you have to feel your
way around with your hands...

187
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:55,311
... and it dissolves like a spider web.

188
00:19:56,741 --> 00:20:00,141
When something is, and yet isn't.

189
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,851
When all goes dark...

190
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:10,791
...and only a red glow in the West,
like from a chimney...

191
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,651
- When...
- Man...

192
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:20,001
...you're groping around with
your feet like a spider!

193
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,001
The toadstools...

194
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,471
Doctor...

195
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,281
...the toadstools.

196
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:39,351
Did you ever notice how they
grow in figures on the ground?

197
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,781
If one could read that...

198
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:47,791
Woyzeck, you have the most
wonderful aberratio mentalis partialis.

199
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:52,671
The second kind.
Beautifully developed.

200
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:54,761
Woyzeck...

201
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:58,071
... I will give you a raise.

202
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:04,801
Second kind... Fixed idea,
with a generally sane condition.

203
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,971
Still shaving your Captain as usual?

204
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,071
Yes, sir.

205
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:11,981
- Eating your peas?
- Always.

206
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,921
My wife gets the money.

207
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,251
- Doing your duty?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:22,261
You are an interesting case.
You have a beautiful fixed idea.

209
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:26,421
You'll make it to the nuthouse yet.

210
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,101
Subject Woyzeck...

211
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:33,861
...just be good.
Let me feel your pulse.

212
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,051
What should I do?

213
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:49,091
Eat peas, then mutton.

214
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:51,351
And clean your rifle.

215
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:55,221
You're getting a bonus dime
this week.

216
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,501
My theory...

217
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,431
My new theory...

218
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:36,861
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Step right up!

219
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:40,421
Ladies and gentlemen!
Come and see my show!

220
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,301
The creature and the art!

221
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,341
Look at the creature as God made it.

222
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,141
A nothing, a zero, absolutely nothing.

223
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,211
And now see the art...

224
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,271
...walks upright...

225
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,951
...wear jacket, wears pants,
swings saber!

226
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,661
The monkey is a soldier.
That's not much yet...

227
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:06,621
... it's the lowest rank of mankind.

228
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:10,451
So, take a bow. Good.

229
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,361
You're a baron.

230
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,301
Ladies and gentlemen...

231
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:18,841
... get your tickets for our
astronomical horse.

232
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,631
Right inside the tent.
Please, step right up!

233
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,151
- Do you want to?
- Alright.

234
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,221
Must be quite something.

235
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,541
Look at the tassels on that man!
And the woman has pants on!

236
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:39,191
Look at her.
What a woman!

237
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:43,491
You could sire a cavalry regiment
on her...

238
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:46,001
Yes, and breed drum-majors!

239
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:12,551
Ladies and gentlemen. You will
now see the Astronomical Horse.

240
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:16,661
It'll tell you anything
you want to know.

241
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:20,221
How old? What illness?
How many kids?

242
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:24,691
Show your talent!
Show your beastly reason!

243
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,431
Put human society to shame!

244
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,011
Ladies and gentlemen...

245
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:34,341
...the animal you see here,
with its tail and four hooves...

246
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:38,111
... is a member of
the academic society...

247
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,511
... and professor at our university...

248
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:46,251
...where he teaches the
students to ride and to fight.

249
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,961
Is there a jackass present in
our esteemed assembly?

250
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:03,471
You can't fool him!

251
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:09,081
How much is two times two?

252
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:11,671
Two times two.

253
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:17,281
Two, three, four, very good!
Thank you.

254
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:25,091
What a genius!
Look at that.

255
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,971
Now tell the gentlemen
what time it is.

256
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:32,341
Does anyone have a watch handy?

257
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:34,701
A watch?

258
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:38,371
- Here you go, sir.
- I've got to see this.

259
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,111
- But I'm not giving it to you.
- Just check what time it is.

260
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:47,511
This is a woman!

261
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:07,701
Marie!

262
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:12,501
Show me how you march.

263
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,571
A chest like a bull...

264
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:40,871
... and paws like a lion.

265
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:47,201
There is no one like you.
I'm the proudest lady of all.

266
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:54,081
Wait till Sunday, when I have my
plumed hat and white gloves on...

267
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:56,291
Stunning.

268
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:00,891
The prince always says,
"That's a man!"

269
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:03,151
You don't say. A man!

270
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:12,461
And you are a woman, Marie.

271
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:15,401
Christ Almighty!

272
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,741
We should start a brood
of little drum-majors.

273
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,281
Leave me alone!

274
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:26,511
- Hey, a wild one.
- Don't touch me!

275
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,251
Do you have the devil
in your eyes?

276
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,391
Might as well.

277
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,961
It's all the same.

278
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:54,871
Gentlemen students, I'm up here...

279
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:59,411
...and when I drop this cat
out of the window...

280
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:05,821
... how will it behave in terms of
gravity and following its instinct?

281
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,191
Hey, Woyzeck!

282
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:11,251
Woyzeck!

283
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,201
Woyzeck, come here!

284
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,751
Doctor, she's shitting.

285
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:52,901
You'd think she's your grandma,
the way you're hugging her.

286
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:56,601
- Doctor, I've got the shakes.
- That's fine, Woyzeck, fine.

287
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,771
Fine.

288
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:06,481
Gentlemen, the animal
has no scientific instinct.

289
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,291
But you get to see something else.

290
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:16,091
Look at this man. For a quarter of
a year, he ate nothing but peas.

291
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:21,531
Note the effects.
Feel how erratic his pulse is.

292
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,261
This and the eyes.

293
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:28,601
Take a look, gentlemen,
take a look...

294
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,341
- Doctor...?
- Feel it.

295
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:32,071
Doctor, I'm fainting.

296
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:35,151
Courage, Woyzeck.
A few more and we're done.

297
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,081
By the way, wiggle your ears
for the gentlemen.

298
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:42,251
I wanted to show you this before.
He uses two muscles.

299
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,461
Go on!

300
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:47,221
But, Doctor...

301
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:52,701
Beast, shall I wiggle your ears?
Will you fail us like the cat?

302
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:07,811
There, gentlemen. Those are
transitions to the donkey...

303
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:11,841
...often caused by female
upbringing and the mother tongue.

304
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:16,791
How much hair has your mom
pulled out, out of tenderness?

305
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,761
It has gotten really thin lately.

306
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,691
Yes, the peas, gentlemen.

307
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,671
How they glitter!

308
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:40,911
What kind of stones
did he say they were?

309
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,411
Sleep, boy.

310
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,331
Close your eyes.

311
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,581
Quiet or he'll get you.

312
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:28,391
Girl, close the shutters tight,
the gypsy boy is out tonight,

313
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:37,631
He will take you by the hand
and lead you off to gypsy land,

314
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,381
I bet they' re gold.

315
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,521
How nice they' ll be for the dance.

316
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:11,571
Our kind only has a little corner
in the world and a tiny mirror...

317
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:23,781
...yet I have a mouth as red
as any fine dame...

318
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,811
...with a mirror top to toe...

319
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,021
... and their gentlemen,
who kiss their hands.

320
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,731
I'm only a poor girl.

321
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:47,201
Sleep, child. Close your eyes.

322
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:54,081
The sleep angel...

323
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:58,181
... how it's flitting across the wall...

324
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:08,221
Close your eyes, or it'll look
at you and make you blind.

325
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,831
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

326
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,531
Something's shining
between your fingers.

327
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:49,171
An earring. I found it.

328
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:53,041
I never found anything
like that, two at once!

329
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,661
I'm just human.

330
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:57,271
It's alright, Marie.

331
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:09,511
The boy's fast asleep.

332
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,121
His arm is bothering him.

333
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:21,801
Bright drops on his forehead.

334
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,901
Nothing but work under the sun.

335
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,501
We even sweat in our sleep.

336
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,781
Here's some money, Marie.

337
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:45,221
My pay and something
from the Captain.

338
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,951
God bless you, Franz.

339
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:51,761
I have to go.

340
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:06,871
See you tonight, Marie.
Goodbye.

341
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:18,291
I am a bad person.

342
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,091
I could stab myself!

343
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:38,311
- Doctor, slow down!
- I'm in a hurry.

344
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:41,351
No man with a clear conscience
rushes like that.

345
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:44,611
Doctor, allow me to save a life.

346
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,821
Doctor, I am so melancholy.

347
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:51,681
I'm always raving about something...

348
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:57,361
I cry at the sight of my coat
hanging on the wall.

349
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,331
Bloated...

350
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,931
...typical constitution for a stroke.
Yes, Captain...

351
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:08,141
...typical constitution for a stroke.
Yes, Captain...

352
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:10,441
...you may have a brain stroke.

353
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:15,381
Maybe it will only affect one side,
and you'll be only half-paralyzed...

354
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:20,441
...with some luck your brain will go.
Leaving you to vegetate.

355
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,181
Those are your prospects
for the next four weeks.

356
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:29,421
But, I can assure you that you
will make for an interesting case...

357
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:32,121
... and God willing,
you'll be able to mumble...

358
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:34,961
... and we can make
groundbreaking experiments.

359
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,731
Don't scare me, Doctor!
People have died of fright before...

360
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:40,501
... simply of fright.

361
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:45,531
I already see the people
with lilies in their hands...

362
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:50,451
... but they will say,
"He was a good man, a good man."

363
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:55,111
Hey, Woyzeck, what's the hurry?
Stay awhile, Woyzeck.

364
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:02,251
Running through creation like
a razor. You will cut someone.

365
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:06,561
Running, like he has to shave a
whole regiment of eunuchs...

366
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:10,401
...that will hang him over the last
hair, before he can get away.

367
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:15,641
But, about the long beards,
what was I going to say?

368
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:20,581
- The long beards...
- A long beard under the chin...

369
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:24,511
Plinius talked about that.
Soldiers should get rid of this habit.

370
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:27,641
Yes, about the long beards.

371
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:32,091
Found any hair in your soup,
Woyzeck?

372
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:34,321
Hey, do you understand me?

373
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:35,761
Yes Sir, Captain.

374
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:42,491
A human hair from the beard of
a private, a sergeant, a...

375
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:46,001
... a drum-major's?
Hey, Woyzeck?

376
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:52,611
But he has a good wife.
He doesn't have this problem.

377
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:53,931
Yes, sir.

378
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,651
What are you saying, Captain?

379
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,191
Look at his face.

380
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,551
Well, maybe not in your soup...

381
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:09,991
... but if you hurry, you may
still find one on a pair of lips.

382
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:13,261
A pair of lips, Woyzeck!
I have known love, Woyzeck!

383
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:15,991
The guy is white as a ghost!

384
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,101
Captain...

385
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,011
... I am a poor devil.

386
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:34,321
She's all I have in this world.
If you're joking, Captain...

387
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,791
Joking? Me? You're a funny guy!

388
00:39:39,091 --> 00:39:41,421
The pulse, Woyzeck, the pulse!

389
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,231
Weak, hard, jumpy...

390
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,091
... irregular.

391
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:53,201
The earth is hot as hell,
I'm cold as ice. Hell is cold...

392
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:59,411
Impossible! You want to bet?
Impossible, man, man!

393
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:05,481
Facial muscles very tense, jumpy
at times. Posture upset and tense.

394
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:14,151
I'm going now.
A lot is possible.

395
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:19,621
We have nice weather, Captain.
Look at that nice, solid, gray sky...

396
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:23,761
...you feel like driving in
a peg and hang yourself.

397
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,101
All because of that little question...

398
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:29,541
...of yes, and then yes and no.

399
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:33,981
Captain, did the no cause the
yes, or the yes the no?

400
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,881
I want to think about that.
Damn...!

401
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:39,311
Phenomenal!

402
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,921
Woyzeck! Bonus!

403
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:47,621
People make me dizzy.

404
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,931
I don't like that.

405
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:55,531
A good man pays attention
and loves his life.

406
00:40:55,671 --> 00:41:01,441
A good person has no courage.
An idiot has courage!

407
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:09,111
I only joined the war
to affirm my love for life.

408
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:13,881
Grotesque... grotesque...

409
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,831
Hello, Franz.

410
00:41:58,531 --> 00:42:00,231
It's still you.

411
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:04,531
Indeed.

412
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:09,371
No, I can't see it.

413
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:13,041
You look so strange, Franz.
I'm scared.

414
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:16,711
I see nothing.

415
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,081
I see nothing.

416
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,891
One should see it, one should
be able to grab it with his fists!

417
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:33,021
What is it, Franz?
You are insane.

418
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:38,531
A lot of people walk the street, right?
You talk to anyone, what do I care?

419
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,741
Did he stand here?

420
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:45,371
There, yes?

421
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:47,541
There?

422
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:51,251
Did he do this?

423
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:54,681
I wish I would've been him!

424
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,911
Him! I can't forbid people to
walk the street and...

425
00:42:58,021 --> 00:43:00,991
...tell them to leave their
mouth at home.

426
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:06,591
Leave the lips at home. They're
so beautiful, it would be a shame.

427
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:10,401
But the wasps like to land on it.

428
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:16,031
And which wasp has stung you?

429
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:21,571
A sin, so full and wide.
It stinks...

430
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:26,311
...fit to smoke the angels
out of heaven.

431
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:34,421
You have a red mouth, Marie...

432
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,391
... and not a blister on it.

433
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:40,091
- Franz, your fever is talking.
- I saw him!

434
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:43,761
You can see a lot with two good
eyes and the sun shining.

435
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,271
Did he stand here?
Like that? Like that?

436
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:49,571
When the day is long
and the world old...

437
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,371
...a lot of people can be
in one place or another.

438
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:53,471
Hit me, Franz!

439
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:56,571
I'd rather have a knife in my body
than your hand on me.

440
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,891
No.

441
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:17,431
There should be a sign on her.

442
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,561
There should be a sign on her.

443
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:25,771
Every man is an abyss.

444
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:29,941
You get dizzy looking in.

445
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,381
Innocence, there's a mark on you.

446
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,851
Do I know? Do I know?

447
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,051
Who does know?

448
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:06,751
Down at the Inn is a pretty maid

449
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:12,451
She sits in the garden,
day and night, She sits in...

450
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:13,551
Yes?

451
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,791
Andres, they are dancing!

452
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:22,531
Yes, at the White Horse.
I saw the girls leave.

453
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:28,701
She sits in her garden,
until the clock strike twelve

454
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,841
and waits for the soldiers,

455
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,411
Will her hands be hot?

456
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:45,351
People are steaming.

457
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:47,881
Damn!

458
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:57,061
What do you want?

459
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,771
I have to go there. I have to see.

460
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:04,271
Troublemaker!

461
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:06,741
Because of her?

462
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,801
Don't stop! Don't stop!

463
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:47,451
Him... her...

464
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,781
Don't stop! Don't stop!

465
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:56,021
Spin and roll around!

466
00:47:56,761 --> 00:47:59,591
Why doesn't the Lord
blow out the sun...

467
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:03,131
... so everyone can roll in fornication?

468
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:07,761
Do it in bright daylight,
do it like the flies on my hand.

469
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:10,601
Don't stop, don't stop.

470
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:13,961
The bastard...

471
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,931
... how he's feeling her up!

472
00:48:34,131 --> 00:48:35,681
But...

473
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:42,291
...when a wanderer, leaning
against the stream of time...

474
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:50,301
... or answering to himself with
divine wisdom...

475
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:58,181
... is saying to himself,
"Why does man exist?"

476
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:01,581
Why does man exist?

477
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:08,891
But honestly, I'm telling you...

478
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:16,031
... how would the farmer,
the cobbler, the doctor live...

479
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:20,041
... if God hadn't created man?

480
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:28,341
How the soldier, if he wasn't
endowed with the desire...

481
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,311
...the desire...

482
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:40,981
...the desire to kill his own kind?

483
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,351
Therefore, doubt not.

484
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:50,291
All things of this world are evil.

485
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:55,571
Even money decays.

486
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:08,581
Finally, dear congregation...

487
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:13,351
... Let's piss crossways so a Jew dies!

488
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:06,371
Don't stop... don't stop...

489
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,221
There!

490
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,141
Louder! Louder!

491
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:38,141
What are you saying?

492
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:42,371
What?

493
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:52,951
Stab dead.

494
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:58,451
Should I?

495
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:00,991
Must I?

496
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,531
Do I hear it there, too?

497
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:11,101
Is the wind saying it, too?

498
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,411
Stab dead.

499
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,671
Do I hear it?

500
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:20,851
Don't stop.

501
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:23,451
Don't stop.

502
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,351
Don't stop.

503
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:44,441
I'm a man!

504
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:51,211
A man, I say!

505
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:56,851
Who wants to have some?

506
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:02,491
Who isn't too God almighty drunk
to take me on?

507
00:53:03,491 --> 00:53:06,191
I'll knock your nose up your ass!

508
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:18,531
Hey, you...

509
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:21,911
A man has to drink!

510
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,751
A man has to drink!

511
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:00,281
Should I tear out your tongue
and wrap it around you?

512
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:10,861
Should I leave you enough
air for a grandma's fart?

513
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:12,621
Hey, break it up!

514
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,731
The guy has to turn blue.

515
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:34,681
Give me brandy,
give me wine...

516
00:54:37,061 --> 00:54:40,681
... a cast-iron gut and
a ramrod spine!

517
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:56,101
One thing at a time.

518
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:18,731
Andres... Andres...

519
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:22,931
I can't sleep.

520
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:27,061
When I close my eyes,
I start spinning...

521
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,901
... and then I hear the fiddles.
Don't stop, don't stop.

522
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:38,871
And it speaks from the wall.
Andres!

523
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,851
Andres, can you hear it?

524
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:50,691
Yes, let them dance.

525
00:55:51,231 --> 00:55:54,161
Now lay me down to sleep, Amen.

526
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:58,031
It always says, "Stab! Stab!"

527
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:01,901
I feel a pain between
my eyes like a knife.

528
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,771
Sleep, fool!

529
00:56:43,381 --> 00:56:44,781
Andres.

530
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:16,571
And no guile is found
in His mouth.

531
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:22,851
And the Pharisees brought unto
Him a woman, taken in adultery...

532
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:28,091
...and set her in the midst.
And Jesus said unto her...

533
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:33,891
"Neither do I condemn thee.
Go and sin no more."

534
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,031
Lord, don't look at me!

535
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:44,931
Franz didn't come.

536
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:48,981
Not yesterday, not today.

537
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:53,811
It's getting hot here!

538
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:24,611
You didn't hear anything?
But he said something.

539
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:27,181
What can I say?

540
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:31,281
He laughed and then he said...

541
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:34,921
..."A delicious woman!
What thighs, hot as sin!"

542
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:40,621
So...

543
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:45,371
- That's what he said.
- Where to, Woyzeck?

544
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:47,061
Get my officer wine.

545
00:58:49,371 --> 00:58:54,281
But Andres... she was a special girl.

546
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:56,001
Who was?

547
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:58,051
Nothing. Goodbye.

548
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:10,921
- It's too much for the pistol.
- You want to buy it, or not?

549
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:19,261
How much is the knife?

550
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:23,171
It's very straight. You want
to cut your throat with it?

551
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,041
I give it to you as cheap as the next.

552
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:30,011
Death should be cheap,
but not for free!

553
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:33,021
You should have an
economical death.

554
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:37,051
- This cuts more than bread...
- Two dimes.

555
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:49,701
There! Like it was nothing,
and yet it's money. The dog!

556
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:38,751
Here, Andres...

557
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:43,781
...this shirt's not part of the uniform.
You could use it.

558
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:45,891
Yeah.

559
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:03,501
This ring and crucifix
belonged to my sister.

560
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,141
I also have a little Saint's image.

561
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:18,581
Two hearts and made of gold.
My mother kept it in her bible.

562
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:20,051
Yeah.

563
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:46,511
Friedrich Johann Franz Woyzeck,
private...

564
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:52,881
... rifleman in the 2nd regiment,
2nd battalion, 4th company.

565
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:57,681
Born on Annunciation day,
the 20th of July.

566
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:05,061
Today I am 40 years old...

567
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:12,731
... 7 months and 1 2 days.

568
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:18,171
Franz, you should go
to the infirmary.

569
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:22,441
Poor guy, you need to drink
liquor with powder in it.

570
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:25,481
It kills the fever.

571
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:33,261
When the carpenter gathers shavings,
whose head will rest upon them?

572
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:01,561
Marie, sing us a song!

573
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:03,721
- I can't.
- Why?

574
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:09,261
- Because.
- Why because?

575
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,161
Come here.
I tell you a story.

576
01:03:14,271 --> 01:03:19,271
Once upon a time, there was a
poor child, with no mom and dad.

577
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:23,071
Everything was dead and
not a soul was left in the world.

578
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:27,171
She went out and searched
day and night.

579
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:33,081
Since nobody was left on earth,
she wanted to go to heaven.

580
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:36,061
And the moon looked
at her so friendly.

581
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:42,231
When she finally reached the moon,
it was a piece of rotten wood.

582
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:45,601
So, then she went to the sun...

583
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:51,131
... but when she got to the sun,
it was a wilted sunflower.

584
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:56,941
And when she went to the stars,
they were little golden bugs.

585
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:04,051
And when she wanted to return to
earth, it was an upside-down cauldron.

586
01:04:04,151 --> 01:04:06,181
And she was all alone.

587
01:04:07,221 --> 01:04:10,021
So, she sat down and started to cry.

588
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:13,661
And there she sits to this day,
all alone.

589
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:18,231
Marie, we have to go. It's time.

590
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:21,031
- Where to?
- I don't know.

591
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:45,791
- But this is the way back to town.
- You have to stay.

592
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:47,561
But I want to go home.

593
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:50,431
You won't get sore feet.

594
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:53,701
How strange you are!

595
01:05:08,591 --> 01:05:11,211
Do you know how long
it's been now, Marie?

596
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:14,121
Two years this Pentecost.

597
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:19,191
Do you also know how long
it's going to last?

598
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:24,231
I have to prepare supper.

599
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:29,901
How hot your lips are.

600
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:32,571
Hot...

601
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,201
...whore breath.

602
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,971
And yet I'd give heaven
to kiss them one more time...

603
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:50,491
A red moon rising!

604
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,061
Franz, what are you up to?

605
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:40,471
Dance, sweat and stink,
he will get you all in the end.

606
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:11,261
So, Katy... sit down.

607
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,411
I am hot. Hot.

608
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:25,381
That's the way it is, the devil
takes one and lets the other go!

609
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:32,521
You are hot, too, Katy.
How come?

610
01:12:33,861 --> 01:12:36,231
You'll be cold, too, in the end!

611
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:38,021
Marie!

612
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:47,771
Katy, Katy, be reasonable!
Couldn't you sing, Katy?

613
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:54,011
For Swabia I do not care

614
01:12:54,321 --> 01:12:58,121
and a long dress I do not wear,

615
01:12:58,721 --> 01:13:02,351
For long dresses, pointed shoes

616
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,921
aren't for a maid to choose,

617
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:09,761
What's that on your hand?

618
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:13,071
- Me?
- Red...

619
01:13:14,271 --> 01:13:16,301
- Blood!
- Blood.

620
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:27,511
- Blood...
- Yes, I cut myself on my left hand.

621
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:30,051
Then how did it get on your elbow?

622
01:13:32,961 --> 01:13:34,321
I wiped it off.

623
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:39,521
What? With your left hand on
your left elbow? How skillful...

624
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:41,461
What do you want?

625
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:45,631
What do you care? Move!

626
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:52,311
You think I killed someone?

627
01:13:54,341 --> 01:13:55,641
I'm a murderer?

628
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:05,181
What are you staring at?
Stare at yourselves.

629
01:14:06,491 --> 01:14:07,511
Move.

630
01:14:24,741 --> 01:14:27,801
The knife... where is the knife?

631
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,971
I left it here.

632
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:35,281
It'll give me away!

633
01:14:38,761 --> 01:14:40,751
What kind of a place is this?

634
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,201
What kind of place is this?

635
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:56,071
Marie.

636
01:15:12,261 --> 01:15:15,221
Why is your hair all tangled, Marie?

637
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:24,871
Didn't you do your
braids today?

638
01:15:38,421 --> 01:15:40,941
There, the knife!

639
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:47,991
The knife, I found it.

640
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:52,661
Well...

641
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,531
In there!

642
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:05,631
No, it's too close...
when they go swimming...

643
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:21,191
Alright, now...

644
01:16:22,831 --> 01:16:25,261
There, there...

645
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:32,791
... but in the summer,
when they are diving...

646
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,141
Ah, it will rust.

647
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:47,551
Who will recognize it?

648
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,811
Am I still bloody?

649
01:16:54,391 --> 01:16:57,421
I must wash myself.
I must wash myself.

650
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,021
There... there's a stain!

651
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:03,291
There's another stain!

652
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:06,661
And another!

653
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:10,931
Another stain...
there's another stain...

654
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,491
- Let's go to Marien!
- What is it?

655
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:28,561
You don't know?
There's a dead woman out there!

656
01:17:28,661 --> 01:17:30,151
- Where?
- There!

657
01:17:30,461 --> 01:17:32,721
Hurry, so we don't miss everything.

658
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:25,561
A good murder, a real murder,
a beautiful murder;

659
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:30,811
as beautiful, as any man
can hope to see.

660
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:35,481
We haven't had one like this in ages.
