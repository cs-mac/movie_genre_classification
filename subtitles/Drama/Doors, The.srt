1
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,058
"The movie will begin
in five moments"...

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,228
the mindless voice announced.

3
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,899
"All those unseated
will await the next show."

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,445
We filed slowly, languidly
into the hall.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,699
The auditorium was vast and silent.

6
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:37,246
As we seated and were darkened,
the voice continued.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,124
"The program for this evening
is not new.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,710
You've seen this entertainment
through and through.

9
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,879
You've seen your birth,
your life and death.

10
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,506
You might recall all of the rest.

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,259
Did you have a good world
when you died?

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,970
Enough to base a movie on?"

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,015
Hey, Jim, it's your birthday, man.

14
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,644
What do you say
we finish this another night?

15
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,566
Turn the lights down a little bit more,
will you, Jay?

16
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,493
Hey, man.
How come the Doors aren't in on this?

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,456
No music. No Doors.
Come on, let's roll.

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,625
Rolling.

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,728
ls everybody in?

20
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,070
The ceremony is about to begin.

21
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,453
Let me tell you about heartache...

22
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,955
and the loss of God.

23
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:06,126
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.

24
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:10,797
Out here, in the perimeter,
there are no stars.

25
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,427
Out here, we is stoned, immaculate.

26
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,976
lt's beautiful.
Look at those big, puffy clouds.

27
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,105
Hey, Jimmy.
Wake up. Look at the clouds.

28
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,858
Come on.
Wake up.

29
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,408
What's going on?

30
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,661
l don't know.

31
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,885
Officer, what happened?
Can we help?

32
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,138
No, sir.
We've got everything under control.

33
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,361
Just a dream, Jimmy.

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,531
That's all it is.
lt's just a dream

35
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,470
Waiting for the medicine.

36
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,449
On your finger.

37
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,075
Wait here.
Don't go.

38
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,660
l'll be right here.

39
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,221
You got a problem with doors?

40
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,223
Waste of time.

41
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,644
l followed you from the beach.

42
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,397
You followed me?

43
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,816
- Why?
- 'Cause...

44
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,818
you're the one.

45
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,380
Maybe you should meet my old man.

46
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,382
What's your name?

47
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,261
- Mine's Jim.
- Pam.

48
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,020
Who the hell was that?

49
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,648
l have no idea.

50
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,526
Nietzsche said...

51
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,822
"All great things must first wear
terrifying and monstrous masks..

52
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,867
in order to inscribe themselves...

53
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,661
on the hearts of humanity."

54
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,454
Listen, children...

55
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,041
to the sound of the Nuremberg night.

56
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,377
ln a seance...

57
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,298
the shaman leads a sensuous panic.

58
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:49,887
He acts like a madman.
A professional hysteria.

59
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,431
Have you ever seen God?

60
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,225
Mandala?

61
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,852
A symmetrical angel.

62
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,938
We got our final vision by clap.

63
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,192
Columbus' groin got filled
with green death.

64
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,403
- l touched her thigh...
- This film is weak.

65
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,031
and death smiled.

66
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,286
Hey, Morrison.
Fuck them, man.

67
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,705
lt's great.
lt's nonlinear, it's poetry.

68
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,624
lt's everything good art stands for.

69
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,628
This world, a monster of energy.

70
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,214
Without beginning,
Without end.

71
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,966
Likewise, without increase or income.

72
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,845
Disclosing nothing.

73
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,805
This world.

74
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,725
This world is a will to power...

75
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,186
and nothing besides.

76
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,026
Pretty pretentious there.

77
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,778
Not easy to follow.
A little incoherent.

78
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,697
Dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation.

79
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,241
What's next?

80
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,701
- What do you guys think?
- A bore, man. l hated it.

81
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,246
lt was better than a Warhol picture!

82
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,664
lt was worse!

83
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,332
A guy sleeping for seven hours?

84
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,043
There was no political conscience.

85
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,588
- You need your art spoon-fed to you.
- Right on!

86
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,802
Hold it down.
Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks.

87
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,807
l quit.

88
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,164
Awake.

89
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,336
Shake dreams from your hair,
my pretty child, my sweet one.

90
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,964
Choose the day
and choose the sign of your day.

91
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,843
The day's divinity.
First thing l see.

92
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,387
Come on out for a walk.

93
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,390
lt's a beautiful night.

94
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,601
A vast, radiant beach...

95
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,188
and a cool, jeweled moon.

96
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:09,526
Couples, naked,
race down by its quiet side.

97
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,613
And we laugh like soft, mad children...

98
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,116
smug in the woolly,
cotton brains of infancy.

99
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,329
Every time
l try to make love to you

100
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,958
you run around
with your mouth stuck out

101
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:29,171
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones.
The time has come again.

102
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,090
Choose now, they croon,
beneath the moon...

103
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,592
beside an ancient lake.

104
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,929
Enter again the sweet forest.

105
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,806
Enter the hot dream.
Come with us.

106
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,475
Everything is broken up...

107
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,810
and dances.

108
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,024
l can't believe it's so beautiful.

109
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:53,987
"Now l have come again to the land
of the fair, strong and the wise.

110
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,365
Brothers and sisters
o'er the pale forest.

111
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,325
O, children of night...

112
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,035
who among you will run with the hunt?

113
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,664
Now, night arrives with
her purple legion.

114
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,084
Retire now to your tents and dreams.

115
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,962
Tomorrow we enter
the town of my birth.

116
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,130
l want to be ready."

117
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,510
lt's beautiful.

118
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,638
- Do you like that?
- lt's beautiful.

119
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,641
l've never read much poetry before.

120
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,646
What's a shaman?

121
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,402
He's a medicine man...

122
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,070
of the lndians.

123
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,949
He gets into a peyote trance...

124
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:44,079
and he gets deeper and deeper,
and then he has a vision...

125
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,582
and the whole tribe is healed.

126
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,711
All cultures have a version of it.

127
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,005
Greeks had theater and gods.

128
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,342
The lndians say the first shaman
invented sex.

129
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,761
They called him
"The One Who Makes You Crazy."

130
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,099
What turns you on?

131
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,312
l don't know.

132
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,399
Experience.

133
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,735
Freedom.

134
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,197
Love. Now.

135
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,909
You know, the first time l did acid,
l saw God.

136
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,829
And l saw a friend of mine
who was Christ and Judas too.

137
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,123
Then l realized that...

138
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,210
that was the secret of everything.

139
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,463
We're all one,
the universe is one...

140
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,883
and that everything is beautiful.

141
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,890
l feel most alive...

142
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,893
confronting death...

143
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,561
experiencing pain.

144
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,440
l think you're most alive
by recognizing beauty.

145
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,442
Seeing truth.

146
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,321
Does death turn you on?

147
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,323
You love death?

148
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,910
Life hurts a lot more.

149
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,371
When you die, the pain's over.

150
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,969
All the poems have wolves in it.

151
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,304
All but one.

152
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,057
The most beautiful one of all.

153
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,188
"She dances in a ring of fire...

154
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,525
and throws off the challenge
with a shrug."

155
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,530
That's beautiful.

156
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,034
Who did you write that for?

157
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,453
l wrote it for you.

158
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,279
Try acid, Ray.

159
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,949
lt's guaranteed.

160
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,993
Shit, Morrison.

161
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,456
My last trip was a real bummer, man.

162
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,917
l never had a bummer on acid.

163
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,877
l'm trying naturally high now.

164
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,795
Whatever works.

165
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,881
Making movies at MGM yet?

166
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,717
l got in to see the head of production.

167
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,386
He said, "Where's your script?"
l said, "l don't need a script.

168
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,972
Godard doesn't use a script.
He improvises."

169
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,017
The guy says, "Great. Who's Godard?"

170
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,019
l'm off movies, man.

171
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,732
l went out to the desert.
Got lost.

172
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,277
l've been living up on Trick's rooftop.

173
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,865
- Got stuck on a chick.
- So what else you doing?

174
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,869
Writing songs, poems.
Stuff like that.

175
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,039
You're writing songs?

176
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,582
So let me hear one.

177
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,043
l'm shy.

178
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,420
- Sing it to me.
- l can't sing.

179
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,713
You sing better than Dylan?

180
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,215
Johnny's in the basement

181
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,884
Mixing up the medicine
l'm on the pavement

182
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,261
Thinking about the government

183
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,764
Let me hear your words.

184
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,438
All right.

185
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,070
Let's swim to the moon

186
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,740
Let's climb through the tide

187
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,662
Penetrate the evening

188
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:58,667
That the city sleeps to hide

189
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,549
Let's swim out tonight, love

190
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,845
lt's our turn to try

191
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,184
Park beside the ocean

192
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,728
On our

193
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,023
Moonlight drive

194
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,701
Those are great fucking lyrics, man.

195
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,455
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You write this?

196
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,832
You got others in here?

197
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,502
A bunch, man.
l got a whole concert in my head.

198
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,337
l can see it all.

199
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,380
What the hell happened to you
in the desert, man?

200
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,924
- Ecstasy and madness.
- Let's get a band together...

201
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,800
and make a million bucks!

202
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,261
- l got tons of songs.
- Things are about to explode.

203
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,264
l can feel it in the air.
People want to fight or fuck.

204
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,017
Love or kill.
Vietnam is right out there.

205
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,019
Sides are being chosen.

206
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,606
Everything's gonna flame.
The planet is screaming for change.

207
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,608
We gotta make the myths.

208
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,693
There ought to be great orgies, man.

209
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,489
When Dionysus arrived in Greece,
he made all the women mad.

210
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,575
Leaving their homes
and dancing off into the mountains.

211
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,329
There should be great, golden
copulations in the streets of L.A.

212
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,664
We should call ourselves Dionysus.

213
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,166
l got a name.
Doors.

214
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,836
You mean "The Doors ln Your Mind"?
The Huxley book?

215
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,004
- Doors of perception. Acid.
- That's great.

216
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,006
The quote's from William Blake.

217
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,300
"When the doors of perception
are cleansed...

218
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,302
things will appear
as they truly are."

219
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,013
Mescaline experiments.
Reducing the sugar flow to the brain.

220
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:35,097
Come on!

221
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,015
Come on!

222
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,487
You know the day destroys the night

223
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,614
Night divides the day

224
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,033
Try to run

225
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,618
Try to hide

226
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,621
Break on through to the other side

227
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,838
What's the matter?

228
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,798
- lt just doesn't sound right.
- l know that, John.

229
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,884
Jim, stay in time.

230
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,468
l say we try that bossa nova beat.

231
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,597
l think it's hot.

232
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,351
l think the lyrics are kind of weird.

233
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,105
You write one, man.

234
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,775
We need more songs anyway.

235
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,111
l thought it was pretty good.

236
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,572
Let's go outside.

237
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,001
l came up with something.

238
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,966
A minor, then F sharp.

239
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,227
You know that it would be untrue

240
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,855
You know that l would be a liar

241
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,901
lf l was to say to you

242
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,530
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

243
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,242
Come on, baby, light my fire

244
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,620
- G, A, D.
- Pretty good. Pretty neat.

245
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,957
Try to set the night on fire

246
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,959
Great, Robby.
You got nice changes in there.

247
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,044
- Got anymore lyrics?
- l got some.

248
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,797
l call it "Light My Fire."

249
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,510
lf l'm gonna compete with your stuff, it
better be about earth, snakes or fire.

250
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,388
l like it.
Sounds like the Byrds though.

251
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,974
But l like it.
lt's good.

252
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,767
A little Latin beat'll
do it some justice.

253
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:48,146
Maybe put a couple long solos,
like Coltrane on "My Favorite Things."

254
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,941
Start over, man.

255
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,819
A minor, B minor.
lt's jazz.

256
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,071
The time to hesitate is through

257
00:19:56,154 --> 00:20:00,868
- Some kind of intro.
- No time to wallow in the mire

258
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:04,121
Try now, we can only lose

259
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:08,083
And our love becomes a funeral pyre

260
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,503
Come on baby, light my fire

261
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,886
Try to set the night on fire

262
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,558
- Can you give me--
- Try now, we can only lose

263
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,228
Can you give me five minutes?
l got to figure out some kind of intro.

264
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,148
- Let's let him work. You like that?
- Yeah, l like Laguna Beach, man.

265
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,443
Funeral pyre.

266
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,241
What do you think about when you play?

267
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,994
l don't know.

268
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,038
Fish in my fish tank.

269
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,376
- How about that acid tonight, man?
- Not for me.

270
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,296
- Not me, either.
- Right here at Ray's house.

271
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,673
See what kind of trouble
we can get into tonight.

272
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,759
No way.
You always get all the chicks.

273
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,302
l always get the dogs.

274
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,221
Hey, l got it!
Come on!

275
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,639
l got it!
l got the intro!

276
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,808
Hang on a second.
John, count off in four, man.

277
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,352
One, two, three.

278
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:37,798
ls that horny fucker
in the black pants here tonight?

279
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,259
No l.D.'s, you can't get in.

280
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,352
Yeah, we chased our pleasures here

281
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,604
Dug our treasures there

282
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,482
Can't you still recall
The time we tried

283
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,569
Break on through to the other side

284
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,799
Turn around, man.
Come on, let them in.

285
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,760
l found an island in your arms

286
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,430
A country in your eyes

287
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,183
Arms that chain us
Eyes that lie

288
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,560
Break on through to the other side

289
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,400
All right

290
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,364
l'm a big fan!
Give it to me!

291
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,782
Made the scene

292
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,201
Week to week

293
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,578
Day to day
Hour to hour

294
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,581
The gate is straight
Deep and wide

295
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,875
Break on through to the other side

296
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,678
All right

297
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:08,305
Hi, Jim.
Can l have your autograph?

298
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,558
Hi, Jim.
Can l have your autograph?

299
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,269
- l don't know. Where do you want it?
- Anywhere you want it.

300
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,313
Leave it to me.
l can take you all the fucking way.

301
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,690
- You blew my mind.
- Did you like the music?

302
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,901
l loved it.
That's why we're talking.

303
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,529
Some of it's on the dark side.
You ought to get some tunes.

304
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,365
Herman's Hermits stuff.
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter

305
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,033
That shit goes right to the radio.

306
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,078
l need him here
to groove on my boyfriend.

307
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,748
What about getting us
some real equipment?

308
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,583
l sign you
to a five-year management contract--

309
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,669
You with the joint.
Put that out, please.

310
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,213
- We can smell that upstairs.
- l can get you there.

311
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,131
Trust me for a while.
What do you say?

312
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,842
We'll have a band meeting on it.

313
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:48,971
We do everything unanimously
or we don't do it.

314
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,305
The Musketeers.

315
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,516
l'm touched.

316
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,102
Let me tell you something.
Loyalty don't pay the bills.

317
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:59,064
Think about it and call me tomorrow.
Here's my card.

318
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,572
Pay attention.
You could get rich.

319
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,949
- Are you blind?
- How old are you?

320
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,410
- Twenty-one.
- Get lost, will you?

321
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:17,749
l'll make this quick and to the point.
lf you repeat it, l'll deny it.

322
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,251
Drop those guys.

323
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,920
Jim's got to start facing the crowd
if he's going to be our front man.

324
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,422
He's just getting his confidence.

325
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,925
- The guy never does what's rehearsed--
- Well, how does it feel?

326
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,302
lt feels great, but--

327
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,138
Your looks. Your voice.
That's what's going to sell records.

328
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,806
We'll make a million bucks a year.

329
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,558
Call me.
l'm right.

330
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,977
Hey, man, let's go.

331
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,813
Do yourself a favor.
Call Larry.

332
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,441
l like a guy
who wears his soul on his face.

333
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,445
Whisky's next, man.
l can feel it in my bones.

334
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,656
l still think the lyrics are weird.

335
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,950
The days are bright

336
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:55,162
And filled with pain

337
00:24:55,245 --> 00:25:00,667
Enclose me in your gentle rain

338
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:04,922
The time you ran

339
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:09,551
Was too insane

340
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,887
We'll meet again

341
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,059
The chicks are really
digging you tonight, man.

342
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,894
We still got to deepen, man.

343
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,396
- We got to go one more step.
- Turn around and face the crowd.

344
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,940
lt'll help present it better.

345
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,775
l got to go to the desert
and take that peyote.

346
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,443
ls that what you're on?

347
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,654
Yeah, man.
lt's kicking in!

348
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,573
- Fucking longhair!
- He's fucking crazy.

349
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,243
- Come on.
- l'm not doing acid, man.

350
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,453
lt's peyote.

351
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,456
What's a rock and roll band for?

352
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,459
Let's plan a murder or start a religion.

353
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,795
More, more, more!

354
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,256
l'm into T.M., man.
l promised my guru.

355
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,341
l'll try it.
l'm ready.

356
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,634
Let's go to the desert.

357
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,636
Let's do the peyote.

358
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,640
Who's on next?

359
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:59,059
Arthur Lee.
He's cool.

360
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,106
l am the lizard king!

361
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,149
l can do anything!

362
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,403
Raise your hands if you understand.

363
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:14,908
Let's take a poll.
How many of you know you're alive?

364
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,661
Bullshit!

365
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,081
You're plastic soldiers
in a miniature dirt war.

366
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,542
Come on!

367
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,545
How many of you people
know you're alive?

368
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,130
Close your eyes.

369
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,924
You see the snake.

370
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,594
See the serpent appear?

371
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:16,929
His head is ten feet long...

372
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,181
and five feet wide.

373
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,350
He has one red eye and one green eye.

374
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,311
That's all right.
lt gets better.

375
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:25,896
Peace.

376
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,107
Seven miles long.

377
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,947
Deadly.

378
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:41,203
See it.
All the history of the world...

379
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,705
is on its scales.

380
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,041
All people.
All actions.

381
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:50,045
We're all just little pictures
in the scales.

382
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,133
God, it's big.

383
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,345
lt's moving.

384
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,599
Devouring consciousness.

385
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,978
Digesting power.

386
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,358
Monster of energy.

387
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,402
lt's a monster.

388
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:19,491
l'm gonna kiss the snake on the tongue.

389
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,035
Kiss the serpent.

390
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,122
But if it senses fear...

391
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:28,166
it'll eat us instantly.

392
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,586
But if we kiss it without fear...

393
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,046
it'll take us through the garden.

394
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,882
Through the gate.

395
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:38,343
To the other side.

396
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:41,513
Ride the snake...

397
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,515
'til the end of time.

398
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,687
l think l'm fucked up, man.

399
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,272
l'm not thinking right.

400
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,233
Look at your eyes, man.
You're death.

401
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,444
l'm afraid of my father.

402
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,198
l can't be what they want me to be.

403
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,033
Maybe you should kill your father.

404
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,409
l'm in pain, man.

405
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,080
l feel the universe
functioning perfectly...

406
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:11,960
but l'm still perfectly locked
inside myself.

407
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:15,214
lnstead of oneness, l feel isolation.

408
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,175
But you're alive.

409
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,928
- Feel it.
- l'm scared.

410
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,888
- lt's beautiful.
- l'm still scared.

411
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,015
Then use us.

412
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,310
Use our strength.
Come on in here.

413
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,270
That's right.

414
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,941
We're a tribe now.
A tribe of warriors.

415
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:39,071
l promise you, l'll be with you
to the end of time.

416
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,698
Nothing will destroy our circle.

417
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,700
Ride the snake.

418
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,873
Come on.

419
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:55,838
My wild love went riding

420
00:29:55,921 --> 00:30:00,467
She rode all the day

421
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:05,472
She rode to the devil

422
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:09,268
Asked him to pay

423
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:14,857
My wild love went riding

424
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,235
She went to the sea

425
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,282
She went to the devil

426
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:28,662
All that's left was we

427
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,470
l'm lying.
l am afraid.

428
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,649
Don't go away!

429
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,195
Come dance with me!

430
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:10,204
Where you going, Jimmy?

431
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,678
This is the end

432
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,557
Beautiful friend

433
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:36,063
This is the end

434
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:40,734
My only friend, the end

435
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:44,613
Of our elaborate plans

436
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,698
The end

437
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,786
Of everything that stands

438
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,788
The end

439
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:56,583
No safety or surprise

440
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,627
The end

441
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,463
l'll never look

442
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,758
lnto your eyes

443
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,010
Again

444
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:16,144
Can you picture what we'll be

445
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,399
So limitless and free

446
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:25,028
Desperately in need

447
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,740
Of some stranger's hand

448
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:34,413
ln a desperate land

449
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:10,866
Lost in a Roman

450
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:15,454
Wilderness of pain

451
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:22,169
And all the children

452
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,297
Are insane

453
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:44,733
Waiting for the summer rain

454
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:06,129
There's danger on the edge of town

455
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:16,014
Ride the king's highway, baby

456
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,731
Weird scenes inside the gold mine

457
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:34,157
Ride the highway west, baby

458
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,790
Ride the snake

459
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,883
To the lake

460
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:56,180
The ancient lake, baby

461
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:01,435
The snake is long

462
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,646
Seven miles

463
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,483
Ride the snake

464
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,281
He's old

465
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,036
And his skin is cold

466
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:29,046
The west is the best

467
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,768
Get here and we'll do the rest

468
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:54,279
The blue bus

469
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:58,450
ls calling us

470
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:13,173
Driver, where you taking us

471
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:32,150
The killer awoke before dawn.

472
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,570
He put his boots on.

473
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,866
He took a face...

474
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,742
from the ancient gallery...

475
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:44,329
and he walked on down the hall.

476
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:56,175
He went into the room
where his sister lived.

477
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,926
Then he...

478
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,347
paid a visit to his brother.

479
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:05,350
Then he--

480
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:09,479
He walked on down the hall.

481
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,152
And he came to a door.

482
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:19,448
He looked inside.

483
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,997
"Father."
"Yes, son?"

484
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,333
"l want to kill you."

485
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,839
"Mother."

486
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,970
l want to

487
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,598
fuck you all night, baby

488
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,392
Come on, baby

489
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,439
"Mother, l want to fuck you"?

490
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,193
Come on

491
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,325
Fuck, fuck

492
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:06,036
Turn him off!
Turn his fucking amp off!

493
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,753
Fuck me, baby

494
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,809
Come on, baby

495
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,602
- He's insane!
- He's a great artist!

496
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,312
- We all love it!
- Come on

497
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,369
All right

498
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,420
Kill

499
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,933
Get him out of here!

500
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:10,058
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

501
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,936
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

502
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,191
Nobody's gonna fuck their mother
on my stage!

503
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,484
- That's what l mean!
- You're out of here!

504
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:21,862
Kill your father!
Fuck the mother!

505
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,614
All right!

506
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,616
Jerry, come on, man!

507
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,744
- Art, man! lt's art!
- What do you know about art?

508
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,079
Take a look at the future, old man!

509
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,415
We're things to come!

510
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,626
Here's art.

511
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,171
- There's your art!
- This is fucking great!

512
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:43,050
- We'll never work in this town again.
- Quite a night.

513
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,177
l'm Jac Holzman.

514
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,888
- l own Elektra Records.
- ls that asshole gonna pay us?

515
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:53,060
l think if you can put
what you did in there on record...

516
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,854
we could really have something
and make a lot of money.

517
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,691
Rothchild here
was born to be your producer.

518
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,694
How you doing? Sorry about all this.
You guys are--

519
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,657
Bertolt Brecht. lt's cabaret.
lt's rock and roll.

520
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,700
l'm really blown away, guys.

521
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:13,080
l'd like to get you guys
into a studio immediately.

522
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:16,458
How would you like to come down
from there and make a record?

523
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,419
Sure.
Pretty good. Pretty neat.

524
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,550
Bruce, you feel it?

525
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,094
lt's bitchin'.

526
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:31,640
An album of killer music in six days.
Six days, baby.

527
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,433
Unreal.

528
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:36,979
The time to hesitate is through

529
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:40,941
No time to wallow in the mire

530
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:44,194
Try now, we can only lose

531
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:48,282
And our love become a funeral pyre

532
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:51,034
Come on, baby, light my fire

533
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,959
Try to set the night on fire

534
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,037
L.B.J.! L.B.J. !

535
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,040
How many kids
have you killed today?

536
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:47,716
You know that it would be untrue

537
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:51,595
You know that l would be a liar

538
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:55,182
lf l was to say to you

539
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,727
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

540
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,813
Come on, baby, light my fire

541
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,446
Try to set the night on fire

542
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,880
All right!

543
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:56,410
- Name? Occupation?
- Bill Siddons. l'm the manager.

544
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,870

00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:08,255
John Densmore.

548
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,300
Twenty-two years old.
Far out, man.

549
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,845
- Name? Occupation?
- Raymond Daniel Manzarek.

550
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:19,224
Born 2-12-39.
Musician. Organist.

551
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:22,519
- Name? Occupation?
- Jim.

552
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:31,046
We're gonna be on TV.

553
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,714
Right this way, Mr. Sullivan.

554
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:32,840
They're called the Doors...

555
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,967
They're called the Doors...

556
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,928
and they've got the number one single
in the country right now.

557
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,930
"Light Your Fire."

558
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,308
Now, they're not your usual group...

559
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,811
but l think they're gonna fit in
just fine.

560
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,729
Everything's gonna be fine.

561
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:50,858
The riot continues in Detroit,
with 1,400 buildings burned.

562
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,568
No wonder "Light My Fire"
is number one.

563
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,613
So, what's your room number?

564
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,365
l'll talk to you later.

565
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:02,286
- You have got very serious hair.
- Were you pinching her butt?

566
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:06,206
- What about me?
- l won't open that kettle of worms.

567
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,208
What about you, handsome?
What can we do?

568
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,794
Some of the worst mistakes of my life
have been haircuts.

569
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:14,256
Don't wash it. Don't set it. Go away.
l like it just the way it is.

570
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,718
- Be mean.
- Boys. Boys.

571
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,761
Meet Mr. Sullivan.

572
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:22,055
Fellas, just great.

573
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,933
-l heard your record, "Light That Fire."
-"Light Your Fire."

574
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,602
- Just--
- "Light My Fire."

575
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:29,271
Fine.
Just really, really fine.

576
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,732
l have one small thing to bring up.

577
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,526
But it's important.
The guys at network told us...

578
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,528
they have a little problem...

579
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:40,032
with the lyric,
"Girl, we couldn't get much higher."

580
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:42,159
You can't say "higher"...

581
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,702
on network.

582
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,579
They asked if you could say, instead...

583
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:48,040
"Girl, we can't get much better."

584
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:50,125
- Can you dig that?
- How about...

585
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:53,837
"Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"?

586
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,591
l don't think
Standards and Practices would--

587
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:01,512
Why don't you have a nice, big smile
on your face when you get out there?

588
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:03,347
There's no point in being sullen.

589
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:06,141
- You know what l mean?
- We're a sullen group, Ed.

590
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:11,605
You boys should know, Mr. Sullivan
is considering you for four more shows.

591
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,023
- You dig?
- We dig.

592
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,401
l'll work it out.
Just give me five minutes.

593
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,403
- Groovy.
- Just give me five.

594
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:20,531
Have a great show.

595
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,495
Well?

596
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:31,083
- Come on.
- lt's just a word.

597
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,669
The Stones changed
when they played here.

598
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,796
Why don't you change your name to...

599
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:38,298
Sidney or lrving Manzarek?

600
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,425
- lt's just a word.
- Hey, man.

601
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:43,053
My words. l don't care.
Let's just jam.

602
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,388
And now...

603
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,932
direct from
Los Angeles, California...

604
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,561
ladies and gentlemen,
here now, the Doors!

605
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,816
You know that it would be untrue

606
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,860
We're okay sound wise?

607
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:04,533
lf l was to say to you

608
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:08,078
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

609
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,830
He said it!

610
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,331
He said it on national TV.

611
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:15,085
- l can't believe that!
- Come on baby, light my fire

612
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,837
What's he doing? What's that?

613
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,673
Jesus! Get it off!
You can see his thing!

614
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,800
You blew it, you little shit!

615
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,802
You'll never play Sullivan again!

616
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:32,144
Can you just move a step forward?

617
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,688
Come on.
l know you love to look at yourself.

618
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:38,192
Great.

619
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:43,071
Let's try something different.
Take your shirt off.

620
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,825
- You take it off.
- Do you need help?

621
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,913
That's good.

622
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,418
The camera
is whatever you want it to be.

623
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,170
A woman you want to seduce.

624
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,049
A man you want to kill.

625
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,885
lt can be anything you want.

626
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:06,595
That's nice.

627
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,598
That's great!

628
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,392
Do you have any idea
what these pictures can do?

629
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:16,188
One image controls millions of people.

630
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,857
- Where are the Doors?
- Right here.

631
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:20,317
Will you forget the Doors?

632
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,110
You're the one they want.

633
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,321
You are the Doors.
Come on.

634
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,658
That's it.
Be ugly.

635
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,662
l love that.

636
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,455
Anything you want.

637
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,624
There are no restrictions here.

638
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,504
Look at yourself.

639
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,506
Fall in love with yourself.

640
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:47,719
You're your own audience now.

641
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,223
They want you.

642
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,894
Worship, love you.

643
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,479
Adore you.

644
00:48:57,563 --> 00:49:00,482
Jim Morrison.

645
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,484
The god of rock...

646
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,486
and cock.

647
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:47,154
Not tonight, Edie.
Thank you, not tonight.

648
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:50,240
This is the fun part of my job.
This is history in the making.

649
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:54,870
Would you like to see my imitation
of a shrimp?

650
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:57,039
Let me put it this way.

651
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,501
Andy is more than an artist.
Andy Warhol is art.

652
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:03,754
Sometimes l think bright people
in America must ask themselves...

653
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,924
"Does Andy imitate life,
or does life imitate Andy?"

654
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,718
Jim, this is Tom Baker.

655
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:13,096
He's in one of Andy's movies,
"l, A Man."

656
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,766
- And this is Count "Ruspooli."
- Ruspoli.

657
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,726
He's ltalian, but he lives in Paris.

658
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:21,271
He's from a very famous family,
700 years old.

659
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:24,191
Hi, Jim.
You are great.

660
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:27,236
l see you at Ondine's with Hendrix.

661
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,572
So cool.

662
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,574
- All right.
- Don't you like the way he talks?

663
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,118
- lt's so cool.
- What's your trip?

664
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,663
My trip?
l thought it was yours.

665
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,749
l caught your gig at The Scene.
l thought it was pretty good.

666
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,543
l liked it a lot.
lt was hot.

667
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:45,629
l like your movies, man.
You got a great penis.

668
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:51,051
We're gonna split.
Why don't you come with us?

669
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,680
- We're going to get a bite to eat.
- No, you can't leave.

670
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,265
Where's your will to be weird?

671
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:58,809
Look, that's Jim Morrison.

672
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,519
l like the Doors.

673
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,230
Let's get out of here.
These people are wacky.

674
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,693
Come with me.
Andy's waiting for you.

675
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:10,028
No, not now.
Let's do this later.

676
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,532
Do you remember San Francisco?

677
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:15,868
- No, not really.
- Have another joint.

678
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,619
Check it out.

679
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:21,915
This chick here sings with Andy's band,
The Velvet Underground.

680
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,419
She says she can
drink you under the table.

681
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,048
Hi, l'm Nico.

682
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,551
lt's so boring tonight.

683
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:37,181
Some of us are going downtown
to a new club.

684
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,099
You want to come?

685
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,560
Elevate your taste in trolls, man.

686
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,440
Vodka?

687
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,442
l'll race you.

688
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:53,488
Your death.

689
00:51:57,284 --> 00:52:00,037
Come on, man.
Let's go.

690
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,706
All right.
We're gonna go to a club.

691
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,834
l think this girl
wants to hang out with you.

692
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:09,796
Don't you want to meet Andy Warhol?

693
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,091
l could do without the guy.
He's a freak.

694
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,885
Come on.
We got a big gig tomorrow.

695
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:18,680
Wait. l thought we were going
to be a rock and roll band.

696
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:21,225
All right.
The four of us.

697
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,435
Come on.
This isn't our scene.

698
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,187
These people are vampires.

699
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,194
Come on, let's make the myths.
Remember?

700
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:33,654
Let's go.

701
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,405
Don't leave.

702
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:37,741
Come on, you guys.
Not tonight.

703
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,743
l don't know what'll happen.

704
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,621
lt might be death.

705
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,333
lt's not death, man.

706
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,085
l'll see you tomorrow.

707
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,826
Jimmy, this way.

708
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,829
Andy's waiting. This way.
l'll take you to him.

709
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:25,497
Hey, daddy.

710
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,417
Jimmy, please.
Come on.

711
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,419
Andy's waiting.
Come on.

712
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:34,840
Hey, man.
How you doin'?

713
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,967
All right.
How you doin', man?

714
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,468
Great.

715
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,763
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

716
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,400
There was this big show
in Philadelphia.

717
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,902
Andy.

718
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:57,070
There were so many
people there--

719
00:53:57,154 --> 00:54:00,741
This is Jim Morrison of
the world-famous Doors musical group.

720
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,702
- Andy Warhol, of course.
- Hi. Wow.

721
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,496
We really like your music.

722
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,124
- How you doin', Andy?
- Oh, great.

723
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:13,420
And there were so many people
at the show...

724
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,674
the paintings
were getting crushed...

725
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:21,803
and they had to
take them all down.

726
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:26,141
Really, they were kind of...

727
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:28,810
great.

728
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:31,813
Just the walls.
You see, Andy was the art.

729
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:34,566
You should do a show
with just bare walls.

730
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,569
We'd really like to use you
in one of our movies, Jim.

731
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,571
You're really such a beauty.

732
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:43,742
Andy says someday everybody
will be famous for 15 days.

733
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,827
He'd really be great,
wouldn't he?

734
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,874
l mean...

735
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,839
lt's the singer,
not the song, right?

736
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,841
lt's the astronaut,
not the voyage.

737
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,179
Somebody gave me this telephone.

738
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:07,850
- l think it was Edie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was Edie.

739
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,895
And she said that...

740
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,815
l could talk to God with it...

741
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:17,734
but l don't have anything to say.

742
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,529
Here. This is for you.

743
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:28,245
Now you can talk to God.

744
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,219
Morrison.

745
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,305
Come here.

746
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,202
Darling, listen,
l pay the bills...

747
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,871
so l can use any language
that l want.

748
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,373
The guy wants to talk
to the bum.

749
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,919
Check it out, brother.

750
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:52,306
What are your songs about,
Mr. Morrison?

751
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:56,560
Love, death, travel, revolt.

752
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,482
We all write the songs.

753
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,109
l'm interested in...

754
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:08,363
chaos, disorder...

755
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,450
especially activities which seem
to have no meaning, like this.

756
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:16,538
How do you feel about being called
"the ultimate Barbie doll"?

757
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:19,917
When you say something like that,
it's a shortcut to thinking.

758
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:24,213
And do you think about
the dreadful reviews...

759
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:26,215
your new poetry book has gotten?

760
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:28,717
l guess they didn't understand.

761
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,262
- Did you finance its publication?
- Have you bothered to read the poetry?

762
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:36,266
You keep denying that nothing good
can come out of L.A.

763
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,268
That's a rather
provincial attitude.

764
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:41,355
- Do you believe in drugs?
- l believe in excess.

765
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:44,107
ls alcohol considered part
of the shaman's wisdom?

766
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,692
lt's the American way.

767
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:49,029
Every year we spend more money
on tobacco and alcohol...

768
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,781
than we do on education.

769
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:53,909
- On behalf of the British press--
- What about the future of the Doors?

770
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:56,912
- That's just an excuse for free sex.
- How do you spend your money?

771
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:05,003
l believe in a long, prolonged
derangement of the senses...

772
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,214
to attain the unknown.

773
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,759
Although l live
in the subconscious...

774
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,555
our pale reason
hides the infinite from us.

775
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:19,434
Are you, by any chance,
in a trance now?

776
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,064
Do you hurt?

777
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:26,984
What?

778
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,237
What hurts you the most?

779
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:36,159
What do your parents think
about what you're doing?

780
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,245
Actually,
l don't remember being born.

781
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:41,248
lt must have happened
during one of my blackouts.

782
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,959
They must have expressed
some feeling.

783
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,963
Well, to tell you the truth,
they're not living anymore...

784
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:51,133
so l really don't like
to talk about that.

785
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,303
Could you tell us how they died?

786
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,350
lt was a...

787
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:03,020
horrible car crash...

788
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,563
in New Mexico...

789
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:06,732
in the '50s.

790
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:10,194
My father ran right into
a truckload of Navahos.

791
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,320
They were...

792
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,699
all over the highway, bleeding.

793
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:20,412
Their souls, kind of
stirring in the breeze...

794
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,122
just leapt into mine.

795
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:27,419
l'm sorry.

796
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:33,342
Mr. Krieger, do you really
consider Mr. Morrison a shaman?

797
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:05,999
Don't worry about it.
lt happens to other guys too.

798
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,002
Wanna do some coke?

799
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,004
lt'll loosen you up.

800
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:13,340
Sure. The new thing.

801
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,846
Wow.

802
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:22,558
How old is this?

803
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:26,395
That's 14th century.

804
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:29,273
- Witchcraft.
- lt's a religion, you know.

805
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:31,233
Witchcraft.

806
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,443
Witches are
the protectors of the seasons...

807
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,780
the goddesses of the grain...

808
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,782
and when crossed...

809
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:41,743
destroyers.

810
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,751
You ever try drinking blood?

811
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,796
What?

812
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,215
lt works, you know.

813
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:58,218
Drink it at the right time
of the moon.

814
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:03,932
They used to dance
in the forests naked.

815
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,935
l think that's what
offended the Puritans...

816
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,645
and led to the burnings.

817
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:13,358
They were a sexual threat
to their male order...

818
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,652
like the Bacchae.

819
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:17,654
Five days a year,
for Dionysus...

820
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:20,699
they used to wander the hills
of ancient Greece.

821
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:24,119
The first witches.

822
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:27,497
Clans of wild women...

823
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,709
looting...

824
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,002
fucking...

825
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,214
eating animals raw...

826
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:39,384
looking for Dionysus...

827
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:41,386
to tear him...

828
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:42,888
to pieces!

829
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,019
Where do you get the blood?

830
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:55,567
Blood is the rose
of mysterious union.

831
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,570
Symbol of potency.

832
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:02,574
- Now you.
- l can't cut myself.

833
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:06,078
Don't be such a child.
lf l do it, you have to do it.

834
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,376
You do it.

835
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:23,530
Come on, rock god.

836
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:25,908
Fuck me.
Fuck me good.

837
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:50,182
What do you want me to do?
What can l do, baby?

838
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:58,982
- What's the matter?
- Will you die for me?

839
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:02,319
What do you want me to do?

840
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:05,197
Maybe l should see
a doctor or something.

841
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:10,702
What do you think?
Someone from the Freudian philosophy?

842
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:15,499
lt happens to other guys too.

843
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:22,965
You know, that's the irony.

844
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:29,513
Teenage death girls
want my dick, not my words.

845
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,524
lt's not so complicated.

846
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,484
lt's just sex, you know.

847
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,946
Never wake up
in a good mood again.

848
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:49,283
lt's the hours and the pressure.

849
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:52,786
You do everything
like it's your last performance.

850
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:55,914
We weren't built to last.
You never know.

851
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,918
You're setting yourself up, you know.
You're setting yourself up.

852
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,881
You're a poet, not a rock star.

853
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:06,884
You really know what l am?

854
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:12,639
- You know what poetry is?
- You don't belong on Ed Sullivan.

855
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:14,641
Who am l?

856
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:19,229
Where's the feast
they promised us?

857
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:21,231
Where's the new wine?

858
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,985
Dying on the vine.

859
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:32,242
See, l lied to you.

860
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,291
l loved fame.

861
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:42,044
l do love fame.

862
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,969
- Why are you doing this to me?
- 'Cause you're here.

863
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:52,888
And that's gonna help?

864
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:57,226
l don't have this problem
with anybody else.

865
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,228
Suck it, honey.
Come on.

866
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:01,313
- Fuck you.
- Where you goin'? Huh?

867
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,315
Where do you think you're going?

868
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:05,901
Love my girl!

869
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:07,986
How many guys have you fucked?

870
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,614
And how many dogs
have you fucked?

871
01:07:10,656 --> 01:07:13,492
You're the only one
who couldn't make it, you asshole!

872
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:16,995
You are the only limp dick
in the lot!

873
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:21,750
Will you die for me?

874
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,420
- Answer me!
- Will you die for me?

875
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:27,047
Sure.

876
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:28,590
l'd die for anybody.

877
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:32,219
Shut up in there!
l'm trying to sleep in here!

878
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,141
- Will you die for me?
- Yes!

879
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,560
l don't believe you!

880
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,562
- Say it!
- Yes. Yes.

881
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:51,905
l'm just a clown.

882
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,825
Am l a clown?

883
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,083
l need a home...

884
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:05,919
a place to hide.

885
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,131
l'm sorry.

886
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:12,509
We're gonna fuck death away.
Come on.

887
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:17,556
Let's fuck death away.
Come on, baby. All right.

888
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:26,231
An ancient lunatic reigns
in the trees of the night.

889
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,833
We've got
a serious problem here.

890
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,836
The fire marshal
won't let this concert go on...

891
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:50,881
unless you clear the aisles
and go back to your seats.

892
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:54,259
Unless you clear these aisles,
there is no show.

893
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:56,553
The sound of the crowd.

894
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:59,723
l don't even like rock groups.
They're sleazy.

895
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,311
- You like that, huh?
- Like Nuremberg.

896
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:06,313
- Like that?
- We're Germans.

897
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:09,608
- Beg.
- l'm begging.

898
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,778
You wanna fuck me?

899
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,949
Don't ever fuckin' lie
to me again.

900
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:21,703
- About what?
- Why did you say your father was dead?

901
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:24,164
He is dead.
Both of them. Totally.

902
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:27,459
lf he's so dead,
who answered the phone when l called?

903
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:28,961
What?

904
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:34,132
You didn't really think you were
getting away with that, did you?

905
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:36,802
Your father's an admiral
in the Navy...

906
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:40,806
who was at the Gulf of Tonkin
when the Vietnam War broke out.

907
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,563
Wow.

908
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:50,691
Your dad's deputy chief
of operations.

909
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,277
Just don't ever lie
to me again.

910
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:02,536
What?

911
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:07,708
You shouldn't have done that.

912
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:11,211
Like it's so hard
to trace your school records?

913
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:15,757
You went to University of Florida,
Albuquerque, New Mexico...

914
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,385
Arlington, Virginia...

915
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,554
Washington, D.C.

916
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:24,558
You have a brother
and a sister.

917
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:28,061
"Seven Miles Long," baby.
lt's all in "The End."

918
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:44,661
l'm sorry.

919
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:47,664
What did he do?

920
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,168
Did he love you?

921
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:56,006
How much?

922
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:02,930
Your mama?

923
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:12,356
Hatred's
a very underestimated emotion.

924
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:16,860
Doesn't matter anymore,
does it?

925
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,032
Do you hear them out there?
Are you listening to them?

926
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,078
lt's you they want now.

927
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:29,748
lt's not the Doors.

928
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:33,836
lt's not your mother
or your father's child.

929
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,588
lt's you.
