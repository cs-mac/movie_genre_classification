00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:56,120
"I cannot forget,but i
can forgive."´ Mandela

2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,400
That protects from misfortune...

3
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,560
and the evil eye..

4
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,760
Rich men,give me a dollar.

5
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,280
Go away.

6
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,240
Tell him to go away.
I'm sick.

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,120
We have no money.
Go away.

8
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,440
You're so stuborn!
Go away!

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll do it for free.That
man will pay.

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,920
Go away!Women
are protesting

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,000
Where?

12
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Not for political reasons.
We're hungry.Jobs..

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,760
Interesting.
Got any change?

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Come see
the revolution

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,080
It's not for political reasons!
We're hungry!We need jobs!

16
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't pull me like this!Pull
those women over there.

17
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,360
The Talibans are
coming to bring hell!

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,080
It's not for political reasons!
We're hungry!We need jobs!

19
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,480
WE ARE WIDOWS

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,480
Run!The Talibans are
coming!Run!

21
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,560
You want to get killed?

22
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,160
You'll get killed.Run!

23
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,720
Sends the misforunes away,
in the name of the king...

24
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,560
and the girls.Protects
from the evil eye.

25
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,920
Get up!

26
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Don't lock us here!

27
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,680
Heretics!

28
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Why you came now?It's
a dangerous situation.

29
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,200
The hospital is closing.
The manager wants to go.

30
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,040
Go where?He owes me
4 months!

31
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Let's go my love.

32
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,440
How am i gonna pay you?
I have no money.

33
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,720
So,what can i do?

34
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Our patient is dying.
Help us!

35
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm not a doctor.I'm
just the manager here.

36
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,160
Look at my shoes!

37
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
I can't do anything.

38
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,160
Government doesn't care
about us either.

39
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,520
I can't do anything.
The hospital is a mess.

40
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,560
We're hungry!We're begging you!

41
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,320
Leave me alone,
for Christ's sake!

42
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,800
My wife went out alone.
The Talibans arrested her.

43
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,200
It's said that the goat mourns
and the boucher for meat.

44
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,640
You're late.Come,my
father is not well.

45
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,080
Why?Isn't he
better than yesterday?

46
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,440
-He's worst.
-Worst?

47
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,440
Yes,come quick.

48
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,640
-Come quick!
-I'm coming!

49
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Quick!My father is worst.

50
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,480
He was ok yesterday.

51
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Now he's worst.
I'm loosing my father.

52
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,760
-How are you sir?
-Ok.My body's in pain.

53
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,560
Let's give half of yours
to this old man.

54
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,440
He's poor
and needs help.

55
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,040
We have no oxygen.
Make some air.

56
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
The Talibans are here.

57
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,360
What's happening?Mom!
The Talibans are here!

58
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,640
Are there any
foreign woman here?

59
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
No.

60
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Who is she then?

61
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,000
She's with my father.
He's sick.I brought him here.

62
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,760
And you came with whom?

63
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,480
With me.

64
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,400
Who are you?

65
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm her husband.

66
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
I am with
my sick father.

67
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,040
You bastard!How you let her
speak?You're the husband!

68
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,040
Forgive me.

69
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,080
Father has asthma.
I'm making some air to him.

70
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,840
Mom,they're gone.

71
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,040
Come here so they don't see you.

72
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,720
Take that thing out.
I'll take him home.

73
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,080
He will die if i take it out.

74
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
I have no choice.

75
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,080
If i take care of him at home,
will you pay me?

76
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Come,God is Great.

77
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Quick!Let's go,
before it gets colder.

78
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,800
Come quick and bring it.

79
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,480
Will you take us home?
We're gonna be late.Let's go.

80
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll escort them.The
Talibans will tease them.

81
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Stop it,you bastard!

82
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,720
Aren't you ashamed of having
your wife on the bicycle?

83
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,000
All the men will fal in love with her!
Cover your legs!

84
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
Forgive me!
I won't do it again!

85
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Can you escort
me again tomorrow?

86
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
No,find someone else.

87
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Don't you add more
misery to me,mom.

88
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,320
God took his revenge on me
allready.I am a mess.

89
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,400
Shame on you!I told you not to take it off.

90
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,800
If something goes wrong..

91
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,920
what will i do?

92
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,120
Oh God,what a misery?

93
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,800
I wish my husband was alive.He
was bringing the food at least.

94
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,160
You took him away
in the Kabul war.

95
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,600
I wish my brother was alive...

96
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,520
and not kileed in the Russin war.

97
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,720
He would take care of
us now, mother mostly.

98
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,120
Oh God,i wish i had a son
instead of a daughter.

99
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,080
He would work for me.

100
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,000
I wish God haven't created women.

101
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,680
What?Men and women
are exactly the same.

102
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,840
My hair grown white
but i saw..

103
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,080
that there is no difference
between men and women.

104
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,920
Both work the same..

105
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,440
and both are the same unfortunate.

106
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,680
A shaved man,
under the burka..

107
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,200
looks like a woman...

108
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,200
and every woman
with short hair...

109
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,920
and wears a pair of trousers,
looks like a man.

110
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
Bring her father's
clothes.

111
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
and cut them short.

112
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,080
I'll cut the hair
tomorrow...

113
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,360
and she will be a boy.

114
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,640
What re you saying grandma?

115
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,920
If the Talibans realize this,
they ll kill me.

116
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,040
Don't be afraid.

117
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
If you are careful,
you'll be a man.

118
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,800
You are a boy my love.

119
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
All the bad things in the
world,is in his eyes.

120
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,520
We all die if
you don't work.

121
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,960
Do you remember that
old story i used to tell you?

122
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,880
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful boy...

123
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,240
hos father was dead.

124
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,920
He went to work and
came back a reck.

125
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Then he wished
he was a girl...

126
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,720
so he didn't have
to work.

127
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,440
One day The
Wise One told him...

128
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,960
that if he crossed the
rainbow he would become a girl.

129
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,640
"What's the rainbow?"he asked.

130
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,440
It was a souvenir from
Rastam,the big hero...

131
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,800
to free us from the
pain and misery.

132
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,280
If a boy crosses it
becomes a girl...

133
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,640
and if i girl crosses it,
becomes a boy.

134
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,760
Get up my dear.

135
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,360
-You belong to me.
-Pay me this Friday.

136
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,560
-Thank you.
-I wish you health.

137
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
Don't get upset,Sister.

138
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,240
My condolescences.

139
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,240
Mother!

140
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,760
Mother!

141
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,400
I know you.
Why you cut your hair?

142
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,680
Pay me or
I'll turn you in.

143
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
Hi.

144
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,240
Hi.

145
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,480
You know Rahim?

146
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,680
Rahim who?

147
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,040
-The left-handed.
-No.

148
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,960
The one that got killed
in the Kabul war.

149
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
How come you don't remember him?

150
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
You fought together for 14 years.

151
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm his wife.

152
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm sorry i don't remember.

153
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,120
How are you?

154
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,560
Good.

155
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
How's your daughter?

156
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,080
This boy
is my daughter.

157
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
Come from the back.

158
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,240
Why you got out with
all this fuss?It's dangerous.

159
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,120
What could i do?
I came for you.

160
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,080
I disguised my girl
as a boy...

161
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,280
so you take her
at work.

162
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,640
I am poor
and desperate.

163
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
My husband died as a martyre.

164
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,280
All i got is you and the
garden of God.

165
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Where can i go by myself?

166
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,400
I opened the store
so i can earn some money...

167
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,120
but noone comes.

168
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,560
I hardly earn a
living myself

169
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,280
I wish
i could help.

170
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,760
Sent only some bred.
God bless you.

171
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,800
Son,come
early tomorrow for work.

172
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,120
God bless you.

173
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,040
Thank you.God
helps all.

174
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,640
You come back early.

175
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,600
Let's go son.

176
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,560
God bless you.

177
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
What's wrong?

178
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,400
Wore your sleepers.

179
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,200
Ok.

180
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
Soften you voice.
It's too deep.

181
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,120
Ok.

182
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,800
Don't talk.You voice
gives you away.

183
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Ok.

184
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,280
Boys,it's praying time.

185
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,360
Do you know
how to pray?

186
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,080
Not like that, my son.
Look at me.

187
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Let's go.

188
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,920
God is Great.

189
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,880
Take this and go home before
it gets dark.

190
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,280
Thank you.
God bless you.

191
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,720
Why you hit me?

192
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,760
Mom!A Taliban
is behind the door.

193
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,440
Grandma,he will kill me
if he finds out that i'm a girl.

194
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh God,what am i
gonna do with you?

195
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,400
What have you done?

196
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,520
Nothing.

197
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
The Talibans suspected it.
What am i gonna do?

198
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
I didn't do anything.

199
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,600
Shame on you!

200
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,560
Do something,fast!

201
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,320
Eat some watermelon!

202
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,800
You''ll get sick
if you don't eat.

203
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,320
Eat something and i'll tell you...

204
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,760
a nice fairytail
to sleep.

205
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,880
You'll get sick my dear.

206
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,360
I'll die for you...
I love you.

207
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,480
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful boy...

208
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,320
which father was dead.

209
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,360
He had four sisters.

210
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,680
He went to work
and came back a reck.

211
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,600
Then he wished
he was a girl...

212
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,320
so he doesn't have
to work.

213
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,320
If he crossed the rainbow,
he would become a girl.

214
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,520
He asked what a
rainbow was.

215
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,400
The Wise Man said:"Heavenly
rainbows rise from rain."

216
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,600
If a boy crossed them,
he became a girl...

217
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,960
and if a girl crossed them
she would become a boy.

218
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Let's go.

219
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,520
What's wrong Molah Sahib?

220
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,720
I want that boy.

221
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,960
-What do you want from him?
-I'm taking him.

222
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,160
-He works for me.
-I must take him.

223
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,400
Let him be,please.
He's too poor.

224
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,640
Poor or not,
i'm taking him.

225
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Drink some milk,
Molah Sahib.

226
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,520
Drink some,please.

227
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,200
How are you?

228
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,360
Where are they taking us?

229
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,680
To Bin Landen,
to fight.

230
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,280
No,they're taking us to prison.

231
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,640
Get in line!

232
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,520
Take one each!

233
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,160
One at a time!

234
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,920
What's happening here?

235
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,240
They turn us into Taliban here.
They'll give us turbans.

236
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,000
-Will i get one too?
-Yes.

237
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,280
Take this turban.

238
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,000
How do i wrap this?

239
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,960
Lower a little and
I'll do it for you.

240
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,400
You have to learn this.

241
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,760
My eyes are in pain.

242
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,560
Who can speak of
The Saint Koran?

243
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,600
-I don't know it.
-Don't speak so loud!

244
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,800
The dog barks.
Get up and chant!

245
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,520
Do it!Don't be a coward!

246
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,160
Get up.

247
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,960
Give me your hand.

248
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,760
Put me down.Fast!

249
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Get me down!I'm falling!

250
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,280
Come down...slowly..

251
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,720
Place you feet
on my shoulders.

252
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,680
Coward!Girl!

253
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,600
You know why i am
here today?

254
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,600
To teach you.

255
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,600
The lesson is that
you have a wet dream.

256
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,080
Something comes into your sleep.

257
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,520
Then you'll become men
and then you must take a bath.

258
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,720
There are many
"bath" ways.

259
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,080
A wet dream,
a prayer one...

260
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,320
and i'll show you
how we do it.

261
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,400
First you wash
your hands.

262
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,960
First right and
then left hand...

263
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,520
and then your testicles.
Got it?

264
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,800
I'll show you how,now.

265
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,920
This is for the head.

266
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,120
Got it?

267
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,760
This is the testicle you
must wash.

268
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,360
I didn't quite get it.

269
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,640
Only got knows if
this is the right way.

270
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,880
It's under his control.

271
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,120
Three time
the right side...

272
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,440
Three times
the left side...

273
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,840
and three times the in-between.
That's the way.

274
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,240
Come here.
Everybody pay attention now!

275
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,800
You won't experience
this again.

276
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:33,200
Watch carefully.Noone
has ever done this beofre.

277
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,560
And try to learn it.

278
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,880
You must wash
underneath here.

279
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,160
You don't need to
know which side...

280
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,120
cause it's right there,
hanging in the middle.

281
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:58,560
Now we pour water
three times,got it?

282
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:20,080
There must be plenty of
water.A river maybe.

283
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,160
Dive.

284
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
My foot is bleeding,
Molah Sahib.

285
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,640
Wash your feet first,
then you can take a bath.

286
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,680
Come here to
wash your feet.

287
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,000
Take off you clothes.
Forget about the pain.

288
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,080
Take off your shoes.
Get your feet naked.

289
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,040
Wash'em.Take off your
clothes.Take a bath.

290
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,560
Oh God,what a wonderful feeling!

291
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,200
Do you want me to
wash your feet?

292
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,360
Don't you get it?

293
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,440
3 times right,3 times left
3 the in-between.

294
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:03,080
This boy looks
like a bride.

295
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,320
What's a bride,
Molah Sahib?

296
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:17,880
Brides are the female
spirits in the sky.

297
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,680
It's a girl.Everything
look girlish.

298
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,160
I'm definite
it's a girl.

299
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,440
It's a boy.
Boy.Bastards!

300
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,720
She looks at men.Let
him be!You bastards!

301
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,640
If it's like that,
what's his name?

302
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,040
Osama.

303
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,360
-We'll search him.
-I don't think so!

304
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,600
It's a just a kid.

305
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,240
Go!

306
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,880
-Where is he gone?
-What?

307
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,120
-Where is my boss?
-Pakistan.

308
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,680
Didn't managed too good.

309
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,000
You keep that so
you're warm.

310
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,640
Did he said where
he was heading?

311
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,080
I came back from school
and a neighbour said...

312
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,280
that he went to Pakistan.
What do we do now?

313
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,520
Don't worry.When a door
closes,another hundred open.

314
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,760
Our neighbour is having
a wedding ceremony tonight.

315
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,200
Wear your dress and
we'll go work there.

316
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,280
Give me the picture of the
groom holding a sword.

317
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,480
Thank you.

318
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,440
-Where is the groom?
-Went to Iran.

319
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,480
Talibans are at the doors!
Wear your burkes!

320
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,600
What's happening
in this house?

321
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,000
My mother died.

322
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:10,320
Listen.Forget the war
lessons afterwards.

323
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,040
His face
is girlish.

324
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,880
His feet
are girlish.

325
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,000
Listen to his voice.His hands
are girlish.

326
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,720
Get away from here!
I'm not a girl.

327
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,600
You lied to us yesterday.
You are a girl.

328
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,120
Espandi!

329
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,040
Espandi!

330
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,360
What's wrong?

331
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,280
Why you tease him,
you bastards?

332
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,720
You lied to us.

333
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,040
I didn't lie to
anyone.Go away!

334
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,360
He's not a girl.
He's a boy.

335
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,760
Then he must
climb to the tree.

336
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,320
Climb to the tree,Osama.

337
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,080
He looks like a girl.

338
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,160
He's a boy and he
can climb to that tree.

339
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,800
Espandi!

340
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,760
He's not a girl.
He's a man.

341
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Espandi!

342
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,080
Come this way.
Come close.

343
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,440
I'm falling.

344
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
Up!

345
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,560
Mother where are you?

346
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,960
Get up.

347
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,160
He's a girl!

348
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,480
She's a girl!

349
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,440
Get her!

350
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,280
In the name of the father...

351
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,360
People that came to see.

352
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,280
We gathered here for
our religious laws.

353
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,600
To see what's happening
in Kaboul.

354
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,880
This unfaithful reporter
took shots from everybody.

355
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,200
He was spying
on the noble Talibans.

356
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,840
We have our witnesses
and evidence.

357
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,240
Take him.Death is the punishment!

358
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,240
Death is the punishment!

359
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,480
Judge ordered the death
penalty for him.

360
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,600
This unfaithful woman
was swearing.

361
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:54,960
The judges decided that stones
must be thrown at her until she dies.

362
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,760
-Where is the witness?
-Only God knows.

363
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,160
Bring the girl that
pretended to be a boy.

364
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,520
Whoever does this,
will conclude like him.

365
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,680
In our Holy Islam has never
happened anything like this.

366
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,840
We have seen many bad things...

367
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:56,640
in Kaboul like we see today.

368
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,640
I forgive her.

369
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,920
May you life and
faith go on forever

370
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,360
This orphane girl
doesn't have anyone.

371
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,760
I marry her to you...

372
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,800
legally and in a religious way.
Do you accept?

373
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,080
I accept.

374
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,520
Judge,don't give me
to him,please.

375
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,560
I want my mother.
Bring me my mother.

376
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,760
May God reward you.

377
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,120
They forgave her and
Molah Sahib took her.

378
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,240
Now justice has prevailed.

379
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,520
Praise the Lord.
God is Great!

380
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,160
Come on.

381
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,120
May God bring
hell to the Talibans.

382
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,760
They burnt our house,
our land,our garden.

383
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,120
We have
nothing left.

384
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,520
They arrested me and
the married me to this Molah.

385
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,360
They ruined my life.

386
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,960
I don't have a reason to
live.Oh God,please help me.

387
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,080
Look.At the beginning
we became refugees.

388
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,400
Afterwards,the Talibans took
my brother and killed him.

389
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,360
Then i was thrown to Molah.
I wish he dies.

390
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,920
At night i was painting my
hands with henna...

391
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,000
he forced me to run away
and marry him.

392
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:51,800
My life is black
and miserable.

393
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:57,360
I hate but
what can i do?

394
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,040
He took my life
the night we were married.

395
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:09,160
All my youth was destroyed
by that man.

396
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,000
Where is the girl?

397
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,400
I'll find hetmyself.

398
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,120
Come on!

399
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,280
Choose.
Look and choose.

400
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,960
You don't like these.

401
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,600
This one is for you.
It's yours.

402
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,760


403
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:38,440
