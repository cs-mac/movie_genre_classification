Argh!

3
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,749
(Thunder rumbles)

4
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,999
See the galanty show!

5
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,165
Only a penny!

6
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,749
A show for the family!

7
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,290
Full of pictures, both descriptive and humorous!

8
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,082
Only a penny!

9
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:32,624
Galanty show!

10
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,582
Pictures of every description in colour.

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:45,915
See John Guildford make his famous ride,
and only one penny!

12
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,540
lf you haven't got a penny,

13
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,707
a ha'penny will do.

14
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,374
lf you haven't got a ha'penny, God bless you.

15
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,915
Straight from London.

16
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,957
(Thunder and crack of lightning)

17
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,832
Good evening, miss.

18
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,415
l'm offering entertainment.

19
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,540
A show for the family.

20
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,999
Comical pictures
of every description in colour.

21
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,249
See.

22
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,957
Endless rollicking laughter.

23
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,415
Tell your master.

24
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,874
l can ask.

25
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,915
(Dog barking)

26
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:01,499
Roll up for the lantern show!
Only a penny!

27
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,915
You pay for the entertainment
but all the news is free!

28
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,707
North, east, west, south!

29
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,332
All the news is free!

30
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,999
(Tambourine rattling)

31
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,332
(Rattles and strikes tambourine)

32
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,790
(Violent striking of tambourine)

33
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,874
(Birdsong)

34
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,124
Morning, Jacob.

35
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,707
Who's this? Oh! l can see.

36
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,249
Who's this? l've seen that face somewhere.

37
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,790
l've seen that before. Who can it be, eh?
Who can it be?

38
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,624
You don't think l'm gonna drop you, do you?

39
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,749
Here we go, then.

40
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,665
Way-ee-ee.

41
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,790
Off you go, then.

42
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,540
Be coming just over in a moment. Bye-bye.

43
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,790
Bye.

44
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,957
(Laughs)

45
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,957
The rascal.

46
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,874
Children become you.

47
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,665
When can we have one of our own?

48
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,582
How can we manage?

49
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:55,707
Hm?

50
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,957
l know times are hard.

51
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,207
But l'm not getting any younger.

52
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,290
We are the most beautiful people
in the whole world.

53
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,624
lt's true.

54
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,457
Good morning, family. Good morning.

55
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,332
Good morning.

56
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,582
(Laughter in background)

57
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,415
Oh!

58
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,915
Ooh.

59
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,165
(Laughter)

60
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,749
WOMAN: Serves you right.

61
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,957
And he went off and got himself a rabbit.

62
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,999
And he brought it back and he ate it.

63
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,915
And that's it.

64
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,582
(Man chuckles)

65
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,457
WOMAN: Do you know, when l was younger,
l always had to sit between those two.

66
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,707
Nothing changes.

67
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,665
Let us say grace.

68
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,832
Dear Lord,

69
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:41,165
we humbly beseech thee to accept our gratitude
for this our daily bread.

70
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,874
Give us the goodness of heart to share
whatever we have.

71
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,874
Amen.

72
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,707
VlCAR: Proverbs 14.

73
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,790
ln all labour there is profit.

74
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:04,374
But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.

75
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,749
The poor is hated even of his own neighbour.

76
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,582
But the rich have many friends.

77
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,249
But in all labour there is profit.

78
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,415
And it beho?es us to accept our lot in life

79
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,207
and to work for our reward.

80
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,499
Let us never forget that our Lord
humbled himself for all our sakes

81
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,582
to be born of the wife of a carpenter

82
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,832
on this poor earth.

83
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,915
Let us strive to excel in the role we are born to,

84
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:52,374
remembering...
we are all beholden to our maker!

85
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,457
God the Father...

86
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,165
..in his infinite wisdom,

87
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,749
created large men and small,

88
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,165
white men and black,

89
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,749
rich men and poor,

90
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,707
wise men...

91
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,415
..and fools.

92
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,665
And we shall not dare to presume
to question his wisdom!

93
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,915
Hold fast to that which we know
and have learned to value -

94
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:32,165
the natural order of things,
tried and tested down the ages of man.

95
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:41,499
lt is hardly a chance that in all living things
there is law and order.

96
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,874
There are enemies of the Church,

97
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,207
dissenters,

98
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,582
who speak together blasphemously...

99
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,665
(Whispers)

100
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,749
..tampering with God's work.

101
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,207
(Whispering)

102
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,499
Be not drawn by the devil's smile.

103
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,415
(Man whispers) Let go of me.

104
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,915
(Pew door bangs)

105
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,124
Now let us... Let us talk of the...

106
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,207
Let us now sing hymn...

107
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,249
(Organ plays)

108
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,832
(Congregation stumbles over lyrics)

109
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,749
d We go to thee

110
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,040
d To thee...

111
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,290
(Another choir sings nearby)

112
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,707
(Choirs drown each other out)

113
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,915
(Second choir sings lively song)
d We'll win the day

114
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,957
d Though death and hell obstruct our way

115
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:41,082
d We only need to watch and pray

116
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,082
d And then we're sure to win the day

117
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,415
(Baby crying)

118
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,249
d Come all and one to glory now

119
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,499
d And in this world of sin and woe

120
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,790
d Forsake your sins without delay

121
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,707
d Believe and you shall win the day

122
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,124
d We'll win the day, we'll win the day

123
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,332
d Though death and hell obstruct our way

124
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,707
d We only need to watch and pray

125
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:20,915
d And then we're sure to win the day

126
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,957
l liked that.

127
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,082
And now...

128
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,332
we'll pray together.

129
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,540
Give us the vision, Lord,

130
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,290
to see past the narrow confines of the field.

131
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,457
To the great and infinite glory
of the world beyond.

132
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,707
Help us to stretch ourselves
to the full extent of our being...

133
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,874
..that we might be one with all men.

134
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,999
Neither master nor servant

135
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,124
before thine eyes.

136
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,249
Amen.

137
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,499
ALL: Amen.

138
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,957
Jesus has given us many blessings.

139
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,082
And one of these, my friends, is the smile.

140
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,582
l lo?e every new day.
But Sunday is the best of all.

141
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,124
For how good it is to see all of you
joining here together.

142
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,999
During the coming weeks,

143
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,499
we shall be calling upon
the services of my good brother James.

144
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,415
Thank you.

145
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,749
l would like to talk about comradeship,

146
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,832
about the Disciples who laid down their work
to follow in the path of truth.

147
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,499
l look forward to your good attendance.

148
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,874
Praise the Lord.

149
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,374
(Girl giggling)

150
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,374
No planning ahead would be complete

151
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,790
without calling upon our good friend
and neighbour Tom Stanfield. Tom.

152
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,374
As well as reading the Word of God,

153
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:01,165
l shall leave part of my time open for anyone
to approach me with a subject for discussion.

154
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,207
(Whispers)
- All our troubles are shared by Jesus.

155
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,540
So please come forward and don't be shy.

156
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:14,374
lt is worth bearing in mind
a grief shared is a smaller grief.

157
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,832
l see we have a stranger in our midst.

158
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,040
l'm glad you had the temerity to enter.

159
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,124
Now we know who trod the grass
these Sundays past.

160
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,457
Welcome, lad.

161
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,832
(Organ music)

162
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,082
Good morning. Good morning.

163
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,665
(Men talking nearby)

164
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,082
- Hello, John.
- George.

165
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,832
What were you doing in church and all?

166
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,082
(Low conversation)

167
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:17,249
(Knocking)

168

BRlDGET: George. Come in.

171
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,374
We thought it was the vicar.

172
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,499
l wouldn't trust the vicar with a fart.

173
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,957
Forgive me, my dear chap. l had no idea
we had the pleasure of your company.

174
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,332
John.

175

176

My dear friends.

177
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,290
Your labour is more important
than the Sabbath day?

178
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,290
We all need a day of rest.

179
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,790
Maybe your brother has the right idea.

180
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,582
Though it pains me to admit it.

181
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,457
l wish times were different, George...

182
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,999
..and we could have back
the respect we give to others.

183
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,582
lf you'll forgive me, then, George.

184
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,999
Mr Frampton demands
they be sent in this very week.

185
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,290
They are a work of great beauty.

186
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,874
When we create with our hands such harmony,

187

God is truly present.

190
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,790
Why don't you ask for more payment?

191
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,832
Because, George, if they don't like it,
they'll find someone else.

192
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,207
Yes.

193
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,249

Oh, dear.

Nor do we wish to take yourself
too obviously to task.

But, as l understand the alphabet...

202

(Mocking posh accent) ..do not the 'l' in 'Brine'
precede the 'O' in 'Brown'?

Do you call father or son?

l think there must be some mistake.

219
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,582
We should be getting nine shillings.

220
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:36,499
- Not eight.
- There's been no mistake, Mr Stanfield.

221
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,374
You must take it or leave it.

- They're a bargain at twice the price.

Shall we go blackberry picking?

247
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:47,499
A bit of blackberry picking in the woods there?
What do you say?

248
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:50,915
What you do with blackberries,
you squash 'em all up...

249

..you rub them all over your face,

250

Help him to accept things as they are.
Don't let him question things.

to your trying to up the price a bit?

You see, if we get
something for nothing in this world,

285
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,040
it means someone else may have to suffer.

Now, that's not a good thing, is it?

in the garden! Ha-ha-ha!

333
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,999
Roll up, Sergeant Bell's Raree Show!

334
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,124
Only a penny to see the view.

335
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:19,790
See Nelson being defeated
at the Battle of Waterloo.

336
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:23,540
The Raree Show's the thing
for all the lads and the lasses,

337
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:27,957
but be careful, thou young titches,
not to breathe on the glasses.

338
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,207
d Lively fiddle and whistle

339
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,457
(Chatter and laughter)

340
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,249
John. John.

341
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,707
(Grunts)

342
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,624
FOREMAN: Ford!

343
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,415
Grey.

344
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,915
Hammett.

345
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,207
Father. Father.

346
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,457
- Leave me alone, son. Leave me alone!
- Father.

347
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:39,707
l'm tired!

348
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,874
(Low conversations)

349
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,124
- We've talked about this before.
- But we've got the advantage now.

350
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:16,582
MAN lN BACKGROUND:
l'm not saying we should go against the law.

351
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,082
l'm saying we've had enough of all this.

352
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,499
No!

353
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,999
(Woman screams in agony)

354
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,624
Tom!

355
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,874
Argh!

356
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,957
JOHN: lf mother was alive
to see what you've become!

357
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:17,749
JAMES: Leave our mother out of this.
- There's such a thing as responsibility.

358
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:22,124
JAMES: What's so responsible about fathering
a child when you can't make ends meet?

359
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,249
Who do you think you are telling me what to do?

360
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,374
Your brother, that's who.

361
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,999
My first loyalty is to Bridget and the baby.

362
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:32,082
You want me out of the way now. ls that it?

363
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:37,249
- That's a good idea. There's the road.
- l'm boss in my life, not you or anyone else.

364
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:40,582
l'll decide what l want to do
where and when l want to do it.

365
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,374
That bloody baby has gone right to your head.

366
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,040
(Baby stirs)

367
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,332
(Baby grizzles)

368
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,415
Shh.

369
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,374
(Sheep bleating)

370
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,332
What on earth is it?

371
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,749
lt's a skeleton, Mrs Wetham.

372
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,665
But what's it for?

373
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,915
lt's a design for a banner.

374
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,707
- For a union.
- Union?

375
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,749
A society of friends.

376
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,374
lt's a most unusual request.

377
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:11,082
- We'll pay a fair price.
- l'll speak with my husband.

378
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,665
MAN: Mr Loveless.

379
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,874
Good day.

380
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,207
Well, well, well,

381
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,957
what brings you into town?

382
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:44,207
l thought l detected a...Tolpiddle hereabouts.

383
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:51,040
So you're a lover of prints.
Who would have guessed it?

384
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,290
l like to extend my mind whenever l can.

385
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:59,290
How rewarding that one who uses his hands...
might also use his mind.

386
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:06,499
An antidote to the sloth of countrifying,
Mr Frampton.

387
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:11,499
The problem, Mr Loveless, is to match it.

388
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:18,665
And having matched it,
to use both hand and mind

389
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,624
to exert it to some use.

390
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,249
For a well-balanced appetite,

391
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:29,832
we must satisfy all our parts.

392
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,082
Eh, Mr Loveless?

393
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:40,165
But it is sad to see folk who are...
blind to their own interests.

394
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,290
Folk are not blind, sir.

395
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,457
- But it is those that master us that cannot see.
- Explain yourself, Loveless.

396
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,207
Here, for instance.

397
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,249
Can you see this, sir?

398
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:01,499
Yes.

399
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,249
Can you see it now?

400
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,082
No.

401
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,249
What prevents you seeing it?

402
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,374
The silver, of course.

403
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,624
That's just it.

404
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,790
Sir.

405
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,457
GEORGE: Mr Pitt.

406
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:36,249
- George Loveless.
- lt's very kind of you to meet me, sir.

407
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:40,040
- l thought we'd take a ride out of town.
- Thank you, sir.

408
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,415
(Wind blusters)

409
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,874
(Trumpet fanfare)

410
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,040
(Gunfire)

411
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:39,790
(Shouts angrily under cacophony)

412
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,332
(Trumpet, drumming, xylophone)

413
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:25,957
Do you want to buy a ticket to see the show, sir?

414
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,082
None of us needs to bother with that.

415
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:31,249
We'll be having a battle of our own
soon enough. For nowt.

416
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:36,415
My dear sir, l think you underestimate
the novelty of this unique exhibition.

417
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,915
A diorama is the highest achievement
of human ingenuity,

418
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:46,665
delineating the most interesting parts of
the world in varying aspects of light and shade.

419
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:50,082
How about a trip
to the other side of the world tomorrow?

420
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,082
What you offer, sir, is illusion.

421
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,165
lt's the real world l'd like to see.

422
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,374
ln our short lives we move about so little...

423
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,832
..see so little.

424
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,832
Yes.

425
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:15,207
l'd like to travel one day.

426
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:20,790
Hello, George.

427
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,290
You're gonna have 25 children.

428
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,457
lf you spent less time thinking about yourself
and more time helping others.

429
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,332
l mean it.

430
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,582
For your own good.
Getting on with a job never hurt no-one.

431
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,374
Are you getting paid for it?

432
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,415
ls he?

433
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,540
Only a fool does something for nothing.

434
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:50,082
Those men paid a shilling out of their
hard-earned money to join the union.

435
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,707
lf you and others like you were to join...

436
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,749
He believes in what he's doing.

437
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,165
Don't worry about me.

438
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,999
l can look after myself.

439
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,624
(Gentle knocking)

440
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:39,207
MAN: Who comes here to disturb
the peace and harmony

441
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,457
of this our most worthy and honourable order?

442
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,874
l'm a brother with strangers.

443
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:47,832
We wish to be admitted into this,
your most worthy and honourable order.

444
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,999
Most worthy brothers,
another stands at the door with strangers

445
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:55,332
who wish to be admitted into this,
our most worthy and honourable order...

446
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,582
OLD TOM: Let them enter.

447
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,082
(Floorboard creaks)

448
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,207
(Muffled men's voices)

449
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,957
Dear God, help them.

450
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,082
(Soft footsteps upstairs)

451
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,332
Strangers within our secret walls,

452
01:05:56,416 --> 01:06:04,874
we have admitted you
hoping you will prove honest, faithful and true.

453
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:08,415
lf you cannot keep the secrets we require,

454
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,540
go hence,

455
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,790
you are at liberty to retire.

456
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,790
Are your motives pure?

457
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,332
Yes.

458
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:27,290
Then amongst us you will shortly be
entitled to the endearing name of 'brother'.

459
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,957
And what you hear or see here done,

460
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:34,540
you must not disclose to any other.

461
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:39,415
We are uniting to cultivate friendship,

462
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:42,415
as well as to protect our trade,

463
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:47,874
and due respect must to all our laws be paid.

464
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,665
Are your motives pure?

465
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,915
Yes.

466
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,207
Give the strangers sight.

467
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,540
Strangers,

468
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:15,790
mark well this shadow...

469
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,832
..which you see.

470
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,999
lt is a faithful emblem...

471
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,415
of man's destiny.

472
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,624
Strangers,

473
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,874
you are welcome.

474
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,999
And if you prove sincere,

475
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,332
you'll not repent your pains and labour here.

476
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:57,290
We have one common interest,

477
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:00,415
and one common soul,

478
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:06,540
which should by virtue
guide and actuate the whole.

479
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:16,790
The design of this, our order, is love and unity,

480
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:20,874
with self protection
founded on the laws of equity.

481
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:25,165
And when you have
our mystic rites gone through,

482
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,832
our secrets all will be disclosed to you.

483
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,624
Edward Legg, do you swear to this alliance?

484
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,707
EDWARD: I swear.

485
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:06,665
GEORGE: And now,
shouldst thou ever pro?e deceitful,

486
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,832
remember thine end.

487
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,415
Remember.

488
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:27,540
VICAR: l like to think of myself
as being a friend to all men.

489
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:36,457
lndeed it's flattering
that you should ask me to intervene, but...

490
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:43,957
..don't you think
you've got things slightly out of proportion?

491
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,165
Difficult times, Vicar.

492
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,832
Mr Frampton...

493
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,290
..has not been ungenerous.

494
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:58,874
As you can see.

495
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:21,082
Mr Frampton says for you
to make yourselves comfortable.

496
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,582
(Men conversing within)

497
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,415
(Muffled men's voices)

498
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:09,207
(Men laugh in another room)

499
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:39,165
(Applause in another room)

500
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,415
(Laughter)

501
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,082
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

502
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,790
George, how very nice to see you.

503
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,582
l do hope we haven't kept you waiting.

504
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:02,749
We had no idea of the time.
Please accept my apologies.

505
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:04,874
Gentlemen, please...

506
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,124
sit down.

507
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,332
FRAMPTON: Please sit down.

508
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:31,290
Well, gentlemen,
how good it is to see you all here.

509
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:36,457
l must claim, in all modesty, to be a fair man.

510
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:41,165
Mr Frampton, my friends asked me to act
as independent spokesman on their behalf.

511
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,290
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

512
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:46,457
l see no reason to detain you
longer than is necessary.

513
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,582
The vicar has put your case.

514
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,915
And we must admire his ability to see...

515
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,457
both sides of the coin.

516
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:56,290
(Chuckles)

517
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,082
We felt the time has come...

518
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:13,374
Yes, of course you did.
We have your best interests at heart.

519
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:19,874
lt's just that...well, we don't know where we are
what with the wages going down week by week.

520
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,749
You're quite right. There's no question of that.

521
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:28,665
But in spite of the circumstances, and with,
if l might add, a fervent hope for the future,

522
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:32,499
an extra shilling will be granted.

523
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,624
Are you saying eight shillings?

524
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,874
Eight!

525
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,332
Have you any more questions, gentlemen?

526
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:10,040
(Man belches)

527
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:26,624
Have away, Nelly.

528
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:33,749
(Bells ring at various pitches)

529
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,624
Mr Frampton told me to give this to you.

530
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,790
EDWARD: Thank you very much, miss.
That's very kind of you.

531
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,874
Thank you very much, miss. Thank you.

532
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,957
That's all right, Mr Legg.

533
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,749
FOREMAN: Hammett.

534
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:19,124
Legg.

535
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,374
Look.

536
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:29,624
Loveless.

537
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:53,290
Come on, George.

538
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,540
One must eat to live.

539
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,999
Sing for us, Elvi.

540
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,874
l'll sing for you. Come on, Briney.

541
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:13,124
We'll sing for 'em.

542
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:19,332
d When l was just a beardless boy
no more than six years old

543
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,040
d l used to go akeeping crows
in rain and wind and cold

544
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,624
d Oh, well do l remember now
as well as it can be

545
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:28,749
d My little house...

546
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:32,249
d ..thatched in the marsh agin the sea

547
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:35,457

548
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:38,749

549
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,665
d lf you stop here twill cost you dear

550
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:43,082
d l'll kill you dead as mutton

551
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,707
(Laughter and applause)

552
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,957
(Whispers)

553
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,874
Shh.

554
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:03,665
d lt's fare thee well, cold winter

555
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:08,499
d And fare thee well, cold frost

556
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:12,582
d Nothing have l gained

557
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:17,582
d But my true love l've lost

558
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:21,665
d l'll sing and l'll be merry

559
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:26,165
d While a caution do l see

560
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:30,790
d And l'll rest me when l'm weary

561
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:35,582
d Let him go, farewell he

562
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:40,665
d To half a pound of reason

563
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:44,832
d Take a half a grain of sense

564
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,624
d A small sprig of time

565
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:53,040
d And as much of prudence

566
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:57,165
d And mix them up together

567
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:01,582
d As you may plainly see

568
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:06,582

569
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:12,124
d Let him go, farewell he

570
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,082
(Giggles)

571
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,540
Poor Legg.

572
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,874
(Hammering)

573
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,582
Who's the next one
that we see in our galanty show?

574
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,957
Why, it's three little soldier boys
standing in a row.

575
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:16,207
Three little soldier boys.

576
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:18,332
Standing at the battle.

577
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,582
They hear the horses gallop.

578
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,790
They hear the sabres rattle.

579
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:29,499
Soon they'll wish that they were
safely tucked up in their beds.

580
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:31,624
Because...bang goes the cannon!

581
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:34,165
And off comes their heads!

582
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,790
l'm a changed man, George.

583
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,832
A reformed one.

584
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,165
You swept the cobwebs out of my brain.

585
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:05,832
l shall never forget Tolpiddle.

586
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,040
Go, then,

587
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:13,582
and make a union of lanternists.

588
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,040
See?

589
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,499
The heavens!

590
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,290
Remember us!

591
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,415
Remember!

592
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,665
(Pounding on door)

593
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:52,040
George Loveless?

594
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,582
Yes.

595
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,707
You're all right.

596
01:24:57,333 --> 01:25:01,415
PlTT: These Iabourers -
l use the word with the utmost respect -

597
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:03,999
are worthy and honourable men.

598
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,832
l've met George Loveless on several occasions.

599
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,749
He is an honest man.
He told me the men work hard.

600
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:16,040
These men have the right to a decent wage
for a decent job well done.

601
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,332
Beyond this county,

602
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,749
the wage of half a pound is tolerated.

603
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:25,332
The solution is simple.

604
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:31,165
A magistrate should fix the sum by law
as has always been the custom.

605
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:33,290
l am a magistrate,

606
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:37,249
Chairman of the Bench
and a member of the Grand Jury.

607
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:42,582
Vicar, l understand that you were
an advocate for the Tolpiddle men.

608
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:48,040
And that you were present when Mr Frampton
agreed to rectify their grievances.

609
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:51,124
Were they not promised an extra shilling?

610
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:59,832
Well?

611
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:03,290
(Coughs)

612
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,415
No.

613
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,415
No such promise was made.

614
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,540
Are you quite sure?

615
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:12,665
He is a man of God!

616
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:16,374
Mr Pitt, please don't make
such a fool of yourself!

617
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:19,207
The men's wages are neither here nor there.

618
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:22,040
They were engaged in secret meetings,

619
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,165
administering illegal oaths,

620
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,707
taking the law into their own hands,
and this must stop!

621
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:32,207
PITT: We are talking about
a union of farm labourers.

622
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:36,624
Which may be offensive to some
but is no longer against the law.

623
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:40,540
All this nonsense about illegal oaths.
lt's a trumped-up charge.

624
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,665
lt's on the statute book,

625
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,707
Mr Pitt.

626
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,832
You're a magistrate.

627
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,915
l will tell you in the strictest confidence,

628
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:53,790
l have it from no less a person
than the Home Sec...

629
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:57,082
On the highest authority.

630
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:00,790
This is the best way to proceed.

631
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:04,665
We have followed every letter of the law.
Cautions were posted.

632
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:11,415
Yes, two days before their arrest.
For an offence alleged as many months before.

633
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:14,832
The men were charged before
Charles Wollaston.

634
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,540
Your brother.

635
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,457
Half-brother!

636
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:20,374
Actually.

637
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:23,665
William Ponsonby committed them
for trial at the assizes.

638
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,624
- The Home Secretary's brother.
- Brother-in-law!

639
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:29,957
Actually.

640
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:34,832
And Judge Williams
will hear the trial in this very court.

641
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,874
Judge Williams? Herod's brother.

642
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:39,790
Whereas...

643
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:43,332
Yes, and the King's brother.
He also administers illegal oaths.

644
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,415
As the Grandmaster of the Orange Lodge.

645
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,790
One law for the rich and another for the poor.

646
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:53,499
The whole thing is a monstrous game,
a political box of tricks,

647
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:56,290
with the cards stacked against innocent men.

648
01:27:57,333 --> 01:28:00,540
But there's one card left to be played.
Public opinion.

649
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:04,082
You'd be well advised
to forget George Lovelace.

650
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:06,207
And his kind.

651
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,457
No-one wants to know them!

652
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,540
And no-one will remember them!

653
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,790
l'm terribly sorry.

654
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,332
l'm afraid there's not much room.

655
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,457
Ah... Oh, dear.

656
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,582
lf you... Yes.

657
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,999
That's all. l'm afraid the court is full.

658
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:29,332
l'm terribly sorry, but the court is full.

659
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:50,415
(Baby cries)

660
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:46,999
(Whispering)

661
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:58,665
(Whispering continues)

662
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,665
(Muttering)

663
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:49,540
(Weeping in background)

664
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:54,332
What does trans...tr...

665
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,457
Transportation.

666
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:58,707
..mean?

667
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,915
lt means they're going
a long way away on a boat.

668
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:16,624
Seven years is a long time.

669
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:20,999
l'm seven, aren't l?

670
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:04,249
(Dog growling softly)

671
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:07,457
Mr Frampton is not at home.

672
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,207
When will he be back?

673
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,707
l don't know.

674
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,624
How l would love to visit Botany Bay.

675
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,915
Have you read Cook?

676
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,999
Readin' is for the leisured class.

677
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,832
But when it falls into the wrong hands,

678
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,082
it is a corrupter of morals.

679
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:06,665
Strange chance that rabble-rouser Loveless
falling ill, what.

680
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:11,957
Can't exercise his evil powers o?er
those gullible friends of his any more.

681
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:19,165
Next thing we know, the wives
are going to be asking for parish relief.

682
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:25,207
No family is entitled to relief if they can afford
to pay a shilling to join a union.

683
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:28,874
Their leaders are simply
feathering their own nests.

684
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:32,957
l wonder if he really is the ringleader.
Whether there aren't others, what.

685
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:37,374
Some shadow puppet master up in London
manipulating him with rods.

686
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:39,624
Pass.

687
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,457
ln some strange way,

688
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,707
l can't help respecting him.

689
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:52,457
l can't quite put my finger on it.

690
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,874
When all was lost,

691
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:02,749
his eyes looked with such uncanniness.

692
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,874
Almost as if he had won.

693
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,290
Hurry along, Frampton.

694
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,707
Good night, gentlemen.

695
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,207
Bad books.

696
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:34,540
lt's not the books that's bad, my cherub.

697
01:36:50,250 --> 01:37:09,540
(Chains rattling)

1
01:39:34,893 --> 01:39:36,975
Where's it coming from?

2
01:39:38,643 --> 01:39:43,017
I don't want anything that doesn't belong to me.
I couldn't touch it.

3
01:39:43,892 --> 01:39:46,599
Trust him, Betsy.

4
01:39:48,934 --> 01:39:51,933
It won't make up for what's happened.
But it'll help.

5
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:56,891
It comes from London. People of all walks of life
are taking up our cause.

6
01:39:57,059 --> 01:40:00,181
Calling themselves
the London-Dorchester Committee.

7
01:40:00,348 --> 01:40:04,722
They've started a petition.
Meetings are being called all over the country.

8
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,847
Questions in Parliament.

9
01:40:07,015 --> 01:40:10,431
They asked me to see
that you and the children don't go wanting.

10
01:40:12,182 --> 01:40:14,139
They want you to have it.

11
01:40:14,307 --> 01:40:16,805
It's a gift and it'll come every week.

12
01:40:17,889 --> 01:40:19,971
The Lord be praised.

13
01:40:28,264 --> 01:40:30,221
Hetty...

14
01:40:30,389 --> 01:40:32,470
Hetty!

15
01:40:35,721 --> 01:40:37,804
Oh, people are good.

16
01:41:35,717 --> 01:41:37,800
Are you up to walking, sir?

17
01:41:48,007 --> 01:41:50,089
I'm not likely to outdo you.

18
01:41:51,174 --> 01:41:54,672
We're having to bash through the town.
Let me remove them.

19
01:42:06,548 --> 01:42:08,422
It's all right.

20
01:42:09,381 --> 01:42:11,462
I'm not ashamed.

21
01:42:28,503 --> 01:42:31,335
We have injured no man's reputation,

22
01:42:31,503 --> 01:42:33,460
character,

23
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:35,585
person,

24
01:42:35,753 --> 01:42:37,835
or property.

25
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,585
We were uniting together to preserve ourselves,

26
01:42:41,753 --> 01:42:43,460
our wives,

27
01:42:43,628 --> 01:42:45,709
and our children...

28
01:42:46,752 --> 01:42:49,251
.. from utter degradation and starvation.

29
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:43,664
(Horse-drawn vehicle passing)

30
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:35,493
'God is our guide.

31
01:44:36,577 --> 01:44:38,535
From field, from wave,

32
01:44:38,702 --> 01:44:41,784
from plough, from anvil,

33
01:44:41,951 --> 01:44:44,034
and from loom.

34
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,825
We come, our country's rights to save,

35
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,117
and speak the tyrant faction's doom.

36
01:44:54,868 --> 01:44:58,407
We raise the watchword "liberty".

37
01:44:59,449 --> 01:45:03,907
We will, we will, we will be free. '

38

No swords we draw.

40
01:45:12,657 --> 01:45:19,156
We kindle not wars, battle fires.

41
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,031
By reason, union, justice,

42
01:45:24,198 --> 01:45:26,281
laws,

43
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:31,071
we claim the birthright of our sires.

44
01:45:32,364 --> 01:45:34,321
We raise the watchword "liberty".

45
01:45:34,489 --> 01:45:38,738
We will, we will, we will be free. '

46
01:45:46,112 --> 01:45:48,194
He meant this for you.

47
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:51,236
And others like you.

48
01:45:51,404 --> 01:45:53,486
Not me.

49
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:57,694
When you've done with it, don't throw it away.

50
01:45:58,779 --> 01:46:00,861
Let it go from hand to hand.

51
01:46:02,194 --> 01:46:04,902
My task is to teach the members of my class...

52
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:11,985
.. that injustice cannot be allowed
to go unchallenged.

53
01:46:19,693 --> 01:46:21,776
Hello, Betsy.

54
01:47:40,686 --> 01:47:45,977
GEORGE: I thank you, my dear wife,
for the kind attention you've ever paid me.

55
01:47:47,186 --> 01:47:49,269
And you may safely rely on it,

56
01:47:50,436 --> 01:47:52,060
that as long as I live,

57
01:47:52,811 --> 01:47:56,019
it will be my constant endeavour
to return that kindness

58
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,268
in every possible way.

59
01:47:59,352 --> 01:48:02,809
And that I shall never forget
the promise made at the altar.

60
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:07,143
And though we may part awhile,

61
01:48:08,019 --> 01:48:10,559
I shall consider myself
under the same obligations

62
01:48:10,727 --> 01:48:13,224
as though living in your immediate presence.

63
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:18,141
Be satisfied, my dear, on my account.

64
01:48:19,183 --> 01:48:21,432
Depend upon it.

65
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,682
It will work together for good...

66
01:48:24,725 --> 01:48:26,807
.. and we shall yet rejoice together.

67
01:48:29,974 --> 01:48:32,056
I shall do well.

68
01:48:32,974 --> 01:48:35,765
For he who is the lord of the wind and waves...

69
01:48:36,849 --> 01:48:38,806
.. will be my support...

70
01:48:38,974 --> 01:48:41,056
in life...

71
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:44,140
.. and death.

72
01:50:33,132 --> 01:50:36,381
For just one penny,
you can put the world in your pocket.

73
01:50:39,298 --> 01:50:41,379
Absolutely charming thing.

74
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,504
- Nice journey, Captain.
- A profitable one.

75
01:50:46,713 --> 01:50:49,212
A pound a head it pays to keep the scum alive.

76
01:50:52,338 --> 01:50:53,879
British?

77
01:50:54,046 --> 01:50:56,129
Only the very best, my dear sir.

78
01:51:04,879 --> 01:51:06,044
Done.

79
01:51:06,212 --> 01:51:07,753
(Chuckles)

80
01:51:08,837 --> 01:51:10,919
(Piper plays in distance)

81
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:17,918
d Barnacle Bill

82
01:51:26,294 --> 01:51:28,377
(Men shout encouragement)

83
01:51:35,376 --> 01:51:37,333
Come on, more!

84
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:39,458
Into line, you lot.

85
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:41,708
Come on!

86
01:51:44,042 --> 01:51:46,374
Name? Speak up, man.

87
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:48,207
Neilson.

88
01:51:56,458 --> 01:51:58,624
OFFICER: Can we have a few more along?

89
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,831
Hurry it up!

90
01:52:07,415 --> 01:52:08,414
Name?

91
01:52:08,582 --> 01:52:10,248
Blotters.

92
01:52:14,249 --> 01:52:15,789
Name?

93
01:52:15,957 --> 01:52:18,039
Loveless.

94
01:52:24,372 --> 01:52:26,454
(Fly buzzing)

95
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:33,579
Next.

96
01:52:34,663 --> 01:52:36,786
- Where do I go?
- It's all there.

97
01:52:38,496 --> 01:52:41,620
OFFICER: Can we have a few more along,
please?

98
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:44,286
Yes, but...

99
01:52:44,454 --> 01:52:46,411
where is it?

100
01:52:46,579 --> 01:52:48,661
That's for you to find out.

101
01:52:49,412 --> 01:52:50,953
Next.

102
01:52:51,121 --> 01:52:53,202
(Kookaburra laughs)

103
01:53:02,953 --> 01:53:04,910
About 300 miles.

104
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:08,160
It should take you nine days,
a strong fellow like you.

105
01:53:08,328 --> 01:53:11,200
Don't eat your rations all at once or you'll starve.

106
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,450
That way.

107
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,157
BOY: Hey, mister!

108
01:53:31,325 --> 01:53:33,282
Could you help me?

109
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:35,532
I don't know which way to go.

110
01:53:44,366 --> 01:53:46,323
Take it.

111
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:54,406
Ta.

112
01:54:03,905 --> 01:54:04,946
Look.

113
01:54:05,655 --> 01:54:07,738
'C' stands for 'convict'.

114
01:54:08,697 --> 01:54:11,529
No... 'comrades'.

115
01:54:18,196 --> 01:54:20,153
What's your name?

116
01:54:20,321 --> 01:54:22,278
Charlie.

117
01:54:22,446 --> 01:54:24,403
Well, there you are, you see.

118
01:54:24,571 --> 01:54:26,528
Things are more than they appear.

119
01:54:26,696 --> 01:54:28,653
What's yours?

120
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:30,777
Christopher.

121
01:54:30,945 --> 01:54:32,819
No, it isn't.

122
01:54:33,987 --> 01:54:35,444
(Bird squawks)

123
01:54:40,528 --> 01:54:42,194
Men are bad.

124
01:54:42,362 --> 01:54:44,361
Are you bad?

125
01:54:46,945 --> 01:54:49,025
So, not all men are bad.

126
01:54:50,568 --> 01:54:52,525
The truth is...

127
01:54:52,693 --> 01:54:54,775
that men are born good.

128
01:54:57,568 --> 01:54:59,650
Tell me...

129
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:02,900
.. if we planted apples in this field,

130
01:55:03,068 --> 01:55:05,024
and the fruit grew rich and strong,

131
01:55:05,192 --> 01:55:07,149
and we planted apples in that field

132
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:09,774
and the fruit didn't grow rich and strong...

133
01:55:09,942 --> 01:55:11,899
what's to blame?

134
01:55:12,067 --> 01:55:13,399
Hm?

135
01:55:13,567 --> 01:55:14,899
Well, go on.

136
01:55:15,067 --> 01:55:17,774
The apples what didn't come out right,
of course.

137
01:55:17,942 --> 01:55:19,274
No.

138
01:55:19,442 --> 01:55:22,857
We could have planted them here,
they'd have been all right.

139
01:55:23,024 --> 01:55:25,940
Some of them would have come out all right,
anyway.

140
01:55:26,858 --> 01:55:28,315
True.

141
01:55:29,274 --> 01:55:31,773
Some would survive in spite of everything.

142
01:55:34,816 --> 01:55:36,980
But we want them all to grow, don't we?

143
01:55:37,981 --> 01:55:40,021
You sound like a preacher.

144
01:55:40,189 --> 01:55:42,146
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

145
01:55:42,314 --> 01:55:44,188
It's OK.

146
01:55:44,897 --> 01:55:46,980
You don't look like one.

147
01:55:51,981 --> 01:55:54,062
(Horse's hooves approaching)

148
01:55:55,396 --> 01:55:57,354
Wait there. Don't move.

149
01:55:57,521 --> 01:55:59,604
We might be in luck here.

150
01:56:02,605 --> 01:56:03,520
Whoa!

151
01:56:03,688 --> 01:56:06,437
Sir! Whoa!

152
01:56:10,187 --> 01:56:12,269
I wonder if I might ask you a favour.

153
01:56:23,562 --> 01:56:25,311
We've got some papers.

154
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:29,434
It's got a place name on it, but I don't know
because I'm new round here myself.

155
01:56:29,602 --> 01:56:31,142
I wonder if you could help him or...

156
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:33,392
if you know where that is.

157
01:56:37,893 --> 01:56:40,684
Charlie, come here, quick!

158
01:56:53,684 --> 01:56:55,641
Right, get him up.

159
01:56:55,809 --> 01:56:58,433
Go on, Charlie, quickly. You're in luck, lad.

160
01:57:00,433 --> 01:57:01,974
Come on.

161
01:57:05,558 --> 01:57:07,307
Hold on.

162
01:57:07,475 --> 01:57:09,557
Fetch his pack, then.

163
01:57:17,223 --> 01:57:19,263
- Here you are, boy.
- Put it over your head.

164
01:57:19,431 --> 01:57:21,680
Thank you, ma'am. Bless you, boy.

165
01:58:15,094 --> 01:58:17,051
For what we're about to receive,

166
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:19,301
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

167
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:21,800
Amen.

168
01:59:50,752 --> 01:59:52,085
We will...

169
01:59:52,252 --> 01:59:54,335
(Voice echoes several times)

170
01:59:57,669 --> 01:59:59,625
.. be free!

171
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:01,875
(Echoing)

172
02:00:07,126 --> 02:00:09,084
We will be free!

173
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:11,334
(Echoing)

174
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:18,166
(Insects chirrup and frogs croak)

175
02:00:23,459 --> 02:00:25,541
(Dingoes howl in distance)

176
02:00:48,248 --> 02:00:51,288
One, two! One, two!

177
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,871
Keep together, you!

178
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:55,746
One, two! One, two!

179
02:00:55,914 --> 02:00:59,621
One! Come on, you lazy shower of shits!

180
02:01:00,081 --> 02:01:01,830
Put some muscle into that.

181
02:01:01,997 --> 02:01:04,080
You want my boot up your arsehole?

182
02:01:04,622 --> 02:01:07,579
One, two! One, two!

183
02:01:07,746 --> 02:01:09,704
One, two!

184
02:01:09,871 --> 02:01:11,954
(Clattering of tools)

185
02:01:17,913 --> 02:01:19,995
If I catch any man shirking...

186
02:01:27,911 --> 02:01:29,868
And don't look at me like that.

187
02:01:30,036 --> 02:01:32,660
You'll be eating your own shit for breakfast.

188
02:01:34,578 --> 02:01:36,452
(Mutters)

189
02:01:39,452 --> 02:01:41,409
Stay. Stay, boy.

190
02:01:41,577 --> 02:01:43,451
Stay.

191
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:48,159
Take it nice. There's a good boy. Take it nice.

192
02:01:48,327 --> 02:01:50,284
Come on, take it nice.

193
02:01:50,452 --> 02:01:52,909
Take it nice. Come on, take it nice.

194
02:01:53,077 --> 02:01:55,033
Take it... Aagh, you bastard!

195
02:01:55,201 --> 02:01:56,700
Bite me, would you?

196
02:01:56,867 --> 02:01:58,533
Bite me, you bastard?

197
02:02:03,992 --> 02:02:06,658
If I ever meet up with him back home,

198
02:02:07,409 --> 02:02:09,575
I'll show him where my foot will roam.

199
02:02:10,201 --> 02:02:12,281
It won't be where it ought to be,

200
02:02:13,282 --> 02:02:16,073
but up his arse and all for free.

201
02:02:22,449 --> 02:02:24,531
Keep up with us, Brine.

202
02:02:27,281 --> 02:02:29,863
Don't let this bastard road be our memorial.

203
02:03:06,653 --> 02:03:12,985
Water!

204
02:03:28,444 --> 02:03:30,109
Who shouted?

205
02:03:33,859 --> 02:03:35,567
He needs his boots.

206
02:03:40,901 --> 02:03:42,983
He says somebody stole 'em.

207
02:03:53,482 --> 02:03:55,565
Let him steal another pair.

208
02:04:10,231 --> 02:04:12,314
(Harmonica plays mournful tune)

209
02:05:02,394 --> 02:05:04,476
Are you all right there?

210
02:05:13,268 --> 02:05:15,350
(Drunken laughter)

211
02:05:22,601 --> 02:05:24,184
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

212
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:26,017
- Do you love me?
- What do you think?

213
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:29,015
- Do you? 'Cos I love you.
- You're a sight, mate.

214
02:05:29,183 --> 02:05:31,265
(Woman laughs)

215
02:05:41,349 --> 02:05:42,890
(Man shouts)

216
02:05:54,265 --> 02:05:56,222
You remind me of Ned Ludd.

217
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:58,472
Who was he?

218
02:05:59,223 --> 02:06:02,013
He became a she
went he went machine-breaking.

219
02:06:06,681 --> 02:06:08,763
(Man and woman bickering)

220
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:28,303
(Coins jangle)

221
02:06:34,803 --> 02:06:37,635
Ah... like a nice time, Bertie?

222
02:06:37,803 --> 02:06:39,760
(Chuckles)

223
02:06:39,928 --> 02:06:41,468
Huh?

224
02:06:41,636 --> 02:06:43,552
(Laughs drunkenly)

225
02:06:43,719 --> 02:06:45,927
There's not a man among you. (Cackles)

226
02:06:50,552 --> 02:06:52,634
Whatever you do, don't do it alone.

227
02:06:53,927 --> 02:06:56,134
One man is nothing. I've learned that.

228
02:06:57,218 --> 02:06:59,301
We're here to help each other.

229
02:07:06,427 --> 02:07:08,507
Go to sleep.

230
02:07:27,757 --> 02:07:28,798
Wait.

231
02:07:34,257 --> 02:07:36,339
How much?

232
02:07:45,214 --> 02:07:47,297
Too much.

233
02:08:06,837 --> 02:08:08,920
(Cicadas singing)

234
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:14,752
(Grunts)

235
02:08:55,208 --> 02:08:57,291
Do you not like to be entertained?

236
02:09:20,331 --> 02:09:21,747
Hagh! Hagh! Hagh!

237
02:09:21,915 --> 02:09:24,664
Hagh! Hagh! Hagh! Hagh! Hagh!

238
02:09:25,790 --> 02:09:27,872
(Chuckles cockily)

239
02:09:30,998 --> 02:09:32,664
Yargh!

240
02:09:46,038 --> 02:09:47,995
What's this? What's this, eh?

241
02:09:48,163 --> 02:09:50,120
What's this?

242
02:09:50,288 --> 02:09:59,994
Look what I've got for you.

243
02:10:10,577 --> 02:10:12,243
Soldier.

244
02:10:14,952 --> 02:10:17,743
Come on, sweetie, come on. That's it. That's it.

245
02:10:49,741 --> 02:10:51,698
That's my boy.

246
02:10:51,866 --> 02:10:53,157
That's it.

247
02:11:01,698 --> 02:11:02,614
(Mouths)

248
02:11:02,782 --> 02:11:05,156
Good dog! Good boy, good soldier.

249
02:11:05,323 --> 02:11:06,947
Good soldier.

250
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:53,521
If you dig any deeper, you'll reach England.

251
02:12:54,605 --> 02:12:56,187
(Laughs)

252
02:13:07,063 --> 02:13:09,145
MAN: You there!

253
02:13:16,604 --> 02:13:18,478
Yes, you!

254
02:13:19,396 --> 02:13:22,061
Not you, you imbecile!

255
02:13:22,854 --> 02:13:25,560
Don't they understand the plain English?

256
02:13:29,895 --> 02:13:32,644
Our Father, which art in heaven

257
02:13:34,186 --> 02:13:36,144
Hallowed be Thy name

258
02:13:36,311 --> 02:13:38,269
Thy kingdom come

259
02:13:38,436 --> 02:13:41,517
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven

260
02:13:42,643 --> 02:13:44,725
Give us this day our daily bread

261
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:48,600
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors

262
02:13:50,809 --> 02:13:52,767
Lead us not into temptation

263
02:13:52,934 --> 02:13:55,017
But deliver us from evil

264
02:13:57,392 --> 02:13:59,474
Amen.

265
02:15:12,428 --> 02:15:16,594
Tell me something more about yourself
for identification, monsieur.

266
02:15:18,845 --> 02:15:20,925
I was born William Moncrieff Norfolk,

267
02:15:21,093 --> 02:15:23,175
New Year's Day in the year 1790.

268
02:15:23,843 --> 02:15:25,800
Educated at Harrow and Oxford.

269
02:15:25,968 --> 02:15:27,925
Commanded a regiment at Waterloo.

270
02:15:28,093 --> 02:15:30,050
Great times. (Clears throat)

271
02:15:30,218 --> 02:15:33,842
I came to New South Wales
as governor of this province.

272
02:15:35,135 --> 02:15:37,508
My wife finds the climate here oppressive,

273
02:15:37,675 --> 02:15:39,466
suffers from the vapours.

274
02:15:39,634 --> 02:15:41,383
Longs to go back to Grantham.

275
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,674
Pines pathetically for the values
of the mother country.

276
02:15:44,842 --> 02:15:49,508
Women are happier at home, of course.
They shouldn't meddle in the outside world.

277
02:15:49,675 --> 02:15:52,507
Our daughter, Flower,
has adapted rather better.

278
02:15:52,674 --> 02:15:54,423
She's taken to horses.

279
02:15:54,591 --> 02:15:57,090
She'll make an excellent marriage one day.

280
02:15:59,591 --> 02:16:02,298
I sometimes feel the urge
to have more children -

281
02:16:02,466 --> 02:16:04,215
a son.

282
02:16:04,383 --> 02:16:06,465
But my wife and I...

283
02:16:08,466 --> 02:16:10,630
It's like a square peg in a round hole.

284
02:16:11,797 --> 02:16:13,671
(Norfolk sighs)

285
02:16:14,547 --> 02:16:17,796
Now I regard the subjects of this province
as my family.

286
02:16:18,506 --> 02:16:20,671
I'm a martyr to duty, public service,

287
02:16:21,381 --> 02:16:22,713
diplomacy.

288
02:16:22,881 --> 02:16:26,337
It's generally acknowledged
I have promoted a measure of stability

289
02:16:26,505 --> 02:16:28,212
where before there was none.

290
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:30,462
Merci, monsieur.

291
02:16:31,338 --> 02:16:34,462
It is obvious you possess
a very liberal turn of mind,

292
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:38,170
a quality that is greatly appreciated
in my country.

293
02:16:38,338 --> 02:16:43,128
You will of course be familiar with
les raisons d'tre of the French Revolution:

294
02:16:43,295 --> 02:16:48,461
libert, galit, fraternit.

295
02:16:57,462 --> 02:16:58,876
Your aperitive, sir.

296
02:16:59,043 --> 02:17:00,834
Apritif!

297
02:17:01,002 --> 02:17:03,084
Sacr bleu!

298
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:14,501
Tell me another one of your wonderful stories,
Stanfield.

299
02:17:14,667 --> 02:17:16,625
I don't think I know any more.

300
02:17:16,792 --> 02:17:19,416
But you must! You promised me!

301
02:17:19,584 --> 02:17:21,666
I know you were only pretending.

302
02:17:34,375 --> 02:17:36,749
I don't always understand what Jesus says.

303
02:17:36,916 --> 02:17:38,749
Do you?

304
02:17:38,916 --> 02:17:43,665
If Papa said such things, he would become
a laughing stock, wouldn't he?

305
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:47,290
I have a daughter...

306
02:17:48,373 --> 02:17:50,455
.. just about your age.

307
02:17:55,831 --> 02:17:57,705
Don't forget to clean my shoes.

308
02:18:13,622 --> 02:18:15,704
You must learn to read,

309
02:18:16,663 --> 02:18:18,121
to write,

310
02:18:18,288 --> 02:18:20,370
and think for yourselves.

311
02:18:24,037 --> 02:18:26,120
You must use this...

312
02:18:27,412 --> 02:18:29,495
.. not this.

313
02:18:32,537 --> 02:18:35,245
If we fight amongst ourselves,

314
02:18:35,412 --> 02:18:38,118
we perpetuate our serfdom...

315
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:45,493
.. because they know
we will never stand together against them.

316
02:18:48,785 --> 02:18:52,618
You're becoming quite famous, Mr Stanfield,
quite the celebrity.

317
02:18:52,785 --> 02:18:55,658
People in high places
are championing your cause.

318
02:18:55,826 --> 02:18:57,908
I envy you.

319
02:18:58,659 --> 02:19:00,742
You should read about yourself.

320
02:19:11,242 --> 02:19:12,657
Tell me...

321
02:19:14,325 --> 02:19:16,282
.. what is this Society of Friends,

322
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:20,407
the wisdom of which you are so eager
to bestow on others?

323
02:19:21,367 --> 02:19:25,199
To whom, I may say, I've already extended
the hand of friendship.

324
02:19:29,073 --> 02:19:31,280
Perhaps you could wish to share it with me?

325
02:19:32,365 --> 02:19:34,447
I am, as you know,

326
02:19:35,323 --> 02:19:37,614
as indeed all must know, a fair man.

327
02:19:39,115 --> 02:19:42,322
Why, I'm willing to talk to anyone
who'll listen to me.

328
02:19:48,072 --> 02:19:50,154
You won't read about yourself?

329
02:19:53,822 --> 02:19:55,904
You should.

330
02:20:05,946 --> 02:20:07,903
Mr Stanfield...

331
02:20:08,071 --> 02:20:10,153
we are not uneducated men, are we?

332
02:20:12,696 --> 02:20:14,778
The field was my university.

333
02:20:19,152 --> 02:20:22,610
Stanfield, I respect your homespun philosophy.

334
02:20:23,319 --> 02:20:26,026
But I cannot have you preaching insurrection.

335
02:20:29,152 --> 02:20:32,150
The native population
are little more than savages,

336
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:35,734
in spite of my efforts to rescue them
from extinction.

337
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:39,942
Surely you must realise the impropriety of er...

338
02:20:42,568 --> 02:20:44,525
.. arousing them?

339
02:20:46,985 --> 02:20:49,566
I know that we are all God's children.

340
02:20:54,275 --> 02:20:56,233
You imbecile!

341
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:58,649
You snivelling workhouse guttersnipe!

342
02:20:58,817 --> 02:21:00,191
How dare you?

343
02:21:00,359 --> 02:21:03,983
How dare you fetch your filthy stench
to foul the air?

344
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:06,106
You contaminating labouring scab!

345
02:21:06,273 --> 02:21:08,231
Get out!

346
02:21:08,398 --> 02:21:12,481
Get out, before I send you back
where you belong, inside your whore's belly!

347
02:21:23,106 --> 02:21:24,980
(Sobs)

348
02:21:58,228 --> 02:21:59,685
(Branches crack)

349
02:22:07,269 --> 02:22:09,143
Hurry?

350
02:22:09,811 --> 02:22:14,142
Well, I was beginning to think there were
no more people living in the world.

351
02:22:14,310 --> 02:22:16,809
You're the first person I've seen in a week.

352
02:22:20,185 --> 02:22:22,976
I'm making for the Governor's
country residence.

353
02:22:26,227 --> 02:22:28,225
Have you got anything to eat?

354
02:22:31,184 --> 02:22:32,516
Here.

355
02:22:34,392 --> 02:22:36,058
See for yourself.

356
02:22:40,809 --> 02:22:42,891
You want to go that way.

357
02:22:46,015 --> 02:22:47,973
Which way are you going?

358
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:50,098
That way.

359
02:22:50,265 --> 02:22:52,223
Where have you come from?

360
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:54,473
That way.

361
02:23:09,473 --> 02:23:11,555
Why are you going so fast?

362
02:23:12,264 --> 02:23:14,347
You want to get there, don't you?

363
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:18,262
I'm going to see my father.

364
02:23:19,055 --> 02:23:21,012
I haven't seen him in three years.

365
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:23,262
(Charlie moans softly)

366
02:23:24,138 --> 02:23:26,221
Hey, don't fret now.

367
02:23:27,305 --> 02:23:29,512
We'll find something to eat tomorrow.

368
02:23:33,303 --> 02:23:35,385
You know, when I get home...

369
02:23:37,428 --> 02:23:40,010
.. I'll not go hungry again, that's for sure.

370
02:23:42,761 --> 02:23:44,844
I'll forget about this place.

371
02:23:47,261 --> 02:23:50,176
No child of mine will know
what I've been through.

372
02:23:53,469 --> 02:23:55,551
Now, if I was the Lord Mayor...

373
02:23:58,469 --> 02:24:00,551
.. I'd get rid of the old way of life.

374
02:24:04,135 --> 02:24:06,425
There'd be no more bowing and scraping.

375
02:24:09,676 --> 02:24:11,758
I'd build a new world.

376
02:24:14,509 --> 02:24:16,467
Do you hear me, Charlie?

377
02:24:16,634 --> 02:24:18,717
(Charlie snores)

378
02:24:22,216 --> 02:24:24,298
Oh, well.

379
02:24:34,466 --> 02:24:35,506
Look!

380
02:24:41,798 --> 02:24:43,880
Oh, it's beautiful.

381
02:24:44,965 --> 02:24:47,047
- Good?
- Mm.

382
02:24:52,256 --> 02:24:54,755
See them up there? They're the biggest.

383
02:24:54,922 --> 02:24:57,004
That's the boy. A few more.

384
02:24:58,255 --> 02:25:00,338
That's good.

385
02:25:53,126 --> 02:25:54,959
Charlie!

386
02:26:31,873 --> 02:26:43,830
Charlie?

387
02:28:28,529 --> 02:28:30,611
(Shrill whistle)

388
02:28:31,696 --> 02:28:33,653
Come here! Come!

389
02:28:33,821 --> 02:28:35,903
Bring 'em round. Bring 'em back.

390
02:28:38,446 --> 02:28:40,528
(Whistling and sheep bleating)

391
02:28:43,654 --> 02:28:45,985
Come on! Go! Turn 'em round!

392
02:28:46,153 --> 02:28:48,235
Bring 'em back.

393
02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:04,276
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

394
02:29:04,444 --> 02:29:06,401
- Good day's work, yeah?
- It was.

395
02:29:06,569 --> 02:29:08,651
(Plays tune)

396
02:30:01,356 --> 02:30:03,564
Are we saying good night, then, ma'am?

397
02:30:16,354 --> 02:30:19,270
Tell me, James,
are you happy here working for me?

398
02:30:20,771 --> 02:30:22,312
Yes.

399
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,519
I've been happy enough, Mrs Carlyle.

400
02:30:24,687 --> 02:30:26,769
Mrs Carlyle!

401
02:30:27,853 --> 02:30:29,352
Mrs Carlyle.

402
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,477
My name's Violet.

403
02:30:31,645 --> 02:30:33,727
Yes, ma'am.

404
02:30:44,102 --> 02:30:46,268
Do you know, ever since my husband...

405
02:30:47,602 --> 02:30:50,726
Do you know, I've never heard my name
for three whole years?

406
02:30:50,894 --> 02:30:53,018
I was prepared to think I never had one.

407
02:31:13,683 --> 02:31:17,348
Have you ever thought, James,
to make yourself a life out here?

408
02:31:18,266 --> 02:31:21,515
I mean, this country has a lot to offer
for a man like you.

409
02:31:22,391 --> 02:31:24,598
How should I have managed without you?

410
02:31:25,558 --> 02:31:28,432
I could see to it that you had every opportunity.

411
02:31:28,599 --> 02:31:32,181
I could arrange for your wife and your children
to come and join you.

412
02:31:32,348 --> 02:31:34,389
I'm childless.

413
02:31:35,098 --> 02:31:37,931
Ah, it's terrible to be alone with oneself.

414
02:31:39,307 --> 02:31:42,639
I do wish you'd consider it.
I'm not getting any younger.

415
02:31:48,221 --> 02:31:50,054
I love my wife.

416
02:32:01,513 --> 02:32:03,594
(Beckons and clicks tongue)

417
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:24,427
I'm sorry to lose you.

418
02:32:24,594 --> 02:32:26,677
This is from your brother.

419
02:32:28,178 --> 02:32:30,052
George?

420
02:32:46,509 --> 02:32:48,466
'My dearest brother,

421
02:32:48,634 --> 02:32:52,215
I pray to God my message reaches you at last.

422
02:32:52,383 --> 02:32:54,340
I've tried all manner of means,

423
02:32:54,508 --> 02:32:57,632
but hearing nothing from you,
I've feared the worst.

424
02:32:59,258 --> 02:33:03,257
It gladdens my heart to alert you
to the news of our freedom.

425
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:06,715
The Good Lord has looked into
the hearts of men,

426
02:33:06,883 --> 02:33:09,256
and shown them that, imperfect as we are,

427
02:33:09,965 --> 02:33:13,714
we did never countenance violence
nor any violation of the law.

428
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:20,298
Good friends at home have rallied to our cause
and argued long and hard on our behalf.

429
02:33:22,674 --> 02:33:26,421
Rejoice, my long lost brother,
in the free pardon granted to us.

430
02:33:27,630 --> 02:33:31,379
See to it that you complete your work
to the best of your ability,

431
02:33:32,255 --> 02:33:35,171
that our time here
may be said to be honestly done.

432
02:33:35,922 --> 02:33:38,129
We shall all be waiting to welcome you,

433
02:33:38,838 --> 02:33:41,211
all save Hammett, of whom there is no trace.

434
02:33:41,379 --> 02:33:43,336
Fear not, brother.

435
02:33:43,504 --> 02:33:47,461
He that is for us
is more than all that is against us.

436
02:33:48,254 --> 02:33:50,336
We will, we will be free.

437
02:33:52,046 --> 02:33:54,003
Your ever loving brother,

438
02:33:54,171 --> 02:33:56,253
George Loveless. '

439
02:34:14,918 --> 02:34:17,000
(Sings to himself)

440
02:34:18,334 --> 02:34:20,667
Come on. That's good.

441
02:34:27,793 --> 02:34:29,750
Ah, s, s.

442
02:34:29,918 --> 02:34:31,874
S, bella, bella.

443
02:34:32,042 --> 02:34:34,874
(Chuckles) Bella. Bellissima!

444
02:34:36,875 --> 02:34:38,832
No touch.

445
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,957
It's very hot, you understand?

446
02:34:41,125 --> 02:34:42,874
It's hot, it's... (Sizzles)

447
02:34:43,042 --> 02:34:44,999
Ah, hot! Caldo. Molto caldo.

448
02:34:45,167 --> 02:34:47,123
No touch, no. You come with me.

449
02:34:47,291 --> 02:34:49,248
I take your image.

450
02:34:49,416 --> 02:34:51,540
I take image of you.

451
02:34:51,707 --> 02:34:53,873
You understand? Come, come. I show you.

452
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:55,998
I show you.

453
02:34:56,166 --> 02:34:58,206
Standing here. Standing very still.

454
02:34:58,374 --> 02:35:00,331
Like so. Very still.

455
02:35:00,499 --> 02:35:02,456
You stand. Good.

456
02:35:02,624 --> 02:35:04,579
Yeah, very good. Very good.

457
02:35:04,747 --> 02:35:06,704
Stand here, very still.

458
02:35:06,872 --> 02:35:08,663
Good, good, good.

459
02:35:08,830 --> 02:35:09,746
(Chuckles)

460
02:35:09,914 --> 02:35:11,871
Molto, molto bene!

461
02:35:12,039 --> 02:35:14,121
Mwah! Mwah! (Chuckles)

462
02:35:16,289 --> 02:35:19,121
Oh, it's so good. Don't move!

463
02:35:45,537 --> 02:35:47,494
Ges bambino!

464
02:35:47,662 --> 02:35:49,536
Madonna di Dio! Hey!

465
02:35:50,162 --> 02:35:51,827
Get a... Get away!

466
02:35:51,995 --> 02:35:53,950
You get a... Go away!

467
02:35:54,118 --> 02:35:56,742
Go away! Va via! Move! Move!

468
02:35:56,910 --> 02:35:57,950
Move!

469
02:36:00,535 --> 02:36:02,492
No, no, no. Mo?e, mo?e!

470
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:04,117
No, no, no, no!

471
02:36:04,285 --> 02:36:05,450
Stay still.

472
02:36:05,618 --> 02:36:07,950
No, you, get away! Get...

473
02:36:08,118 --> 02:36:10,074
Oh, mamma mia!

474
02:36:10,242 --> 02:36:12,658
You, stay, but you, move!

475
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:16,033
Stay very still!

476
02:36:17,367 --> 02:36:20,324
Dieci, nove, otto, sette,

477
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:24,491
sei, cinque, quattro, tre,

478
02:36:24,659 --> 02:36:26,532
due, uno!

479
02:36:46,781 --> 02:36:48,738
(Tinkling)

480
02:36:48,906 --> 02:36:50,988
(Whistles)

481
02:37:17,237 --> 02:37:19,111
Hammett!

482
02:37:22,237 --> 02:37:25,986
Ges!

483
02:37:26,154 --> 02:37:28,111
(Clattering)

484
02:37:28,279 --> 02:37:30,236
(Wails)

485
02:37:30,404 --> 02:37:32,484
(Mutters angrily)

486
02:37:35,235 --> 02:37:36,984
What do you do?

487
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:38,942
You destroy my work!

488
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:41,192
(Wails)

489
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:43,859
Idiota!

490
02:37:44,027 --> 02:37:46,109
(Photographer sobs)

491
02:38:57,021 --> 02:38:58,895
(Cackles)

492
02:39:02,104 --> 02:39:04,186
(Audience gasps)

493
02:39:13,894 --> 02:39:15,559
(Cackles)

494
02:39:20,352 --> 02:39:23,726
AUCTIONEER: Magnificent creature,
ladies and gentlemen.

495
02:39:23,894 --> 02:39:27,017
Feast yourself on that gleaming, naked flesh -

496
02:39:27,184 --> 02:39:30,975
the arms... made for lifting heavy loads,

497
02:39:31,143 --> 02:39:34,100
the back, like a mule.

498
02:39:34,268 --> 02:39:35,808
Come now, ladies and gentlemen.

499
02:39:35,976 --> 02:39:39,683
You all look as if you could do with
a little domestic assistance.

500
02:39:39,851 --> 02:39:41,183
(Ribald laughter)

501
02:39:41,351 --> 02:39:43,307
The torso, ladies and gentlemen.

502
02:39:43,475 --> 02:39:45,432
The biceps!

503
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:49,891
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
what am I bid for this fine human specimen?

504
02:39:50,058 --> 02:39:52,016
What am I bid?

505
02:39:52,183 --> 02:39:55,641
He may be a bit rough and ready,
but treat him right, I say,

506
02:39:55,808 --> 02:39:58,099
and there's a hard day's work in him yet.

507
02:39:59,973 --> 02:40:02,930
I want to hear the sound of money,
ladies and gentlemen.

508
02:40:03,098 --> 02:40:04,639
Four shillings.

509
02:40:04,806 --> 02:40:06,764
Now, there's a lady of measure.

510
02:40:06,931 --> 02:40:09,014
FOP: Five shillings.

511
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,097
WOMAN. Six shillings.

512
02:40:12,265 --> 02:40:14,222
FOP: Seven shillings.

513
02:40:14,390 --> 02:40:15,929
WOMAN: Eight shillings.

514
02:40:16,097 --> 02:40:17,804
FOP: Nine shillings.

515
02:40:17,972 --> 02:40:21,513
Dig deep into your pockets.
I want to hear the jingle of coin.

516
02:40:22,847 --> 02:40:25,596
Is there any advance on 17 shillings?

517
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:31,263
FOP: 18.

518
02:40:33,138 --> 02:40:34,595
19.

519
02:40:34,763 --> 02:40:38,137
Do I hear a pound?
Will anyone give me a round pound?

520
02:40:38,304 --> 02:40:40,803
Look at the muscles, ladies and gentlemen.

521
02:40:45,513 --> 02:40:46,845
One pound.

522
02:40:47,013 --> 02:40:48,968
Going, for a pound.

523
02:40:49,136 --> 02:40:50,760
Going, going...

524
02:40:50,927 --> 02:40:53,176
gone for a pound!

525
02:40:53,344 --> 02:40:55,426
Thank you, sir.

526
02:41:33,842 --> 02:41:35,424
Jump!

527
02:41:56,256 --> 02:41:58,338
(Whispers)

528
02:42:16,963 --> 02:42:18,920
The bastard.

529
02:42:19,088 --> 02:42:21,045
He won't lick me.

530
02:42:21,213 --> 02:42:23,295
I'll see him in hell first.

531
02:42:28,336 --> 02:42:30,502
So how's it feel to join the nobility?

532
02:42:34,378 --> 02:42:37,668
If you were old enough to know better,
I'd chop your balls off.

533
02:42:41,294 --> 02:42:43,376
There's one thing you don't do, son.

534
02:42:44,877 --> 02:42:47,084
And that's turn against your own kind.

535
02:42:56,002 --> 02:43:00,041
There's some folk that think
they're better than others. They're not.

536
02:43:00,209 --> 02:43:02,500
They're just more selfish, that's all.

537
02:43:04,209 --> 02:43:06,291
What's your name?

538
02:43:07,292 --> 02:43:09,250
Out here, I have no name.

539
02:43:09,417 --> 02:43:10,958
Why are you here?

540
02:43:13,417 --> 02:43:15,500
I'm here instead of my brother.

541
02:43:17,499 --> 02:43:20,081
What's the difference? We're all brothers.

542
02:43:22,582 --> 02:43:24,539
What did your brother do?

543
02:43:24,707 --> 02:43:26,789
He's a carpenter, a craftsman.

544
02:43:28,540 --> 02:43:30,623
If it wasn't for him and others like him,

545
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:33,080
then everything would just fall apart.

546
02:43:41,373 --> 02:43:43,455
I mean, what crime did he commit?

547
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,746
Him?

548
02:43:54,497 --> 02:43:56,579
Oh, he didn't do anything wrong.

549
02:43:57,330 --> 02:43:59,412
He just wanted to see folks treated right.

550
02:44:01,372 --> 02:44:03,454
He believed in what he was doing.

551
02:44:05,911 --> 02:44:09,285
And out there, there are five others just like him.

552
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:15,327
Now that I know what they've been through,
I admire them.

553
02:44:15,495 --> 02:44:17,577
I count myself one of them.

554
02:44:33,994 --> 02:44:36,409
All my life, people thought they owned me.

555
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:39,992
But I'm a free man.

556
02:44:41,701 --> 02:44:43,783
In here, where it counts,

557
02:44:44,618 --> 02:44:46,700
I am a free man.

558
02:44:49,493 --> 02:44:51,658
No matter how other men may treat you,

559
02:44:52,701 --> 02:44:54,781
they can never own your soul.

560
02:44:59,241 --> 02:45:01,323
Remember that.

561
02:45:26,031 --> 02:45:27,571
Push!

562
02:46:48,983 --> 02:46:50,272
Run!

563
02:47:01,773 --> 02:47:02,814
Jump!

564
02:47:14,564 --> 02:47:15,980
Agh!

565
02:47:16,772 --> 02:47:18,855
CHARLIE: Help!

566
02:47:20,522 --> 02:47:21,980
Help!

567
02:47:22,147 --> 02:47:24,103
(Men laugh)

568
02:47:24,270 --> 02:47:32,686
Help!

569
02:47:35,145 --> 02:47:36,686
Get down here.

570
02:47:36,854 --> 02:47:40,435
You are a very silly young man.

571
02:47:40,603 --> 02:47:42,685
Come on, run. Run.

572
02:48:14,558 --> 02:48:16,515
So, comrade...

573
02:48:16,683 --> 02:48:19,515
are you going to tell us your name,
or aren't you?

574
02:48:25,683 --> 02:48:28,514
Are you going to tell us your name,
or aren't you?

575
02:48:39,140 --> 02:48:41,223
Free man.

576
02:48:44,265 --> 02:48:46,347
My name...

577
02:48:47,431 --> 02:48:49,513
.. is Adam Freeman.

578
02:48:50,264 --> 02:48:52,347
(Heavy thud)

579
02:48:55,306 --> 02:48:58,013
Now, you just sign this transportation order.

580
02:48:59,139 --> 02:49:01,220
I'll give you a receipt.

581
02:49:04,971 --> 02:49:08,511
He'll be sent to the penal settlement
at Norfolk Island...

582
02:49:10,054 --> 02:49:12,345
.. the dwelling of devils in human form,

583
02:49:13,179 --> 02:49:15,261
and refuse of Botany Bay,

584
02:49:16,346 --> 02:49:18,427
doubly damned.

585
02:49:21,553 --> 02:49:23,635
He'd be better off dead.

586
02:49:45,385 --> 02:49:47,468
(Thunder cracks)

587
02:50:33,423 --> 02:50:35,505
(Audience whistles and claps)

588
02:50:36,798 --> 02:50:38,672
(Cheering)

589
02:50:56,878 --> 02:51:03,502
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege
to stand here as a representative of you all -

590
02:51:05,003 --> 02:51:09,211
many thousands of men and women
from all parts of the country...

591
02:51:10,128 --> 02:51:14,501
.. whose prayers and entreaties
and remonstrances...

592
02:51:15,544 --> 02:51:19,918
.. have brought about the return
of these ill-used men.

593
02:51:20,086 --> 02:51:22,168
(Applause)

594
02:51:23,669 --> 02:51:25,210
And...

595
02:51:25,377 --> 02:51:27,460
And have supported their families...

596
02:51:28,252 --> 02:51:30,416
.. during their long and arduous exile.

597
02:51:31,167 --> 02:51:33,041
(Cheering)

598
02:51:35,792 --> 02:51:40,249
I do not have to remind you that the women
have suffered along with their men.

599
02:51:43,334 --> 02:51:45,790
We shall not forget the authors and abettors

600
02:51:45,958 --> 02:51:49,707
of this cruel and vindictive violation
of the laws of humanity.

601
02:51:50,416 --> 02:51:54,248
Most truly, those men have earned
for themselves an ignoble fame.

602
02:51:54,416 --> 02:51:58,873
But my task today is to praise and thank
those others who have helped our cause.

603
02:51:59,041 --> 02:52:01,332
(Crowd shouts out names)
Robert Owen! Cobbett!

604
02:52:01,499 --> 02:52:04,622
Grantwell! Whitley! Moore and Pitt!

605
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:06,872
(Pitt chuckles) Yes.

606
02:52:07,665 --> 02:52:12,539
But see who have really lent their weight
to these joint efforts.

607
02:52:12,707 --> 02:52:14,664
The silk weavers,

608
02:52:14,832 --> 02:52:16,372
shipwrights,

609
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:18,204
- joiners...
- Trimmers!

610
02:52:18,371 --> 02:52:20,329
- .. cordwainers...
- Blacksmiths!

611
02:52:20,496 --> 02:52:22,662
- .. journeymen tailors...
- Whitesmiths!

612
02:52:22,830 --> 02:52:24,579
- .. hatters...
- Brassmakers!

613
02:52:24,746 --> 02:52:26,829
- .. corkers...
- Tin-plate workers.

614
02:52:26,996 --> 02:52:28,954
- Bricklayers!
- Blacksmiths!

615
02:52:29,121 --> 02:52:31,079
Glass-blowers!

616
02:52:31,246 --> 02:52:33,204
- Trimmers!
- Wheelers!

617
02:52:33,371 --> 02:52:34,287
Brassmakers!

618
02:52:34,455 --> 02:52:35,994
Yes, yes, yes.

619
02:52:36,162 --> 02:52:38,119
Paper stainers, coach painters...

620
02:52:38,287 --> 02:52:39,411
Gardeners!

621
02:52:39,579 --> 02:52:41,536
.. and gardeners.

622
02:52:41,704 --> 02:52:45,286
To all of you, our heartfelt thanks.

623
02:52:45,454 --> 02:52:46,786
(Applause)

624
02:52:46,954 --> 02:52:48,911
And finally, ladies and gentlemen,

625
02:52:49,079 --> 02:52:52,035
let us thank our friend the lanternist,

626
02:52:52,203 --> 02:52:56,035
who, through the power of optics
and its magical transformations,

627
02:52:56,203 --> 02:52:58,285
has told the story here today.

628
02:52:59,078 --> 02:53:02,702
It was almost as though he had been
present throughout himself.

629
02:53:02,869 --> 02:53:03,785
(Applause)

630
02:53:03,953 --> 02:53:06,827
Ars magna lucis et umbrae.

631
02:53:10,242 --> 02:53:11,283
George.

632
02:53:14,451 --> 02:53:16,533
(Applause and cheering)

633
02:53:26,741 --> 02:53:28,824
Comrades...

634
02:53:32,158 --> 02:53:37,532
.. I believe that God works by means and man.

635
02:53:39,825 --> 02:53:41,781
Under such an impression,

636
02:53:41,949 --> 02:53:45,281
I call upon every working man in England...

637
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:49,989
.. to shake off that supineness
and indifference to their interests

638
02:53:50,157 --> 02:53:52,739
which leave them in the situation of slaves.

639
02:53:55,282 --> 02:53:57,237
Has not the working man

640
02:53:57,405 --> 02:54:00,404
as much right
to preserve and protect his labour...

641
02:54:01,530 --> 02:54:03,612
.. as the rich man has his capital?

642
02:54:06,197 --> 02:54:08,279
Such a measure, I'm well aware,

643
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:11,821
will be dreaded, reviled,

644
02:54:12,655 --> 02:54:15,528
reprobated by the moneyed part of the nation.

645
02:54:17,071 --> 02:54:20,361
They would devise all those schemes,
stratagems and policy

646
02:54:20,529 --> 02:54:22,903
that the art and cunning of man can invent...

647
02:54:23,821 --> 02:54:25,903
.. to thwart and retard it.

648
02:54:29,071 --> 02:54:31,360
But let the working classes of Britain,

649
02:54:33,361 --> 02:54:36,569
seeing the necessity of acting
upon such a principle,

650
02:54:37,945 --> 02:54:40,610
remembering that union is power,

651
02:54:42,361 --> 02:54:47,858
listen to nothing that might be presented before
them to draw their attention from the subject,

652
02:54:48,026 --> 02:54:52,650
alike despising and conquering party disputes,

653
02:54:53,943 --> 02:54:56,025
personal bickerings...

654
02:54:57,443 --> 02:55:00,067
.. and they will accomplish their own salvation

655
02:55:01,151 --> 02:55:03,232
and that of the world.

656
02:55:05,775 --> 02:55:09,441
Let every working man come forward...

657
02:55:11,358 --> 02:55:13,316
.. from north to south,

658
02:55:13,483 --> 02:55:15,566
from east to west.

659
02:55:17,233 --> 02:55:20,648
Unite firmly but peaceably together...

660
02:55:21,857 --> 02:55:23,940
.. as the heart of one man.

661
02:55:25,232 --> 02:55:28,356
And then, no longer
would the interests of the millions

662
02:55:28,524 --> 02:55:30,606
be sacrificed for the gain of a few.

663
02:55:33,107 --> 02:55:37,396
But the blessings resulting
from such a change...

664
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:41,313
.. would be felt by us...

665
02:55:42,814 --> 02:55:47,146
.. and our posterity -
even to generations yet unborn.

666
02:57:09,266 --> 02:57:12,557
# We'll win the day, we'll win the day

667
02:57:13,016 --> 02:57:16,555
# Though death and hell obstruct our way

668
02:57:17,014 --> 02:57:20,346
# We only need to watch and pray

669
02:57:20,806 --> 02:57:24,263
# And then we're sure to win the day

670
02:57:25,264 --> 02:57:28,555
# And when we reach that happy land

671
02:57:28,722 --> 02:57:32,512
# With flags unfurled on Zion's strand

672
02:57:32,846 --> 02:57:36,387
# New land of hope, our heads we'll lay

673
02:57:36,888 --> 02:57:40,470
# And shall to think we've won the day

674
02:57:40,971 --> 02:57:44,387
# We'll win the day, we'll win the day

675
02:57:44,555 --> 02:57:47,969
# Though death and hell obstruct our way

676
02:57:48,387 --> 02:57:51,761
# We only need to watch and pray

677
02:57:52,262 --> 02:57:55,844
# And then we're sure to win the day

678
02:58:14,427 --> 02:58:18,217
# A poor man to labour, believe me, 'tis so

679
02:58:18,677 --> 02:58:22,050
# To maintain his family is willing to go

680
02:58:22,551 --> 02:58:25,966
# Either hedging or ditching to plough or to reap

681
02:58:26,342 --> 02:58:29,758
# But how does he live on
eight shillings a week?

682
02:58:29,926 --> 02:58:33,800
# Eight shillings a week

683
02:58:33,967 --> 02:58:37,507
# Oh, how does he live on
eight shillings a week?

684
02:58:38,466 --> 02:58:42,174
# So, now to conclude and to finish my song

685
02:58:42,591 --> 02:58:45,924
# May the times be much better
before it's too long

686
02:58:46,091 --> 02:58:49,674
# May every labourer be able to keep

687
02:58:50,050 --> 02:58:53,713
# His children and wife
on 12 shillings a week

688
02:58:53,881 --> 02:58:57,963
# 12 shillings a week

689
02:58:58,131 --> 02:59:01,463
# His children and wife on 12 shillings a week

690
03:00:03,626 --> 03:00:07,458
# And it's fare thee well, cold winter

691
03:00:07,959 --> 03:00:12,208
# And fare thee well, cold frost

692
03:00:13,043 --> 03:00:16,166
# Nothing have I gained

693
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:21,374
# But my true love I've lost

694
03:00:21,958 --> 03:00:25,374
# I'll sing and I'll be merry

695
03:00:25,917 --> 03:00:29,749
# While a caution do I see

696
03:00:30,708 --> 03:00:34,580
# And I'll rest me when I'm weary

697
03:00:35,165 --> 03:00:38,955
# Let him go, farewell he

698
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:43,455
# As I was a-walking

699
03:00:43,998 --> 03:00:47,829
# Through a shady green grove

700
03:00:48,372 --> 03:00:51,829
# He met me with a smiling face

701
03:00:52,289 --> 03:00:55,704
# And gave to me the road

702
03:00:56,372 --> 03:01:00,413
# He thought I would have spoke to him

703
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:04,412
# As I passed by

704
03:01:05,163 --> 03:01:09,078
# But before I will humble to him

705
03:01:09,663 --> 03:01:13,787
# I will lay me down and die

706
03:01:14,913 --> 03:01:18,578
# To half a pound of reason

707
03:01:19,163 --> 03:01:22,910
# Take a half a grain of sense

708
03:01:23,577 --> 03:01:26,618
# A small sprig of time

709
03:01:27,161 --> 03:01:31,201
# And as much of prudence

710
03:01:31,744 --> 03:01:35,243
# And mix them up together

711
03:01:35,702 --> 03:01:39,534
# As you may plainly see

712
03:01:40,201 --> 03:01:44,409
# I'll defy the lad for ever

713
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:48,992
# Let him go, farewell he
