00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,703
ANA AND THE OTHERS

2
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,794
- Hello.
- Good morning

3
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,890
- The paper please.
- The paper, here you are.

4
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,059
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

5
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,851
Ana...? I'm Mariana Schuster,
from High School. And she's Silvina.

6
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,322
Hi! How are you?

7
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,759
Yours, isn't he?

8
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,387
Yeah, mine and Rodrigo's.

9
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,194
- Did you marry Rodrigo!?
- It's been four years now.

10
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,827
You look different with your hair cut,
you used to have long hair.

11
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,098
Yeah, I had it cut a short time ago.

12
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,038
Yours is just the same as it was...

13
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,804
Now it's lighter, for the summer.
How are you?

14
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,972
Fine, I'm always in Buenos Aires.

15
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,312
Oh... you know Rodrigo Guzman is also
in Buenos Aires. Do you remember him?

16
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,784
- No, I haven't the slightest idea.
- And I think... Laura too, the curly one.

17
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,479
Laura Solís.

18
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,887
Oh, yes, I think I know who.
- The one that in 4th grade was dating Flaco.

19
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,389
- No, it wasn't Flaco.
- Yes, it was.

20
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,858
No, she was dating Leandro.

21
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,093
Oh Mariana...
I'm sure because I liked him too.

22
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,533
Well, anyway I haven't seen her.
What about you?

23
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,105
No, I haven't married. I have a boyfriend.

24
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,508
I'm a single woman dating.

25
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,010
- Somebody I know?
- No, I don't think so. He's from Santa Fe.

26
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,874
We met there studying.

27
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,012
What's his name?

28
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,924
- It isn't a nice name.
- Why not?

29
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,927
It isn't nice, it's an old name. It's Omar.

30
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,055
- My uncle's Omar.
- Yeah, it's an old name.

31
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,664
Not nice for a young boy.
Old fashioned for our generation.

32
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:16,173
I love to call him Omi.
But when I get angry I call him Omar.

33
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,904
And you, do you have a boyfriend?

34
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,140
No, not really,
there's always something like it...
but not a boyfriend.

35
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,908
Well...

36
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,169
Can you lend me the newspaper?

37
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,473
Excuse me. Can you lend me the newspaper?

38
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,880
Just to see something...
I want to see the sports section...

39
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,287
Thanks.

40
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,024
You know if the Rowing swimmers are in?

41
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,754
No, I really haven't seen
the sports section yet.

42
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,402
Could I keep the page? If you don't mind.
Because this is my boyfriend.

43
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,138
- No, there's no problem.
- Thank you.

44
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,179
- Are you from here?
- Yeah.

45
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,216
- Because he's quite well known...
- Oh, yes? What's his name?

46
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,843
He's Adrián Serrini.
He's in the swimming team.

47
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,488
Have you been with him for long?

48
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:24,393
Not really. We met a long time ago but
we have been dating for fifteen days.

49
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,924
He's older than me.
It's strange you don't know him.

50
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,093
- How old are you?
- Me? 17.

51
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,464
- Now he has short hair but he had
long hair before. - Let me see.

52
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,509
He rode a motorcycle,
and lives near the park.

53
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,245
And how did you meet him?

54
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,848
I went to a disco with a friend...

55
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,383
and he and his friend asked us to dance.

56
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,987
Actually, he was with my friend
but I liked him very much.

57
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:53,490
At one moment I started to talk
to him and we changed mates.

58
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,560
We kept on talking the whole night.

59
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,697
My friend disappeared and we
left together in a taxi.

60
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,665
We exchanged phones but I thought
we'd never meet again.

61
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:07,068
And the following day my friend and
I went for a motorcycle ride...

62
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,537
in the Roses Park and we
saw him with his friend.

63
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,371
And I asked my friend to stop.
"Please, I want to talk to him!"

64
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,911
But she didn't want to because his
friend had been bothering...

65
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,379
her the whole night and she didn't stand him.
And we didn't stop.

66
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,779
But I wanted to see him another time...

67
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,753
to meet him in the bus, in any place.

68
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,189
I returned to the Roses
Park a thousand times.

69
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,525
Every time I had to go somewhere
I chose that way to find him.

70
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,662
I didn't see him for a whole year.

71
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,167
And this year,
I saw him again in the same disco.

72
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,272
He walked in front of me and I followed him.

73
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,305
I touched him on the shoulder and...

74
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,606
we started talking talking,
and he told me that he remembered me.

75
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,183
Since that moment we've been dating.
It was on the 31st.

76
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,480
And now I'm for waiting him.
He's coming over.

77
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,981
- Which was the club where he swims?
- At the Rowing.

78
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,390
I used to go to the Rowing too.

79
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,549
Diego...

80
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,689
Hi.

81
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,223
Hi.

82
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,719
How strange, you riding a bike.

83
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,628
No, I do ride. You should see me.
I even swim now.

84
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,825
- Windsurf?
- Obviously.

85
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,028
- Bullshit.
- No, no windsurf. Not yet.

86
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,673
- Is the bike yours?
- No.

87
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:53,142
It's my sister's... I have to take it back
because she has to go to the gym.

88
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,179
You know how she is,
she needs the bike to go.

89
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,048
- Do you see any of the guys?
- Who?

90
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,448
- Anybody.
- No, not really.

91
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,716
- Mariano?
- No. Are you staying long?

92
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,893
No, just a couple of days.

93
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,291
- Diego!
- Bye!

94
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,693
Marcos, from the club.

95
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,233
Are you staying long?

96
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,793
- You've already asked.
- Yeah.

97
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,694
No, a couple of days.

98
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,470
- Well.
- Well.

99
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,405
- I'm off.
- So am I. Have to go.

100
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,536
- You look thin...
- Yeah... not as much as you...

101
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,275
Yeah, I'm thinner too. But I've always been.

102
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,001
- Excuse me. May I ask you a question?
- Yes.

103
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,443
Would you know if there was
a photo shop here before?

104
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,819
No, not here,
there's one straight ahead on the corner;
but not here.

105
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,581
Not on this corner? One from the Garridos.

106
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,557
No.

107
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,787
Next block, you say?

108
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,727
There's one next block, Yung Color.

109
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,497
- And then there's this other one.
- No, yeah, I'm looking... well.

110
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,438
I don't remember really,
you should ask somebody older.

111
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,599
OK.

112
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,809
Over there on the other block
there's a newsstand.

113
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,441
I think the old man was born in the street,
so he can tell you...

114
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,418
something or give you a hint.
- OK, thanks. See you.

115
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,270
- Hello.
- Good morning.

116
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,376
Excuse me.
Do you know if there was a photo shop here?

117
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,034
No, there has never been one.

118
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,382
There was a lottery shop...

119
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,648
then a restaurant, now the phones.

120
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,331
Hi. Do you know if there was a
photo shop here some time ago?

121
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,034
Here? Yeah, maybe, but a long time ago.
I've been working here for three years.

122
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,840
It was the Garridos' one.
His son used to work.

123
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,141
- A tall one, chunky?
- Yes...

124
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,648
maybe. Do you know him?

125
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,082
- I don't think he's the same one.
- Mariano Garrido.

126
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,383
- No, nothing to do with him.
- OK, thanks.

127
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,831
Hi, Nati?

128
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,402
...Yes.

129
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,802
Yes, give me the address.

130
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,586
- Is it a long time since you moved?
- No, only a year and a half.

131
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,760
- And was the house like this?
- No, it was horrible when we bought it.

132
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:44,597
We did a lot, but we want to make
another floor for the bedrooms...

133
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,197
so that here we can do a room for the grill.
We haven't finished yet.

134
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,637
- It's nice.
- Yes, isn't it?

135
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,913
Guess who I ran into today. Diego.
I saw him very good looking.

136
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,881
No, you're crazy, he's fat.

137
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,454
I was surprised, he's changed. He's thin.

138
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,984
- No, he's ugly.
- I liked him.

139
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,927
- Anyway, we never share our likes
or dislikes. - Come on!

140
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,362
We agreed on some though.

141
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,404
But you had better taste before.
Mariano, for example.

142
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,107
I was going to ask you about him.
- Yes?

143
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,243
He's in Victoria, he went to work there.

144
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,108
- Why?
- Just to know.

145
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,274
But why do you ask about him?

146
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,149
Just to know something about him, that's all.

147
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,281
I've seen Martín quite often.

148
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,884
He went to Rosario to study, he's a dentist,
he came back...

149
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,660
and opened an office with a partner.
And Julio. He's working with his father...

150
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,732
Do you want me to get married?
- It's not that I want you to marry...

151
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,371
but it'd be good for you
to be with someone...

152
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,475
then somebody else,
and at some point you'll make up your mind.

153
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:01,340
- It sounds good.
- I'd hurry up.

154
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,742
See? You wanna see me married.

155
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,281
No, I don't want to get you married,
but it'd be good for you...

156
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
to be with somebody and...

157
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,718
...and not be so alone.
But I enjoy being alone.

158
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,447
It's easier.

159
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,388
No. Neither easier nor harder.
You may also say that...

160
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,960
being with somebody is easy.
- Why?

161
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,761
Because one day you make up your mind
and you've found the person...

162
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,266
you want to be with that meets
a couple of conditions that...

163
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,496
could be different in every case.

164
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,038
For example,
what do you like the best from Lautaro?

165
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,700
Uuumm, he's a good cook,
and makes dinner every night.

166
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,211
No, something bigger.
Why did you decide living with him?

167
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,316
- I don't know.
- Well, it doesn't matter. Anything.

168
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,817
The day you made up your mind,
you didn't think twice.

169
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,185
You're not looking anymore, you don't wonder:
"Would it be this one or another?"

170
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,589
I don't get it. Do you still believe that
a person must be looking all the time?

171
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:53,255
I've also been with this one and another,
but that's that. I can't live like that.

172
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,229
- Like what?
- Wondering, believing that...

173
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,994
there's always somebody better
and that you're missing it.

174
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,230
It never happened to you
to like somebody else?

175
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,599
No, not so far.

176
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,708
You say so far because it
could happen to you?

177
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,276
- Yes.
- And if it does?

178
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,639
- And if it does I'll see when it happens.
- And the house?

179
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,248
- What with the house?
- What would you do with the house?

180
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,111
Ah... is the house the problem?

181
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,276
Do you really think that you'll think
about the house when you decide...

182
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,354
being or doing something with someone?

183
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,014
Well, but if you don't share
a house it's easier.

184
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,423
See, being alone is easier.

185
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,960
- No, no. "Easier" is not the point.
- And what is?

186
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,825
I don't know. I'm lost.

187
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,469
- Look Agos.
- Get down here!

188
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,096
- Look Agos.
- Get down here!

189
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,997
- Who are you shouting at?
- Pablito.

190
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,606
- What Pablito, your neighbour?
- Yes, I told him to get down there.

191
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:45,040
- Come on, let's play.
- I told him: "Step down."

192
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,444
- Did you say that? And he did?
- Yes.

193
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,946
Blow.

194
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,053
Wait until it burns a little more.

195
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,501
Come over here.

196
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,809
Look.

197
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,754
- Come here, Agostina.
- No!

198
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,551
- Agostina, come here!
- Go.

199
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,592
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,498
It looks good on you.

201
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,633
- This is Pablo.
- How do you do?

202
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,741
- You arrived today, didn't you?
- Yes, this morning.

203
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,503
- And?
- Fine, fine, and you?

204
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,077
- Fine, we're coming from the club.
- Which one?

205
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,976
- The "Náutico."
- Which one is it?

206
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,516
- The one up North.
- Ah, near the tunnel.

207
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,085
- Yes.
- Andre!?

208
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,518
- What?
- Are you with the motorcycle?

209
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,623
No.

210
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,281
- C'mon.
- No, really.

211
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,551
I heard you arrive.

212
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,854
- It's not working well.
- You're lying

213
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,124
- It's true.
- That's a lie.

214
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,325
It doesn't have much brake fluid.

215
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,401
Aren't you going to dad's
to pick up something?

216
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,094
No.

217
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,462
C'mon, go.

218
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,608
No.

219
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,939
He called.
There's plenty of leftovers from yesterday.

220
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,376
OK, we'll go in a while.

221
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:30,148
- Hurry up, he's leaving soon.
- We'll go in a while.

222
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,583
Go.

223
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,224
OK.

224
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,403
Hi, Lau, what's up?

225
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,409
Ana? Yes, she's already here.

226
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,314
What time are you coming?

227
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,649
Around ten?

228
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,959
Would you bring the book I
left in the living room?

229
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,622
In a minute.

230
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,692
Come on. Do you want me to cut it?

231
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,129
- No, tell me.
- So I don't cut your hair.

232
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,432
Yes, cut it but also tell me.

233
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,035
- Are you sure that I haven't told
you anything? - Anything.

234
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,873
- About the priest?
- No.

235
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,914
- Sure?
- Yes.

236
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,613
- I'll tell you.
- Please.

237
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,617
We were in church.

238
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:41,214
Lautaro was inside waiting,
the people were all sitting.

239
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,093
I was in the car with dad, ready to get off,
but the priest didn't show up.

240
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:50,759
Mom and Andrea trying to call him,
the man didn't show up and the people...

241
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:55,134
in the chorus had to leave to
sing in another wedding.

242
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,434
And there was no time left.

243
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,511
In that moment Andrea comes to the car and
asks me whether I preferred to have...

244
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,911
the chorus or the priest to marry us.
Obviously I chose the chorus.

245
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,382
I wasn't resigning the hail Mary.
And we were about to start the ceremony...

246
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,220
with some friends of my mom directing it for
they knew the ritual, when the priest...

247
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:20,458
came in completely wet, offering the excuse
that he was confused by the time...

248
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,500
he thought it was ten at night
instead of ten in the morning.

249
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,831
- Hi.
- How are you?

250
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,840
- Wine, please.
- Yes.

251
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,236
Omar gave me this for the party.
Do you like it?

252
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,498
- Yes, it's so nice.
- But it's not my style.

253
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,233
Well, but I think he bought
it thinking of you.

254
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,072
But don't you think he could've bought
something thinking in my likes?

255
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,238
I mean...
Do you think I can put this chain on?

256
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,814
You're angry with him.

257
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,214
- No... Well, actually...
- Hi.

258
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,116
- Hi.
- How are you?

259
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,662
You know that after your questions
for Mariano I asked around...

260
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,131
and they told me he's gone to Victoria.

261
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,534
But it seems that he didn't go for work,
he went because he had a girlfriend there...

262
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,733
and I don't know what happened that
she left him or something...

263
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,307
so he went for her.

264
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,846
I was told something like this.

265
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,111
His parents knew about the meeting.
I don't know if he learnt about it.

266
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,254
- So.
- Fine.

267
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,622
- What were you talking about?
- About Mariano.

268
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,195
- What about Mariano? - That he went
to Victoria after a girlfriend.

269
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,861
- That's a lie.
- How do you know?

270
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,398
Silvina makes up everything she says.

271
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,433
Yes, maybe.

272
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,533
- Hi!
- Hi.

273
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,999
Hi, how are you?

274
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,544
- You are thinner, aren't you?
- Is that so?

275
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,475
- Yes.
- I've heard that.

276
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,207
- I'm getting Lautaro.
- OK.

277
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,476
Do you want something to drink?

278
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,383
- No, I'll be back in a minute.
- OK.

279
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,908
- We'll take the photo.
- All right, I'm going.

280
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,807
- Come on.
- I'm going.

281
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:47,696
The last one I saw was a French one,
the one that they are deeply in love...

282
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,267
and he has to go to war, and she's expecting
and finally she marries...

283
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:56,305
another man.
He came back to her but it's too late.

284
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,636
I don't remember the title.
I saw it in video.

285
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,438
I know it. I didn't like it, neither the
character nor the film in general.

286
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,639
- Really, it rather annoyed me.
- Why?

287
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:09,409
Because the characters don't follow with
that difficult love in the name...

288
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:14,514
of what socially should be,
as if passionate or pure love would be...

289
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,786
something to be lost.

290
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,088
What do you mean by pure love?

291
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,824
It's not related to purity but to pure love.

292
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,032
I don't think so.
I don't think that the film justifies that,
just the opposite.

293
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,537
For me it criticizes that.
They don't have a good time.

294
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,769
Obviously not, but that's the thing.
They do nothing to change it and be together.

295
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,936
It's a tragic love,
it has to finish that way.

296
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,878
- Omar!
- Diego!

297
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,718
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

298
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,047
This is Ana.

299
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,487
How are you?
- Fine.

300
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,112
We haven't met but I've heard about you.

301
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,191
- Is that so?
- Yes.

302
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,987
- From who?
- Silvina.

303
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,392
- Ah, you're Silvina's friend.
- We know each other from High School.

304
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,660
And what did she say?

305
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,495
- No, she just mentioned you.
- Well or bad?

306
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,967
- Nor well, nor bad.
- Nothing weird?

307
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,538
- No, nothing weird.
- Ah, you're not very close then.

308
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,902
No, we're just acquaintances.

309
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,307
I thought you were in Santa Fe.

310
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,107
No, let's not talk about it.
Good I came here for a couple of days.

311
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,012
- Why?
- I have some problems.

312
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,219
- Silvina?
- No, another one.

313
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,719
You're dating them both.

314
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,418
Not both. I'm dating Silvina.
And I see the other from time to time.

315
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,926
What's the problem?

316
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,054
The other girl,
the one I see from time to time,
is a bit anxious.

317
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,497
She went home last week and rang
the bell for two hours.

318
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,000
I was with Silvina,
so I couldn't open the door.

319
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,072
She insisted and insisted and Silvina
asked me what happened.

320
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,243
I tried to explain that they wanted somebody
else from a different floor.

321
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,575
- And Silvina, do you love her?
- Yes, a lot.

322
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,911
- And the other girl?
- Well. I like her.

323
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,215
See you later.

324
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,186
- She doesn't love him very much.
- How do you know?

325
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,590
Ah...

326
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,321
Come on, tell me.

327
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,524
No

328
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,463
- Come on...
- No.

329
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,536
- Come on, tell me.
- No. I don't know, just my opinion.

330
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,662
- But he loves her.
- Not so much.

331
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,468
Yeah, he loves her,
but he likes another girl.

332
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,768
It's not only that he likes another girl,
but he's with the other.

333
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,878
Yeah, but it's not that
he doesn't love her...

334
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,846
Maybe he may like another girl but
if he loved her he wouldn't...

335
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,882
be with another girl.

336
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,590
- Who loves whom more?
- What?

337
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,717
Those two, who loves whom more?

338
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,763
She loves him more.

339
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,500
And of those two?

340
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,303
- She does.
- Oh, women always love more.

341
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,676
No, not always. Just in those cases.
Let's check others.

342
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,577
Those two?

343
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,654
She loves him more.

344
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,816
- You believe it's always like this?
- What's like this?

345
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,224
- That inevitably one loves more
than the other. - Of course.

346
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,854
- Why "of course?"
- Because it's unfair.

347
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,863
- What?
- Love.

348
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,660
What's the relation between love and justice?

349
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,702
Of course it's not fair,
but it's not necessary for it to be fair.

350
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,309
I think it should be. If I love someone,
it's fair that he loves me too, isn't it?

351
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,205
- You want everything.
- Everything, why?

352
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,108
You mean you love a person and that's
enough for the other to love you.

353
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,274
- Yeah, I love him, that's a big deal.
- Yes, it is.

354
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,783
But maybe he just doesn't love you.
Maybe he loves another girl. So, what?

355
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,151
- Well, things shouldn't be like that.
- But they are...

356
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,348
But it's a bad thing.

357
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,286
No, it isn't a bad thing,
it's the way things are.

358
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,017
OK.

359
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,705
We had a good time in Bariloche, didn't we?

360
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,244
- Yeah, it was cool.
- Did you ever come back?

361
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,783
Yes, a couple of years ago,
and truth is it was very boring.

362
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,886
You got bored?

363
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,615
Well, the place is great,
but it doesn't compare to those days.

364
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,246
- Well, no.
- Fortunately.

365
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,826
- Why is that?
- I didn't have such a good time.

366
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,792
Why?

367
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,988
Too many people.

368
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,532
- You did have a good time, didn't you?
- Yes.

369
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,729
- Do you have his phone number?
- Whose?

370
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,305
- Mariano's.
- He's in Victoria.

371
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,999
- Yes, I know.
- You've been asking, haven't you?

372
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,475
No, but it's difficult not to
learn about things here.

373
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,114
Yeah, true. What else did you hear?

374
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,110
He went looking for a girlfriend.

375
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,409
- What?
- Nothing.

376
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,680
- Is it true?
- Partially.

377
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,121
He did have a girlfriend in Victoria
and he travelled a lot to see her.

378
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,624
That's how he met the people from the paper.

379
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,286
When he was fired from the paper
here he decided to move there.

380
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,295
But they had already split up.

381
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,560
Got the number?

382
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,865
Last time I saw he didn't have a phone.
I've got the address though.

383
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,680
- Fancy a coffee?
- No, thanks.

384
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,181
- C'mon, I'll make you one.
- OK.

385
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,317
I brought sugar.

386
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,851
- Black for me.
- OK.

387
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,945
- "OK."
- What?

388
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,354
Nothing. I mock you: "OK."

389
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,525
No cookies left.

390
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,855
- No problem. Not too much into sweets.
- Aren't you?

391
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,889
No, not really.
In Christmas I never eat much,
specially the real tasty ones.

392
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:44,565
Ummm... you never heard that Mariano
and I were apart for quite a while.

393
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,940
Why?

394
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,272
Because I had a crush on you.

395
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,649
I never knew about it.

396
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,419
When was it?

397
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,454
- When we came back from Bariloche.
- Before I left to Buenos Aires.

398
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,258
- Too much?
- Yeah. Well... I don't know. That's life.

399
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,461
Yeah, that stupid.

400
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,262
- They didn't look stupid back then.
- But they are.

401
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,665
No, they're not.

402
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,503
Yes, they're teenage crap. At that age
you're a little silly for some things.

403
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,509
Not anymore?

404
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,046
Yes, it could happen,
but it has to be something important.

405
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,675
That was important. I really liked you.

406
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,286
Ah, you were talking about that.

407
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,421
What were you talking about?

408
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,719
I thought you were talking
about you and Mariano.

409
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,988
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

410
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,561
- And how was it?
- My crush on you or the thing with...?

411
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,207
- The thing with Mariano.
- Just happened.

412
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,834
- But how? You were very close.
- Yeah, but it happens.

413
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,208
You have a fight and that's that.

414
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,974
Yes, but nobody has a fight just
because with his best friend.

415
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,813
Yes, you fight because you feel that way,
because something gets you...

416
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,088
because suddenly you are jealous of
him you want to have what he has.

417
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,421
But fighting you won't have
what the other has.

418
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,462
And besides what's that about "having
what the other one has?"

419
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,724
There's a third party who should
have a say in this, isn't there?

420
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,298
- No.
- No?

421
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,096
- It wasn't with you, it was with him.
- Were you in love with him?

422
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,100
No, I was mad at him.

423
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,240
Because I was in love with him.

424
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,398
Or because he was in love with you.

425
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,276
I should have asked you for advice,
shouldn't I?

426
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,746
"Ana, do you think I should get into a
fight with Mariano for you or not?"

427
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,545
Maybe yes, maybe I would have let you
know that it wasn't worth it and...

428
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,381
you saved yourself a problem.

429
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,582
- But it's over now, isn't it?
- Yes, it's over.

430
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,421
Well... yes.

431
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,678
- See that house?
- Yes.

432
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,905
What do you see?

433
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,517
- Nothing, a house.
- Don't you like it?

434
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,915
Yes, I don't see anything special.

435
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,857
It's a rationalistic style house.
It's the only one built in this town.

436
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,983
Weird, isn't?

437
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,239
Do you know the story about the "Rulero?"
People say that when...

438
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:36,170
...a guy killed himself there...

439
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,646
and then the construction was stopped
for a long time. Right?

440
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,810
- Yes.
- Now they say it's cursed or something.

441
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,215
Yeah, that.

442
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,205
Well, bye.

443
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,639
Bye.

444
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,062
So then I'll start reading the writing
regarding the ownership...

445
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,236
of the property you received
from your parents...

446
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:47,037
to Mr. Fernández, to seal the agreement.

447
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,677
Here it goes.

448
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:57,276
In Paraná, capital city of Entre Ríos,
January 11 2002, I see before me...

449
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,889
...for one party Miss Ana Torres...

450
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:06,263
...ID number 20005704, single...

451
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:11,767
...permanent address Laprida St Nr.
3256 Capital Federal...

452
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,599
and as the other party Mr.
Roberto Horacio Fernández, ID...

453
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,390
Hi

454
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,988
- Sorry. I'm late.
- No problem. Are we late?

455
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,925
A little bit, yes.

456
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,727
- How was it with the writing?
- Fine. It's over.

457
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,698
Sold.

458
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,034
How is it with you?

459
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,506
A little late, but...

460
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,814
- Did you have a good time?
- When?

461
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,721
At that age.

462
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,023
I don't remember.
It couldn't have been so bad, could it?

463
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,164
And who's that?

464
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,894
Pablito, next door kid.

465
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,301
Humm, seems like she's got a boyfriend.

466
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:26,102
- Ouch! She hit him.
- Always does the same, but he has fun.

467
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,611
Or so we think.

468
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

469
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,493
Let's go.

470
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,643
This is changed, isn't it?
It wasn't like this.

471
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,477
No, no it wasn't.

472
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,010
All this part is new.

473
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:49,389
It's a project to prevent erosion,
the falling off of the hill.

474
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,589
Inside, the core of the hill
causes mass movement.

475
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,890
What's that?

476
00:43:55,065 --> 00:44:01,402
When the soil inside begins
to move and slide.

477
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,779
And it finishes with the movement of
the bank because of the strength...

478
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,107
of the Paraná River.

479
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,612
That's one of the purposes.

480
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,084
The other one is to recover land.
Look from the warehouses to...

481
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:23,887
the Rowing Club they'Il do landscaping.
This is the first part they did.

482
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:29,022
Look at the lighting, the decks,
very old decks.

483
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,600
They are being recovered,
there are benches...

484
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,628
so people can be close to the river.

485
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,671
It's very nice.

486
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,809
Something very odd happened
to me in the harbor.

487
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:44,346
We were sixteen and I went there
with a boyfriend I had then.

488
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,616
We hung around, looked at the river...

489
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,845
and when he was about to kiss me, I fainted.

490
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,757
He caught me, sat me on some nearby steps...

491
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,920
and I came around.

492
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,521
Up to there, everything was normal.

493
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,792
The next year, or the following...
Yes, I think It was two years later...

494
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:12,670
I went back to the same place with Mariano.

495
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,878
And it happened again. Exactly the same,
I fainted...

496
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,378
in the same place.

497
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,374
Very strange.

498
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,007
- Was it in the same part of the
harbor both times? - Yes.

499
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,573
Diego called you. He wants you to call him,
he'll be at home.

500
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,100
What's this.

501
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,403
Last night pictures.
Andrea went to pick them up.

502
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,513
Oh! How nice.

503
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,149
Do you know the story of this photographer?

504
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:05,694
The girls placed an ad in
the paper for our party.

505
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,287
But it seems that the only one who
answered was this photographer.

506
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:14,961
He offered himself to take the photographs
and told Mariana that he was blind...

507
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,839
and that now he was recovering his sight.
Mariana felt pity for him...

508
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,170
and she hired him.

509
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,105
Hey, what's up, Diego?

510
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,272
It's been such a long time. Wait.

511
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,786
- Tell him you're still waiting for me.
- Pick up the phone.

512
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,314
No, tell him that you're waiting for me,
but know nothing.

513
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,790
- I told him you were taking a shower.
- Well, tell him I finished and left.

514
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,225
C'mon, pick up the phone.
Say something to him.

515
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,332
- Something like what?
- What do I know?

516
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,763
I don't tell him.

517
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,098
Please, tell him I left early
and I didn't come back yet...

518
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,105
that I'll be in late,
you let me know and tomorrow I'll call,
or later today.

519
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,868
I don't like to lie.

520
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,274
Liar.

521
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,711
If I tell you that I don't like to lie,
it's because I don't.

522
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,647
But this isn't a lie.

523
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:01,910
Ah, isn't it? So what is it then?

524
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,155
Hello, Diego. Yes, I'm Lautaro.

525
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,656
Natalia is with the baby.
That's why I'll help you.

526
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,727
No, Ana is not here yet.

527
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,695
OK. Shall I tell her to call
you when she gets back?

528
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,396
OK. Bye.

529
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,699
Stop, stop. You're going to get her excited.

530
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,604
Go to bed, Agos. It's late already.

531
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,313
And who's that?

532
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:46,589
That's an aunt, that's my brother,
some uncles, cousins...

533
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,526
The only bad thing was that
it was full of old people.

534
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,932
- That's what I hate about weddings
- Sugar?

535
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,595
No, black.

536
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,032
- Are you on diet?
- You see?

537
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,439
Look at this picture.

538
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,808
- Standing still for the picture.
- Posing.

539
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,820
Look at the camera, please.

540
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,221
That's Mariano, isn't he?

541
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,965
Which one? The one in the white shirt?
No, that's Fabrizio.

542
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,235
- No, I mean the voice.
- Yes.

543
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,079
Excuse me.
Do you know the way out to Victoria?

544
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:56,143
One block, turn left, then straight ahead...

545
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,215
No, she has to turn right
at the traffic light.

546
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,313
In the traffic light turn right.

547
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:06,494
Exactly, turn right at the traffic light
and there you'll see the signs...

548
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,928
and you're on route 11.

549
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,263
- Do you live there?
- Yeah.

550
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,800
- And do you know the boy who
lives next door? - Yeah.

551
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:06,993
Come on, Matías!

552
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,933
Yeah! Wait! Yeah, I see him sometimes. Why?

553
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,700
- I'm looking for him.
- And who are you?

554
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,208
- A friend.
- Friend... friend?

555
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,542
Friend, friend.

556
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,148
Because he has several friends...

557
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,343
- Really?
- Yeah. I haven't seen him for some days.

558
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,353
He's got a red car,
but it isn't there either.

559
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,515
- Come on, Matías!
- I'm going! Bye.

560
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,127
- Are you the one who's looking for Mariano?
- Yes.

561
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,224
Come this way.

562
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,653
Hello.

563
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,351
I'm looking for Mariano Garrido.

564
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,827
Mariano's in Gualeguaychú,
working on an article.

565
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,488
He should be back tomorrow or the day after.

566
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,066
- Is there any phone number to contact him?
- What?

567
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,432
Is there any phone to contact him?

568
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,971
Yes, I'll get it for you in a second...

569
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,684
Will you give me a lift up to a friend's?
I've got to fetch something.

570
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,694
OK, get on.

571
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,900
What do you have to fetch?

572
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,601
- A bass drum, for the band.
- You play in a band?

573
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,269
Yeah, with my brothers.

574
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,247
- And when does carnival begin?
- Fifteen days from now.

575
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,079
Not next Sunday, or the next. After the next.

576
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:20,884
That makes it twenty.

577
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,322
- Twenty what?
- Twenty days.

578
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,191
Well, yeah. Sort of.

579
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,566
Are you on a trip?

580
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,103
Yeah. But I guess I'm getting back.

581
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,900
To where?

582
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,340
To Parana. Do you know it?

583
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,504
Yeah. Once I was there, long ago.

584
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:50,051
I remember a playground with a huge duck.

585
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,654
- The "Sirirí Duck."
- What?

586
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,757
The "Sirirí Duck" is the name of the park.

587
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,290
- Did you get on the airplane?
- What airplane?

588
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,519
The one next to the duck...

589
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,631
When I went the plane wasn't there.

590
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,267
What are you saying? I know it.

591
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,666
When I went it wasn't there.

592
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:12,501
I went a long time ago...

593
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:21,406
- I went two years ago.
- And it was there. I used to go as a kid.

594
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,243
You're from there?

595
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,787
Yes, but I live in Buenos Aires.

596
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:30,484
- I don't know Buenos Aires yet.
- Ah, you have to.

597
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,661
- Is it nice?
- Very.

598
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,491
Well, some people don't like it.

599
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,657
- What do you like doing?
- Everything.

600
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,130
Then you'll like it.
Do you know any other city?

601
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:51,172
Yes, Paraní, Gualeguay, Rosario,
Australia, Brasil, Paris...

602
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,248
Ah, been far away.

603
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:57,614
- But, I've never been to Paris.
- Then you're kind of a liar.

604
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,421
- No. Paris is a city.
- Yes.

605
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,591
And I know it. I studied it this year.

606
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,931
And I don't like you to call me a liar.

607
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:16,731
- Why don't you call me by my name?
- Because you're a lady.

608
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,135
What do you mean a lady?

609
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:21,699
- You're older.
- Well, I am older but not an old lady.

610
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:25,302
- You are to me.
- So anybody older than you is an old person?

611
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,848
No, not everybody.

612
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,556
Those girls?

613
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,591
No.

614
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,125
And what's the difference
between them and me?

615
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,719
You're older, I mean not a teenager.

616
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,937
- Uy!
- What's up?

617
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,370
- There goes Jose.
- Who, your brother?

618
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,067
- No, Josefina, a girl.
- And so what?

619
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,701
I don't want her to see me with you.

620
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,641
- Why?
- Are they through?

621
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,375
Yes.

622
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,089
- Go straight ahead on the road.
- OK.

623
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,513
I'll be right back.

624
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,028
- Hi.
- Hi.

625
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,263
- Is there any pay-phone here?
- Yes...

626
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,597
here you are.
- Thanks.

627
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:50,451
You have communicated with Mariano Garrido.

628
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,618
Please leave your message.

629
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,401
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah. Let's go.

630
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,704
OK.

631
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,211
- That's the car!
- What?

632
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,717
That's Mariano's car!

633
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,490
Couldn't you go faster?

634
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,587
Are you sure that's the car?

635
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,323
- Yes, it was him.
- Sure?

636
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,693
Yes, it's a red Fiat.

637
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,903
And did you see him?

638
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:13,064
Yes, it was him. He's blonde, long hair.

639
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,972
Ponytail.

640
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,540
No, I was kidding.

641
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,315
Aren't you going?

642
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,155
Not here.

643
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,491
And what if he never comes out?

644
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,690
We'll wait here, in front of the door.

645
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,496
- But I have to go home.
- Just a minute.

646
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,917
What are you doing? He'll see you!

647
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,614
So? I'll say I was around.

648
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,885
Come on in.

649
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,190
Come on!
So we can follow him when he comes out.

650
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,811
- I don't get this.
- Read it to me.

651
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,587
When banks discuss the government
decisions...

652
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:11,887
a "per saltum" will happen, which will...

653
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:16,328
raise the subject to the Supreme Court
and postpone the first way.

654
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,281
Did see the girl that passed by today?

655
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,550
- Yes.
- I like her.

656
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,717
Ah, really? Does she know?

657
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,385
No, I don't think so.

658
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,064
Josefina, right?

659
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:55,034
No. Me and my friends call her that.
I don't know her real name.

660
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:58,002
- From school?
- No, from my neighborhood.

661
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,138
- You'll have to say something to her.
- No way.

662
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,973
- What do you mean no way?
- No.

663
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,674
One suggestion...

664
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,514
Let's suppose that I'm her so you practice.

665
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,178
- How's that?
- OK.

666
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,915
OK. You go over there and I stay here.

667
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,830
- Hello, Jose.
- Hi.

668
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:25,229
I brought the paper so we can read together.

669
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,268
- Ah, but I don't know how to read the paper.
- Why?

670
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,803
Because I don't really like reading.

671
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,374
So you'll be an animal all your life.

672
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,169
No, how are you going to say that?

673
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,835
What?

674
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,948
Tell her something nice,
maybe something you read about.

675
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,050
C'mon, again, go.

676
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:54,626
Hi, I was reading in the paper about
the football game, shall I tell you?

677
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:58,198
No, do you think she'll care about the game?

678
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,303
No, let's try inviting her somewhere
or to do something.

679
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,205
What are you doing?

680
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,675
- Do you always say hi like that?
- Yes.

681
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,312
No, no like that. Again, go.

682
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,305
- Hello.
- Hi.

683
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,515
Would you like to go swimming to the pool,
this afternoon?

684
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,745
I can't.

685
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,481
Why?

686
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,888
I have to visit my grandma.

687
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,460
May I go with you?

688
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,722
No. What do I say to my grandmother?

689
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,729
- That I'm your boyfriend
- But you're not.

690
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,198
Not yet.

691
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:35,735
No, that's too straightforward.
Do it again, go.

692
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,768
- But how many times?
- Go.

693
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,899
Hello.

694
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,569
- Would you like to go for ice-cream?
- I have no money.

695
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,542
No problem, my treat.

696
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:47,079
And where did you get the money from?

697
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,446
- None of your business.
- No, that's aggressive.

698
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,521
How are you going to say that?

699
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,954
How is she like? Does she pay attention
to you or is she indifferent?

700
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,856
She's hard to get.

701
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,992
Ah. Well, for instance...

702
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,571
I don't know, you'll have to ask my mother.

703
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,170
I ask what?

704
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,280
You say "No problem,
I'll go and talk to your mom."

705
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,780
Go again, from the ice cream.

706
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,783
- Would you like to go for ice cream?
- No, I have no money

707
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,148
OK, my treat.

708
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,279
And where did you get the money from?

709
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,790
My mom, doesn't yours give you any money?

710
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,724
No, my mom says that there's no
reason for kids to carry money.

711
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,864
- Kind of dumb your mom.
- No, no!

712
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,465
Uy, there he is!

713
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,754
You can go, no one is coming.

714
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,796
- But it's red.
- C'mon, go.

715
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,863
It's a minute.

716
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,629
I bet a gum she turns at the corner.

717
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,198
You're not leaving now?

718
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,104
Yes.

719
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,313
Well...

720
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,217
I'm going.

721
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,851
- Bye.
- Bye.
