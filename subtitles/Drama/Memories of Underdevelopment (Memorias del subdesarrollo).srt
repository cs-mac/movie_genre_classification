UNDERDEVELOPMENT

00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,859
Based on the novel by
Edmundo Desnoes

3
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,600
Leading players

4
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:59,356
Directed by
Tomas Gutierrez Alea

5
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:11,216
HAVANA, 1961.
MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY

6
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,687
<i>She'll have to work over there.</i>

7
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:32,136
<i>Until she finds someone stupid
enough to marry her, that is.</i>

8
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,361
<i>Frankly, she's still good looking.</i>

9
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,677
<i>She'll forget me as soon as
she finds an easy life.</i>

10
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,546
<i>I'm the one who's really stupid.</i>

11
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,471
<i>I worked to give her a soft life...</i>

12
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:53,804
<i>... like a New Yorker, a Parisienne,
not an underdeveloped islander.</i>

13
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:12,745
<i>All those who loved me...</i>

14
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:17,781
<i>... or nagged me right up to
the last moment...</i>

15
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,937
<i>... have already gone</i>

16
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:44,498
<i>For years I've wanted to find time
to write, or keep a diary.</i>

17
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,112
<i>Have I anything to say?</i>

18
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,382
<i>Everything's the same.</i>

19
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,277
<i>All the same.</i>

20
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,326
<i>Suddenly it looks like a set,
a cardboard city.</i>

21
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,214
<i>The Bronze Titan.</i>

22
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,124
<i>Cuba, free and independent.
Who'd have believed it?</i>

23
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:36,496
<i>No imperial eagle, but where's the
dove Picasso was going to send?</i>

24
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,744
<i>Iùs comfortable to be a communist
millionaire in Paris.</i>

25
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,018
<i>"This humanity has spoken 'enough'
and has begun to move."</i>

26
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,456
They won't stop
till they get to Miami.

27
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,325
<i>However, everything looks
so different today.</i>

28
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,783
<i>Have I changed, or has the city?</i>

29
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:32,039
<i>The moment of parting.</i>

30
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:36,674
<i>"Oh, abandoned, like the
wharves at dawn.</i>

31
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,412
<i>"Everything about you
was like a shipwreck."</i>

32
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,066
<i>- What are you doing?
- Can't you see?</i>

33
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:56,749
<i>What are you reading?</i>

34
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,863
<i>Something trite, frivolous and
superficial. "The Best of Everything."</i>

35
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,511
<i>Oh, yes, that film...</i>

36
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,503
<i>Stop looking at me...</i>

37
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,014
<i>...as if I'm some strange insect!</i>

38
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,640
<i>Letùs talk.</i>

39
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,424
<i>Whaùs biting you?</i>

40
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:24,164
<i>You only talk about insects lately.</i>

41
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:25,935
<i>Why not?</i>

42
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:31,776
<i>Aren't we surrounded by insects?
Isn't this country falling behind?</i>

43
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:35,099
<i>I say so, but what do you think?</i>

44
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:39,434
<i>Why? You've never been interested
in my opinions.</i>

45
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:45,548
<i>You're practising your English
lately. I think you want to leave.</i>

46
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,105
<i>Clear off! Leave me alone!</i>

47
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,004
<i>I like you when you become vulgar.</i>

48
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,852
<i>It always excites me...</i>

49
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:59,972
<i>... when I see you struggle between
elegance and vulgarity.</i>

50
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,822
<i>I've been keeping an eye on you
for some time now.</i>

51
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:11,525
<i>You've become rather disgusting
lately.</i>

52
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,582
<i>Because I've run out of
Yardley's brilliantine...</i>

53
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:19,456
<i>...and Colgate toothpaste
and after-shave lotion.</i>

54
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:22,608
<i>Those things help a lot,
don't they?</i>

55
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,193
<i>Yet you become more attractive
every day.</i>

56
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:30,683
<i>You're more artificial.</i>

57
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:34,051
<i>I prefer women like you
to natural beauty.</i>

58
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:39,823
<i>I prefer good clothes, good food,
make-up, massage.</i>

59
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,297
<i>Thanks to such things you're
no longer a slovenly Cuban girl.</i>

60
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:49,947
<i>I never know whether you're
serious or joking.</i>

61
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,517
<i>A little of both.</i>

62
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,062
<i>Go joke to your mother!</i>

63
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,942
<i>I can't stand living here
any longer! You stink!</i>

64
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,375
<i>Everything you said was recorded.</i>

65
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:18,935
<i>Every word. I'ùll be fun when
you hear it played back.</i>

66
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:22,713
<i>You monster! I'll smash
the recorder!</i>

67
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,920
<i>Women look into your eyes as though
wishing to be touched by your look.</i>

68
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,555
<i>Such a thing only happens here.</i>

69
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:17,709
<i>Maybe Italian women stare longer,
but no, not like ours.</i>

70
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,116
<i>Havana's like a country town
since "El Encanto" burned down.</i>

71
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:56,460
<i>To think that Havana was
"The Paris of the Caribbean."</i>

72
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,468
<i>Thaùs what tourists and whores
called her.</i>

73
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,794
<i>A Tegucigalpa of the Caribbean...</i>

74
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:12,462
<i>... thaùs what it looks like today.</i>

75
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:19,255
<i>Not only because "El Encanto"
has gone...</i>

76
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,716
<i>...and the stores are half empty...</i>

77
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,056
<i>... but because of the people.</i>

78
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,447
<i>What does life mean for them?</i>

79
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,166
<i>And what does life mean for me?</i>

80
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,830
<i>But I'm not like them.</i>

81
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:13,124
They're making the first socialist
revolution in America. So what?

82
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:19,451
They're going back to the jungle,
hungry, like the Haitians.

83
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:22,037
They beat Napoleon, and so?

84
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:26,900
The worlds most important sugar
industry, before the revolution.

85
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:29,427
Now look what they've made of it.

86
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,459
Times change.

87
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,936
Sergio, iùs not our own problem.

88
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:37,865
Iùs between the Russians and the
Americans, nothing to do with us.

89
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:42,405
I tell you this whole thing
will blow up, Sergio.

90
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:46,577
Whichever of them throws the first
punch, we'll catch it.

91
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,920
Why? Because we're a tiny,
little island.

92
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,452
You'll catch the punch,
because I won't be here.

93
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,482
<i>To think we've been friends
for over five years.</i>

94
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:07,988
Under Batista things got to
breaking point for you.

95
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:14,038
Not me, I kept out of politics,
I have a clear conscience.

96
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,919
All I've ever done is work,
like an animal.

97
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:24,847
Just think of Anita. So beautiful,
yet living on a diet of black beans.

98
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,614
Iùs not good enough.

99
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:32,388
Yet they have the know-how to
develop the country's economy.

100
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,537
Yes, the know-how.

101
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,615
The Americans know how to
make things run properly.

102
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:55,388
- Check the oil.
- I haven't any, but I can check it.

103
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,400
Why bother?

104
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,528
I've got to hand it in
just as it was.

105
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:16,157
Iùs been inventoried. If iùs
not as it was, I can't leave.

106
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:33,338
You'll have to touch it up with
synthetic paint somehow.

107
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:38,523
You'll have to paint this part,
at least.

108
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,533
<i>He says a Cuban can stand
everything except hunger.</i>

109
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,271
<i>Think how we've starved
since the Spaniards came.</i>

110
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,094
<i>In Latin America...</i>

111
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:01,698
<i>... four children die of malnutrition
every minute.</i>

112
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:05,904
<i>In ten years twenty million
children will have died.</i>

113
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,857
<i>Equal to the death roll of
the Second World War.</i>

114
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,051
A symbol of decadence.

115
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:30,132
If I keep it here I don't have to
get it repaired.

116
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,142
Well, if you prefer walking...

117
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:36,546
No, but I feel happier.
Iùs a way out of problems.

118
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,831
They say the latest American cars
are incredible.

119
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,828
I was reading a magazine
Julio lent me.

120
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:50,959
Sealed engines, two spark plugs,
a two year guarantee.

121
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:55,165
If it breaks down they give you
another one.

122
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,256
Thaùt's the only answer to
our mechanics.

123
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:00,384
<i>People are becoming more stupid.</i>

124
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,474
- Pablo's right: The French stink.
- They're just naturally dirty.

125
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:10,469
I don't care if they confiscate
the lot.

126
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:14,354
Iùs all the same to me.

127
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:18,332
But I'm not staying safe indoors,
like when they fought Batista.

128
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,709
Truth is, I never thought
they'd topple him.

129
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:29,957
I must do something now, or I'll be
lost when this thing blows over.

130
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,009
That'ùs what the Bay of Pigs
prisoners said.

131
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:42,671
THE TRUTH OF THE GROUP
IS IN THE MURDERER

132
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:53,507
<i>We found, in the invaders' military
organization, a social structure...</i>

133
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:59,750
<i>... reflecting the social structure
and morality of the bourgeoisie.</i>

134
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:02,386
<i>The priest.</i>

135
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,715
<i>The free enterprise man.</i>

136
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:07,043
<i>The dilettante official.</i>

137
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,528
<i>The torturer.</i>

138
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,273
<i>The philosopher.</i>

139
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:14,705
<i>The politician.</i>

140
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,669
<i>And many sons of good families.</i>

141
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,502
<i>Each of them had specific duties...</i>

142
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,020
<i>... yet it was the whole, the group...</i>

143
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,679
<i>... which gave meaning to
each individual activity.</i>

144
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:36,536
<i>CalviÒo was a murderer who even
horrified the bourgeoisie.</i>

145
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:41,217
The housecoat I wore
is still bloodstained.

146
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:44,092
He kicked my stomach and I bled.

147
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,876
But that wasn't enough for him.
Because I struggled...

148
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:53,681
...they broke two of my vertebrae.

149
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,078
<i>They hit him with sticks.</i>

150
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,882
<i>You hit him, too. He fell
on his knees...</i>

151
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,922
<i>... you kicked him in the side.</i>

152
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,124
<i>Then he fell down. Do you remember?</i>

153
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:08,260
<i>You abused him even after
he was dead.</i>

154
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,524
<i>You shot him, then laughed
at the way he died.</i>

155
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,058
<i>On October 6th, at 7 PM...</i>

156
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,121
<i>Do you deny it?</i>

157
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,335
<i>Do you deny...</i>

158
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:33,376
<i>...nine days after you had
killed Morua...</i>

159
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,185
<i>... you boasted about it?</i>

160
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,532
<i>- Do you deny it?
- I can't answer</i>

161
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:46,094
<i>In all capitalist societies...</i>

162
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:50,436
<i>... the same type of man is at
the disposal of the bourgeoisie.</i>

163
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:55,083
<i>In the moral division of work...</i>

164
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,760
<i>... the murderer enables others
to exist...</i>

165
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:01,553
<i>... others not in direct contact
with death...</i>

166
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:05,233
<i>... who, as individuals, wish to
keep their souls clean.</i>

167
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:12,882
<i>Speaking for myself and
those like me...</i>

168
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,495
<i>... maybe a minority...</i>

169
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:21,044
<i>... we're not like Ventura, or those
other miserable creatures.</i>

170
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:27,110
<i>I didn't even know CalviÒo then.
I lived my own life.</i>

171
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:32,958
<i>They're like disjointed elements of
a whole which no one fully admits.</i>

172
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,786
<i>I can't answer for the others.
Everyone answers for himself.</i>

173
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,203
<i>It seems that you want to accuse me...</i>

174
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,505
<i>... of being the instigator of
the invasion.</i>

175
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,802
<i>I insist my mission was
purely spiritual.</i>

176
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:54,183
<i>I have never handled a weapon.</i>

177
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:59,250
<i>Being mixed up in a conspiracy
doesn't make one a conspirator.</i>

178
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:04,329
<i>As I've told you, I've always
taken a neutral stand.</i>

179
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:09,650
<i>I'm apolitical; never had anything
to do with a political party.</i>

180
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:14,998
<i>One's personal behaviour excuses
one from general responsibility.</i>

181
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:20,584
<i>Everyone concentrates on himself
to escape contamination by others.</i>

182
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:24,745
<i>Or else, by sinking into the group
to mask his own responsibility...</i>

183
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,381
<i>... he divides his guilt with others.</i>

184
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:30,408
<i>I wasn't the only one in the group.</i>

185
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,296
<i>Conversely, the group may be
disowned...</i>

186
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:37,091
<i>... when its members wish to
avoid responsibility.</i>

187
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>You're talking about the group's
idea, not mine.</i>

188
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:48,193
<i>But the idea of group
responsibility...</i>

189
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:53,112
<i>... is the murderer-torturer's
haven, his claim to moral innocence.</i>

190
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:57,827
<i>Listen, I've committed no
direct crime, I tell you.</i>

191
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:01,266
<i>But none of the cases considered...</i>

192
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,968
<i>... shows the dialectic relationship
between individual and group.</i>

193
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,711
<i>None of those who came with
CalviÒo...</i>

194
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:11,583
<i>... see that they're part of a system
which entangles them in their acts.</i>

195
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,160
<i>In the accounts of landowner
Freyre...</i>

196
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:18,892
<i>... in the extreme unctions of
Lugo...</i>

197
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:22,988
<i>... in the reasonings of
philosopher Andreu...</i>

198
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:25,818
<i>... in the dismissals of
dilettante Rivero...</i>

199
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,666
<i>... in Varona's "representative
democracy"...</i>

200
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,149
<i>... who could divine the death
they'd help spread over Cuba?</i>

201
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:36,483
<i>Death by starvation, by sickness...</i>

202
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,817
<i>... by torture, by frustration.</i>

203
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,738
<i>She cleans the apartment
three times a week.</i>

204
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:15,576
<i>She's been coming for a year
and I never noticed her.</i>

205
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:21,311
<i>She'd be attractive if she troubled.
She's as thin as a Vogue model.</i>

206
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,523
<i>I like her.</i>

207
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:27,322
<i>She's a Protestant.</i>

208
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:29,985
<i>A Baptist, I think</i>

209
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:33,087
Were you baptized in a river?

210
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,656
What happened?

211
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,172
Well...

212
00:26:43,742 --> 00:26:45,539
Is it a secret?

213
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,769
We gathered by the river...

214
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:55,363
...the pastor and I entered the water
and he told me the meaning of baptism.

215
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:00,627
For us, baptism symbolizes
the death of sin...

216
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:06,699
<i>... the resurrection of a new life,
full of faith, hope and dignity.</i>

217
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,188
<i>Then he immersed me in the water.</i>

218
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:17,369
<i>You've no idea how frightened I was.</i>

219
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:22,888
<i>But it was all over so quickly.</i>

220
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:26,676
<i>All that worry and fuss for nothing.</i>

221
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:39,121
<i>Almost everyone's an exhibitionist.</i>

222
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:45,761
<i>I see people as weak, almost
hairless animals, on two legs.</i>

223
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:51,040
<i>Someone said that man's intelligence
and physical imperfection...</i>

224
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:53,802
<i>...are because he's the premature
foetus of a monkey.</i>

225
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,400
<i>At an exquisite moment...</i>

226
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:21,209
<i>... between 30 and 35, Cuban women
lose their looks.</i>

227
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:27,312
<i>They are fruits which rot
at an amazing speed.</i>

228
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:39,233
<i>The rule of the Yankee empire...</i>

229
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:44,357
<i>... having been ended by the
triumph of the Revolution...</i>

230
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:48,013
<i>... their Guantanamo Base
is now a spy centre.</i>

231
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:50,559
<i>Our cameramen...</i>

232
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:53,979
<i>... film some of the provocations...</i>

233
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,641
<i>... by military personnel and
counter-revolutionaries hiding there.</i>

234
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,658
You have beautiful knees.

235
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,741
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Are you crazy?

236
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,255
No, I just don't like eating alone.

237
00:31:27,113 --> 00:31:31,470
Are you waiting for someone?
Your boyfriend?

238
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:35,768
Are you crazy?

239
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,919
Iùs dangerous to wait around alone
at your age.

240
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,518
You are crazy.

241
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:46,961
No, look... really...

242
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:57,133
Why not have dinner? I get
indigestion if I eat alone.

243
00:31:57,528 --> 00:32:03,478
I'm waiting for someone from the
film company. I'm having a film test.

244
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:07,582
I have a friend there. An important
director, I believe.

245
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,311
In the film company?

246
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:11,975
I'll introduce you to him,
if you like.

247
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:16,318
- What'ùs the time?
- About six-thirty.

248
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:21,206
He's late. He won't come now.

249
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,967
Won't you have a drink?

250
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,416
I mustn't. I'm having injections
for my nerves.

251
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,537
Why do you want to act?

252
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,139
I'm tired of always being the same.

253
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:13,301
I want to be someone different
without people thinking I'm crazy.

254
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:16,788
I want to develop my personality.

255
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:20,739
But all those characters
are like scratched records.

256
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,577
An actress just keeps
repeating everything.

257
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:30,926
The same movements, the same words,
thousands of times.

258
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,134
Where did you get them?

259
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:07,795
We found them. They're cuts
made by the old censor.

260
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,833
The outfit we had before
the Revolution.

261
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:14,115
They refused to pass such scenes.

262
00:35:14,494 --> 00:35:18,169
They said they offended morals
and good taste.

263
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:26,001
So they had their moral
preoccupations, too.

264
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:29,241
At least they worried about
keeping up a front.

265
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:34,459
- What will you do with them?
- I might use them.

266
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:39,197
As a sort of collage,
a bit of everything.

267
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,489
- It will need to have some meaning.
- It will. You'll see.

268
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:45,993
Will they release it?

269
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:57,031
Have you acted before? In the
theatre, or on television?

270
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,302
No, I had no luck.

271
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:01,551
Have you studied drama?

272
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:05,928
Well, I did intend to
take some classes...

273
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:09,588
Well, just complete that form.

274
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,795
Aren't you going to audition me?

275
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,662
I can sing, too.

276
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,936
If you say so... Well?

277
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,365
Are you sure iùs no?

278
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:46,087
What a beautiful house.
Do you like it?

279
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,380
Don't think we'll do anything.

280
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:25,988
That'ùs where I live. Come on.

281
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,038
- I don't...
- Don't what?

282
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:35,967
- What about your wife?
- I told you, I'm divorced.

283
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:40,545
- Even so, what about the neighbours?
- Well, if you don't trust me...

284
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,534
What'ùs wrong then?

285
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:48,339
Well, you go up first.

286
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:51,836
Top floor, apartment K-L.

287
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:11,136
Make yourself at home.
I'll make some coffee.

288
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,453
My parents... and my ex-wife, Laura.

289
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:02,913
They left on the same day.

290
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,358
And you?

291
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,029
Aren't you leaving?

292
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:16,180
No, I'm all right here.

293
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:22,564
Are you a revolutionary?

294
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:26,250
What do you think?

295
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:31,412
Neither revolutionary
nor counter-revolutionary.

296
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,037
Well, what am I?

297
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,325
You're nothing.

298
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:52,933
- They'll send you things.
- What for?

299
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:59,862
They could send nice shoes...
maybe even a car.

300
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,720
Laura had a figure like yours

301
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:12,261
You can look at her dresses

302
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:16,145
You can have them, if you like.

303
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:25,672
Look at them, anyway.

304
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,414
Perfect!

305
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:51,714
You must fasten it up.

306
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:24,433
Come along now, don't cry.

307
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:33,612
You've ruined me.

308
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,898
We've done nothing wrong.

309
00:44:47,286 --> 00:44:49,242
What shall I tell mama?

310
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:53,467
Don't tell her anything.

311
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,620
I'll come with you if you like.

312
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,239
No thanks, I'd rather be alone.

313
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:54,805
Call me.

314
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:32,631
<i>Thanks to such things you're
no longer a slovenly Cuban girl.</i>

315
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:36,856
I never know whether you're
serious or joking.

316
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,256
A little of both.

317
00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:40,904
Go joke to your mother!

318
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:51,637
I can't stand living here
any longer! You stink!

319
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:00,800
Everything you said was recorded.

320
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:05,857
Every word. I'ùll be fun when
you hear it played back.

321
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,820
You monster! I'll smash
the recorder!

322
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,609
Let me go! I never want to
see you again!

323
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,870
I'm leaving... alone. I don't
want you to come with me.

324
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,566
Leave me?

325
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:36,067
Find some other woman,
more to your taste!

326
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:40,234
I won't be a guinea pig for
your whims and games!

327
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:45,875
I'm going to live my own life!
I'm getting old!

328
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:51,970
I don't want to be with you!
I'm leaving!

329
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,037
<i>Before your lips confirmed
you loved me...</i>

330
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:35,690
<i>... I already knew it, I knew it!</i>

331
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:38,701
All right now?

332
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:42,338
I thought you felt bad.

333
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:46,833
I'm all right now. I'll help you
prepare lunch, if you like.

334
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:54,981
- What'ùs the matter?
- Nothing's the matter with me.

335
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:05,763
<i>Go, say it! It couldn't last!</i>

336
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:11,916
<i>Iùs all over! You don't love me
any more!</i>

337
00:49:18,474 --> 00:49:19,907
Nice?

338
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:22,141
Why did you cry last night?

339
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:24,595
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm not.

340
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:27,333
You are, you don't have any feelings.

341
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:30,725
<i>You don't have to criticize
the way I live...</i>

342
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:38,473
<i>One thing about people
that upsets me...</i>

343
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:42,425
<i>... is their inability to sustain
something without collapsing.</i>

344
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:45,574
<i>Take Elena...</i>

345
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:48,543
<i>... she was totally inconsistent.</i>

346
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:51,126
<i>Didn't relate things.</i>

347
00:49:52,769 --> 00:49:54,964
<i>Thaùs a symptom of underdevelopment.</i>

348
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:59,793
<i>The inability to relate things,
to gain experience, develop.</i>

349
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,655
<i>Iùs difficult here...</i>

350
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,823
<i>... because women are conditioned
by sentiments and culture.</i>

351
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:14,535
<i>A soft environment. People waste
talents on inconsistent adaptations.</i>

352
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:19,056
<i>They always need someone
to think for them.</i>

353
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:26,612
I hope to see you soon, Sergio.

354
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,410
No, I'm already familiar with
the States.

355
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,012
What will happen here is the mystery.

356
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,201
Everyone knows what will happen.

357
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,773
Well, I don't. I really don't.

358
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,379
It won't be like the Bay of Pigs.

359
00:50:44,587 --> 00:50:47,977
Maybe not, but it might have
interesting results.

360
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:51,140
Right, but I'd rather be
on the other side.

361
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,932
You'll be safer.

362
00:50:55,267 --> 00:50:57,497
And you'll be able to see old friends.

363
00:50:57,812 --> 00:51:02,840
I know what you mean, but there are
decent people among them.

364
00:51:03,737 --> 00:51:05,409
So they say.

365
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:09,414
Whatever they say, I've got
a clear conscience.

366
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:12,566
You, yes.

367
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,808
<i>Was I like him?</i>

368
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:29,835
<i>Possibly.</i>

369
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:36,468
<i>The Revolution is my revenge on
idiots like Pablo, at my own risk.</i>

370
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:46,486
<i>I know Pablo isn't Pablo,
he's my own life.</i>

371
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,871
<i>Everything I don't want to be.</i>

372
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:51,772
<i>Good riddance.</i>

373
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,927
<i>Like vomiting them up.</i>

374
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,389
<i>I keep my mind clear.
A disagreeable emptiness.</i>

375
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:05,191
<i>I can't prevent whaùs happening
to me: Him, Laura, everyone.</i>

376
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:28,339
<i>Francisco de la Cuesta lived here.</i>

377
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:35,622
<i>We were eight or ten years old.</i>

378
00:52:37,526 --> 00:52:39,437
<i>Where is Francisco now?</i>

379
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,071
<i>Does he remember our pranks?</i>

380
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,956
<i>I try to and I can't.</i>

381
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,620
<i>At school the priests were
always right.</i>

382
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:23,176
<i>They had the power.</i>

383
00:53:24,254 --> 00:53:25,448
<i>I'd done nothing...</i>

384
00:53:26,924 --> 00:53:29,233
<i>Then I understood the relationship
of Justice and Power.</i>

385
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:36,975
<i>Armando's father was a freethinker.</i>

386
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:41,909
<i>Every week he'd give him a peso
to go to a brothel.</i>

387
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:49,760
<i>He took me to a woman who charged
50 cents; told her to be nice to me.</i>

388
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:36,462
<i>But I couldn't do anything with her.</i>

389
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:40,455
<i>I had to find another.</i>

390
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:49,376
<i>After that I went every week.</i>

391
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,920
<i>Suddenly I discovered that Elena
didn't think like me.</i>

392
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,651
<i>I expected more of her. I thought
she was complex and interesting.</i>

393
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,621
<i>I'm Europeanized.</i>

394
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:13,176
<i>Elena forces me to feel
underdeveloped.</i>

395
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:31,780
<i>I tried to change Elena,
but, like Laura...</i>

396
00:55:32,756 --> 00:55:37,955
<i>... she doesn't understand, she has
a different world in her head.</i>

397
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:40,864
<i>She doesn't see me.</i>

398
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:49,955
A TROPICAL ADVENTURE

399
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:54,431
Hemingway shot this gazelle
on his last trip to Africa.

400
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,088
That was in 1953.

401
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:03,882
He made that trip with Mary,
his fourth wife.

402
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:13,634
It is one of the fastest
gazelles in Africa.

403
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:28,214
<i>He said he killed it to avoid
killing himself.</i>

404
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:32,109
<i>But finally he couldn't resist
the temptation.</i>

405
00:56:42,263 --> 00:56:44,902
He made several trips to Spain
as war correspondent...

406
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:08,270
Is this where Mr. Way used to live?

407
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:15,890
What'ùs special about it?
Books and dead animals.

408
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,567
Just like the American houses
in Preston.

409
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:26,240
The same furniture, the same
American smell.

410
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:30,208
- What'ùs an American smell?
- I don't know... you sense it.

411
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:33,451
Do you like the smell of Russians
best, or Americans?

412
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:38,268
Leave me alone! I don't know
anything about politics.

413
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:41,791
<i>The tropics.</i>

414
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:45,588
<i>Backward countries...</i>

415
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:48,258
<i>... where you kill animals...</i>

416
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,795
<i>... fish and sunbathe.</i>

417
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:54,880
<i>And there: "the beautiful
Cuban seÒorita"!</i>

418
00:57:56,694 --> 00:58:00,289
<i>"I'll ever fear anything again",
Macomber said to Wilson.</i>

419
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:03,968
<i>"Something happened inside me when
I saw the first buffalo.</i>

420
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:08,959
<i>"Like a dam bursting.
It was pure excitement."</i>

421
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:13,196
<i>As if chasing a buffalo would
conquer fear.</i>

422
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:17,782
<i>Anyway, there are no buffaloes
in Cuba.</i>

423
00:58:18,598 --> 00:58:22,352
<i>He conquered fear of death, but
couldn't stand fear of life...</i>

424
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,534
<i>...at a time when the world was
beginning to get too big.</i>

425
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:29,740
Why did you go away?

426
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:32,027
You were amusing yourself.

427
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,678
Do you mind?

428
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:39,211
You don't care.

429
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:41,427
You don't care about me.

430
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:45,386
About anything.

431
00:58:49,346 --> 00:58:52,861
This is Hemingway's private study.

432
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:56,787
He could always be found at
this typewriter.

433
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,704
He never sat down to write.

434
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:05,055
He'd get up very early and work
till 11 or 11.30.

435
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:09,493
Few people were allowed into this
room. I was one of them.

436
00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:13,309
I would move about very quietly...

437
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:20,447
<i>Rene Villarreal.</i>

438
00:59:20,721 --> 00:59:24,191
<i>He was a guttersnipe when
Hemingway found him.</i>

439
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,857
<i>I read that somewhere.</i>

440
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,828
<i>He moulded him to his need:
Faithful servant and great lord.</i>

441
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:37,491
<i>Colonialist and Gunga Din. Hemingway
must have been insufferable.</i>

442
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:46,625
<i>This was his refuge, his tower,
his tropical island.</i>

443
00:59:49,884 --> 00:59:52,193
<i>Big game hunting, American
furniture...</i>

444
00:59:52,637 --> 00:59:57,233
<i>... Spanish photos, books in English,
a bullfight poster...</i>

445
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,283
<i>Cuba never really interested him.</i>

446
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:06,431
<i>It was his refuge, guest house,
base for fishing in the Gulf Stream.</i>

447
01:02:03,517 --> 01:02:05,587
ROUND TABLE: LITERATURE
AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT

448
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:08,492
Culture in an underdeveloped
country...

449
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:11,967
...is the sometimes painful
and costly operation...

450
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:18,065
...by which people become aware of
the possibility...

451
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:21,328
...of changing social conditions...

452
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:23,740
...writing their own history...

453
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:27,832
...and select the most fertile
of their traditions...

454
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:32,004
...to bear fruit in the conditions
created by national liberation.

455
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,918
We are only a few steps away from
being negro cooks and janitors.

456
01:02:38,563 --> 01:02:43,842
I discovered I was a "spick", a
derogatory term for Latin-Americans...

457
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,544
...negroes and other inferior people.

458
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:51,667
Although I look like a white,
Anglo-Saxon Protestant...

459
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:55,156
...I'm really a southern negro.

460
01:02:55,585 --> 01:03:00,943
All Latin-Americans are negroes,
discriminated against, oppressed...

461
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:06,216
...ignored outsiders in the swindle's
pretensions of universitality...

462
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:10,919
...the American way of life, the
great white dream of the U.S.A.

463
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:15,872
Now iùs the turn of
the devil's advocate.

464
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:20,860
He who piles doubt upon doubt...

465
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:24,695
...and asks you:

466
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,021
Don't you realize, the words
you are using...

467
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:31,893
...underdevelopment,
underdevelopment...

468
01:03:33,134 --> 01:03:35,932
...are sick, or at least ailing?

469
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:42,138
Don't you realize that these
may be language traps...

470
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:46,811
...accessories of an already
wasted culture...

471
01:03:47,987 --> 01:03:51,218
...a stratagem, a linguistic alibi...

472
01:03:52,368 --> 01:03:56,122
...a linguistic-ideological
arrangement...

473
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:58,978
...leading to the tranquillity
of formulas?

474
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:04,284
Iùs useless to flee the linguistic
continent of underdevelopment...

475
01:04:05,385 --> 01:04:08,821
...and forget that the basic
contradiction of our times...

476
01:04:09,223 --> 01:04:11,214
...is not the contradiction...

477
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:14,601
...between North American imperialism
and underdeveloped continents...

478
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:18,420
...but the contradiction between
the impetuous development...

479
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:21,337
...of the productive forces
of the whole world...

480
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:27,777
...and the forms and relationships
of capitalist production.

481
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,845
Between the socialist revolution...

482
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:33,323
...and the final imperialist phase
of capitalism.

483
01:04:34,256 --> 01:04:36,850
To take one of your examples...

484
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:42,338
...the basic contradiction between
the proletariat and capitalism.

485
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:48,054
I believe that what you have said
is a complete abstraction.

486
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:52,442
The embodiment of the basic
contradiction...

487
01:04:53,698 --> 01:04:56,496
...takes the form of war.

488
01:04:57,453 --> 01:05:00,604
For me, the basic contradiction
at this moment...

489
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:04,962
...is not between European
proletariates and capitalists...

490
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,816
...but it is in the areas where
war exists...

491
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,776
...there we see the basic
contradiction, as in Vietnam.

492
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:18,043
The sole basis of this discussion...

493
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:24,344
...rests on whether the
basic contradiction...

494
01:05:25,198 --> 01:05:27,234
...is one thing or the other.

495
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:30,261
On pure Marxist grounds...

496
01:05:30,663 --> 01:05:35,179
...I agree with you, but the
embodiment is something else.

497
01:05:35,628 --> 01:05:37,983
<i>Who are you up there,
with that cigar?</i>

498
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:41,802
<i>You feel pretty important; you
don't have much competition here.</i>

499
01:05:43,096 --> 01:05:47,772
<i>Outside Cuba, you'd be nobody;
here you're well placed.</i>

500
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:52,449
<i>Who's seen you, Eddy? Who sees you
now, Edmundo Desnoes?</i>

501
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,971
I'll translate what Jack Gelber
just said.

502
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:02,244
<i>I don't understand...
The American was right.</i>

503
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:07,741
<i>None of that helped. Words devour
words and leave you in the clouds.</i>

504
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:12,754
<i>How does one get rid of
underdevelopment? Iùs difficult.</i>

505
01:07:13,673 --> 01:07:15,629
<i>It taints everything.</i>

506
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:21,007
<i>What are you doing, mixed up
in all this, Sergio?</i>

507
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:25,984
<i>You've nothing in common with them.
You're alone.</i>

508
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:32,201
<i>In underdevelopment things are
forgotten, people are inconsistent.</i>

509
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:37,700
<i>But you remember too many things,
too much.</i>

510
01:07:39,373 --> 01:07:42,410
<i>Where's your family, your work,
your wife?</i>

511
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:46,013
<i>You're nothing. You're dead.</i>

512
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,337
<i>Now, Sergio, your final destruction
begins.</i>

513
01:08:14,586 --> 01:08:17,703
<i>Iùs always the same with mother's
letters: Gum and razor blades.</i>

514
01:08:18,132 --> 01:08:20,441
<i>I use an electric razor.</i>

515
01:08:22,138 --> 01:08:24,777
<i>All I asked for was books.</i>

516
01:08:32,318 --> 01:08:34,115
<i>I can't read her writing.</i>

517
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:38,393
<i>They're crazy. We don't
understand each other.</i>

518
01:09:10,826 --> 01:09:14,102
<i>Hanna was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

519
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,647
<i>Escaping Hitler, they landed in Cuba.</i>

520
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,619
<i>Hanna was more of a woman than the
underdeveloped girls here.</i>

521
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,635
<i>How long were we together?</i>

522
01:09:28,808 --> 01:09:33,006
<i>I can't remember; the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

523
01:09:34,023 --> 01:09:36,742
<i>Why did I let her go?</i>

524
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:49,546
<i>When they left for New York
we were engaged.</i>

525
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,927
<i>Not that we believed in convention.</i>

526
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:58,755
<i>I planned to settle in New York
with her.</i>

527
01:10:59,886 --> 01:11:01,319
<i>I wanted to be a writer.</i>

528
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,903
<i>Hanna was the one person
who believed in me.</i>

529
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,921
<i>She'd help me.</i>

530
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,506
<i>Then father gave me a
furniture store.</i>

531
01:11:36,976 --> 01:11:41,731
<i>I worked like mad for two years.</i>

532
01:11:44,653 --> 01:11:48,362
<i>"Hanna, darling, I can't leave now.
Please understand.</i>

533
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:52,120
<i>"I don't want to arrive
empty-handed."</i>

534
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:54,552
<i>Hanna, darling...</i>

535
01:11:55,459 --> 01:12:00,487
<i>One day it was too late...
I'll always look for you.</i>

536
01:12:02,593 --> 01:12:03,787
<i>Where are you now?</i>

537
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:07,469
<i>What do you think of me?</i>

538
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:45,732
Stop right here.

539
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:09,467

544
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,628
An ex-landlord.

545
01:14:26,615 --> 01:14:28,810

548
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:39,245

549
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:43,211
- When did you last pay it?
- I never have.

550
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:47,592
This apartment, are you the owner,
illegal occupier?

551
01:14:47,976 --> 01:14:49,853
I'm the owner.

552
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:51,870
- Any embargo?
- No.

553
01:14:55,194 --> 01:15:00,063
How many square metres? Roughly.

554
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:03,093
Iùs pretty big.

555
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,516
Letùs say 100 to 200 square metres.

556
01:15:07,877 --> 01:15:11,267
- Want to measure it?
- No, I'll take your word.

557
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:16,342
Leùts say 300. We can always
correct it afterwards.

558
01:15:17,807 --> 01:15:20,082
Type of construction: Brick.

559
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,069
Now, concerning these apartments...

560
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:29,598

562
01:15:33,077 --> 01:15:38,390

563
01:15:40,587 --> 01:15:42,543

564
01:15:43,173 --> 01:15:48,293
There are two lifts.
State of upkeep: Good.

565
01:15:49,431 --> 01:15:50,659
Sign here.

566
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:59,538
- What'ùs it all about?
- Iùs just a sort of check.

567
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:06,514
If anything's out of order
we'll let you know.

568
01:16:08,748 --> 01:16:13,663
You can't turn there,
go straight ahead.

569
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,656
Don't bother, I'll get out here.

570
01:16:27,064 --> 01:16:30,101
<i>In the midst of all this
I'm living off rents.</i>

571
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:36,356
<i>I've got some 12 or 11 years
to go yet.</i>

572
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:40,194
<i>Iùs two years since they took over
my apartment block.</i>

573
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,530
<i>Everything's either too early
or late for me.</i>

574
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:07,218
<i>Once I might have understood
these going on.</i>

575
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:10,348
<i>But not now.</i>

576
01:17:52,426 --> 01:17:54,781
<i>I'm 38 and I'm an old man.</i>

577
01:17:56,431 --> 01:17:59,150
<i>I don't feel wiser, or more mature.</i>

578
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:02,071
<i>I'm more stupid, more rotted away.</i>

579
01:18:03,482 --> 01:18:06,599
<i>Like rotten fruit, like refuse.</i>

580
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:11,131
<i>It may be something to do with
the tropics.</i>

581
01:18:11,993 --> 01:18:16,589
<i>Everything ripens and decomposes
quickly; nothing endures.</i>

582
01:18:37,234 --> 01:18:38,826
<i>I'm old already.</i>

583
01:18:40,697 --> 01:18:42,096
<i>Since 13 I've been to brothels.</i>

584
01:18:44,327 --> 01:18:45,680
<i>At 15 I was a genius.</i>

585
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:47,751
<i>At 25 I owned a store.</i>

586
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:50,615
<i>Then Laura.</i>

587
01:18:54,549 --> 01:18:55,459
<i>My life...</i>

588
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,076
<i>... is like a sterile ornamental
plant.</i>

589
01:19:07,691 --> 01:19:09,249
<i>I have a certain dignity.</i>

590
01:19:15,076 --> 01:19:16,111
You Sergio?

591
01:19:17,704 --> 01:19:19,501
I'm Elena's brother.

592
01:19:23,962 --> 01:19:26,157
Is she ill?

593
01:19:26,466 --> 01:19:29,344
She's never ill. Iùs something else.

594
01:19:29,678 --> 01:19:32,715
She says you took advantage of her.

595
01:19:35,269 --> 01:19:37,385
You've ruined her.

596
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:41,890
Iùs not something to be paid off
with dresses.

597
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:49,608
She says you promised to marry her,
then took advantage...

598
01:19:50,706 --> 01:19:54,494
<i>I should have known Elena was
capable of anything.</i>

599
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:56,356
<i>I didn't want trouble.</i>

600
01:19:57,423 --> 01:20:01,621
<i>I was willing to marry her.
I was afraid.</i>

601
01:20:02,388 --> 01:20:05,346
Tell him what you told mother.

602
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:15,517
You deceived me.

603
01:20:17,282 --> 01:20:19,113
You deceived me.

604
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:25,493
You said you'd give me some dresses...

605
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:33,090
...then you took advantage of me.

606
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:35,809
If you say so.

607
01:20:38,769 --> 01:20:40,248
But you know iùs untrue.

608
01:20:40,604 --> 01:20:41,923
You're no virgin...

609
01:20:42,273 --> 01:20:45,902
Show respect! My sister's no whore,
damn it!

610
01:20:48,782 --> 01:20:50,977
<i>How could I get involved in this?</i>

611
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:53,716
<i>I resigned myself.</i>

612
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:58,274
<i>I'd let myself be dragged along.
I was afraid.</i>

613
01:20:58,878 --> 01:21:02,996
Girls must go to the altar as virgins!
Iùs their greatest treasure!

614
01:21:03,384 --> 01:21:05,022
Women are liberated now.

615
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:08,932
Don't talk like a revolutionary,
because you're not!

616
01:21:11,645 --> 01:21:16,196
I won't be forced. If I marry
iùs because I want to.

617
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:21,904
Why did you want to get rid of me?

618
01:21:22,242 --> 01:21:26,952
Iùs not that, Elena. I'll marry you.
Iùs just that I need to think...

619
01:21:27,374 --> 01:21:29,171
Think about what?

620
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,052
I've got to make arrangements,
haven't I?

621
01:21:31,463 --> 01:21:34,580
I must get my divorce papers.

622
01:21:35,468 --> 01:21:37,424
Yes, madam, I'm divorced.

623
01:21:40,224 --> 01:21:42,613
Why did you have to bring her?

624
01:21:42,936 --> 01:21:47,134
That night when she came home,
her panties were bloodstained...

625
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:50,111
That'ùs not true!

626
01:22:02,128 --> 01:22:07,600
<i>I'm sure she wasn't a virgin.
What will they get out of this?</i>

627
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,550
Any statement?

628
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:14,889
Iùs all untrue.

629
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:18,815
I didn't assault her: She consented.

630
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:21,786
It wasn't rape.

631
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:19,956
The accused, Sergio Carmona...

632
01:23:20,272 --> 01:23:24,390
...planned to seduce Elena
Josefa Doredo, aged 16...

633
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:28,350
...and with that intent took her
to his apartment...

634
01:23:28,783 --> 01:23:30,501
...at Linea, Vadado...

635
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:33,178
...where he abused her virginity...

636
01:23:33,581 --> 01:23:36,937
...although aware that she was
mentally disturbed...

637
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:40,294
...therefore incapable of resisting.

638
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:44,594
Have you anything to say?
Address the attorney.

639
01:23:47,557 --> 01:23:50,355
Do you know Elena Josefa Dorado?

640
01:23:50,895 --> 01:23:52,772
Answer to the bench.

641
01:23:56,694 --> 01:24:00,164
- Where did you meet her?
- On 23rd Street, in Vedado.

642
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:04,898
Did you take her to your apartment
and have sexual intercourse?

643
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:12,013
Tell me, before the night
in question...

644
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:17,259
...did the plaintiff confess to you
any previous experience...

645
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:20,277
...sexual intercourse with
another man?

646
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:21,670
No, never.

647
01:24:23,312 --> 01:24:27,351
<i>I was the only one to give coherent
evidence. That finished me.</i>

648
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:30,730
<i>It was as if I'd duped a
"poor unfortunate."</i>

649
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:34,663
It was to give me some of
his wife's dresses.

650
01:24:35,662 --> 01:24:38,335
She's left the country.

651
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,736
<i>Now everything's "the people."</i>

652
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:45,875
<i>Before, they'd have been the guilty
ones and I the respectable one.</i>

653
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:51,166
The bastard has the nerve...

654
01:25:05,284 --> 01:25:07,639
Did you threaten Sergio's life?

655
01:25:07,996 --> 01:25:09,748
If he didn't marry her.

656
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,190
You threatened him. What did he say?

657
01:25:12,502 --> 01:25:16,620
He said he'd make arrangements, but
in the end he didn't marry her.

658
01:25:17,091 --> 01:25:19,286
When was Elena taken to the doctor?

659
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:22,594
Well, according to mother...
I don't know exactly...

660
01:25:23,099 --> 01:25:28,890
Mother says it was some months before
all this happened...

661
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,587
Do you know what the doctor said?

662
01:25:31,986 --> 01:25:34,739
And the results of the tests?

663
01:25:35,115 --> 01:25:36,628
<i>Then came the verdict.</i>

664
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:43,167
<i>The accused, Sergio Carmona...</i>

665
01:25:43,876 --> 01:25:47,425
<i>... invited Elena Josefa Dorado,
aged 17...</i>

666
01:25:47,798 --> 01:25:52,155
<i>... for a walk on the evening of
25th January, 1962...</i>

667
01:25:52,554 --> 01:25:56,183
<i>...and during said walk they went
to the home of the accused...</i>

668
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,189
<i>... located at Linea, where they
had sexual intercourse.</i>

669
01:26:00,565 --> 01:26:05,764
<i>Tests show no evidence of the girl
being mentally disturbed...</i>

670
01:26:06,197 --> 01:26:10,509
<i>...nor that she was insane or
unaware of her conduct.</i>

671
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:14,348
<i>Secondly, the accusations by
the district attorney...</i>

672
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:19,187
<i>...are as set out in folios
six and seven.</i>

673
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:22,066
<i>Thirdly...</i>

674
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:26,746
<i>... the defence has denied all
the district attorney's charges...</i>

675
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:30,770
<i>... pleaded for the acquittal
of the accused...</i>

676
01:26:31,146 --> 01:26:33,944
<i>...and dimissal of the case,
with costs.</i>

677
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:35,994
<i>Finally...</i>

678
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:38,746
<i>... on the facts as proved...</i>

679
01:26:39,073 --> 01:26:42,907
<i>... there is no evidence to sustain
the charge of rape.</i>

680
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:47,367
Upon consideration of the above...

681
01:26:47,752 --> 01:26:50,630
...and with regard to Articles
142, 240, 741 and 742...

682
01:26:50,964 --> 01:26:53,956
...of the Social Defence Code and
the Criminal Prosecution Law...

683
01:26:54,636 --> 01:26:58,311
...our verdict is that we hereby
absolve the accused...

684
01:26:58,724 --> 01:27:02,876
...of the crime of rape as charged
by the district attorney.

685
01:27:03,314 --> 01:27:07,512
<i>A happy ending, as they say.
Justice triumphed for once.</i>

686
01:27:09,155 --> 01:27:10,952
<i>But is that so?</i>

687
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:15,947
<i>I'm left in a bad situation;
I'm too educated to be innocent.</i>

688
01:27:16,539 --> 01:27:19,497
<i>They're too ignorant to be guilty.</i>

689
01:27:20,461 --> 01:27:23,578
<i>I just hope they haven't
locked her away.</i>

700
01:28:15,032 --> 01:28:18,991
<i>Attempting to resolve ideological
problems, rights or wrongs...</i>

701
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:22,124
<i>... by administration or repression,
is not only useless, but harmful.</i>

702
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:26,782
<i>For the safety of customers who
come to the shop below...</i>

<i>...as well as for the sake of
the tenants...</i>

704
01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:33,484
<i>... why doesn't somebody
repair our balcony?</i>

705
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:36,799
<i>Seven times I've reported it
to the authorities.</i>

706
01:28:55,961 --> 01:29:00,591
<i>She brought me a stack of photos
taken at her baptism.</i>

707
01:29:07,184 --> 01:29:10,142
<i>It wasn't at all as I imagined.</i>

708
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:13,692
<i>The robe didn't cling to her body.
There were many people.</i>

709
01:29:16,571 --> 01:29:21,520
<i>I hadn't thought of them, the
witnesses who are everywhere.</i>

710
01:30:41,766 --> 01:30:46,760
<i>People are ready to die, without
considering who's to blame.</i>

711
01:31:04,504 --> 01:31:06,142
<i>What if it all starts?</i>

712
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:12,439
<i>No good protesting. I'd die, too.</i>

713
01:31:14,893 --> 01:31:17,168
<i>This island is a trap.</i>

714
01:31:18,147 --> 01:31:19,785
<i>We're small, and too poor.</i>

715

<i>Iùs an expensive dignity.</i>

716
01:31:23,738 --> 01:31:29,290
We definitely reject any intention
of an enquiry...

717
01:31:30,956 --> 01:31:32,753
...any inspection of our country.

718
01:31:34,168 --> 01:31:35,920
Nobody inspects our country.

719
01:31:37,214 --> 01:31:39,011
We know what we're doing.

720
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:44,090
We know how to defend our integrity
and our independence.

That doesn't scare us.

723
01:31:53,276 --> 01:31:55,232
We know the age we live in...

724
01:31:55,613 --> 01:31:59,162
...and we must learn how to live
in it, with dignity.

725
01:31:59,785 --> 01:32:02,743
All of us, men and women...

726
01:32:03,123 --> 01:32:07,082
we are all one!

01:32:07,462 --> 01:32:09,100
In this hour of danger...

728
01:32:09,965 --> 01:32:14,675
...every one of us, revolutionaries
and patriots...

729
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,069
...share the same peril...

730
01:32:18,768 --> 01:32:21,885
...and victory shall be for all.

731

Our country or death! We shall win!
