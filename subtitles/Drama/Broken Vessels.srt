1
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,814
- You see what happened there?
- I'm pretty sure you hit me.

2
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,907
I gave you left, left.
You think it'll be another left...

3
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,032
..and I gave you a right.

4
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,783
I'm just telling ya
that's what boxing's all about. Okay?

5
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,951
You show your opponent one thing.

6
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,037
You do something else.

7
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,746
That's how Ali took the title from Foreman.

8
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,166
He beat him with a rope-a-dope. Remember?

9
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,418
I don't remember what day it is!

10
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,762
Everyone thought Ali's arms had run out.

11
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:27,686
But he was just setting Foreman up.

12
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,728
He let him burn himself out.

13
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,854
And then in the eighth round, in he comes!

14
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:42,149
Poor George has got nothin' left.

15
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,784
I always liked Bruce Lee movies.

16
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,959
Hey, you're learning!

17
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,755
Don't look at my hands.
Look at my shoulder!

18
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,718
Where the punch comes from! See?

19
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:09,098
You're still looking at my hands!
Let's try it again.

20
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,767
Come on! Focus.

21
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,808
Shoulders!

22
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,545
- Here.
- No, you keep it.

23
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:22,918
Come on, you won.

24
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:26,679
Yeah, but I always win.
I mean, I'm starting to feel guilty.

25
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,642
Shut up and take it!

26
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:38,984
You know why
you didn't beat me today, Hale?

27
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:42,856
Could it be you've been boxing
for 20 years and you're better than me?

28
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:45,907
No.

29
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,155
You don't have the will to win.

30
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,580
Well, ... your insight is shattering.

31
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:52,376
You had me today.

32
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:55,213
You coulda shut me down,
but you blinked. Mm?

33
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,089
Well, we were only sparring, buddy.

34
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:04,296
Thinking like that
is exactly why you lost. Take this.

35
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:06,676
No, it's yours.

36
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:11,346
No, take it. If you didn't give it everything
you've got, I don't want it.

37
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,811
- Go ahead.
- No, it really is yours.

38
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,269
I took it out of your wallet
while you were in the shower.

39
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,746
- General.
- General.

40
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,678
Major, were you recently promoted past me?

41
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:42,793
No, sir.

42
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,260
Then, why are you smoking
in my briefing room?

43
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:49,681
Uh... Sorry about that, sir.
That'll never happen again.

44
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,476
Sit.

45
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,899
You take off in the Stealth at 0-dark.30.

46
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:03,449
Fly a simulated low-level border penetration.
Nap of the earth.

47
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:06,108
Usual... Scare the cows, wake the farmers.

48
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,828
Not tonight, buddy.

49
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,072
We're flying the B-3 with two live nukes.

50
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,285
Palmdale's concerned about...

51
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:16,581
..low-level gamma and x-ray diffusion
on the peripherals.

52
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:20,124
They want to send up a couple pre-dawn.
See if anything glows.

53
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:21,463
61s?

54
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:24,044
Big ones. 83s.

55
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,511
Phew! Crowd pleasers.

56
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,183
(chuckles)

57
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,075
- How's your head?
- It's all right. I'll be fine.

58
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,869
- I'm sorry about that.
- Don't worry. I'll get you back.

59
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:59,040
Ah! Now you're dreaming!

60
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,126
After you, Major.

61
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,162
You know, these exercises are fantastic.

62
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:32,326
When we have to go to war against Utah,
we are really gonna kick ass!

63
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,251
Ground control. Ready for roll-out.

64
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,172
Park ranger!

65
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:28,672
I'd like to speak to you about this campfire!

66
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,340
- I'll go.
- No, Wanda, you stay put.

67
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,931
Yeah, I know...

68
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,311
No wood fires in the park.

69
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,606
But Wanda has a cold
and I want to keep her warm.

70
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:42,988
Sir, have you seen any other hikers
or campers in this area?

71
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:46,608
Not this time of year.
Say, what's the fine for this?

72
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,493
Pretty steep.

73
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:51,580
- Aargh!
- (Woman) Oh!

74
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,246
Aagh!

75
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:01,293
Secured.

76
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,026
Jesus Christ!

77
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,318
Drag him outta there!

78
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,861
We'll be smelling that all night.

79
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,917
(Hale) Climb heading 2-8-7.
Flight level 2-0-0.

80
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:39,495
That's 2-8-7. 2-0-0.

81
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:44,126
(Hale) I don't think that Aurora project
will happen for me.

82
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:48,513
Your buddy Taylor said
I don't have enough fighter time to qualify.

83
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,093
What did you say to him?

84
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:53,932
- "Thank you, sir. Goodbye."
- You'll never change, will you?

85
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,856
And that, my friend, will be your downfall.

86
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:01,101
- You know what your problem is?
- Yeah. I'm always right.

87
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,149
- You think you're always right.
- That's deep.

88
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,861
You said yourself
you should have made colonel.

89
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,157
But you're always pushing at everybody.

90
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,704
Well...

91
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:13,623
That's an awesome responsibility, isn't it?

92
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,342
McMurran Control, this is Ghost-7.

93
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,916
Colonel! You boys in Utah still awake?

94
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:28,048
Copy, Major Deakins.
We're ready and waiting.

95
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,303
Be advised we're gonna catch your butts
this morning and bite down hard!

96
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:35,929
You may pass that along
to Captain Hale with my compliments.

97
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,439
Ooh! Wilkins is giving us attitude!
You wanna take it through?

98
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:42,776
Tell him I'm gonna fly this thing
in one ear and out the other.

99
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,939
He won't even know we were there!

100
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:47,701
Copy, Colonel.
Hale says if anyone can catch us, ...

101
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,861
..you can.

102
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,030
And everyone get a fix!

103
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,448
They're about to turn out the lights!

104
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,421
Ready, Captain?

105
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,507
On your command, Major.

106
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,928
Go to war.

107
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,678
Initiating Stealth mode.

108
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,692
River valley approach, here we go.

109
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,107
Colonel, they've gone to Stealth mode.

110
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:32,112
We lost them on the radar!
Anybody still holding? Anybody?

111
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,875
- Capture on their heat signature, sir.
- Good.

112
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,580
They may be running cold,
but the air is colder.

113
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,745
Good man, Frenchy. I like that.

114
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:44,334
(Deakins) Descend to 400 feet AGL.
Altimeter setting 3-0-0-1.

115
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:47,712
(Hale) Airspeed .7 Mach.
3-0-0-1. 400 feet.

116
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:50,093
Nap of the earth, here we go.

117
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:10,985
(radio) Terry? You been through
the Needles entrance tonight?

118
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,320
- No. Why?
- Mrs Parker just called.

119
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:16,534
Oh, God! What is it this time?
Another UFO?

120
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,708
- Or did Elvis drop by for dinner?
- She didn't mention him, ...

121
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:24,711
..but she said some trucks went through
the Needles entrance an hour ago.

122
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,877
She thought they looked suspicious.

123
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,050
Clyde, what exactly
does a suspicious truck look like?

124
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,347
I don't know and lhave no idea!

125
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,220
Me neither!

126
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:39,682
Yeah, the thing is though,
she said one of the trucks was ours.

127
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:43,642
You're the only one out there tonight,
so if it wasn't you...

128
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:48,483
She was probably just hallucinating.
Don't worry, I'll check it out.

129
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,208
(bleeping)

130
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,704
- Lost 'em.
- Damn!

131
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:03,085
Come on, keep hunting. Keep hunting!

132
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:09,089
We're below their eyes and ears.
Proceed to primary target.

133
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,256
Descending to 200 feet.

134
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,638
Ridge coming up in six seconds.

135
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,434
I got it.

136
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,688
Whoo! Very nicely done!

137
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:27,813
Excellent.

138
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,529
- Switching to autopilot.
- Almost as good as me.

139
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,822
I left a few trees behind.
I'll try to do better next time.

140
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,788
You love this shit, don't you?

141
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:38,246
Where else can you fly a $2 billion plane...

142
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,873
..800 miles per hour
100 feet off the ground?

143
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:43,667
Well, that is a fact. That is a fact.

144
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,543
You're in for life, huh?

145
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,878
As long as they'll have me. Aren't you?

146
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:52,593
No, no, no, no. I don't think so.

147
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,759
I mean, come on...

148
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,846
You even said it yourself.

149
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,931
I should be colonel by now.

150
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,562
Instead, idiots like Boone become general.

151
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:05,059
- Boone is not such a bad guy.
- Oh, come on!

152
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:08,654
If a thought goes through his head,
it's the quickest trip in America!

153
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:10,533
(both chuckle)

154
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:11,649
Nah...

155
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,123
Flying doesn't mean
what it used to mean to me.

156
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,870
No, not the flying. Carrying the nukes.

157
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,329
I know you love
having the power of God at your fingertips.

158
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:24,498
You get off on it.

159
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,057
Look out your window.

160
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:43,149
There's something wrong
with the terrain following.

161
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:46,569
Shouldn't that starboard ridge
be on our port side?

162
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,542
(alarm buzzing)

163
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,051
Here she comes.

164
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,525
(Hale) No!

165
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:29,609
What are you doing?

166
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:06,229
Clyde, I'm looking at half the valley
and nothing's going...

167
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,610
Holy shit!

168
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,114
- I got 'em!
- (Cheering)

169
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,116
McMurran!

170
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:02,157
This is Deakins!
Hale's lost it! I'm punching out!

171
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,321
Oh, shit!

172
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:36,114
Get me Search and Rescue!
We got pilots down!

173
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,996
The plane crashed 18 minutes ago.

174
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,043
The White House Chief of Staff
is on his way up.

175
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,882
Good morning, gentlemen!

176
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,051
So, do I wake the President?

177
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,602
- Bill.
- Jack.

178
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,141
Well, what have we got?

179
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,644
We're going out with this.

180
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:09,813
Rick's team prepared it.

181
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:15,911
The United States AirForce
regrets to announce that early this morning...

182
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,486
..a C-141 heavy-lift cargo plane went down...

183
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:22,793
..over the Utah desert. Crew status
has yet to be determined. Yadda yadda...

184
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,292
Well, that's very nice bullshit, Rick.

185
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:28,706
- Thank you, sir.
- We'll go with that.

186
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,129
Wait!

187
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,130
We're making a mistake.

188
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,759
Giles?

189
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,639
You have some input
you wish to share with us?

190
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,308
Yes, sir.

191
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,520
Aviation Week...

192
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,733
..has been following the development
of the B-3 for years.

193
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:54,533
They have stringers, ...

194
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:57,987
..guys camping in lawn chairs
by the Whiteman perimeter fence...

195
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,618
..watching for one of these things to take off.

196
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,499
They're gonna know...

197
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,871
..that one took off last night
and they're gonna know...

198
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,837
..that it didn't come back.

199
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,925
When our press release says
a C-141 went down in Utah, ...

200
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,003
..they'll put two and two together.

201
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:15,005
Aviation Week will run a story.

202
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,423
Everyone will know what really happened...

203
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:20,269
..and we're all gonna look extremely stupid.

204
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:21,972
(murmuring)

205
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:24,554
We're better off just telling the truth.

206
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,227
The truth?

207
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:28,891
- How did you get this job?
- (Laughter)

208
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:39,862
- Rewrite it, like Giles said.
- Yes, sir.

209
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:45,670
I want you to go to Utah.
I'll have my C-21 standing by.

210
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,830
It was good work in there.

211
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,416
Guys in lawn chairs...

212
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:54,509
I don't know, Giles...
Sometimes you scare me.

213
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,340
Hell, sir, ...

214
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,389
..sometimes I scare myself!

215
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:03,770
Go! Move! Move!

216
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,026
Thomas, over there!

217
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,157
Reed, check over there!

218
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,321
Kelly, check over there!

219
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:27,037
(bleeping)

220
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,505
Anything?

221
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,554
Not a goddamn thing!

222
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,801
Colonel! This is Rhodes!

223
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:41,926
Go, Max.

224
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,224
Aircraft disintegrated.
Negative survivors on site.

225
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,596
Checking payload!

226
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:49,314
You watch your needles there, Chief!

227
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,781
Over here!

228
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,201
(whistles)

229
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,029
Over here!

230
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:12,923
Take that end!

231
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,436
The nukes are gone.

232
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:40,991
Colonel!

233
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,158
We got ourselves a Broken Arrow.

234
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:50,331
You find those nukes, Chief.

235
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:55,086
If your Geigers pick up more rads
than you get off a toaster, I want you out!

236
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,093
A broken what?

237
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,223
Broken Arrow.

238
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,884
It's a Class 4 Strategic Theater Emergency.

239
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,016
It's what we call it
when we lose a nuclear weapon.

240
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,147
I don't know what's scarier.

241
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,228
Losing nuclear weapons, ...

242
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:14,238
..or that it happens so often
there's a term for it!

243
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:18,487
They found the wreckage
about 90 miles outside of McMurran.

244
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,654
No bombs on board.

245
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,823
This is a real nightmare.

246
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,668
We don't know where the hell
the damn things are.

247
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,294
- Captain.
- Sir?

248
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,795
Put two more teams in the air.
I want Chief Rhodes backed up.

249
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,720
Why didn't they go off?

250
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,883
They have to be armed to detonate.

251
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:43,597
They're designed to survive crashes intact.

252
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:47,352
They could lie in burning jet fuel
for five hours, no problem.

253
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,647
So what the hell happened?

254
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,196
In his last transmission, Major Deakins
said that Captain Hale lost control.

255
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:59,240
It's possible one of them may have hit
weapons release during the confusion.

256
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,714
Agh!

257
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,501
Deakins...

258
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:03,677
You won that round.

259
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,109
Sir! Please turn around.

260
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,773
Who the hell are you?

261
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:54,152
Park ranger.

262
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:59,944
Just put it down and I won't have to kill you.

263
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:02,903
This isn't a standoff. I've got the gun.

264
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,034
I never keep it loaded.

265
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:20,129
I thought you said it wasn't loaded.

266
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,638
I lied. Now, who the hell are you?

267
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:26,348
I'm a captain in the United States Air Force.

268
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,976
Well, Captain, you're under arrest.

269
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,983
Lady, you're missing the bigger picture here.

270
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,608
Hold still.

271
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:42,325
All right?
I have already had a hell of a morning, lady.

272
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,828
Now, I can't tell you what's going on,
but I need your help.

273
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,288
This is a good way to convince me.

274
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,799
We both know the gun is loaded, ...

275
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:00,757
..so if I wanted,
I could blow your head off. Right?

276
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,600
Yeah.

277
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,143
But I'm not going to.

278
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:11,937
Come on.

279
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:27,331
I got a radio in my truck.

280
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:33,789
It's this way.

281
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,975
Got 'em!

282
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,165
(rapid bleeping)

283
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,673
We got one.

284
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,591
(truck)

285
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,569
- How are you doing?
- Hey!

286
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,989
You guys need any help?

287
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,041
Air Force training exercise, sir.

288
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,161
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

289
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,544
Hey, no problem. We just, uh...

290
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,919
Oh, Jeez...

291
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,426
Argh!

292
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,949
Any sign of Deakins?

293
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,918
Maybe the son of a bitch is dead.

294
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,958
(Deakins) What a terrible thing to say!

295
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,594
Get 'em.

296
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,307
You assured me
everything would go smoothly!

297
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,436
It is going smoothly, I assure you.

298
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:54,560
Our merchandise
is not where it's supposed to be!

299
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:57,024
It's right down there, Mr Pritchett.

300
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,189
Everything's on schedule.

301
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:03,658
(rapid bleeping)

302
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:14,542
Sir? We got one intact.

303
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:18,416
Let's go find the other one!
Move! Let's go!

304
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,919
Care for a Coke or something?

305
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:23,883
Two gunships just left McMurran,
headed this way.

306
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:25,254
Oh, wonderful!

307
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,426
- Don't worry about them.
- I worry.

308
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,057
What about the other pilot?
We saw him eject.

309
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:32,020
Hah!

310
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:35,982
Captain Hale...
Well, I seriously doubt he's alive.

311
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:39,273
I punched him out
when we were scraping the valley floor.

312
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:41,440
A park ranger called in a report.

313
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,941
She saw a pilot come down
and was gonna look for him.

314
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,415
Find her.

315
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:58,999
- I got it!
- (Rapid bleeping)

316
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,632
Hello! McMurran, come in!

317
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:06,923
Go, Max.

318
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,809
McMurran, come in. Over.

319
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:10,175
- (static)
- McMurran!

320
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:12,311
Max, are you there?

321
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:14,806
- McMurran?
- Max!

322
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:17,275
McMurran, come in!

323
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:19,690
(machine-gun fire)

324
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,216
Move!

325
00:30:44,932 --> 00:30:47,138
Gonna open up the access panels.

326
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:49,598
Gonna drop in a couple of grenades.

327
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:52,890
It won't go nuclear,
but it will destroy the bomb.

328
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,143
And who's ever trying to steal it.

329
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,905
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Chief.

330
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,240
And why not?

331
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,417
All clear!

332
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:48,736
- Where is this truck of yours?
- Just around the bend.

333
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:51,286
- How did you find me?
- Saw your chute.

334
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,119
Don't step on that stuff!

335
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,286
There, on that black stuff!

336
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,546
- What is it?
- It's cryptogamic soil. Very fragile.

337
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,966
One footprint takes centuries to repair.

338
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,129
- Oh...
- Come on, jump.

339
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,713
I thought it was a mine or something.

340
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:10,848
Endangered dirt. That's a new one.

341
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,938
(buzzing)

342
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,316
Colonel Wilkins! This is Airman Kelly, sir!

343
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,025
- Go.
- Chief Rhodes is dead!

344
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:23,490
They're all dead!

345
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,778
What the hell happened?
What the hell happened!

346
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,993
(razor buzzes)

347
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,491
It's the nuke! It's open!

348
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,660
It's wide open!

349
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:35,832
Kelly! Come in!

350
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,878
What happened?

351
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,084
Oh, God!

352
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,300
What am I gonna do!

353
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,593
- Whoo!
- (Laughs)

354
00:32:51,478 --> 00:32:53,555
Recall Search and Rescue.

355
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:55,640
Get me Washington.

356
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:57,772
I want NEST on this right now.

357
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,728
- You missed your calling, boy!
- Hell, Deak! I even bought it!

358
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:05,357
Make sure you get Hale! Go!

359
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,701
There are still two attack helicopters
headed this way!

360
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:11,457
Not any more!
They've just been recalled!

361
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,874
I'll check further ahead!
That's where they're headed!

362
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:17,037
Get to work!

363
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:27,136
You see, Mr Pritchett,
they believe they've got an exposed core...

364
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:30,059
..and that changes things remarkably.

365
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:34,686
Cos it wouldn't be right to just send people
into an active radiation area.

366
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,809
First you have to take a picture
from a satellite.

367
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:40,772
It takes about an hour and a half
just to change orbit.

368
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:43,270
Then they gotta send in a NEST.

369
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,903
That's a Nuclear Emergency Search Team.

370
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:48,828
Closest one is about two hours from here.

371
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:51,238
So, by the time they find us, we'll be gone!

372
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,790
So relax!

373
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:05,168
- Think your radio can reach McMurran?
- Clyde will patch us through.

374
00:34:05,263 --> 00:34:09,676
We can get your people in here,
then I can go home and feed my dog.

375
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,356
Clyde, this is Terry. Do you read me?

376
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:38,705
Hello, Clyde. This is Terry.

377
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:40,671
Do you read me?

378
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:25,250
- Why are they shooting at us?
- No time to discuss it right now.

379
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:27,219
Come on!

380
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:29,298
Let's have some fun!

381
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,927
(machine-gun fire)

382
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,865
- You okay?
- Yeah.

383
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:50,032
Gimme your gun.

384
00:35:56,585 --> 00:35:58,044
Come on!

385
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,880
(gun clicks)

386
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,896
- You have any more bullets?
- Yeah.

387
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,693
We need to get out of this canyon.

388
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,655
We can get out up that way.

389
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,324
If that bastard would just hold still...

390
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:38,161
I have an idea!

391
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:39,795
Wait! I didn't mean...

392
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:55,426
Oh, shit...

393
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:01,856
Don't shoot!

394
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,775
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

395
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,420
Oh, no!

396
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:46,983
Go, go, go!

397
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,035
(Pritchett) Holy shit!

398
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,050
Novacek must have hit a canyon wall.

399
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:06,715
- Do you think?
- Maybe.

400
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,879
Maybe?

401
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:12,138
You said you'd planned this thing carefully!

402
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:14,930
How are we going to move those things now?

403
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,514
(Deakins) Use the trucks.

404
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,852
The trucks now!

405
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,265
You listen to me...

406
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,143
I've spent a lot of money underwriting this,
and frankly, ...

407
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:28,857
..you're beginning to shake my confidence!

408
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,369
Mm-hm... mm-hm... Well...

409
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:37,082
Yeah, well, I uh...

410
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,076
I do appreciate the money...

411
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:42,669
..that you and your associates
have invested in this operation.

412
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:45,923
But it is an operation,
a military operation, ...

413
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,251
..and you don't know dick about that.

414
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,671
I've been in the military for 20 years.

415
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:54,098
I planned and flew
over 100 missions in the Gulf.

416
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:57,885
These boys are motivated
and they are highly trained, like me.

417
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,103
This is what I do, Mr Pritchett.

418
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:04,354
This is battle,
and battle is a highly fluid situation.

419
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,316
You... plan on your contingencies, and I have.

420
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,530
You keep your initiative, and I will.

421
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:13,152
But you don't share command.
It's never a good idea.

422
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:16,327
It's still my money.

423
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:22,377
And if we succeed,
you and your friends will get a ton of it.

424
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:23,839
If we're successful?

425
00:39:23,924 --> 00:39:28,087
Look, Mr Pritchett, I will deliver
the weapons to the destination.

426
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,052
But I can't guarantee...

427
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:33,638
..that the assholes in Washington
won't do something stupid, ...

428
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:35,635
..like... not pay.

429
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,012
What if they don't?

430
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:40,181
Well, if they don't, ...

431
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:44,104
..the Southwest
will be a quiet neighbourhood...

432
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:46,270
..for about 10,000 years.

433
00:39:52,745 --> 00:39:55,283
- (phone)
- Wilkins.

434
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,623
Fax me their last transmission.
How much radiation is out there?

435
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,835
- Fax that to Mr Prentice.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:07,050
- So far we're not picking up any.
- Well, that's strange, isn't it?

437
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:09,258
I mean, ... with an exposed core?

438
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:12,382
Well, I'd call it good news.
The breach may not be so bad.

439
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:29,281
Colonel, ...

440
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,738
What if this wasn't an accident?

441
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:34,278
What are you saying, Giles?

442
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:38,238
In his final transmission,
Major Deakins said Captain Hale lost it.

443
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,326
We all assume that to mean...

444
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:42,542
..pilot error or equipment failure.

445
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:44,005
But...

446
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,007
..what if he meant...

447
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:50,378
- ..Hale intentionally lost the plane?
- Why would he do that?

448
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:53,092
Two nuclear weapons
would be worth a lot of money.

449
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:54,213
To who, son?

450
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:57,143
There are easier ways
to buy nuclear weapons.

451
00:40:57,228 --> 00:41:01,391
The old Soviet republics will sell you
a couple for the price of a BMW.

452
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:03,356
Sir, ...

453
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:06,894
..l meant how much
would they be worth to us.

454
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:09,313
How much would we pay
to get them back?

455
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,281
Hold on.

456
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:16,994
These nukes have codes or something
to stop people using them.

457
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,113
Of course.

458
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,122
And no-one knows these codes,
except for the President and you guys?

459
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,999
Access to codes
requires the highest security.

460
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,257
Yeah, but not even the pilots
have these codes, right?

461
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:30,336
Where's that NEST team?

462
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:34,557
They just took off, sir.
The ETA in Utah is 96 minutes.

463
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,979
- Left ten, left.
- Ten-four.

464
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,492
- It's okay...
- It's not okay!

465
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:02,042
I wanna know what's going on,
and I wanna know right now!

466
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,967
We were carrying nuclear weapons
on our plane last night.

467
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:19,638
My former commander
is trying to steal them.

468
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:25,353
- Oh, my God!
- That's why I need your help.

469
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,945
But without the helicopter
he won't be able to move them.

470
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:34,658
No, no. Deak'll have a backup plan.
He'll be prepared for that.

471
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:38,032
Trucks!

472
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:41,457
He's got trucks! Last night...

473
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:45,043
..Clyde told me someone came through
the Needles Gate with trucks!

474
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:49,916
He won't take 'em towards town.
What else is around here?

475
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,590
The river.

476
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,351
(coughs) Do you mind?

477
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:09,730
No, I don't mind at all.

478
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:13,609
Care for one?

479
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:16,744
(chuckling)

480
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:35,380
The one in the front has got the nukes in.

481
00:43:35,474 --> 00:43:36,636
How do you know?

482
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:39,845
There's only a driver.
They're keeping the weight down.

483
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:43,520
- Give me your gun again, will ya?
- What are you gonna do?

484
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:46,561
Well, ... I'll think of something.

485
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:49,688
Wait... We know where they are.
Let's phone for help.

486
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,567
If they make it to the river,
I'm gonna lose 'em again.

487
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,107
But you get to the phone, okay?

488
00:43:56,245 --> 00:43:58,653
- Then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

489
00:43:58,748 --> 00:44:02,532
- You're gonna need help!
- Lady, I don't have time to argue.

490
00:44:02,627 --> 00:44:05,034
The nuclear weapons are my responsibility.

491
00:44:05,129 --> 00:44:07,537
You're a park ranger. I'm a military officer.

492
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:09,007
Go to the phone.

493
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:27,732
(Terry) Oh, this is a bad idea!

494
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,075
- Hi!
- Hi.

495
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,989
Hale! Goddamn!

496
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:02,601
Run him down.

497
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:05,684
Get him! Get him!

498
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:10,650
Get him, goddammit!

499
00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:21,949
Fuck!

500
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:28,125
Don't panic. Bulletproof glass.

501
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:31,801
You can get out now.

502
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:35,295
It looks like we got ourselves a standoff!

503
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:37,512
Aargh!

504
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,473
No... we... don't!

505
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,734
Go! Go!

506
00:45:52,698 --> 00:45:54,774
Okay... You can come.

507
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,697
Goddamn!

508
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:09,586
Would you mind not shooting
at the thermonuclear weapons?

509
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:23,555
- Where's St Jude's Hospital from here?
- Salt Lake City, I think.

510
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,524
- Shit!
- What?

511
00:46:35,617 --> 00:46:38,951
- We're losing gas!
- They must have hit the tank.

512
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:41,742
We have to find some place
to hide these things.

513
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,741
I know a place.

514
00:47:02,812 --> 00:47:04,140
What are you up to, Hale?

515
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:15,355
Don't even...

516
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,237
Stop!

517
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,004
Oh, fuck!

518
00:47:36,471 --> 00:47:38,963
You learn that in survival school?

519
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,717
New Jersey.

520
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:42,885
Trenton, New Jersey.

521
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,792
What is this place?

522
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:20,471
It used to be a copper mine.
They shut it down a couple of years ago.

523
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:26,143
Why would they have a new lock?

524
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:33,821
(Hale) All right!

525
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:39,695
Good move, Hale. I didn't see it coming.

526
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,992
But you're definitely gonna pay for it.

527
00:48:43,082 --> 00:48:44,955
Saddle up, boys!

528
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:21,654
This place has been prepped.

529
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:23,822
Deak's been here.

530
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,451
You think he's coming back?

531
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:30,915
That'd be my guess.
We may not have a lot of time.

532
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:32,548
What are we gonna do?

533
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:35,459
(sighs)

534
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:43,761
We just take away
his reason for being here.

535
00:49:44,144 --> 00:49:46,718
Wanna help me unload these things?

536
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,609
Where do you think they're going?

537
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:57,698
Same place we were.
It's the only thing on this road.

538
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:10,664
My God!

539
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:19,836
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

540
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,849
When you fly with nuclear weapons,
you're trained...

541
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:26,849
..to retrieve if possible,
disable if necessary, destroy if essential.

542
00:50:26,938 --> 00:50:28,516
What are we doing?

543
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,768
I'm gonna disable it.

544
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:36,812
You have to arm these things with a code.

545
00:50:36,907 --> 00:50:40,323
If you enter the wrong code three times,
the nuke goes dead.

546
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,614
All the circuitry shuts down and shorts out.

547
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:48,451
Pretty soon these things'll be
nothing more than paperweights.

548
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:49,742
(bleeping)

549
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:55,500
Hale! Pick up!

550
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,963
Pick up!

551
00:50:59,764 --> 00:51:02,255
Come on, buddy. Pick up the phone.

552
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,885
Buddy, huh?

553
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:08,311
Son of a bitch!
You tried to kill me! Friendship is over.

554
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,437
That doesn't mean I don't like you.

555
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,352
Hell, I'm impressed!

556
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:15,444
I figured you'd have packed up
and walked off by now.

557
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,199
Well, you figured wrong.
Now I get the nukes.

558
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,774
Guess what, Deak?
I'm gonna deactivate 'em.

559
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,364
- (buttons bleep)
- I'm punching in the wrong codes.

560
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,121
Pretty soon these things
are gonna be absolutely useless.

561
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,918
You might as well drive away.

562
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,673
Outstanding, Hale! That's the spirit!

563
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,504
Damn! I'm totally screwed now!

564
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,215
Unless, of course,
I'd already thought of that.

565
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,476
What?

566
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,347
You're kidding!

567
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,100
Didn't work, did it?

568
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,434
I used uncoded circuit boards.

569
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,147
You just activated a nuclear warhead,
my friend.

570
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,025
Setting off a nuke in this mine
has been in the plan from day one.

571
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,449
Otherwise, some DC civilian
might say I haven't got the guts.

572
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,081
Fuck!

573
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,872
He's insane!

574
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:16,088
Hale, I considered bringing you in on this.

575
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:19,509
- You know why l didn't?
- Because I would've said no?

576
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,672
Nah. Then I'd have just killed you.

577
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:23,971
I was afraid that you would say yes.

578
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,309
Because you don't have the balls
to go through with this.

579
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,558
We both know that.

580
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,520
- How deep is this mine?
- Uh...

581
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:37,188
About 2,000 feet.

582
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:40,109
That's plenty.

583
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,494
I'm gonna be there in a few minutes.
My advice to you is to get out now.

584
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,619
It's your last move, buddy.

585
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:51,120
I can think of another move, Deak.
I'm gonna keep these things together.

586
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:54,830
If one goes off, the other gets buried
under a billion tons of rock.

587
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:59,052
- How's that sound, huh?
- You wouldn't do that.

588
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:02,422
Are you sure about that, ... buddy?

589
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:05,306
Shit! Fuck! He's gonna do it!

590
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:06,887
Let's get 'em!

591
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:10,394
All right.
We gotta be gone before he gets here.

592
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:20,024
I can't do this!

593
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,987
Listen, you told me
this is a copper mine, right?

594
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:24,536
- Right?
- Right.

595
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:28,958
The blast will fuse this place
into one big, solid, copper pot.

596
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:30,667
- But they're coming!
- That's right.

597
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:34,335
If I don't get these things
down to a safe level first, ...

598
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,629
..God knows where he'll use them.

599
00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:50,225
Just keep an eye on the timer, okay?

600
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,491
All right.

601
00:54:44,244 --> 00:54:46,321
(low rumbling)

602
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,413
What is that noise?

603
00:54:56,632 --> 00:55:00,297
Water. There's an underground river
beneath this place.

604
00:55:00,386 --> 00:55:02,877
All right, let's get these unloaded.

605
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:32,868
I understand, sir.

606
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:37,125
I'll advise NEST and as soon as they confirm
the ground is clean, ...

607
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:40,549
..I'll send in a dozen gunships.
We'll secure the area.

608
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:42,510
Yes, sir.

609
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,594
Giles Prentice, sir.
I got here as soon as I could.

610
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:49,056
- Wilkins. Good to meet you.
- Likewise, sir.

611
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:52,062
That was the chairman, Mr Prentice.

612
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:56,060
According to an NSA radio intercept,
you were right.

613
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,437
But it's Deakins stealing the nukes.
Not Hale.

614
00:56:17,382 --> 00:56:19,339
(Terry) Now what?

615
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:22,343
Now we get outta here before he shows up.

616
00:56:40,155 --> 00:56:42,231
How many times do I have to say it?

617
00:56:42,324 --> 00:56:45,195
Please don't shoot the nuclear weapons.

618
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,119
Kelly! We've found the nuke.
We're at the end of tunnel A.

619
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,164
Put the cold one on the elevator.
We'll be right along.

620
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:46,547
A service tunnel! Come on!

621
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,139
Make sure Hale doesn't get back to the bomb.

622
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,228
And, Johnson...

623
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:54,352
The clock is ticking.

624
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:01,936
Hm...

625
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,670
- Where are you taking us?
- Back to the elevator.

626
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,846
These service tunnels
run between the main shafts.

627
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:29,387
Now, if we take the next right...

628
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:31,223
(Terry screams)

629
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,901
Hey, Hale!

630
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:48,195
Nice move with the nukes!
Shows initiative, ...

631
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:50,778
..determination. Proud of ya!

632
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:53,699
But I think I gave us all too much time.

633
00:58:53,793 --> 00:58:56,284
30 whole minutes? I don't know...

634
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:59,380
Shows a lack of total commitment,
don't you think?

635
00:58:59,465 --> 00:59:01,173
I took it down to 13.

636
00:59:05,096 --> 00:59:07,172
I'll be right back.

637
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:21,687
(gun clicks)

638
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:26,877
All set.

639
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:29,048
We'll be right along.

640
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,817
(Terry) Are you okay?

641
01:01:43,842 --> 01:01:46,049
(Deakins) Well, ... I gotta go.

642
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:49,592
You two have a nice time down here.

643
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:55,890
And, uh... don't forget to say hi
to Johnson for me when you see him.

644
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,100
I got 20 bucks that says
you're gonna see him first.

645
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:01,268
- Really?
- Yeah.

646
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,611
You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City,
aren't you?

647
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:08,031
- Well, why do you say that?
- St Jude's Hospital?

648
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:10,573
You'll hide the warheads in Radiology...

649
01:02:10,662 --> 01:02:13,746
..so they don't show up
on any satellite scans. Right?

650
01:02:13,832 --> 01:02:17,366
- Huh! Well, I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

651
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:20,665
- So how much will you ask for?
- Lots.

652
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:24,587
I got a broker in Stockholm
who's gonna buy me 5% of Volvo.

653
01:02:24,676 --> 01:02:28,211
For the rest of my years,
I'm gonna live off the dividends, ...

654
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,381
..happy in the knowledge...

655
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:34,222
..that I'm helping to make
the safest automobiles in the world.

656
01:02:34,311 --> 01:02:36,719
So that's what this is all about?
The money?

657
01:02:36,814 --> 01:02:38,356
(chuckles) Yeah.

658
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,065
Bullshit.

659
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,902
Well, look, you tell me why. Go ahead.

660
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:45,070
You tell me why.

661
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:48,275
Because you've been passed over
for promotion so often...

662
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,692
..you wanna show the bastards you're right!

663
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:54,570
Maybe it's because
everybody's cashing out, so why not you?

664
01:02:54,665 --> 01:02:55,863
Fuck...

665
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:58,580
Or your mother dropped you
on your head as a baby.

666
01:02:58,669 --> 01:03:00,294
Who the hell cares, Deak?

667
01:03:00,379 --> 01:03:04,508
There's no difference between you
and a guy who shoots up a school yard.

668
01:03:04,592 --> 01:03:06,917
You both got a head full of bad wiring!

669
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:10,131
- What was that?
- You're fucked in the head, Deak!

670
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,260
Hah!

671
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:16,261
I pissed him off.

672
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:30,401
It's this way!

673
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:43,589
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell's the other one?

674
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:45,548
Shut up!

675
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:53,552
Help us. Come on!

676
01:03:59,482 --> 01:04:01,558
(clattering)

677
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:16,826
(Pritchett) Get the goddamn thing in!
Let's get outta here!

678
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:22,162
That was the only way out.

679
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:26,381
Man...

680
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:29,175
Well, that's it, then, isn't it?

681
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:50,358
You have any family?

682
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:54,820
No... Just me and Fred.

683
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:59,333
Fred... Who's Fred, your boyfriend?

684
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:01,669
No, my dog.

685
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:06,418
The river!

686
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,336
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

687
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:12,845
They... they... hit it,
uh... digging a tunnel!

688
01:05:12,932 --> 01:05:15,506
That's why they shut down the mine!

689
01:05:15,602 --> 01:05:17,096
Come on!

690
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:41,295
Hang on! Four minutes to detonation.

691
01:05:41,378 --> 01:05:43,916
You stupid bastard! We'll all be killed!

692
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,880
We'll be fine, Mr Pritchett.

693
01:05:45,966 --> 01:05:49,631
And will you please keep your voice down?
I'm concentrating.

694
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,676
This should be it!

695
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,908
This thing doesn't go anywhere.

696
01:06:21,169 --> 01:06:23,043
Ohh!

697
01:06:31,763 --> 01:06:33,637
One o'clock! On the road!

698
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:39,846
(gasping)

699
01:06:52,952 --> 01:06:55,525
Attention! We are federal agents!

700
01:06:55,621 --> 01:06:57,578
Stop your vehicle immediately!

701
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:59,325
Oh, God! Oh, God!

702
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:03,000
How does that gunship
fit into your grand strategy?

703
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:05,329
You don't know what you're doing.

704
01:07:05,423 --> 01:07:08,626
This is out of control! I must have been...

705
01:07:09,594 --> 01:07:11,670
(gagging)

706
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:14,133
Hush! Hush!

707
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:16,474
Stop your vehicle!

708
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,181
I repeat!
Stop your vehicle immediately!

709
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,448
Swing around in front of 'em!

710
01:07:38,373 --> 01:07:40,995
Do not move or you will be fired upon!

711
01:07:42,044 --> 01:07:42,993
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

712
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:45,329
We are federal agents!

713
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:47,462
Throw down your weapons...

714
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,626
..and keep your hands in sight!

715
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:14,066
I just realised something.

716
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,734
I never actually killed anyone before.

717
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,662
I mean, I dropped bombs on Baghdad, ...

718
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,992
..but... never face to face.

719
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:27,458
I don't know what the big deal is.
I really don't.

720
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:34,049
Turn your electronic equipment off now.

721
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:35,514
Throw down your weapons!

722
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:17,688
All right!

723
01:09:19,282 --> 01:09:20,990
We're losing power!

724
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:22,321
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

725
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:34,127
We've gone red! Triple red! All out!

726
01:09:40,387 --> 01:09:42,095
Wahoo!

727
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:51,223
I say, goddamn! What a rush!

728
01:09:55,027 --> 01:09:56,059
Whoo!

729
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,854
Son of a bitch!
Shock wave took down the damn chopper!

730
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:04,327
That's EMP. Electromagnetic pulse.
A nuclear blast sends it out for miles.

731
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:07,912
Anything electronic shuts down
including choppers and radios.

732
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:10,786
We just shut down
McMurran's field communications!

733
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:14,875
That'll put a pretty little dent
in their response time, huh?

734
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:17,503
- Deak, you the man!
- I'm the man!

735
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:20,380
Colonel Wilkins, sir?
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

736
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,427
We're fine. It was underground.

737
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:25,598
- Colonel Wilkins for General Creely.
- How do you know?

738
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:29,848
With a surface detonation we'd have
felt a different kind of ground tremor.

739
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:32,608
We'd also be burned, blind, and dying.

740
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:37,396
We're ten minutes behind.

741
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,813
Mr Pritchett,
would you mind stepping outside?

742
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,829
It went off underground, thank God!

743
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:56,998
What do we do now?

744
01:10:57,091 --> 01:11:00,543
First, we nail a huge goddamn lid
on this thing.

745
01:11:00,637 --> 01:11:03,424
And with all due respect to your boy Giles...

746
01:11:03,515 --> 01:11:06,634
..and his belief
that honesty is the best policy, ...

747
01:11:06,726 --> 01:11:09,431
..from now until the end of the world, ...

748
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:12,972
..what happened in Utah today
was an earthquake.

749
01:11:48,644 --> 01:11:50,970
Hey! It's okay...

750
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:54,397
- My God! We set off a nuclear bomb!
- The walls shielded the blast.

751
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:57,195
None of the radiation leaked out.
We're all right!

752
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,485
Look at my hands! Why are they shaking?

753
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:01,648
Because the water was freezing.

754
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:05,359
- No, that's not normal!
- It's okay. You're just cold.

755
01:12:06,246 --> 01:12:08,534
You just need to get warm, okay?

756
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:10,867
All right?

757
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,046
Hey, look!
You see the butterflies there?

758
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:21,749
If there was radiation around,
they wouldn't survive, would they?

759
01:12:21,845 --> 01:12:23,173
No.

760
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:25,339
Well...

761
01:12:25,933 --> 01:12:28,221
- Right?
- I guess not.

762
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:34,644
It says in the, uh... detonation manual...

763
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:39,230
..that if you see butterflies after detonation,
you're gonna be fine.

764
01:12:40,281 --> 01:12:41,691
Okay?

765
01:12:44,076 --> 01:12:46,152
It doesn't say that!

766
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:49,286
I promise you that we're fine.

767
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:58,167
How far down the riverbank
does this path go?

768
01:12:58,257 --> 01:12:59,835
Three or four miles.

769
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:04,092
We should be able to get to Deakins
before he gets outta here.

770
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:19,862
Wait!

771
01:13:25,035 --> 01:13:26,494
Hey!

772
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:29,248
- There's just two of them.
- (Man) Running late!

773
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:33,281
- (truck)
- There's more coming.

774
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:35,251
(tires screech)

775
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,879
Hey! I thought you said
Hale wouldn't be a problem.

776
01:13:44,972 --> 01:13:49,136
Yeah, well, he surprised me, too,
but he's dead, so let's go.

777
01:14:39,862 --> 01:14:41,321
Sink it?

778
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:43,030
Steal it.

779
01:14:56,713 --> 01:14:57,792
(man) Let's move it!

780
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,454
- They're coming!
- Get out of the boat!

781
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,009
Get out of the boat!

782
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,997
Your friends in Washington
should be getting the package about now.

783
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:41,168
Yep. I'm sure we got
their full and complete attention.

784
01:15:41,258 --> 01:15:42,587
Let's move it!

785
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:45,713
- We're on a tight schedule!
- (Engine starts)

786
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:23,418
$250 million by 14:00, Utah time.

787
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,835
This deadline is not negotiable.

788
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,005
The second device is on a timer.

789
01:16:28,098 --> 01:16:31,716
Shortly after you receive this,
the timer will be activated.

790
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,720
At 14:01, I will make a call.

791
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:36,482
If I find you've complied,
I will stop the timer.

792
01:16:36,565 --> 01:16:38,558
If you have not...

793
01:17:06,596 --> 01:17:09,965
- Yes. Yes, sir, I understand.
- (Phone rings)

794
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:13,176
- Creely.
- Please hold the line, sir.

795
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:18,186
The President is asking
if we know where the device is headed.

796
01:17:18,275 --> 01:17:21,975
If Deakins had a plane,
it could be anywhere. We just don't know.

797
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,102
I do.

798
01:17:24,031 --> 01:17:25,441
One moment, sir.

799
01:17:25,532 --> 01:17:29,696
General, they've found Captain Hale.
He's at Lake Powell.

800
01:17:48,723 --> 01:17:51,095
This is a really bad idea!

801
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:29,759
- Sir! The prisoner is secure!
- Good job, Tom!

802
01:18:29,848 --> 01:18:32,422
You gentlemen can RTB.
I'll take it from here.

803
01:18:32,518 --> 01:18:34,557
Roger, sir. Returning to base!

804
01:18:34,645 --> 01:18:37,136
They found the raft
on the other side of the lake.

805
01:18:37,231 --> 01:18:41,063
Tracks from a heavy truck
ran out when they hit the paved road.

806
01:18:42,027 --> 01:18:44,779
- What about the girl?
- What about her?

807
01:18:44,864 --> 01:18:47,485
What about her!
She's an innocent victim in this.

808
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:50,492
I got her involved.
When you guys find that truck, ...

809
01:18:50,578 --> 01:18:52,487
..you'll hit it with everything!

810
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,988
I don't want her becoming a casualty.

811
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,834
Maybe it's okay with you,
but we're military officers.

812
01:18:57,919 --> 01:18:59,793
We took an oath.

813
01:18:59,879 --> 01:19:03,628
As officers, we have a responsibility
to save that woman's life...

814
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:05,793
..and get back the weapon.

815
01:19:05,885 --> 01:19:09,753
I have a responsibility to follow orders
and return you to McMurran.

816
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:13,715
- Do you understand orders, Captain?
- Yes, sir. I do.

817
01:19:14,186 --> 01:19:15,431
Good.

818
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:23,185
Because I'm about to break them.

819
01:19:27,157 --> 01:19:29,316
Any argument, Mr Prentice?

820
01:19:29,409 --> 01:19:31,402
No, sir.

821
01:19:32,955 --> 01:19:35,956
Just for the record,
I'm not entirely a civilian.

822
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:40,288
I was actually a lieutenant
in the ROTC at Yale.

823
01:19:43,007 --> 01:19:45,083
Good for you, Lieutenant.

824
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:50,797
(Wilkins) ls the radio still down?

825
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:54,259
Afraid so. Your chopper
will be refueled in two minutes.

826
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,428
I wish I were going with you.

827
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:58,976
Captain, what exactly are you looking for?

828
01:19:59,065 --> 01:20:00,643
Tracks.

829
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:02,892
As in railroad tracks.

830
01:20:02,986 --> 01:20:06,106
Deak knows you'll cover
every inch of asphalt north of here.

831
01:20:06,197 --> 01:20:08,735
I'll bet 20 bucks that nuke is on a train.

832
01:20:09,284 --> 01:20:11,158
Let's see the map.

833
01:20:11,244 --> 01:20:15,242
All right. Salt Lake is northwest of here.
These tracks curve east first.

834
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:17,953
- Why would he do that?
- He's not going to Salt Lake.

835
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:23,047
But you found the radiology tag
from the hospital.

836
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:26,382
That's what's been bothering me.
I think he planted it.

837
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:30,418
He wanted whoever found it
to think that's where he was heading.

838
01:20:30,514 --> 01:20:33,135
- He's doing a rope-a-dope!
- He's doing a what?

839
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:35,716
Rope-a-dope.
You know? It's a boxing term.

840
01:20:35,811 --> 01:20:37,887
Ali and Foreman in Zaire?

841
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,767
Captain, I know what it is.
What's your point?

842
01:20:40,858 --> 01:20:45,437
If everything he shows us says west,
he's actually heading east.

843
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:48,906
Denver.

844
01:20:50,451 --> 01:20:53,488
You said you had Salt Lake
sealed up pretty tight.

845
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:56,153
What's gonna hurt
if we check out Denver?

846
01:21:15,352 --> 01:21:16,929
- Shepherd!
- Hey, Deak!

847
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,187
- Any trouble with the train crew?
- They went like lambs.

848
01:21:20,273 --> 01:21:22,729
Good. Let's get that satellite dish wired in.

849
01:21:22,818 --> 01:21:25,273
- Already done.
- Excellent!

850
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:28,648
With this remote
you can shut the bomb down face to face, ...

851
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,982
..or you can dial it in over the link.

852
01:21:31,076 --> 01:21:33,116
All right, let's close this deal.

853
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:35,825
Shepherd, I want to be airborne
in five minutes.

854
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:39,533
Kelly, contact Washington
and tell them the bomb's going to Denver.

855
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:43,411
Then contact Geneva. When the money's
there, I'll shut down our puppy.

856
01:21:43,506 --> 01:21:46,709
Smile, boys! We're about to retire!

857
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,924
Let's get this bird unwrapped!

858
01:22:24,047 --> 01:22:26,123
We haven't met. I'm Max!

859
01:22:35,643 --> 01:22:38,312
You probably thought
I was a computer nerd.

860
01:22:38,395 --> 01:22:40,602
(laughs) Wrong!

861
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,433
I was a Navy SEAL, lady.

862
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,775
You should see what I can do...
with just my thumb.

863
01:23:22,024 --> 01:23:23,186
(gun cocked)

864
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:43,752
You just saved me $3 million.
I owe you one.

865
01:23:43,838 --> 01:23:46,126
Shoot yourself. We'll call it square.

866
01:23:46,215 --> 01:23:48,291
Whoa! Attitude!

867
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,258
Now, where's my little buddy Hale?

868
01:23:54,015 --> 01:23:56,091
He left you alone, didn't he?

869
01:23:56,184 --> 01:23:59,719
Well, that's his speed - 100% pussy.

870
01:24:00,438 --> 01:24:02,810
He's got more guts than you think.

871
01:24:02,899 --> 01:24:04,726
(chuckles)

872
01:24:04,818 --> 01:24:07,772
But would he have enough guts
to eat a bullet...

873
01:24:07,862 --> 01:24:11,196
..before he'd help someone
vaporize a whole city?

874
01:24:11,825 --> 01:24:14,031
I think he'd fold. But not you.

875
01:24:14,703 --> 01:24:17,324
I think you've got more guts than he does.

876
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:19,739
I think you'd eat a bullet.

877
01:24:25,255 --> 01:24:27,331
Let's find out!

878
01:24:29,009 --> 01:24:31,049
Now, press four...

879
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:34,047
Ooh!

880
01:24:39,395 --> 01:24:41,471
I said push four.

881
01:24:44,191 --> 01:24:46,184
Go ahead.

882
01:24:46,277 --> 01:24:48,353
Push four!

883
01:24:53,659 --> 01:24:55,569
Ah...

884
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:56,776
Four.

885
01:24:59,749 --> 01:25:01,825
Eight.

886
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:05,081
Seven.

887
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,465
Go ahead.

888
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:10,626
- Please...
- Seven.

889
01:25:13,972 --> 01:25:17,637
Starting at ground zero
and moving out in concentric circles, ...

890
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:20,299
..we have, in terms of immediate effect, ...

891
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:22,767
..100% fatalities to 30 miles, ...

892
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:27,981
..90% at 40 miles, dropping roughly 10%
for every 10 miles after that.

893
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:30,444
Two.

894
01:25:32,282 --> 01:25:34,026
One.

895
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:39,285
Enter.

896
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:42,367
Enter...

897
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:44,911
We estimate...

898
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:48,084
..250,000 dead on impact, ...

899
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:52,041
..with another quarter million
projected within the year.

900
01:25:56,683 --> 01:25:58,343
Enter.

901
01:25:58,434 --> 01:26:00,641
Come on. Just push Enter and it's done.

902
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:06,725
Which is it gonna be, hm?

903
01:26:10,655 --> 01:26:12,731
Ah! Mm...

904
01:26:13,909 --> 01:26:17,527
You know, to tell the truth,
I thought you were gonna fold.

905
01:26:17,621 --> 01:26:20,456
Well, I'm dead either way, ...

906
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:23,328
..so do it yourself, asshole.

907
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:28,545
Open the door!

908
01:26:32,469 --> 01:26:34,177
Night-night, honey!

909
01:27:19,351 --> 01:27:21,972
- Cover me!
- Good luck!

910
01:27:27,985 --> 01:27:30,061
Bring it in!

911
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:55,088
Gimme your hand!

912
01:28:07,734 --> 01:28:10,023
Okay! You can come!

913
01:28:16,076 --> 01:28:17,404
Get me down there now!

914
01:28:30,883 --> 01:28:33,338
Let's give those guys a haircut!

915
01:28:39,225 --> 01:28:40,138
Shit!

916
01:28:40,226 --> 01:28:41,388
Get down!

917
01:28:52,822 --> 01:28:54,067
Freeze!

918
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:24,430
Wow!

919
01:29:24,521 --> 01:29:26,561
That was a first for me, too!

920
01:30:36,262 --> 01:30:38,219
This is where you two get off!

921
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,564
No!

922
01:31:33,612 --> 01:31:35,901
- We're leaving now!
- Yes, sir!

923
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,360
- Where's Shepherd?
- He should be here.

924
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:40,447
Find him!

925
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,208
Cut the power!

926
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,148
Goddamn you, Hale!

927
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:26,154
We'll never get clear in time.
We need to shut down the nuke.

928
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,657
You hear me? You need to disarm it!

929
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,828
Find Hale!

930
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:57,862
Oh, God! Your shoulder...

931
01:32:57,949 --> 01:32:59,942
Help me off with this!

932
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:01,910
Oh, God!

933
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:24,307
No matter what happens,
this train can't make it to the city.

934
01:33:24,393 --> 01:33:28,640
You stay here and uncouple the car.
I'm gonna go after Deakins.

935
01:33:31,025 --> 01:33:32,934
I'll see you soon.

936
01:33:33,027 --> 01:33:34,569
You promise?

937
01:33:52,463 --> 01:33:54,622
Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

938
01:34:04,893 --> 01:34:06,553
What the fuck are you doin'!

939
01:34:32,254 --> 01:34:34,710
Shut that son of a bitch down! Now!

940
01:34:34,798 --> 01:34:36,838
This ain't what I signed on for!

941
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:39,214
I'm not ready to die! Not for you!

942
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:43,886
Everybody dies, Kelly.
I'm as good a reason as any.

943
01:34:47,895 --> 01:34:50,303
Come on! Come on!

944
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:54,105
Hale!

945
01:34:58,114 --> 01:34:58,814
Incoming!

946
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:08,035
(screams)

947
01:35:27,853 --> 01:35:30,142
Come on out, Deak! It's over!

948
01:35:46,414 --> 01:35:48,490
(Deakins laughs)

949
01:35:51,169 --> 01:35:53,042
You lose.

950
01:35:53,129 --> 01:35:55,252
I've still got my finger on the trigger.

951
01:35:56,507 --> 01:36:00,505
That's the remote trigger.
You see, if I press this button here, ...

952
01:36:00,595 --> 01:36:02,054
..you lose.

953
01:36:03,515 --> 01:36:05,638
And if I push this button, ...

954
01:36:06,142 --> 01:36:08,716
..the weapon is disarmed.

955
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:11,055
Why don't you disarm it, then?

956
01:36:11,648 --> 01:36:13,641
I'm not in the mood.

957
01:36:13,733 --> 01:36:15,441
Now, get rid of your weapon.

958
01:36:15,944 --> 01:36:18,020
Get rid of your weapon!

959
01:36:20,198 --> 01:36:21,693
Come on!

960
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:27,241
Attaboy!

961
01:36:27,331 --> 01:36:30,616
You can shut it down.
You just have to come and get it.

962
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:33,710
And $20 that I took from you last night...

963
01:36:34,505 --> 01:36:36,581
..says that you won't.

964
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:42,003
You're out of your mind!

965
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:44,468
Yeah! Ain't it cool?

966
01:36:44,557 --> 01:36:47,012
I'm serious, Deak.
Your mind has gone off the map.

967
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,636
Maybe, but I'm still gonna kick your ass.

968
01:37:03,868 --> 01:37:06,786
You're bleeding, aren't ya?
Well, that's good!

969
01:37:06,871 --> 01:37:09,908
Let's see if we can't get any more out,
all righty?

970
01:37:32,356 --> 01:37:33,601
(presses buttons)

971
01:38:01,553 --> 01:38:04,044
Used to be, every fight went to a knockout.

972
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:06,345
You know what a knockout feels like?

973
01:38:26,745 --> 01:38:30,446
Your brain presses against your skull
and it feels like this!

974
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,802
Does it feel like that?

975
01:40:01,759 --> 01:40:02,874
(bleep)

976
01:41:31,268 --> 01:41:33,225
I win.

977
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:35,684
Sir, please turn around.

978
01:41:59,881 --> 01:42:01,957
My name's Riley Hale.

979
01:42:02,926 --> 01:42:05,002
Terry Carmichael.

980
01:42:05,428 --> 01:42:07,302
(Hale) Pleased to meet you.

981
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:09,962
(Terry) You know,
you're still under arrest, Captain.

982
01:42:10,058 --> 01:42:13,178
Oh, yeah?
I guess you'd better take me in.
