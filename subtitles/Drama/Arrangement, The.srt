1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:01,679
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

2
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:03,161
I really think we should
do something with this.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,787
That side of yourself is fearless,

4
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:06,465
and I find that very attractive.

5
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,401
I have to go somehow
convince McPherson not to sell

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,953
the story Kyle's been dying to direct.

7
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,137
What if you don't?

8
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:13,671
But oh, my God! I get
to meet Charlotte Banks!

9
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:15,166
- Yes!
- And her producing partner

10
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,296
saw me in the play,

11
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,809
and now I'm gonna be reading with her.

12
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,945
- That's amazing.
- Oh, my God!

13
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:22,881
She's getting totally sucked
in and it needs to stop,

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,366
and that was the whole
point of the photos.

15
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,368
What? You're the one
who leaked the photos?

16
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,251
Kyle West is really just a product

17
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:29,921
of the Institute of the Higher Mind.

18
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,989
This is sick, Hope.

19
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,858
I've taken the workshop myself.

20
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:35,010
- What?
- Terence, this is Shaun.

21
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,135
- Megan's friend.
- Yeah.

22
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,464
How hard did you fight for me?

23
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,104
How hard did you try to make
a different deal with her?

24
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,625
Don't come near me again.

25
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:52,773
So all the data for
the system goes where?

26
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:55,078
- Put on some server operated by you?
- Correct.

27
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:56,939
Okay, and how secure is that?

28
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,984
Well, if you're asking if
our servers can be hacked,

29
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,685
it's virtually impossible.

30
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,320
Virtually?

31
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,022
Look, I'll be honest with you.

32
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:06,791
We can give you the best
security system in the world,

33
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,529
and we will, but if
someone is just hell-bent

34
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:12,497
on getting past it to
invade your privacy,

35
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,698
they'll find a way.

36
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,467
What are we doing this for?

37
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,335
It's a very effective deterrent.

38
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:20,253
How many stalkers
have you had, Mr. West?

39
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,774
Three... ish.

40
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:24,242
You need to do something.

41
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,444
Hey, how's it going?

42
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,013
Quinn was just, uh,

43
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,737
walking me through how
this whole thing works.

44
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,349
It's crazy that somebody got in here.

45
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:32,984
It's really disturbing.

46
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,986
Well, we're installing
motion-detector lights,

47
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,188
there's sensors on
the doors and windows,

48
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,690
and we've got internal-external cameras,

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,824
carbon monoxide alarms...

50
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,359
Security cameras inside the house?

51
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:42,794
Well, if there's a
break-in, you want to know

52
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:44,262
exactly where the intruder is.

53
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,466
Right, but isn't the point
of all this other stuff

54
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,567
to prevent the break-ins
in the first place?

55
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:51,870
Sorry, obviously, I want
to do everything we can.

56
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,506
It's just the idea of
cameras makes me feel like

57
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:57,173
I'm gonna end up on
a sex tape somewhere.

58
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,545
No interior cameras.

59
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,882
Okay.

60
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,383
Thank you.

61
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,167
Okay, I'm off to set.

62
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:12,208
Zach told me that he's the only
one who checked her references.

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,256
This doesn't make you nervous?

64
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:16,161
It seems to make you nervous.

65
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:19,097
Okay, what is going on with you?

66
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,333
Kyle's house was broken into.

67
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,068
Now there's some woman
that we don't know

68
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,533
installing a new security system?

69
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,037
Why are you not all over this?

70
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,639
Kyle and I made a
mutual decision to take

71
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,240
a step back from each other.

72
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:31,719
Okay, what happened? Tell me.

73
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,679
So you can distance
yourself from the fray?

74
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:36,320
No.

75
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:39,584
So I can navigate what I'm
sure is an emotional minefield.

76
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:42,287
He's been wanting independence.
I'm respecting that.

77
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,555
What else happened?

78
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:46,448
The rest is between him and me.

79
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:49,661
Look, my job is a lot easier
when he has a clear head,

80
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,063
and this lovers' quarrel
that's between the two of you

81
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:53,531
does not help me right now.

82
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,876
Well, I'm sorry about that.

83
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,872
Does this conscious uncoupling
extend to the Institute as well?

84
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,241
Look, DeAnn, the sky
is not falling, okay?

85
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,243
I've got plenty of things to catch up on

86
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,846
until Kyle finds his
way back, which he will

87
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:11,740
as soon as he realizes that he
is not built to do this alone.

88
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,917
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:31,725

www.addic7ed.com

90
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,244
- Hello.
- There she is.

91
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,564
- Hello, my love.
- Hey, Charlotte.

92
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,217
Did you get some rest?

93
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:48,620
I laid down while I
read the sides 100 times.

94
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,188
Does that count?

95
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,756
I might be a little excited.

96
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,491
Well, so am I.

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,860
An actor's life for
me, thank you very much.

98
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,777
Hi-diddle-ee-dee.

99
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,633
Pinocchio?

100
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:05,136
"Hi-diddle-ee-dee, an
actor's life for me"?

101
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:07,050
Or not.

102
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,076
Megan.

103
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:14,045
- Lucas. Hi. First AD.
- Hey, Lucas.

104
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:17,454
- New pages for today.
- New pages?

105
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,051
Reflecting last night's changes.

106
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,736
40 minutes, yeah?

107
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,960
Thanks.

108
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,192
All of the lines are different.

109
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,160
It's a completely different scene.

110
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,628
Did you just get this too?

111
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:32,097
An hour ago.

112
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:34,297
You learn to work fast in television.

113
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,968
No, I just put in a lot of
work in the other version.

114
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,204
Well, we'll find the
moments as we go along.

115
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:42,368
Just focus on learning the lines.

116
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:44,275
Okay.

117
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,212
And I will have a word with Patrick.

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,115
- Patrick?
- The showrunner.

119
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,939
Oh, no, it's okay. I'll be fine.

120
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:56,229
No, it's not okay. You
can't treat your actors

121
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,554
like glorified props.

122
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,256
You think he'd try this
shit with Jeff Daniels?

123
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,591
He'd get his ass handed to him.

124
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:08,230
So have you given my
weekend idea any thought?

125
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:10,083
I like the idea...

126
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,867
I just think that time-wise,

127
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,737
I'm not ready for another seminar.

128
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:16,238
The Anatomy of Leadership,

129
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,808
I thought you... that
you would jump at that.

130
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,478
You're certainly qualified.

131
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:25,606
It's just hard to integrate
into my actual life.

132
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,718
My friends are resistant,

133
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,654
and the firm is a meat grinder.

134
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:35,558
There isn't a lot of solid
ground to build my column.

135
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,994
So you want a guarantee
before you make a commitment?

136
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,098
No. I didn't say guarantee.

137
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,633
Well, what's your word then?

138
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,535
The work only works
for you if you extend it

139
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:48,404
to the other people in your life.

140
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:53,976
You can't let an unfriendly
room get in the way.

141
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,328
Frame composition and camera movement.

142
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,587
Don't tell me you used to be a director.

143
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,456
No. Just a lot of my clients.

144
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,892
First rule: balance your frame.

145
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,627
Unless you're following
an unstable character,

146
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:14,163
in which case it's a
great rule to break.

147
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:15,798
- Speaking of which...
- Sorry.

148
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,510
Just a heads up, it's quarter till.

149
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:18,956
Thanks, Zach.

150
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,007
Look, I know you don't
want to live in a fortress.

151
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,274
Plenty of my clients feel the same way.

152
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,278
And I know you want to
make your girlfriend happy,

153
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,848
which is usually a good way to go,

154
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,740
but I've reread those police reports,

155
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,985
and this stalker of yours is
not exactly garden-variety.

156
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:41,741
I know.

157
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,520
Your old security system is old,

158
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,488
but it's not flimsy.

159
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:52,897
Whoever this person is, they
took the trouble to disarm it

160
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,493
and then didn't steal
anything, which tells me

161
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,999
the ultimate target was you.

162
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,726
Or it was about intimidation and fear.

163
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,739
So whoever did this draws
the line at vandalism.

164
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,037
Is that what you're holding on to?

165
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:06,939
What do you think would've
happened if you'd been there?

166
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,342
Or your girlfriend?

167
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,177
Look, if you're not
gonna install cameras,

168
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,346
I think you should consider this.

169
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:21,353
I'm assuming you had weapons
training for your movies.

170
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,790
Sure, but a gun in the house?

171
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,600
Loaded with live ammo?

172
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,135
- I don't know.
- Mm.

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,594
Gives you a fighting chance if
this person somehow comes back.

174
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,514
You don't have enough
protection without it.

175
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:40,701
And I wouldn't be doing my
job if I didn't tell you that.

176
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,172
Okay, everybody. Last looks.

177
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,010
- Hey, Megan?
- Yeah.

178
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,279
- I'm Patrick, the showrunner.
- Oh, hey. How's it going?

179
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,981
Good, good. Just, um,

180
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,844
seeing how you're
feeling about the lines.

181
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,901
I know you're learning
them on short notice, so...

182
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,336
Yeah, um...

183
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,605
pretty good, I guess.

184
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:02,541
Okay, well, we've got
a couple of options here

185
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,476
to give you some relief.

186
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,011
What kind of relief?

187
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,481
Okay, well, uh, option
one would be cue cards.

188
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,483
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

189
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,518
Uh, Lucas can hold them right by camera,

190
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,420
and you could go to them between takes

191
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:17,489
when we'll be cutting
away from you anyway.

192
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,691
Okay, uh, and what's the other option?

193
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,182
We give you this earpiece. We would just

194
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,919
- cover it with your hair...
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:25,197
And then cheat you away
from camera, so they can...

196
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,932
Oh, wait, guys. Slow down.

197
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,135
Everybody just take a breath.

198
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,582
Let me take Megan for a little walk.

199
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,355
She's cuffed to a chair.

200
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,504
Then leave so we can talk.

201
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,344
I'm turning off your mic.

202
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,955
Do not take the cue cards

203
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,024
or that ridiculous earpiece.

204
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,759
They tell you they want to help you,

205
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,527
but the next thing you
know, you've got a reputation

206
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,262
as a girl who can't learn her lines.

207
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,197
You're better than that,
and you're way better off

208
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,166
doing this on your own.

209
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,309
He loved me.

210
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,739
I don't know why you don't believe that.

211
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,411
Maybe you've never been loved.

212
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,349
Maybe that's why.

213
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:23,188
We found your blood
on the toe of his boot.

214
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,690
What kind of love is that?

215
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,458
Tell me.

216
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,060
And cut!

217
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:32,019
Okay, let's un-cuff Megan
and we are turning around.

218
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:39,485
Oh, my gosh. She's his girlfriend?

219
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,841
- Dude, it's Kyle West.
- But you're here.

220
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,609
I thought that was one of those movies

221
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:47,412
that's an excuse to tour Europe.

222
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:49,181
Croatia and Monaco eventually.

223
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,349
We start in L.A.

224
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,984
It gives me a chance to watch this one.

225
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:53,251
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

226
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,820
Hi.

227
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:56,855
This one is a major talent.

228
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,992
Keep her close.

229
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,393
She's being nice.

230
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,562
They changed all of
today's scenes last night,

231
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,896
and I don't know what
the hell I was doing.

232
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,765
Whoa. Whoa, Megan.

233
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,232
Nobody's saying that, okay?

234
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,576
You totally got through it.

235
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:10,702
I grew up idolizing her.

236
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,671
I wanna do more than
just get through it.

237
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,313
Look, I'm sorry to ask
you this right now, but...

238
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,415
were you planning on going
to your house after this?

239
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:24,716
Yeah, why?

240
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:26,985
Can you come to mine instead?

241
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:29,721
I don't like the idea of you
going alone to that rental

242
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,076
- with absolutely no security at all.
- Kyle...

243
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:34,793
Megan, now look, there is
some crazy asshole out there

244
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,762
who at minimum wants to
scare the shit out of me,

245
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,989
and he very easily
could come after you too.

246
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:45,482
I want you to move in with me.

247
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:47,672
Permanently.

248
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,538
My house is the safest
place for both of us.

249
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:50,675
Oh, my God.

250
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,345
I'm trying to work,
and I'm doing my best

251
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,546
not to freak out right now,

252
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:56,448
but you're making it really hard.

253
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:58,717
Uh, Megan, can we get
you back on set, please?

254
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,396
Yes. Absolutely. Right now.

255
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,791
Hey, how's it going?

256
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:08,060
Hey. How you doing?

257
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,165
There's been far too much concern

258
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,168
about potential negative imagery
and... and celebrity clientele,

259
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:19,538
and not enough focus on what
we actually have to offer here.

260
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,840
We... we have an incredible,
progressive system

261
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:23,341
for personal development,

262
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,118
and we need to make our presence felt.

263
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,214
The work deserves it.

264
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,583
And the world deserves the work.

265
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:34,953
So you'll talk with the facilitators?

266
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,322
This should be our approach
across the board from now on.

267
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:39,458
Yeah, I will.

268
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,693
Maybe they'll have
better luck than I have.

269
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,137
What does that mean?

270
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,298
Shaun has tapered off.

271
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:49,101
Oh. Yeah, I noticed.

272
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:50,778
I keep trying to bring
her to the next level,

273
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,171
but she says she's not ready.

274
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,675
Not ready for what, the next
level with IHM or with you?

275
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,611
Maybe both.

276
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,936
Yeah, probably not both.

277
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:07,668
Incoming, boys!

278
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,621
Watch my six!

279
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,921
We got a man down! Get
somebody over there now!

280
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:15,747
Fall back!

281
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:18,140
And cut it! Good!

282
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,530
Great, guys. Moving on.

283
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,634
Nice take, guys.

284
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,638
Hello, love.

285
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,858
Hey.

286
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,448
How's the house? How are you holding up?

287
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,809
The house is great.

288
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:33,245
Got it all cleaned up,
kick-ass new security system.

289
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:35,013
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

290
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,620
Well, I have some news
you're not gonna love,

291
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,084
but if we take a breath,

292
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,486
we'll see that there's a
real silver lining here.

293
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,355
Okay.

294
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:46,191
We no longer have the
rights to "The Resistance."

295
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,693
Rand didn't extend the option.

296
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,228
What?

297
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,796
Yeah, I was blindsided too.

298
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,265
The extension should
have been pro forma,

299
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,233
and the rights have
been sold to Premiere.

300
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,935
For who?

301
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,204
If you tell me Jeremy Renner,
I'm gonna lose my shit.

302
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,605
Then I won't tell you.

303
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,679
Son of a bitch.

304
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,443
Is this an Adam Westfeldt move?

305
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,806
Look, I don't know
what Adam was thinking.

306
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,947
No, he was thinking he could
pacify me with a directing job

307
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,283
and then kill it after I
signed off on Amelia Briggs.

308
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,251
That's exactly what happened.

309
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,994
Listen, I get that you're pissed.

310
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,188
So was I.

311
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:18,023
But we can try and
look at the opportunity

312
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,271
that this gives us.

313
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:20,972
"The Resistance" was the opportunity.

314
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:22,953
I found the story.

315
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,497
I've been working on
this for three years.

316
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,585
Then let's move on to
a different project.

317
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,510
One that's free of the studio's control.

318
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,846
Look, I know the timing sucks,

319
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:33,703
but this script...

320
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,483
this is a special one, Kyle.

321
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:37,118
Why don't you read this?

322
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,286
No.

323
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,254
I'm not moving on to anything else.

324
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:41,556
Somehow, people have started to think

325
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,224
that they can mess with me,

326
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:44,992
and I'm not gonna let it happen.

327
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:48,429
Kyle.

328
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:49,864
Tell them I need an hour.

329
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,315
Hey, buddy.

330
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,945
Doing some work on
yourself? That'd be good.

331
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,743
No, just checking in with
Terence. Talking long-term goals.

332
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,917
In other words, you, my friend.

333
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,485
We're not friends, Adam.

334
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,887
And we're not making
movies together anymore.

335
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:21,056
Okay, just slow down before
you go off half-cocked.

336
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,992
You screwed me twice.

337
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,627
It's not gonna happen a third time.

338
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:26,495
You're going back to the
Amelia Briggs thing now?

339
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,075
I put you in the best
possible situation to succeed.

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,657
I'd love to get screwed that way.

341
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,348
And killing "The Resistance"?

342
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,030
- What's your spin on that one?
- I didn't kill anything.

343
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:36,820
That was a legal snafu in the option

344
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,455
that DeAnn said she'd handle.

345
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,665
So it's DeAnn's fault

346
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,600
she didn't fix your screw-up.

347
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,059
It's DeAnn's fault
because she set the meeting

348
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,238
with the rights owner,
and then bailed on it.

349
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,589
I dropped the ball. That's fair.

350
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,465
But if you want to know
why "The Resistance"

351
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,357
is with Premiere right now,

352
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:58,192
that's why.

353
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,154
You really think that bullshit
story's gonna hold up in this town?

354
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:02,519
It's the truth,

355
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,278
and if you just take a breath,

356
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:07,035
we can sit down and actually
have a productive conversation

357
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,635
about what our next steps are.

358
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,865
This one's been incredibly productive.

359
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,847
You know, that last scene
was better than you think.

360
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,282
Oh...

361
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,059
no, I thought it was good,

362
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,218
- I just...
- I know.

363
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:35,622
You just wanted to break it
all down and figure it out.

364
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:37,291
But don't be afraid to let raw instinct

365
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,135
carry you once in a while.

366
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,128
Sometimes you get the
best stuff by not thinking

367
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:43,010
and just letting it be quick and dirty.

368
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:44,802
Are we still talking about acting?

369
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,061
It works for other things too.

370
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,236
Thanks.

371
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,741
And I'm glad I did
the scene with no help.

372
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,467
If you hadn't said something,
I probably would've taken

373
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,491
the earpiece just so
Patrick wouldn't freak out.

374
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,980
That's one of the biggest
problems in this business.

375
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,916
- People freak out.
- Hm.

376
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:05,376
When I did "Opposite of Jessica,"

377
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,232
there was this asshole studio
head who shall remain nameless.

378
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,243
Howard Levin!

379
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:13,970
Who told some assistant that
he didn't want to sleep with me

380
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,095
because I wasn't skinny enough.

381
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,822
- Gross. Are you kidding?
- Nope.

382
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,918
And the assistant blabbed to a producer,

383
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,153
and suddenly, they started
changing my wardrobe,

384
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:25,021
even the way they lit and shot me.

385
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,857
The entire production was terrified,

386
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,569
and I was a mess.

387
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:31,261
How did you get through that?

388
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,996
Shirley Tate.

389
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,698
She went to the producers and told them

390
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,326
that she and her multiple
Oscars were quitting

391
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,880
unless the nonsense stopped.
And the nonsense stopped.

392
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,371
I love that.

393
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
The original take-no-shit gangster.

394
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,809
She was a wonderful woman.

395
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,245
We stick together in this business.

396
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,470
Someday you'll pay it forward too.

397
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,217
Well, I appreciate you coming.

398
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:56,019
I understand work has you very busy.

399
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:58,691
Hmm. James been keeping you posted?

400
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,423
When I ask.

401
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:04,480
Oh, well, work's been pretty
much round the clock lately.

402
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:07,164
Yet you still managed
to come here today.

403
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,966
Well, like you said, you asked.

404
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,036
Yes, but I'm not your boss,
Shaun. You could've said no.

405
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:15,996
I know.

406
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,327
So maybe what I'm hearing
about you losing interest in IHM

407
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,873
isn't entirely accurate?

408
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,743
Wha... I never said

409
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,550
I was losing interest.

410
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,845
It's just hard to
figure out how it fits in

411
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,415
with the rest of my life.

412
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,683
But I am going to try and make

413
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,384
the Anatomy of Leadership this weekend.

414
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,553
Oh. Forget the seminar.

415
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,989
I've got something that
will eat up less of your time

416
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,425
and give you more bang for your buck.

417
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,160
We're starting a child
development program.

418
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,695
The First Life Initiative.

419
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,431
The idea is to create a path
to adulthood weaving education

420
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,546
with IHM's philosophies on awareness.

421
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,474
That... that sounds amazing.

422
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:54,138
I agree.

423
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,007
As a result, we've applied
for non-profit status,

424
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,209
but my in-house council
has decided to build

425
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,944
his column in Switzerland.

426
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,479
So you need a lawyer?

427
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,914
Yeah.

428
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,392
A good one.

429
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,117
Someone who knows how to
create a structure that will

430
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,852
help us avoid certain...

431
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,787
Regulatory inefficiencies.

432
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,589
Well said.

433
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,927
So are you ready to use
your powers for good?

434
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:27,552
Hello?

435
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,776
Hey.

436
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,011
I wasn't expecting you.

437
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,313
What's this?

438
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,882
You asked me to move in.

439
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,218
This isn't all your stuff, is it?

440
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,419
God, no.

441
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,921
This is, like, the tip of my iceberg.

442
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,091
But I'm prepared to bring
the rest under one condition.

443
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,367
You're prepared to go full iceberg?

444
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,529
- Oh, I am.
- Mm.

445
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,232
I love you,

446
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,868
and I want us to share
our lives with each other,

447
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,604
and I'm sorry for how I
reacted when you asked,

448
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:03,349
but you have to promise me that
you're not doing this out of fear.

449
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,410
Look, when... when Nic and I decided

450
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,378
to live with each other,

451
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,709
we did it to save money, but...

452
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:12,131
we weren't actually ready
to be with each other.

453
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,199
Uh, Megan...

454
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:15,219
And I just want to make
sure that you're ready.

455
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,054
Okay? This is a big step.

456
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,506
I know, and I'm really sorry
for the way that I asked.

457
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:23,194
It's this whole break-in thing.

458
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,563
Whoever this stalker is, uh...

459
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,031
I can deal with it.

460
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,017
I am dealing with it.

461
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,774
It's just...

462
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,578
I realized that you're
the only person in my life

463
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,407
that I can trust.

464
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,343
I'm surrounded by people who
use me to get what they want,

465
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,571
and I'm trying to figure
out a way to change all that.

466
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,392
What happened with you and Terence?

467
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,690
I gotta keep that between Terence and I.

468
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,559
Is that okay?

469
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,841
Sure, yeah.

470
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,628
It's your business.

471
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,331
But I am ready to live
with you and your iceberg

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,737
- in this house.
- Okay.

473
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:03,100
And I'm not afraid.

474
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,369
Good, because I already
made a date with the girls

475
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,772
to pack up my place tomorrow night.

476
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,574
Does it have to be at night?

477
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,175
- Kyle.
- I'm sorry, you know,

478
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,044
I'm just saying that this
guy is still out there,

479
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,178
and you can't just assume that
he's not gonna come after you.

480
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,328
I will lock the windows and the doors,

481
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:19,450
and then I'm gonna enjoy
saying good-bye to the place

482
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,385
I've lived in for, like, five years.

483
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,753
Okay?

484
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,290
- Okay.
- I'm gonna run a bath.

485
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:35,222
Out of everyone, you
surprise me the most.

486
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,715
Give me a chance to explain?

487
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,114
Nope, don't have time.

488
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:39,644
I gotta get some reading done.

489
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,859
You know, I do want to
ask you one thing, though.

490
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,660
If you didn't want me
directing "The Resistance,"

491
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,128
why didn't you just tell me?

492
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:47,498
I did want you to
direct "The Resistance,"

493
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:50,070
but then Adam let the
rights go, and I thought...

494
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,401
Please. I don't have time for
this he said, she said crap.

495
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:54,008
Kyle.

496
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:55,923
He let the rights go,
and I started to think

497
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:58,026
of the contingency plan
like any producer would,

498
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,161
and that's when I found
"Technicolor Highway,"

499
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,230
and I realized it is
a much better choice

500
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,865
for your first directing job.

501
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,933
It's edgy, it's contemporary,

502
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,869
you're not burdened by the
restrictions of the period.

503
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:10,705
There's a great part in it
for Megan, and best of all...

504
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,709
You still haven't answered my question.

505
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:16,569
Best of all, we can
make it independently.

506
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:19,391
No studio telling you
what it needs to be.

507
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,785
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd say no.

508
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,258
Thank you.

509
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,972
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got some work to do.

510
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:33,897
- Kyle...
- No, look,

511
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,273
I wanted to do the other movie.

512
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:36,807
I loved it.

513
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,209
Dreamed about it.

514
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:39,911
And I can't work with
someone who thinks they can

515
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,679
take that away from me.

516
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,485
Is this trash or donate?

517
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,820
Oh, I love that lamp.

518
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,423
I haggled with an old
Russian lady for 30 minutes

519
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,358
to get that down to ten bucks.

520
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:55,793
Well, it looks like ten bucks,

521
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:57,498
and it smells like paste.

522
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,764
Oh, chuck it.

523
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,601
Oh, my God!

524
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,136
- What?
- What were you, like,

525
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,901
running a daycare?

526
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,373
No, I like games.

527
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:13,614
You cannot take these to
that beautiful house, Megan.

528
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,948
Hey, I had to get three
paralegals to cover me at work,

529
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,749
so I got no time for nostalgia.

530
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:20,685
The only way to do this
right is to be ruthless.

531
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,020
Fine, donate.

532
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,755
Okey dokey.

533
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:26,857
Hi-dee-ho, ready to go!

534
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:30,035
Let's stuff some boxes, bitches.

535
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,929
That sound a lot less dirty

536
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,114
when I said it in my head.

537
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,089
Okay, that pile can be yours.

538
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,091
We're sorting into
keep, trash, and donate.

539
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,748
And a very warm hello to you, too.

540
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,907
Only keep the essentials.

541
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:44,609
We're being ruthless.

542
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:46,629
Ruthless, got it.

543
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:50,995
What is this?

544
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,450
Donate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

545
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,778
You cannot throw out
The Deck of Nonsense.

546
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:55,886
- See!
- Yes, we can.

547
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,288
- Oh!
- I told her.

548
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:58,990
Captain Party Pooper.
Put this in a safe place.

549
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:01,840
- Captain Party Pooper!
- This we don't care about.

550
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,520
He said he wanted to
strike out on his own?

551
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:04,795
Well, he made it very clear

552
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:06,664
he didn't want to work with me anymore.

553
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,428
That's unfortunate.

554
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,162
Unfortunate?

555
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:13,170
I don't know what you want me to say.

556
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,885
How about you tell me
what your plan B is?

557
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,376
Because I don't think he's
gonna wake up and realize

558
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,311
he needs us anytime soon.

559
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,413
He's not falling apart
like you imagined.

560
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:24,549
I never said anything about us.

561
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:29,387
Wow, I guess I missed the part
where it wasn't us anymore.

562
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,088
Did you?

563
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:32,923
'Cause I remember pretty
clearly you telling me

564
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:35,059
to stay in my lane, to
leave the producing to you.

565
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,994
I said that because
you went behind my back.

566
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,797
Which is exactly what
you just did with Kyle,

567
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,732
so maybe if you acknowledged
I had the better idea,

568
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,101
it wouldn't bother you so much.

569
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:46,082
Better for Kyle?

570
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,340
Of course.

571
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:54,744
There was a time when
you and I came first.

572
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,024
No matter what we did
or who we did it with,

573
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:00,626
we made sure that we were okay.

574
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:04,658
When did that change?

575
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:11,916
Lisbeth.

576
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,707
Kyle fell apart and he took us with him.

577
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,277
No.

578
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,743
He took you.

579
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,027
You might be right.

580
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,283
Look, I felt responsible.

581
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:25,754
Like I'd failed him,

582
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:28,449
and I've been overcompensating
since to make up for that.

583
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,512
DeAnn, I've done some things that I...

584
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:32,347
that I truly regret,

585
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,527
which I need to make right.

586
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:37,346
And I need to make
things right with you too.

587
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,361
What if Kyle really doesn't come back?

588
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:49,431
He will.

589
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,411
But if he doesn't,

590
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,136
will there be anything left of us?

591
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:00,342
Of course.

592
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,323
Have you read anything good yet?

593
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,692
Yeah, the only decent one
is about three generations

594
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,227
of Italian mobsters living in Sicily.

595
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:21,163
Isn't that "Godfather II"?

596
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:23,498
Pretty much.

597
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,709
How are you guys doing over there?

598
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:25,767
It's good.

599
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:27,502
Hope rescued my game stash,

600
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,371
so we're taking a tiny
little packing break.

601
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,505
Okay.

602
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,509
I'm gonna get back at it.

603
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:35,210
You okay over there by yourself?

604
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:41,516
Yeah, I'm okay.

605
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:44,663
Listen, you stay safe
over there, all right?

606
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:46,455
I'll hit you back in a bit.

607
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:48,142
Okay.

608
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,703
All right.

609
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,364
- Kyle.
- Oh!

610
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,900
Jesus.

611
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,406
- Forgot you were still here.
- Sorry.

612
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,205
I gave Juliet the new
codes for the gate.

613
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:06,074
She'll be here at
7:30 to cook breakfast.

614
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:08,143
Okay, good.

615
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:10,545
I was gonna take off for the
night, unless you need anything?

616
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,981
No. No, no, I'm good. Thanks.

617
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,202
Okay, no, I... no, I
seriously have you so beat.

618
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:26,884
Like, so badly.

619
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:28,733
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

620
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,791
- Lay it down, girl.
- Are you gonna sell it?

621
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,093
You know I'm gonna sell it.

622
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,999
Of course you would give me this card.

623
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,966
Of course you would. Okay, um...

624
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,622
Coming in a theater near you...

625
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:47,174
"Micropenis: The Movie."

626
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:51,902
I've literally seen that movie.

627
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:54,853
Like, so many times in real life.

628
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:56,407
I miss hanging out with you guys.

629
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:57,741
- I know.
- It's been so long.

630
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,243
Oh, shit!

631
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:00,844
You know what we should do right now?

632
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,708
We should go to Skylark Club for dinner

633
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,190
and make them give us
the employee discount.

634
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,413
- That would actually be awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:09,428
But I don't work at
Skylark Club anymore, so...

636
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,088
What? Why?

637
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:13,925
It was Bruno! He kept
bothering me to be a manager,

638
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,694
so eventually I just had
to tell him to go suck it.

639
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:19,563
Because he offered you a promotion?

640
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:21,865
Yes, because it means he
thinks I'm not gonna make it

641
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,200
as an actress, so...

642
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:24,635
Yeah, managing a restaurant is, like,

643
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:26,303
40 hours a week minimum.

644
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:27,871
There's no time to audition.

645
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,592
Oh, okay.

646
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,536
What does that even mean?

647
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:33,994
Do you have something to say, Shaun?

648
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:35,826
You... you made the right choice.

649
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,432
You're an amazing actress.

650
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,000
So stay strong, mi amiga.

651
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:40,301
And you.

652
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,606
Pick a card.

653
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,908
The road to hell is paved with...

654
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,276
Micropenises.

655
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,383
Jesus, are you seriously
worrying about a stalker

656
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:03,698
coming to get us?

657
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:06,154
Uh, I think I'm seriously drunk,

658
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:10,091
but I promised Kyle I'd
lock up, so I'm locking up.

659
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,626
So Kyle's a little worried?

660
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,194
A little. I get it.

661
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:15,696
I mean, he came home and his
place was totally trashed,

662
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:17,465
and the person's still out there.

663
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:20,701
Yeah, well, that person
didn't even take anything,

664
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,005
which just screams
of a giant power trip.

665
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,873
Hello? Who does that sound like?

666
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:27,826
Who does it sound like?

667
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,317
Gandhi.

668
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,229
Terence Anderson!

669
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:36,581
Why on Earth would Terence
break into Kyle's house?

670
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,720
Um, because he's creepy
and he runs a cult.

671
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,756
Did no one go to the police
with this information?

672
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:43,228
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

673
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:46,150
Actually, Kyle and Terence
did have a falling out.

674
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,972
Fine, but that doesn't mean

675
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:50,397
Terence would trash Kyle's house.

676
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:53,267
You... you seriously have no
idea what you're talking about

677
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:55,055
so you should just stop.

678
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,506
I'm not even sure why
you're defending him,

679
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,358
and B, why are you
being such an asshole?

680
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,931
Wha... I'm not the one talking shit

681
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,296
about someone I don't even know.

682
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:06,422
- You don't know him either.
- I do know Terence.

683
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,561
I've been going to
seminars at the Institute...

684
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,543
for weeks now.

685
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:16,621
What?

686
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:21,379
Terence asked me to help
him with some legal work.

687
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,857
Legal work?

688
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,692
I didn't realize you were that involved.

689
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:28,004
Holy shit, you're a pod person.

690
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:31,449
Totally explains why you
haven't been returning my calls.

691
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:34,244
Shaun, why didn't you tell me?

692
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:37,111
You're right.

693
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,373
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:42,279
But... trust me, Megan.

695
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:44,814
Terence is not your problem.

696
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,148
Oh, yeah, no.

697
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:47,950
No, for sure, totally not your problem.

698
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:51,278
He can manipulate your
boyfriend into firing you

699
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:52,688
off of his movie, but no,

700
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:54,890
don't worry about him;
he's not your problem.

701
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:58,143
How can you even just sit here
and act like you're the one

702
00:30:58,168 --> 00:30:59,829
who has Megan's back?

703
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:02,698
What, did you just
forget about what you did?

704
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,936
Okay, Shaun, enough.

705
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:10,640
No, I think this
conversation is way overdue.

706
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,350
I think this conversation
sucks right now.

707
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,543
What are you guys talking about?

708
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:16,108
Tell her.

709
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,400
- Or I will.
- Tell me what?

710
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,452
Hope's the one who
gave your naked pictures

711
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,010
to the press.

712
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,026
You did that?

713
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:33,011
Why?

714
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:35,264
Because you finally had your big break,

715
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,361
- and she couldn't handle it.
- That is not why!

716
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,801
You know... you...

717
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:41,304
You know what?

718
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:44,073
I'm really sorry I
had to tell you, Megan,

719
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:47,209
but, uh, I can't do this anymore.

720
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:56,952
Okay, please, just hear
me. Just hear me, please.

721
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,989
Okay, yeah.

722
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:03,264
Kyle kicked me out of his
party and I was pissed...

723
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,380
- Holy shit.
- No! Listen.

724
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:07,930
The people from the Institute
like Kyle and Terence,

725
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,598
I keep trying to tell you
that they're dangerous,

726
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,535
- and you're just not hearing me.
- You humiliated me

727
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:15,514
in front of millions of people.

728
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,989
I thought that a scandal would
make them leave you alone.

729
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:22,725
- It was the trade-off, right?
- Oh, my God.

730
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:25,805
No, but it was a horrible idea.

731
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,494
It was a terrible,
bad, stupid thing to do.

732
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,086
And I'm really sorry that I hurt you,

733
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:32,188
but it all came from love.

734
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,357
No, I-I...

735
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,075
I do not do that
version of love anymore.

736
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,832
I can't have you in my life.

737
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:43,165
Megan, I made a mistake.

738
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,395
No. You need to leave.

739
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,737
Now.

740
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,847
What are you doing here?

741
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:37,048
We're overdue a meal together.

742
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:41,991
How'd you get in?

743
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:45,741
How do you think?

744
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:47,378
I have the code.

745
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,069
What the hell are you doing?

746
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,383
Stop it!

747
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:00,936
Stop!

748
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:38,247
Christ. Shit.

749
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,789
Megan.

750
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,455
I'm so sorry.

751
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:50,259
What happened? You okay?

752
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,328
Hope leaked the photos of me.

753
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:55,531
And Shaun...

754
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,435
I don't know who my friends are anymore.

755
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:02,759
Come on, let's get you to bed.

756
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:30,263
Business.

757
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:34,045
Well, okay then.

758
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,296
This is a contract for
the rights to your script.

759
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:40,431
And a check for $100,000.

760
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,301
Kyle wants to do it?

761
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,503
No, not yet.

762
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:48,873
But one way or another, I
will get this movie made.

763
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:50,041
Wow.

764
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,685
I don't know what to...

765
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:53,551
thank you.

766
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,113
There's a condition.

767
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,583
You don't come anywhere
near this production, and...

768
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,586
you and I part ways.

769
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,338
Because you don't want Kyle or Megan

770
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,863
to know how this got started.

771
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,585
Or anyone else.

772
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:10,553
I didn't realize this would
end with me disappearing.

773
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:11,905
You disappear.

774
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,907
But Ann Toren...

775
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:20,230
can walk into any
studio with this credit

776
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:23,031
and her next great idea, and get a deal.

777
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,226
It's called a nom de plume,

778
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:29,344
and it's your chance to have
something real in this business.

779
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,240
You should grab it.

780
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:39,102
So the key is to take
a few minutes each month

781
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:40,932
to make sure you both
know the new codes.

782
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:43,424
And at least you know it's working now.

783
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,990
Yeah. Yeah, now the alarm works well.

784
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:48,349
Uh, I gotta give this
back to you, though.

785
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:51,450
I don't want it in the house anymore.

786
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,641
Well, it's your call.

787
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:55,133
Like I said, if you want to be safe,

788
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,440
you're gonna need more than you got now.

789
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,209
I know.

790
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:01,092
I have something in mind.

791
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:09,544
Hello there.

792
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:10,787
Hey.

793
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,055
You doing something on the lot?

794
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,990
Actually, I came by to bring you

795
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,793
a housewarming gift of sorts.

796
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,828
I'd like you to read this.

797
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:20,830
"Technicolor Highway"?

798
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,230
Who's Ann Toren?

799
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:23,458
A completely unknown writer,

800
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,535
but this script will
knock your socks off.

801
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:27,670
It's a smart, completely fresh take

802
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,272
on Southern California Gothic,

803
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,307
and you would be perfect for the lead.

804
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,778
You want me to read this and
then tell Kyle to direct it.

805
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:37,213
I'm sorry,

806
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:38,514
I'm not getting in the middle

807
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,049
of whatever's going on with you guys.

808
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:42,619
Megan, I just want you to read it.

809
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,554
Because if you connect
with it like I did,

810
00:37:44,623 --> 00:37:46,322
you'll go to Kyle regardless.

811
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:49,792
This is our chance for the three
of us to make a movie our way,

812
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:51,761
with no interference.

813
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,833
Or maybe you won't like it, which case,

814
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,768
forget everything I said.

815
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,667
New pages for you.

816
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,278
Seriously? Again?

817
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,594
I don't call the
shots, I just give them.

818
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:28,573
Whoever that is, it's me
time! Come back in ten minutes!

819
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,588
Hi, it's Megan. I need to talk to you.

820
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:39,151
What is it? I'm decompressing.

821
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,412
Late-night writing?

822
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,993
Actually, Patrick and I
rewrote the pages this morning.

823
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,418
And yesterday too, I guess?

824
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:51,287
I'm an executive producer
on the show, sweetie.

825
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:53,289
It's my responsibility to
make sure that the product

826
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:55,489
we're putting out there
is as good as it can be.

827
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:57,727
Even if it means making me look bad?

828
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,724
You're not the product, Megan.

829
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:06,583
I am, and I have to protect myself.

830
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:08,053
I've been doing this long enough to know

831
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:10,587
that no one else is going
to do it, and let's be real,

832
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:12,006
you didn't look bad.

833
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:14,134
No, I just sat there
looking like an idiot

834
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,460
while I listened to a bunch
of fake outrage and bullshit

835
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,128
about the sisterhood.

836
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:20,097
You lied to me.

837
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,850
I could've just told you to
quit panicking and suck it up.

838
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,176
- Would that have been better?
- I wasn't panicking.

839
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:25,302
I was just surprised
that this happened...

840
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:26,373
You were panicking,

841
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,882
and I gave you a friend and an ally,

842
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:30,674
which is a hell of a lot
more than people have given me

843
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,341
over the years.

844
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:35,111
I'm sorry you didn't feel supported.

845
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:38,448
I have seven more minutes to myself.

846
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,133
Go learn your lines.

847
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:45,355
Millennial bullshit.

848
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:50,560
- Welcome home.
- Aww.

849
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:52,162
Hey, we got beer, right?

850
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,495
- Hell yeah, we got beer.
- Yeah.

851
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,434
Things must have went well today.

852
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:59,336
Actually...

853
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,516
no, it was pretty much a nightmare.

854
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,399
I got new pages at
the last minute again,

855
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,476
and then I discovered that Charlotte

856
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:08,203
actually helped rewrite them,

857
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,893
so not only did I wander
blindly through the scenes,

858
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:14,153
but my childhood idol ended
up being completely two-faced.

859
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,906
And then?

860
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:19,976
'Cause it seems like
you're in a good mood.

861
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,611
And then...

862
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,080
I read this.

863
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:32,543
DeAnn came to see me.

864
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:34,591
Jesus.

865
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:35,825
I tell her I'm not interested,

866
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,207
and she goes behind my back to you.

867
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:38,595
I know that's exactly what she did,

868
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,063
and I told her it wasn't cool,

869
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,931
but, babe...

870
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,230
this script is really good.

871
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:46,603
I mean it.

872
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:49,873
It's so real and visceral,

873
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:51,774
and yet totally about character.

874
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,209
And the whole time I was reading it...

875
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:54,677
I read it twice, actually...

876
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:58,481
I just kept thinking
that this script is so us.

877
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,747
"Technicolor Highway."

878
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:06,756
Who's Ann Toren?

879
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:09,659
I don't know, but she's the real deal.

880
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:52,003
Dear Kyle,

881
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:54,284
I'm running out of time.

882
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:59,074
It's time for me to face the
consequences for what I did.

883
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:03,918
You can still distance yourself from me.

884
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:06,275
Kyle...

885
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,907
I only hope you can believe the truth...

886
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:11,501
that I love you...

887
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,595
and I'm so, so sorry...

888
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,344
