1
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:35,876
Why?

2
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,724
Did he say anything to you?

3
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,478
Did he say nothing?

4
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,396
Why?

5
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,724
Isn't it strange that out
of six question words...

6
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,962
...the first one we think
of has no clear answer?

7
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,172
The questions who,
what, where...

8
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,483
...when and how must have
definite and correct answers...

9
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,679
...but "why" always gets you different
answers and raises new questions.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,958
You can see the answers to all the other
questions, and even touch them...

11
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,687
...however, "why" is hidden
somewhere inside us.

12
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,963
Is that the reason we wonder
most about why, grandpa?

13
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:08,757
Here I am.
Look, I came.

14
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:11,841
To be able to touch your hand,
to see you with my own eyes.

15
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,356
To ask the greatest question
of those who stayed...

16
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:16,358
...and to learn the answer
of those who left.

17
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:19,526
Just damn this smart-ass
attitude of mine. I came to you.

18
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:24,006
Why? I miss you so much,
where are you, grandfather?

19
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,595
Today, you have received
your report cards. Children.

20
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,839
Children!

21
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,759
Did I say you could go?

22
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:06,955
Here they come.
Charge!

23
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,119
Get the fuck out
of our neighborhood.

24
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,596
We aren't going anywhere.
Like you own the place.

25
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,121
We do. You thought we were
going to turn it over to you?

26
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,158
- This belongs to everyone, man.
- Not everyone.

27
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,887
What will you do now
that school is over?

28
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,356
You can't go whining
to the teacher anymore.

29
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,838
Here, shove this up your ass.

30
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,125
That's vulgar.
We have our girlfriends here.

31
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:36,802
Don't cross the Namık Kemal bridge
or you will frighten the duck.

32
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:40,237
I planted a pine in your mother's pussy
and then put her on a truck.

33
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,244
Wonder what you will do.

34
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:46,404
You are bound to go through hour
neighborhood to buy yogurt.

35
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:49,605
You bashed his head, man!

36
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,037
Grandpa.

37
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,680
You son of a jackass.

38
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,236
Boy, are you never going to wise up?

39
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,239
What in the world are you doing
fighting with people like a rabid dog?

40
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,063
I come all the way
down to school to see...

41
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,679
...your report card and
what are you doing?

42
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,235
You are making war and bashing
people in the head with rocks.

43
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,167
But, I didn't do it.
it was Hüseyin and them.

44
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:09,520
I was just standing there.

45
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,717
Zip it, you liar.
Am l to believe you or my own eyes?

46
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,164
- You were throwing rocks.
- I threw a few, but l couldn't hit them anyway.

47
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,960
Man, are you the one raising hell?

48
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,277
Are we raising you to be an outlaw?

49
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:23,484
Just look at your knees. If a dog licked
them he wouldn't be hungry anymore.

50
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:26,121
Okay, grandpa. Let me get in the car
and you can yell at me inside.

51
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm not letting you in the car.

52
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,766
I'm going to make you walk
all the way as a lesson for everyone.

53
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:33,719
And, by God, l won't let you ride
in the car ever again. Asshole.

54
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,878
But you are going to
let me wash it, right?

55
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,646
I talk about pretty lass and
you talk about the hair in my ass.

56
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,878
And he laughs, the dirty rascal!

57
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,638
But, look l got my report card,
grandpa.

58
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,561
Grandpa,
I got my report card.

59
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,201
What do you think we
came down here for?

60
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,318
Walk faster.
Keep up with the car.

61
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:55,642
But, we are downtown now.
Come on, let me get in.

62
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,843
And I got straight A's look.
Are you going to look?

63
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,164
Besides, you didn't let me
kiss your hand.

64
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,926
You little bastard.

65
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,687
Straight A's.
Math was a B but there stare all A's.

66
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:19,238
And, what do you get for
getting along with friends? Just a C.

67
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,927
Those are behavioral
and they don't count anyway.

68
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,521
One of these days,
I'm going to make them count.

69
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,604
If you don't get an A for your
relationship with your friends next year...

70
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:30,884
...I will take you out of school and
make you work in the garden. Hear me?

71
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,042
- I hear ya.
- Give me your word.

72
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,920
- Promise. Cross my heart and hope to die.
- We’ll see.

73
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,519
Are you going to give me money
for my report card, grandpa?

74
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,035
You pimping whore longer.

75
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:46,244
You certainly keep me in practice
when it comes to cursing and swearing.

76
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:48,716
Grandpa, did you go down
to the sea again?

77
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,397
Have a good day.

78
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,958
- Are you coming from the sea, Mr. Mehmet?
- No, we came over land in the car.

79
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,238
Have you received some news?

80
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:14,606
My dear Durmuş, the news is over;
we have returned to your normal programming.

81
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,083
Mr. Halil, I hope business is good.

82
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,201
Mr. Hasan, I hope business is good.

83
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,762
Right foot first, right!
You are going to bring bad luck to the store.

84
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:42,242
Grandpa, why don't you lock
the shop when you go out?

85
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,163
The shop shouldn't be
locked in the daytime...

86
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:45,799
...it would be an affront
to the neighbors.

87
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:49,243
It would seem like I didn't trust them.
It would also be impolite to the customers.

88
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,365
They would view the lock like a dead-end
wall and be turned off of the shop.

89
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:55,007
You will work here part time
on your vacation. Learn all of this.

90
00:05:55,407 --> 00:06:01,357
Here, take this too. Go show your
report card to everyone at home.

91
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,397
- Come on.
- Thanks, grandpa.

92
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,876
Monday, you need to be at work,
Don't let me down. Got it?

93
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,162
Damned infidel is what he is.
And he mocks me to boot.

94
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:18,041
He's forgotten the days on his island
when he was eating snails.

95
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,961
Fine but what are you getting
all bent out of shape for, Durmuş?

96
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,003
Or, is there some account
you're trying to settle?

97
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:25,436
You are going to get beat
with a shoe if you don't watch it.

98
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:28,247
I don't know, but Uncle Mehmet
is a decent guy. And, everyone loves him.

99
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,556
Get the fuck out of this store.

100
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,852
I saw this collar on Şöhret's daughter.

101
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,117
I wanted one just like it.
They cut this one from a model.

102
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:36,885
I'm home!

103
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,527
Lord have mercy, son.
You scared me half to death.

104
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,172
They said they lost the pattern.

105
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,641
They're jealous and don't want
anyone else to have it.

106
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,487
Yours will be different.
I'm going to make it even better for you.

107
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,444
Ozan, where's the report card?

108
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,318
Straight A's.
I got a B in math. The rest were A's.

109
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,681
Well, that's our boy.

110
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:55,482
Good job, son.
You're gonna turnout alright.

111
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:56,926
Next year, bring your math up.

112
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,356
I'm going to the beach.

113
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,603
No. It's too early for that.
Stay right where you are.

114
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,812
Why not? School is out.
Summer is here.

115
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,361
Look how sweaty l’m.
It's already warm enough.

116
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,882
Nope. You can't go swimming
before we move to the vineyard.

117
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,565
Yes, you can.
Grandpa was there today.

118
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,647
I'm going to the beach.
I'm going to the beach. I'm going to the beach.

119
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,240
Oh, that's enough.

120
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,760
Mom, aren't my flip-flops here?

121
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,037
My goodness, this crazy
boy isn't going to stop.

122
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,237
Nadire, you shouldn't have bothered.

123
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,847
Saime, wait a bit, my dear,
he won't give up.

124
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,475
- Hello?
- Aysun.

125
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:30,361
- How're you doing, dear. This is Nurdan.
- Fine, Nurdan, how're you doing?!

126
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,485
I'm fine l reckon.
Connect me to Ercan's beach, will you?

127
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,239
Have you not moved
to the vineyard yet?!

128
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,841
I guess we’ll be going to the
vineyard the day after tomorrow.

129
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,086
I suppose you waited
for the boy's school to finish.

130
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,886
- I've got work to do. Put me through, if you will.
- Fine, suit yourself.

131
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,805
She just won't stop.

132
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,681
Nurdan, do you think
this looks a bit long?

133
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,838
- "Nurdan, do you think this looks a bit long?"
- Hush.

134
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,478
We still have to hem it.
That is a temporary stitch. Oh brother...

135
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,755
- Hello?
- Ercan. This is Nurdan.

136
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:58,802
What's up, dear?!

137
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,546
This boy is insisting
on going swimming.

138
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,165
You going to be around
to look after him?

139
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,532
Oh, yes, of course, don't worry.

140
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,205
Thanks Ercan.
I know we're putting you out.

141
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,437
- Don't mention it, my dear.
- Say hi to Haktan.

142
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,760
- Okay. You say hi for me too.
- Sure thing. I’ll tell him. Have a good day.

143
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,955
I'm going to the sea.
I'm going to the sea.

144
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,678
Look, at his report card dear.

145
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:21,366
Run along then and hurry back.
Go see your father too.

146
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,881
Remember, if you're not back
in an hour, you’ll get a whipping.

147
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,201
Okay. The money?

148
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,158
Have you already gotten
some from your grandpa?

149
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:34,167
I didn't ask him for it.
He gave it to me himself.

150
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,395
He said it was report card money.

151
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,367
You have become the
hungry dog from a rich home.

152
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:38,800
You way lay your
grandpa and then me.

153
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,722
Mister soldier. Mister soldier.

154
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,679
You have made
the semen a bit angry.

155
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:13,287
They were yelling about
when this hole is going to be filled in.

156
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,795
Sir, Çolak Ibrahim's sewer
has always caused problems.

157
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,644
They are making the complaint.

158
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,844
Whenever we start digging,
they yell at us to close it back up.

159
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:25,925
Then let's do this: Tell everyone to meet
at the teahouse in the town square.

160
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,677
- That's my boy! Hey, did you hear that?
- Yikes! Deputy, you frightened me.

161
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:31,995
Hey everyone, did you hear that?

162
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,166
That's my boy.
Friends, he got straight A's.

163
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:41,560
Come on, dad. Put me down.
You're embarrassing me.

164
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:46,518
That's alright. He doesn't let us
love on him. The boy is like a kitten.

165
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,243
Stop, stop. You've got a passenger.

166
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,800
Stop. You've got a passenger.

167
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,197
Money, please.

168
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,000
Ozan!

169
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:49,805
Look at that!

170
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,403
Grandpa was here
this morning, Ercan.

171
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:59,485
Okay, I got it and hid it when he left.
You don't need to look for it, boy.

172
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,367
There's no reception here.
Leave it alone, will you?

173
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:14,800
That static is giving us a headache.

174
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,041
Son, sit still.

175
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,322
Mehmet, turn that thing off, will you.

176
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,077
Oh brother.

177
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,565
I'm going to hand you
over to crazy Peruzat.

178
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,364
We'll let her nail
you rears to the ceiling.

179
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:27,240
Don't scare the boy like that.
She is one of our people too.

180
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,246
I'll be right back.

181
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,757
Poor woman.
May God grant patience.

182
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:38,692
I don't know they stand it here.

183
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,683
Her mother is a wonder too.
How old is she?

184
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,687
She must be in her80s.
If she would just pass on.

185
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,245
How can she make
it out here by herself?

186
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,562
It would be real tough.

187
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:48,042
They stayed here, didn't they?
They never go down from here.

188
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,598
Just give her to me,
dear, let her mother rest.

189
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,119
My dear one.

190
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,986
Grandpa, what drove
this woman crazy?

191
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,605
There are some things
that kids can't ask.

192
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,607
She's not crazy;
she has a different mindset.

193
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,676
I'll tell you about it later.

194
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,363
- You can't be serious, dad?
- Using language appropriate for his age.

195
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,201
Don't you go explaining everything?
He is confused enough as it is.

196
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,404
No, everything must
be explained to children.

197
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:13,285
Not only will it serve as a warning,
it will teach them about people.

198
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,926
And, teach them to love
and respect them.

199
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,486
Yeah, well he's
talking in his sleep.

200
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:18,527
- What does he say?
- He is going to take a rifle

201
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:19,437
and shoot JR in Dallas.

202
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,716
I did not.

203
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,361
But, for the love of God, is there
anybody around here in their right mind?

204
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,172
I don't know if it's
the water or the air

205
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,243
but everyone around here
is missing a few marbles.

206
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:32,478
I guess the grandson takes after us.
How could it be any other way?

207
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,999
Here we are.

208
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,361
My God! My house,
my beautiful, wonderful house.

209
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,245
Look at him runaway,
afraid he’ll carry bags.

210
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,722
You had to wait here patiently
through that long winter.

211
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:53,557
- Pick this up, son, take it.
- Hey neighbors.

212
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:56,117
- We're here. We're here.
- Take this too.

213
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,359
Muazzez! Emine! Yusuf!

214
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,563
My dear, no need to
scream like a banshee.

215
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:08,042
Son, around here they communicate
by howling like jackals.

216
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,201
Come on, take this.

217
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:13,324
We were irrigating.
I saw the car and came.

218
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,526
Dear me,
where have you been, girl?

219
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:19,684
Girl, don't just stand there yelling,
come help.

220
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,078
- Now we have that. Perfect.
- This is a sweet machine.

221
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,641
- Come on grandpa, let's me and you do it.
- Okay, hold your horses.

222
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,758
You have all gone completely wild.
Come on.

223
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:34,438
- Mom, we will be doing it first this year.
- Great. We'll watch.

224
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,838
Mother and daughter-in-law,
they're doing it.

225
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,044
One, two, three.

226
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:46,484
I hope the whole
summer is filled with laughter.

227
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,361
Isn't that right, girl?
Isn't that right, sweetie?

228
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,286
Mustafa.

229
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,241
We're back.

230
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,241
Alright, come on.
Let's open the bottles.

231
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:18,720
In the name of Allah,
the Merciful.

232
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,202
You shameless she at hens!

233
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,398
It's not a sin until you get to this line.
I talked with Him about it.

234
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,884
So, I reckon that means
you will drink half of five bottles.

235
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:34,561
Now, doesn't this look beautiful.

236
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,286
God bless our neighbors,
they have taken...

237
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,925
...a simple meal and
turned it into a feast.

238
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,927
Being the first day and all,
we couldn't do much.

239
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,561
Looks like we'll be going
to bed hungry tonight.

240
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,479
- Did you invite Peruzat and her family?
- I did. They'll be here for coffee.

241
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,117
So you've opened the bottle, Mehmet?

242
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,516
Well, what did you expect me to do?
Break it?

243
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,444
So, what's the status
on the other bottles, Mr. Mehmet?

244
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,922
They're on the way. On the way.

245
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,839
I'm full. I'm going to bed.

246
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,840
How could you be full?

247
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,966
Let him go. He'll be getting up
early tomorrow anyway.

248
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,412
What's the matter with you?

249
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,517
Do you consider yourself
better than your grandpa?

250
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,563
Don't be rude or l'll be
teaching you a hard lesson.

251
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,485
- We are Turks. Turks l tell you.
- Of course, we are. What about it?

252
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,765
No! You are infidels
and you support the infidels.

253
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:22,126
Fear not,
for the crimson flag...

254
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,439
Let me check the baby girl.

255
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:38,047
Our national anthem
must never be left unfinished!

256
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,641
So, let's sing it to the very end.

257
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,372
Fear not, for the crimson flag that...

258
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:50,797
...proudly ripples
in this glorious twilight

259
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,963
Shall never fade

260
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,886
What are we celebrating?

261
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:38,759
Good morning,
hope business goes well.

262
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,286
Good morning to you, sir.

263
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,159
I swear l didn't do anything, grandpa.

264
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,758
Good morning to you.
What can I do for you?

265
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,724
I was going to ask a favor, sir, but...

266
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,803
Come in to the shop.
Let's have a morning coffee.

267
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:03,163
- No, don't trouble yourself.
- Don't be silly, man.

268
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,887
- How do you take your coffee?
- One sugar please. If it's no trouble.

269
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,395
Come on, son.
What're you standing there for? Hurry.

270
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:27,516
Hasan! One medium coffee
and whatever my grandpa drinks!

271
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,605
Okay, coming right up.

272
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:44,318
I thought he could learn a trade.

273
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,440
And besides he doesn't need to be
wandering the streets like a stray dog.

274
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,876
If there is a need, sir,
my Tahsin would do the job.

275
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,332
The money's not important.

276
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,119
It doesn't matter
whether you give him or not.

277
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:56,486
I can vouch for my boy.
He's hard-working and well-behaved.

278
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:59,958
- He will do you right here in the shop.
- Oh my goodness. Foreman Berat.

279
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,321
You are a foreman, right?
If l remember correctly.

280
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,436
That's right, sir.

281
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:07,160
I have brought my grandson in
as an apprentice this summer, but...

282
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,566
May the Lord protect and preserve him.
That's alright, I understand, sir.

283
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:14,084
It would be great to have two apprentices
in the shop working together.

284
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:17,240
It has to be swept every morning.

285
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,797
You will pour a bit
of water on the floors.

286
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,077
The bucket and mop are over here.
The tap is over there.

287
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:25,126
Use this to wipe the shoes.

288
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:28,876
When a customer comes in, you have to
stand up, and say, "How can I help you?"

289
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,165
When they ask
for something, don't say,

290
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,804
"We don't have it".
You say, "We're sold out."

291
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,481
That's enough for now.
Ozan will explain the rest to you.

292
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:36,755
I'll be damned if l do.

293
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,284
When you are measuring fabric,
always give the man extra four fingers...

294
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:41,965
...and an extra finger of cologne.

295
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:44,367
First of all, we never
want to cheat anyone and secondly,

296
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:45,516
it is a gift from us to them.

297
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:50,118
When an apprentice can cut the fabric
from beginning to end in a single swipe...

298
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:54,365
...straight and clean, that is when
the apprentice becomes a journeyman.

299
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:58,205
Remember.
A single swipe without any tearing.

300
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:17,640
- Uncle Mehmet, l found 100 lira on the floor.
- Give it to me. Put it right here.

301
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,037
Whoever dropped
it will come back for it.

302
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:29,639
- Tahsin, go order yourselves two fruit tea.
- No, uncle, I don't want one.

303
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,922
Order it, I said. Now, run along.

304
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,155
- Did you throw that money on the floor?
- No.

305
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:40,723
My son, listen, I'm asking you nicely.
Don't make me pull you by the ear.

306
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:42,965
You think l don't know
that when you lie...

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,644
...you turn as yellow as a lemon?
Just like this.

308
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:48,167
Well, that's what you did when
you brought in a new apprentice.

309
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,807
I thought you had forgot.
It was just a test, you know.

310
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,995
What would have happened
if he had taken the money?

311
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,681
You would have come
and told on him, right?

312
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,705
Man, you think you
can give an accomplished...

313
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,683
...soloist singing lessons.
Get out of my sight.

314
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:04,199
Leave and don't comeback.
You'll never be a man. That's clear enough.

315
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,840
- Grandfather!
- Get the fuck out of here.

316
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,440
- Huddle up now. I have something to say.
- Hey, Ozan is here.

317
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,839
You remember infidel Tahsin?

318
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,012
He came to the shop
with his father...

319
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,844
...and they made my grandpa
feel sorry for them.

320
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,485
Now, he's an apprentice
at the shop.

321
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,035
You call everyone an infidel,
but your grandpa is an infidel

322
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,640
Is not! We are Turks! Turk!

323
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,003
They say your grandpa
faked your circumcision.

324
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,401
The foreskin is still there.

325
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,763
Fuck it's there.
Look at this!

326
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,120
You see?
They’re Turks.

327
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,767
If that's so, let's go to war,
we'll see who's more Turkish.

328
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,644
Let's see who will
break the most glass.

329
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,767
- You going to the immigrant neighborhood?
- To war!

330
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:58,724
Don't leave a single
window unbroken.

331
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:01,526
If you catch the girls,
pinch their tits, man!

332
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,322
They come and settle in our town
and the government does nothing.

333
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:08,485
They've taken over.
It's only these kids doing something about it!

334
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,725
Stop it. Stop.

335
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,199
Hey kid, do you want
some lemonade?

336
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,315
Hey, what are you doing here?
I thought you were apprenticing?

337
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:59,046
I work until noon.
Did you forget, oh great intellect.

338
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,843
Are you hungry?
Shall I put something on for you?

339
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:04,767
No. I'll have a sandwich
at the what cha-call it.

340
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,086
What do you mean,
'what cha-call it'?

341
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,362
To the sea, again?
You stay right where you are.

342
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,244
Not again.
I've only been once.

343
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,246
If you are going to be like this
at the beginning of the summer...

344
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,483
...we're going to be
butting heads for months, Nurdan.

345
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,603
How dare you talk like that?
I'll cut your tongue out.

346
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:19,126
You were the one
that said no sea...

347
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,566
...before we moved
out to the vineyard.

348
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,797
Here we are at the vineyard
so that means l can go.

349
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:25,197
Besides, I'm going to walk,
so it's free.

350
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,044
You make sure to tell
Ercan you are there.

351
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:30,802
- Is Ercan blind? Like he won't see that I'm there.
- I'm telling you to let him know.

352
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,447
If l see him,
I'll tell him and I'll tell him...

353
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:33,641
...to bring me coffee
with milk too.

354
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,687
You impertinent thing.
We'll see if l let you go.

355
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,676
Come here you little imp.

356
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,684
Run, boy, run!

357
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,684
You bastard,
no offence to your father.

358
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:56,519
Have a ground beef pita over there
at Muzaffer's. Drink ayran not cola.

359
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,321
Here, take this.
Take it, son.

360
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,041
My goodness, you're an apprentice.
Obviously, I'm going to feed you.

361
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:06,085
If you get back early,
sit in front of the shop and wait. Okay?

362
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,316
Okay, Uncle Mehmet.

363
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,726
Way to go, Mehmet.

364
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,266
I swear you are
how we know summer...

365
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,726
...has arrived.
Take a dive for me too.

366
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:15,599
- Come on, I'll take you too.
- Thanks, but l can't.

367
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:39,446
Mr. Ercan, you'll keep an eye
on my grandson, right?

368
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,518
Yes sir, don't you worry.
I'm keeping an eye on him.

369
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:44,485
We'll have you out to the
vineyard for dinner sometime.

370
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:48,520
Why, we'd be honored, sir.
We miss your company and our chats.

371
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,685
- Okay bye.
- Bye now. Have a nice day.

372
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:09,757
Stop.

373
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,767
The glass is going to shatter.
You're going to cut yourself.

374
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:15,315
- Stop it, you're going to break it.
- Yes, I'm going to break it.

375
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:21,525
Lord have mercy.
Aren't you ashamed of ripping that up?

376
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,092
Look,
I ought to tell your grandpa.

377
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,243
People are going to
cut their feet on this.

378
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:27,601
Liar!

379
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:31,125
I thought you were picking
these things up and keeping them.

380
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:34,398
That is something your grandfather
has enjoyed for years. Leave him alone.

381
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:36,523
- I'm not going to leave him alone.
- And, just why is that?

382
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,801
Because we are Turks!

383
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:41,641
- Has somebody called you an infidel, son?
- Yes, they have!

384
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,721
Son, if we were to look at it like that,
half the people here are infidels.

385
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,718
Everyone is an immigrant here.

386
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,844
You don't know.
Everyone mocks us.

387
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:58,238
Your grandfather is a Greek infidel.
With those bottles...

388
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:01,923
...those bottles of his.
He writes letters and sends information.

389
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,118
They say he is a spy.

390
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,161
You know those people
who greet him with a smile?

391
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,602
Well, they always
talk behind his back.

392
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:16,244
Ercan, do you want me to
come over tonight?

393
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,126
Sure, come on over, dear.

394
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:19,932
But, if it going to
be a half-ass job...

395
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,798
...like it was the other night,
then don't bother.

396
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,878
- I wasn't there. It's a lie.
- What's going on, man?

397
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,200
- They're raising a ruckus again.
- Shame on you, young people, don't do that.

398
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:32,083
Mr. Mehmet, I need to
have a quick chat with you.

399
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,556
I sent Ozan home.
Don't worry about him.

400
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:37,445
Please come in, Mr. Ercan.
Don't mind these tactless bastards.

401
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,518
Tahsin, you sit here.

402
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,842
I don't know if...

403
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,644
...their teachers are
teaching them this...

404
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,882
...or what but it's
clearly bothering him.

405
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:50,720
He cried for quite a while.

406
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:53,082
It broke my heart, Mr. Mehmet.

407
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,238
The poor boy is really hurting.

408
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:59,559
Apparently, they are making fun of him,
calling you an infidel from Crete.

409
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:02,685
For goodness sake.
Where does the kid get this from?

410
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,685
Who could possibly be mocking us?

411
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,839
They are the faithless,
the one who follow the pack...

412
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,303
...who say "Yes, sir"
to your face...

413
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:10,680
...but when you turn
your back on them...

414
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:13,606
...it turns into a different tune.
Sleeping serpents.

415
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:18,764
Plus, Ozan loves you deeply
and holds you in the highest regard...

416
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:22,157
...so you are
basically a hero to him.

417
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,332
As a result,
he can't stand it that

418
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,959
anyone would say
anything against you.

419
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,641
In fact, if you ask me,
that is the issue anyway.

420
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:32,203
It isn't patriotism,
it is how much he admires you.

421
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,045
Doesn't that just be at it all.

422
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,118
I'm sure this isn't something
he has communicated.

423
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,161
Children don't show their
affection, Mr. Mehmet.

424
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,302
...shot by three people.
Three bombings

425
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:43,357
last month’s led to
the evacuation of!

426
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:44,966
Especially at times like these.

427
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:50,644
These are difficult times
of testing, Mr. Mehmet.

428
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,932
It's not my place to tell you,
but l would say

429
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,527
you need to talk to your
grandson and win his heart

430
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,196
After all, he's just a kid.
He doesn't understand.

431
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,199
I'm about to pass out in here.

432
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,485
I've grown accustomed
to these a breezes.

433
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,327
Hey, Ozan. Listen.
That is the first

434
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,555
cicada of the summer.

435
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:17,559
Well, I'll declare.
Summer is here at last.

436
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,559
Hush, hush!

437
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,963
What'd you go and do that for?

438
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:26,561
Just because! I don't want
him chirping. My head is hurting.

439
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,326
Well, if you sit under the hot sun on the

440
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:30,005
beach until sun down
like a stray dog...

441
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:31,918
...your head and
your ass will both hurt.

442
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,846
Drink this.

443
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,559
Let's put some yogurt
on that back of yours.

444
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,320
I don't want any.
Let it burn.

445
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:47,161
Aren't you a cranky one.
Cheer up a little, man.

446
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:51,161
Muazzez and Yusuf are coming tonight.
We're going to eat together.

447
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:53,802
They come every night.
I don't want them to come.

448
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,920
They should eat at their own house
for a change. I've got a headache.

449
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,332
He has become a complete jackal.

450
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,483
He doesn't want people around,
the little outlaw.

451
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,080
Look, your grandpa's here.

452
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:08,125
Is that Mr. Ercan in the front?
It sure as heck is.

453
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,683
Mr. Haktan is here, too.
And he never tells us.

454
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,606
If we had known,
we would have been ready.

455
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,205
We'll have to make
do with three dishes.

456
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:17,323
- Oh my goodness, look who's here.
- Welcome. Come right in.

457
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:20,319
This crazy husband of yours
insisted, Mrs. Nadire.

458
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,205
He said we had to dine with you.
We went and picked up Haktan too.

459
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,920
Good for you.

460
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,316
My goodness,
the watermelons are out.

461
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:34,476
You can't come to visit the prettiest
lady in town empty-handed. Here you go.

462
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,035
Oh, that was so sweet.
You've embarrassed me.

463
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:39,516
- Welcome!
- Thank you!

464
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,040
- How are you, Haktan?
- Hi, how're you?

465
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,439
If we could put this in the fridge...

466
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,327
lf it weren't for you,
Ercan, I swear there isn't

467
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:46,885
a soul in this world
who'd bring me roses.

468
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:49,124
Come on girl.
We haven't brought you roses!

469
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:52,358
You didn't even send me a handful
of blossoms from the chaste berry tree.

470
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,324
Ercan, you just keep on spoiling them.

471
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:56,921
You just have to put with
their whimsical way, my dear Ibrahim.

472
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:03,477
No more chirping!

473
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,966
Would you like a drink?

474
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,919
If it's no trouble, sir.

475
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,924
She shouldn't have any, son.
It gets to her.

476
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:17,362
Oh mother, please. Don't interrupt.

477
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:22,723
Oh what a modern evening
this is, isn't it? I just love these parties, sir.

478
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,163
Peruzat, I'm Ercan.

479
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:30,036
Well, my lands, Mr. Ercan.

480
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:32,118
How are you, my dear Peruzat?

481
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:35,438
What can I say, sir?
I'm just waiting.

482
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,758
- Just waiting.
- I wish she hadn't had any. It gets to her.

483
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:44,318
Oh, I wish my late
husband was here.

484
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:47,640
Here's to Mr. Hüseyin.
May his ears ring.

485
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:50,527
May his ears ring,
because they hear us.

486
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:53,121
Let them know that
we have not forgotten them.

487
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,523
Something’s just can't be forgotten.
For example, the place of your birth.

488
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:01,485
Even the places you remember
just barely when you've grown up a bit.

489
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,966
Sit down over there.

490
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:05,641
Tonight, no one leaves this table.
I've taken everyone prisoner.

491
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:07,842
I'll shoot you right
between the eyes with this.

492
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,758
It won't kill you,
but it'll make you suffer.

493
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:15,002
What were we saying?
Oh yes, the fuzzy memories we have.

494
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,092
I had just turned
8. Some of it l can

495
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:21,925
still remember down to
the minutest detail...

496
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:24,680
...some of it is a bit fuzzy.

497
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:31,206
I remember a white house in Crete,
in the village of Rethimno.

498
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:34,722
You could hear the sea
from far off, Emine.

499
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,917
I can still hear the sound
from way back then.

500
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,920
There was a tavern
in the distance too.

501
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:47,755
We could hear the sound at night.
A young girl would sing.

502
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,361
I have no idea if the tavern
is still there or not.

503
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,012
Anyways. The rooms
were all white washed

504
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:59,164
and the whole place
smelled wonderfully of sea.

505
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:00,482
Always hot.

506
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,566
A bright yellow heat.

507
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,362
The cicadas would chirp constantly.

508
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,452
My mother had
gathered carob pods

509
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:11,479
and poured them out of her
skirt on to the floor.

510
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:16,005
My older sister and I came running.
Mustafa was still a baby in the crib.

511
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,165
If only you could have seen it.
It was a hell of a lot of fun.

512
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:22,319
My sister and l would share
the carob pods right away.

513
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:24,204
My father was a mason.

514
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,678
He was very domineering.

515
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,486
He would come home every night
carrying tons of food.

516
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:32,367
He was huge, he could
barely get through a door.

517
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,718
Missus, I'm home.

518
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:43,962
Ladies and gentlemen,
look at the camera. Smile!

519
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:46,476
Look for the birdie.

520
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:50,481
They also put Mustafa in my lap and
took a picture of the two brothers.

521
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,725
I was shocked to see
my own picture on paper.

522
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,924
Me and the baby Mustafa.

523
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:59,746
The pictures were left
behind in the house.

524
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:01,445
We couldn't take them
in the hurry to leave.

525
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:05,116
We were happy, like we are now.
May the Lord make it ever so.

526
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,081
Amen.

527
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,717
Tons of stuff got left
in that house. Tons...

528
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:12,999
In 1923, things started to heat up.

529
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,558
Everyone was talking about
something called the "exchange”.

530
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:19,400
Apparently, we would have to
depart these lands and leave our house.

531
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,126
What could we do?
You can't stop fate.

532
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,772
They sold and dispersed
everything they...

533
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:28,367
...had for practically nothing.
We gathered our stuff.

534
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,412
All the while,
my mother cried that...

535
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:34,757
...we were leaving our
neighbors and our houses.

536
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:36,967
My father said all of the
Turks were emigrating.

537
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,366
We left before dawn in the morning.

538
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,492
My mother took
the lemon tree...

539
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:43,405
...sapling from the yard
at the last minute.

540
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:46,684
It was as if she was taking
the house with her, too.

541
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,960
Sister.

542
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:17,040
This way, go this way,
come on, to the harbor.

543
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,996
Let's go toward the harbor.

544
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,924
Get out Turks!
Get out of our country.

545
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:33,357
Stop it Talos.
This is shameful.

546
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:34,920
Our neighbors for all these years...

547
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,317
Stay out of this, woman.
The Turk is never a friend.

548
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,876
They should thank God
we haven't killed them.

549
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:52,715
- Go in peace.
- Don't worry.

550
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,846
Get out Turks!
Go to the bottom of hell!

551
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:03,396
Fatma, give the
baby to Cemal, to Cemal.

552
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,361
Come here my child.

553
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,958
Move along, move along.

554
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:34,961
Children, don't be afraid.

555
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:36,679
Don't get separated.

556
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,166
Stay together.

557
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:39,481
We'll beat the harbor soon.

558
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,805
Oh Lord, help us!

559
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,440
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

560
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,087
They say a ship called Gülcemal
will come and pick us up.

561
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:35,195
They said we just need
to wait a bit longer.

562
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,117
We're going to our homeland.
What else could we want?

563
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:39,521
Don't cry.

564
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,445
Hold on. You guys wait here.
Let me ask around.

565
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,717
How this is going to work out,
and what will we do.

566
00:35:54,967 --> 00:36:00,121
Enise, cover me so
I can nurse the baby.

567
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:21,235
- Have you wrapped the baby up tightly, Fatma?
- Yeah, I've wrapped him.

568
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:26,919
- Is it cold? Are you chilled, my son?
- No, father. I'm not.

569
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:30,763
Look how many
stars there are, father.

570
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:29,126
It's been two days.

571
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,159
When is this ship supposed
to arrive, Hasan?

572
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:32,841
We are running out of bread.

573
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:35,401
Should I run to the house?
Maybe get some potatoes and onions.

574
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,205
- We could roast it here on a fire...
- No.

575
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,326
You can't go.

576
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,522
Why?

577
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:42,625
We don't have a house
anymore, Fatma.

578
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,604
They would not let
us in the door.

579
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:57,838
Come on, Gülcemal.

580
00:37:58,487 --> 00:37:59,966
Where are you?

581
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,122
Good bye, my Crete.

582
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,644
He has a fever.

583
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,802
We were some
of the first to migrate.

584
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:46,846
Later, 50 ships carried
2 million people

585
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:49,565
from here and there.
It took a whole year!

586
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,759
His fever is very high.

587
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:06,165
Let me talk to the captain...

588
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,680
...and see if he will take us inside.

589
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,200
What is this, Hasan?

590
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:18,275
Don't let Mehmet and
Hatice get near the baby.

591
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,196
Don't look.

592
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:54,165
Cemal. Take the children
somewhere else.

593
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:57,643
Come on, kids.
Let's go somewhere else.

594
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:07,326
Brother, my condolences.

595
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:10,996
Listen, Hasan.

596
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,521
The journey is long, the journey is long,
do you understand?

597
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:19,476
Typhus is spreading on the ship.
A typhus epidemic.

598
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,879
The baby... into the sea.

599
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:23,317
Come on.

600
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,044
Give her, sister. Let go

601
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,517
God is great.
He will grant you patience.

602
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:29,757
Let go, my sister.

603
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:32,995
It's providence.

604
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,916
Fate.

605
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:39,207
Look, Mehmet, look,
there's fish going by.

606
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,798
I don't know how many
days we traveled.

607
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,518
It was early in the morning.
It was the first time l saw lzmir.

608
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:05,563
I made the place outback for him
so that he would have a gravesite.

609
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:08,683
My brother became the Sea Boy.

610
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,885
Then, you know the place
they call "Quarantine" in Izmir.

611
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,042
We are the ones that
gave it this name.

612
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:17,641
- What's your year of birth?
- What's your year of birth?!

613
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,203
The doctors and
nurses spoke Turkish.

614
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:49,680
They would say,
"open your mouth"...

615
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,758
...and I barely understood.
I don't know how many days...

616
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:53,263
...they kept us under quarantine...

617
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:54,680
...to keep the typhus
from spreading.

618
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,647
They put us in the baths
and washed us down.

619
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,239
I was just a kid so
l was embarrassed.

620
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,838
I said to myself, 'They don't like us.'

621
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:05,004
Over there, we were the spawn of the Turk
and here we were Greek infidels.

622
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,123
It was the last time
I saw the land of Crete.

623
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:09,482
First we settled in lzmir

624
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,406
And they all died.

625
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:15,563
Then I came here.
Life was hard in the big city.

626
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:19,317
I was 25. I opened a shop,
spending everything we had.

627
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,718
Thank goodness, we found you.

628
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:24,241
You became our people
and we became yours.

629
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:27,083
I established myself
and got married late in life...

630
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,358
...but we are happy now.
May the Lord keep it that way.

631
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:35,035
Our family came
from Thessaloniki.

632
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,597
I came over in my mother's womb.

633
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:40,446
Our family came from
Thessaloniki too. I was born here.

634
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:44,004
I grew up quick.
I grew old fast as well.

635
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:46,157
But, that house...

636
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:49,321
...my childhood, it is still there.

637
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,636
I was never a child again, you see.

638
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:56,765
I was always curious about
who lives in that house.

639
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:02,004
I wondered if a small boy
like myself still wanders those rooms.

640
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:06,361
That is there a son that l put letters
in the bottles and send them to Crete.

641
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:07,812
So that whoever lives in that house

642
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:09,758
will know about me when
they find it and read it.

643
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,118
I send them greetings from here
with the little bit of Greek that l remember.

644
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:15,287
If someone even in
Chios were to find the bottle,

645
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:16,686
that's right here,
under our nose...

646
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:19,804
...they would send it on to Crete.
They will send it.

647
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:22,405
It will happen.

648
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:27,163
If someone finds those bottles
and says, "We found them,"...

649
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:30,276
...then l will believe that
all of this really happened.

650
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:34,039
That is what the bottles
are really about.

651
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:36,516
Let everyone, the ignorant
and informed alike, take note.

652
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:39,963
The people who mock and ridiculous
are the same thieving opportunists...

653
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,046
...who robbed us blind because
we came from abroad destitute...

654
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,487
...and they took our gold
and possession for a song.

655
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,442
Don't get me started.

656
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:57,965
Maybe one day we can all go together.

657
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,003
To see my house.

658
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:04,318
- To pay our respects.
- Once, you talked about going.

659
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:06,802
In fact, it was with
your son-in-law, wasn't it? Many years ago.

660
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,684
Yeah, yeah.
But, that's the law.

661
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:13,763
If the registry of birth was over there,
for example mine is Rethimno...

662
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,356
...they won't give us a visa.
We can never go back.

663
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,320
They said you had to find out
what the name was changed to...

664
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:22,132
...after the population exchange...

665
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,044
...and have your registry
corrected accordingly.

666
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:27,997
We said that's fine and I went down
with my son-in-law to the office in lzmir.

667
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:31,080
I was so happy that
we would be going,

668
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:35,396
It was a bit shaky. They might turn
us away at any moment, but anyway.

669
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,444
We were leaving the next day.

670
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:41,762
If it weren't for bad luck,
I'd have no luck at all.

671
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,157
And when Nurdan turns on the radio,
we hear about:

672
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:47,639
The invasion of Cyprus.

673
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:53,316
All of the permits and
visas were cancelled again.

674
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:57,841
What can you do?
It wasn't meant to be.

675
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:02,923
Maybe when my grandson
has grown up a bit he can take me.

676
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:05,556
He will say:

677
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,556
"Come on, take my arm, grandpa.

678
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:14,760
We're setting off."

679
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:19,721
Right, Ozan?

680
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:28,880
I didn't make it in time. I was putting
my daughter to bed. Are you leaving?

681
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,679
Mr. Ercan,
I'll drop you guys off.

682
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:34,406
That won't be necessary.
We'll just walk and take this shortcut.

683
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:38,118
Leave those alone
and come here for a minute.

684
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:39,640
Why don't you come and
help me instead?

685
00:45:39,727 --> 00:45:41,922
If we don't cleanup,
the dogs will be attracted.

686
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,840
Let them come.
What could happen? You come too.

687
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:52,841
Okay, here I am.

688
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:00,200
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

689
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:10,765
Look what l have.

690
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,758
At this hour?
Everyone is sleeping, you crazy fool.

691
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:16,719
We'll keep it low.
Just two songs.

692
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,275
Look, what l just bought.
Halil brought it from Germany.

693
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:20,959
Crystal Gayle.

694
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:25,485
You mean the lady with the
long hair that you admire so much.

695
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,886
I have loved one woman.
And, I loved her dearly.

696
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:35,236
This heart has no room for anyone else.
And, there never will be.

697
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,444
Mr. Mehmet,
I hope business is good.

698
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,399
Good morning, Halil,
you're early today.

699
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,801
Good morning.

700
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,407
Don't stir up the dust.
We're washing a car here.

701
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:18,760
How many times do
I have to wash it?

702
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:22,837
Do you know how to drive the car?

703
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,919
Yep, but l don't because
the police might catch me.

704
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,480
We could buy a Mercedes if we wanted,
but my grandfather doesn't like them.

705
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:32,478
He says it would be
an affront to the poor.

706
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,722
What in the world are you doing, man?

707
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:41,241
- Well, get out of the way, will ya.
- Fighting again?

708
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:44,558
Nope. He got a little water on him is all.
Accidentally.

709
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:55,283
Tahsin, you take the buckets.

710
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:58,084
How can I help you, ma'am?

711
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,638
I hope business is well Mehmet.
How're you doing?

712
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,365
- Thank you, my dear. Welcome.
- Thank you.

713
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,916
I want number 70 white Oren Bayan.

714
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,325
Newspaper won't work for this.
Wrap it in white paper. The ink will rub off.

715
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:13,360
You don't need to wrap it.
I'll just put it in my bag.

716
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:15,795
Here you go.

717
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:20,958
Those are two hundred and fifty lira.

718
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:23,052
Look, he know sit by heart. Hello?

719
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:24,918
This kid has passed
you up as a shop-keeper.

720
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,641
Thank you.

721
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,638
- Good day, Mehmet.
- Have a good day. Good bye.

722
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:36,400
Kids, come here.

723
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:40,323
Now, I'm going to ask you a riddle.
Let's see which of you will get it.

724
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:41,726
Put your eye right here.

725
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,003
Slowly, don't cut yourself.

726
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,438
Give it to Tahsin.

727
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,758
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

728
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:51,275
A white triangle.

729
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,523
In other words, nothing.

730
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,524
Look again.

731
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:06,045
There are flowers, Uncle Mehmet.
There are flowers.

732
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:08,437
Tap it on the bottom. It will change.

733
00:50:11,727 --> 00:50:12,812
For goodness sake, boy.

734
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,407
I didn't ask you to do a strength test.
I said tap it.

735
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,001
Oh well, tell me
what made those flowers?

736
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,725
Different colors.

737
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,842
Now, both of you think about it.
What does this mean?

738
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:26,361
Don't tell me the answer.
Just think about it yourself.

739
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:28,756
- And, go ahead and order tea and fruit tea.
- You stay, I'll go.

740
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:35,203
Bayram, come right in.

741
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:43,598
Take these. Look, there is food
in this one and clothes in the other.

742
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:48,601
Take these out since the weather is hot.
These are for you to wear, okay?

743
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:52,685
Now, you go down to Sebahattin's bath.
I've already spoken with him.

744
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:55,561
Wash up and come back.
I'll go to the barber with you.

745
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:57,842
Do you hear, Bayram?

746
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:01,356
Okay, we'll see you later.

747
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:07,158
What are you doing now, kid?
What is eating at you?

748
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:09,795
Grandpa, don't let
Bayram come into the shop.

749
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:12,355
- And, why is that?
- He stinks to high heaven.

750
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,439
Now, that's enough.
You think he enjoys it?

751
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:20,801
That's enough, son.
Put it on your balls too, why don't you.

752
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:23,758
Why are you so afraid
of Bayram every time?

753
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,157
I'm not afraid. It's just that he looks at you
with those eyes, you know.

754
00:51:27,247 --> 00:51:29,886
What is he supposed to look with?
Don't talk like that. It's a sin.

755
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:32,323
He is one of our people too.
Come right here.

756
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:36,005
Tahsin, you listen too.

757
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,878
You remember Peruzat?

758
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:43,238
She was the most beautiful woman
in the seaport when she was young.

759
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:47,525
She even became the
tangerine beauty queen once.

760
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:50,235
They called her
Greta Garbo Peruzat.

761
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:53,319
And, this Bayram,
he fell in love with her as a youth.

762
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:57,082
The poor thing was a half-wit sharecropper.
Quite destitute.

763
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:00,839
People were bored, of course
and said, "Let's have a little fun."

764
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:04,283
They wrote a letter that purported
to be from Peruzatto Bayram.

765
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:07,325
Of course, Peruzat had giventhem
the cold shoulder...

766
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:11,719
...and they were going to get
their revenge on her. What small minds.

767
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:15,132
They called Bayram
to the coffeehouse.

768
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,681
They read him the letter,
saying that she wrote it.

769
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:20,240
It was such a love letter.

770
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:23,603
They had Peruzat saying, "I'm dying,
I'm burning for you, Bayram.

771
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:26,157
Come and ask my mother
for my hand in marriage."

772
00:52:26,487 --> 00:52:28,557
- Good day, Mehmet.
- Thanks dear. Goodbye.

773
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:31,161
Where were we now?
Oh yes.

774
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:35,638
Bayram brought his mother
along and the two poor souls setoff.

775
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:37,372
Greetings were
exchanged at the door.

776
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,999
In the end, the woman says,
"Are you crazy?"

777
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:41,247
Peruzat is studying
at a vocational school.

778
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:42,521
She is going to be a teacher...

779
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,287
...and doesn't have
a clue about any of this.

780
00:52:44,322 --> 00:52:45,686
You need to be on
your way, neighbor.

781
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:48,281
Granny Şengül, right?
Well, she did the right thing.

782
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,360
You're so inconsiderate.

783
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:53,644
Of course,
Bayram was devastated.

784
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:57,517
He was angry at everyone
and never opened his mouth again.

785
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:02,477
Later Peruzat met someone
at her school and they got married.

786
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:06,565
They settled in the capital
where they were studying.

787
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:08,963
Of course, she had no clue
about what had happened here.

788
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:11,481
Her mother didn't tell her
so she wouldn't be saddened by it.

789
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:15,395
Years passed by and Peruzat
returned home full of sorrow.

790
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:17,886
She returned home.

791
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:21,723
Her husband had been arrested
because he was an anarchist.

792
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:24,884
They had interrogated
Peruzat for a while, too.

793
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:27,442
They caused the poor
woman a lot of grief.

794
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:30,678
When she returned she found out
about Bayram from her acquaintances.

795
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:32,485
So she had to bear that sadness, too.

796
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:35,161
Her husband is still in custody,
where about is unknown.

797
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:38,398
No one knows what happened.
It's the grace of God, that's for certain.

798
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,444
So she doesn't believe it.

799
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:44,686
She sits waiting for
her husband to return. That's how it is.

800
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:49,835
You can be sure that the evil people
do hurts worse than a scorpion bite.

801
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:53,635
All creations tarts
talking and asks for mercy.

802
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:58,240
But people have
no mercy and pass on by.

803
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:01,964
Oh, what small minds!

804
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:07,802
Oh, now that is much better.

805
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:12,287
Okay, now, let's you and
me go to the barber.

806
00:54:12,322 --> 00:54:14,243
I'm going to get
my moustache trimmed.

807
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:17,839
We might as well look our best,
right Bayram?

808
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:20,203
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to...

809
00:54:20,238 --> 00:54:21,800
...hear a sound from you.
Behave yourselves.

810
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:27,843
- What a pity, isn't it?
- Hey! Don't talk to me.

811
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,972
Besides, just wait until
my grandpa comes back.

812
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:32,123
I'm going to tell him you took
the triangle and hid it.

813
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:36,439
You think I'm an idiot?
That l didn't see? You thief. I'll get you fired.

814
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:06,837
- Good day.
- Thanks, you too, ma'am.

815
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:08,720
- Uncle Mehmet?
- Yes, son?

816
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:11,958
I took this out of the trashcan
since it was just being thrown away.

817
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:15,160
- Are you crazy? I was just joking.
- Okay.

818
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,761
No, it's not okay.
Tell me what is going on.

819
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:24,046
You know, the flowers that
you see when you look at it.

820
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:27,605
They are similar to the flowers
where we come from.

821
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,643
I was small,
but l remember it a little.

822
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:34,397
My sister Kiraz, though, was a baby
when we came here.

823
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:36,172
She never saw them, that's why.

824
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,926
She doesn't know what it was
like and is always asking.

825
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:41,801
I was going to show her
the flowers inside and say:

826
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:44,452
"Look, this is what they were like."

827
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:47,797
That was what l was going to do.
Nothing more.

828
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:54,843
- He was going to tell on you, wasn't he?
- No, Uncle Mehmet. I swear he wasn't.

829
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,886
Beat it! Go home
and get out of my sight!

830
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:09,205
What's the matter with you, man?

831
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,286
What's the matter?

832
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:16,441
My grandpa ran me
out of the shop.

833
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:18,919
Shut up, man!

834
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:21,165
Because of that boy Tahsin?

835
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:28,037
Should we ambush him somewhere?
We'll beat the shit out of him.

836
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:31,043
He's become a total show-off.

837
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:38,805
Okay Tahsin, go have lunch.

838
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,065
Have a pita, or meatballs if you like.

839
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,163
Put it on my account.
Have dessert too.

840
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,887
I'm going to run into Izmir.
I'll be back in two hours.

841
00:56:46,922 --> 00:56:47,956
You can open the shop.

842
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:51,085
If there is anything you can't handle,
ask Uncle Halil for help.

843
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:54,684
- Okay, son?
- Okay, Uncle Mehmet.

844
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:55,961
Great.

845
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,923
Hey kid! Where are you headed?

846
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:18,046
I'm headed for hell!
I'm going home, where else would I go?

847
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,642
And my name's not "kid".
It's Ozan. Got it?

848
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:21,877
Ozan!

849
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,161
Where is your husband?

850
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:30,605
I'm... I'm waiting. He'll come.

851
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,759
Bullshit! Your husband's an anarchist!
They killed him.

852
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:35,280
What do you think of that!

853
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:54,524
Sea Boy, I have
something to say to you.

854
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:56,400
But you won't be pleased.

855
00:57:56,487 --> 00:57:58,796
Grandpa has found himself
a new grandson.

856
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,362
He has forgotten you too.
Did you know that?

857
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:04,196
See, you are just going
to lie there. Idiot.

858
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:08,644
He has forgotten me too.

859
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,803
I declare a yellow little puppy
has come to our house.

860
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:17,638
Are you talking to Mustafa?

861
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,600
What Mustafa! Do you think
l would talk to an empty grave?

862
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:22,484
What do you think l am?
Crazy like you?

863
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,637
Well, my ears were ringing.
I must have been mistaken.

864
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:26,997
You were mistaken, of course.
Go wash your ears.

865
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:31,402
I ought to rip your little penis off,
then you'll see, you bitch in heat.

866
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:32,892
What is the matter with you lately?

867
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,599
The older you get the
crazier you become.

868
00:58:34,807 --> 00:58:37,799
Your grandpa has never forgotten
you or the Sea Boy.

869
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:39,764
But, he drove me from the shop.

870
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:41,724
I'm sure it's because
you were unruly.

871
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:44,242
I'm going to go and work
at my uncle's cinema.

872
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,358
What cinema?
The cinema is closed.

873
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:48,324
Doesn't he have a summer cinema?

874
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,882
Oh, so you'll come home at
1 o'clock in the morning.

875
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:53,047
You are going to become
a vagabond at this rate.

876
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:54,036
What is it to you if l do?

877
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:58,883
I wish I had died instead of Mustafa.

878
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:01,972
No one can die
in place of someone else.

879
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,077
On the contrary,
they are born to take their place.

880
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,239
Do you know why we
love you so much?

881
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:08,972
When you were still a baby...

882
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,157
...your grandpa would whisper
in your ear all the time.

883
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:14,239
He would ask God to give you the lifespan
that he took away from Mustafa.

884
00:59:14,327 --> 00:59:17,683
You are a grandson and a
brother to your grandpa. Don't forget that.

885
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:20,640
That means that
when he embraces you, he is doing it twice.

886
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,639
You don't know these things...

887
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,266
...which is why you
strut around here...

888
00:59:24,301 --> 00:59:25,805
...fat and lazy with
a dick no longer than...

889
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:27,052
...your balls because you haven't...

890
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:28,679
...a thing to worry about.
You just keep it up.

891
00:59:29,007 --> 00:59:30,847
As soon as we find
something to be happy about,

892
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:32,246
you hit us on the head with a stick.

893
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:33,686
Grandma.

894
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:37,319
Yes, my child.

895
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,479
- What does "on the contrary" mean?
- It means your mama's poontang.

896
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:45,245
- What does poontang mean?
- What is going on? No one can sleep.

897
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:47,079
Who did you have this child with?

898
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:49,084
The boy's demon-possessed.

899
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:52,239
I'm going to have an imam with clout pray
over you. Otherwise, it's hopeless.

900
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,835
He's going to strangle us in our sleep
when he grows up a bit.

901
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,799
Help me, neighbors.
I can't get Peruzat under control.

902
00:59:58,487 --> 00:59:59,920
What's the matter, girl?

903
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:02,841
Ozan, quick. Go up to your sister
so she doesn't wakeup.

904
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:06,205
What is the matter?
It scared us to death.

905
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:07,640
Is that Peruzat?

906
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:17,244
OneDrima, 5 meters of curtain backing,
80 centimeters clean skirt fabric.

907
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:19,292
Uncle Halil cut it with the scissors.

908
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,205
It will be put on Ayşe Durmaz's bill.
She didn't pay.

909
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:24,881
Good job, Tahsin.
You are going to be alright. Look.

910
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:26,764
There was also a really
old lady stopped by.

911
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,356
I said, "How can I help you?"
She said, "You wouldn't know," and left.

912
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:31,487
That's okay. I'm sure it's nothing.
Here, take this.

913
01:00:31,522 --> 01:00:33,284
When you leave tonight,
take it to her sister.

914
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:42,044
Peruzat, it's okay now.
It's okay, sister.

915
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:45,318
Peruzat. Open your hand for me.
You have made a fist and I can't open it.

916
01:00:45,407 --> 01:00:47,841
I wonder if we could give her Diazepem?
Should I bring some?

917
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:50,435
Not without being sure.
Let me make a phone call from Halim's.

918
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:52,961
We'll have the doctor come
and give her a shot or something.

919
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:55,287
That would be best.
Run, Muazzez, run.

920
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:57,039
Okay. Hand it to me, neighbor.

921
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:02,158
I wonder why
it happened so suddenly?

922
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:04,092
Your grandson just kept saying,

923
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,324
'Your husband died."
And she just threw herself down.

924
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:24,401
Ozan!

925
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:32,002
Bayram, what happened?

926
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:36,760
What happened to the kid?

927
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:38,599
What happened?
Did he fall?

928
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,759
They've busted his head, the bastards.
Hurry, put him in the car.

929
01:01:41,967 --> 01:01:44,322
- Halil Usta, close up the shop!
- Okay.

930
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:52,324
Ozan. Don't run off!
Come here!

931
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,402
You know what
I'm going to do to you?

932
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,523
Are you trying to kill somebody?

933
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,878
Nurse, call a doctor right away.

934
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,276
Ozan!

935
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,763
Ozan, where are you, fool?

936
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:18,879
Look, I'm not going to beat you.
I won't.

937
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:22,686
Okay, you might get you rear pulled
a bit, but that is all.

938
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,920
Ozan!

939
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:28,372
We gave him three stitches, Mehmet.

940
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:30,967
Your apprentice is fit as a fiddle.
He'll be just fine.

941
01:02:31,087 --> 01:02:32,812
They are children.
What can you do?

942
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:35,156
Does he have a childhood left,
Hamide, my dear.

943
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:40,078
Does he have a childhood
left anymore. What is this?

944
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:41,520
Oh, Mehmet, sir.

945
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:43,447
Foreman Berat.
Sorry about all of this, man.

946
01:02:43,482 --> 01:02:44,516
Thank you, sir.
Can I see him?

947
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:48,317
- My dear son. What's happened to you?
- Nothing, dad. I'm fine.

948
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,078
Who did this, son, tell me.

949
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,681
Uncle Mehmet, I swear, it wasn't Ozan.
He wasn't there.

950
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,560
Then who was it?
Spit it out.

951
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,692
And what am l asking for.
Who else?

952
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,002
Obviously, it is that other
pack of bastards.

953
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,395
I don't know.

954
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:06,480
Sorry, l won't touch it again.

955
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:09,719
Stop crying. We'll find him.
He's around here somewhere.

956
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:11,452
If he is here,
he should come out then.

957
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,364
There are jackals and wolves.
They'll eat my boy.

958
01:03:13,447 --> 01:03:15,517
Give me a break.
Do you think we live in the Amazon?

959
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:18,446
- Aren't there any wild boars?
- You are right.

960
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:20,998
- Ozan.
- Ozan.

961
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:22,652
He's not over
by our place either.

962
01:03:22,687 --> 01:03:24,723
Have you looked over by the
old chaste berry tree?

963
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:26,365
I've looked everywhere.

964
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:28,332
Ibrahim, hang on, this won't do.

965
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:30,562
Let's make a plan and
search methodically.

966
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,765
That's right. We shouldn't all pileup
in the same place. Oh, Emine.

967
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:35,360
Emine.

968
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:38,327
You don't reckon
he'd go to the sea again, do you?

969
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,063
If he had,
Ercan would've grabbed him

970
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:41,599
by the ear,
and brought him back by now.

971
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:43,678
- Where is Mehmet Bey?
- You look in the vineyard rows.

972
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,162
I'll go out on the road.
I'll go to police for the last resort.

973
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,837
The little bastard is probably hiding
and doing this on purpose, the little beast.

974
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:52,361
Don't call him a beast, lbo.
Look, my hands are shaking.

975
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,876
Son, are you crazy?
Where are you going?

976
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,847
I'm going to lzmir.
I'm gonna find a job.

977
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:23,326
I'm gonna work.
I don't want you.

978
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:27,038
I wasn't gonna hit you, son.

979
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:29,766
- Would I ever hit you?
- You hit me once before.

980
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:31,680
I did hit you once, yes.

981
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:39,159
Come here. That's my man!

982
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,517
Aren't you afraid
all by yourself out here?

983
01:04:42,927 --> 01:04:44,092
What kind of kid are you?

984
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,197
- I don't understand.
- Why should I be afraid?

985
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:48,961
Turks are the most fearless people
in the world.

986
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,485
Good for you, then.

987
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:54,763
I can even let my hands go if l want.

988
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:56,082
Hold on, you’ll fall off!

989
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:59,923
What he needs is a sound beating,
but we aren't used to that as it's not our way.

990
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,397
Let it go. It frightened him.
Let's not make it worse.

991
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:04,677
Well, alright. Good night everyone.

992
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:09,478
Those sons of asses you call
friends busted Tahsin's head open.

993
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,366
You were clearly the cause.

994
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:14,365
You pushed Peruzat over the edge
just for the heck of it.

995
01:05:14,487 --> 01:05:16,824
And on top of that you
ran away from home.

996
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,162
What do you have
up your sleeve next?

997
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,003
Why don't you
go ahead and kill us?

998
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:22,320
You would be rid
of us and we of you.

999
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:24,165
- You live here and we live in glory.
- Father.

1000
01:05:24,247 --> 01:05:26,447
Hang on, Ibrahim.
This discussion is going to take place.

1001
01:05:26,482 --> 01:05:27,482
He has come to his senses.

1002
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,999
This has gone too far.
He's never known poverty or difficulty.

1003
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:34,284
He's never gotten a beating from
any of us, so what's his problem?

1004
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:36,767
We have dropped
everything to take care of him.

1005
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:38,041
What is it that you want, kid?

1006
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:40,635
Answer me.

1007
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:43,920
You could string him up by his toenails
and he would still be a wall.

1008
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,646
He's gonna talk! He'll talk
if we have to sit here until the sun rises.

1009
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,243
Why are you like this, son?

1010
01:05:51,207 --> 01:05:54,005
Why are you acting
so wickedly, son?

1011
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,882
- I'm not wicked.
- You are wicked.

1012
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,686
I am not.

1013
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:01,122
A wicked man will not say
he is wicked. He won't believe it.

1014
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,324
He has already seared his conscience
and he doesn't even know it.

1015
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,284
Listen to me.
I'm telling you.

1016
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:07,760
Your heart is wicked.

1017
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,680
Stop this childishness, grow up
and screw your head on straight.

1018
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:15,486
My friends don't like
the people you do.

1019
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,961
They are different.
Not like you.

1020
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:23,602
I'm the one that is all alone.
Am I to have no friends?

1021
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:26,716
Everyone does it.
You think it's just me?

1022
01:06:27,527 --> 01:06:29,882
You keep talking
about the good old days.

1023
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,679
About your homes and your people,
but l have nothing.

1024
01:06:35,727 --> 01:06:38,480
What am l to do?
What about me!

1025
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:40,958
Am I to live all alone?

1026
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:59,402
The wind kicked up again today.
But Lord, it's like a furnace.

1027
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:01,955
- Did you slice tomatoes, mom?
- What do you think l am doing?

1028
01:07:02,047 --> 01:07:03,878
Just look at my husband.

1029
01:07:03,967 --> 01:07:05,446
10 eggs, is that enough?

1030
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:08,600
I don't know. Wait till they come.
If it's not enough, we'll make more.

1031
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:10,439
Look here, the little
prince has arrived.

1032
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,758
A little prince has awoken
and is looking at us from over there.

1033
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,362
My goodness,
but isn't he handsome.

1034
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:19,885
I made the scrambled eggs
and tomatoes that my son loves so much.

1035
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:21,844
- Without peppers.
- You're kidding. Don't we get any?

1036
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:24,566
I don't know.
If Ozan says it's alright, I'll give you some.

1037
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:25,961
- Son?
- Is grandpa gone?

1038
01:07:26,367 --> 01:07:28,562
- He's left.
- Today's Sunday?

1039
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,918
Come on, let's wash our faces.

1040
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,961
The devils probably licked
your face until sunrise.

1041
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,125
Down you go.
Come on, wash your face.

1042
01:07:39,247 --> 01:07:42,956
Lean over, lean over.
Stick your head under there.

1043
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:44,878
But, it's cold dad. Come on.

1044
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:53,443
- Ozan, your grandpa is taking us to the sea.
- Ozan, we're here.

1045
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:55,320
We're going to the beach,
to the beach!

1046
01:07:55,727 --> 01:07:57,922
Alright! Bless my soul.

1047
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,644
Good morning.
Sit down everyone.

1048
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:14,605
There were three
more kids but they must

1049
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,444
have fallen out of the
car along the way.

1050
01:08:18,447 --> 01:08:21,086
Bankruptcy!
The locusts have come for our crops.

1051
01:08:21,487 --> 01:08:24,638
Nadire. If we run out of molasses,
we have Hüsey in here.

1052
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,400
We can bust his head
and let it ooze out, for a change.

1053
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,560
We're here.

1054
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:40,204
Hold on!

1055
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:56,164
Everyone will stay
between me and the beach. No further.

1056
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:09,079
Who made these
stuffed bell peppers?

1057
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,963
You can't beat Nadire's
stuffed bell peppers.

1058
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:17,283
Eat some pastry, eat up.

1059
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:37,644
Mehmet. Good day.
I hope your business is good.

1060
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:39,843
Good day, Mrs. Güssün.
I hope it's just as good for you.

1061
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:42,083
I stopped by the other day.
You were out.

1062
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:46,086
Why don't you get my burial shroud ready?
Then, I'll be on my way.

1063
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:47,572
Hold on, Sister Güssün.

1064
01:09:47,607 --> 01:09:49,359
It's a bit early for that.
What's the matter?

1065
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:51,757
Well, the time is
approaching, Mehmet.

1066
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:55,556
I thought I’d come and get it
while I could still get out and about.

1067
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:58,719
- I'd feel better if l got it taken care of.
- Goodness gracious, Sister Güssün.

1068
01:09:58,967 --> 01:10:00,606
Well, you just get
my package ready.

1069
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:02,245
You see, I'm running
off to my husband.

1070
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:06,797
Whatever you say. Have a seat.
Would you like tea or coffee?

1071
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:09,317
Make it tea.
Coffee aggravates my heart condition.

1072
01:10:18,807 --> 01:10:20,638
In the name of God,
the Merciful.

1073
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,121
This time it has to be done
without scissors. Look and learn.

1074
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:40,207
You can't use scissors
on a burial shroud.

1075
01:10:40,242 --> 01:10:41,196
It has to be done by hand.

1076
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:44,601
These are so that the dead
smell good when they are buried.

1077
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:47,560
This is the interesting part of this job.
Learn this.

1078
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:53,157
Do you know what they
do with this cotton?

1079
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:56,997
He was not born
and He doesn't give birth!

1080
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:08,252
Is the tea for you, Sister Güssün?

1081
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,845
- Here you go.
- Yes, it is. Thank you.

1082
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:12,127
Did you come to buy
a new dress and shoes.

1083
01:11:12,162 --> 01:11:13,162
You know, something flashy.

1084
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:15,127
Hush, you dog.
What would I do with a dress?

1085
01:11:15,162 --> 01:11:16,276
I'm just getting some stuff.

1086
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:19,035
- How's your mother doing?
- She's as well as could be expected.

1087
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:20,766
Give her my greetings.

1088
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,932
Your jackass got
loose the other day.

1089
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:25,481
He got into my garden and
ate every flower l have.

1090
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:29,806
Now, my garden is poor and barren.

1091
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:32,600
You bring some new ones
and plant them by fall.

1092
01:11:32,887 --> 01:11:34,559
Oh, of course.
I have nothing else to do anyway.

1093
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,844
Shut up. I'll bust your head.

1094
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:39,003
Bring some saplings
and we'll plant them together.

1095
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:41,403
Good, sister. Enjoy your tea.

1096
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:43,404
- Hope business is well.
- Thanks, Hasan.

1097
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:51,643
Here you go, Ms. Güssün.
This is yours.

1098
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,041
- Is this it now?
- Yes

1099
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:55,526
Take this too.

1100
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:58,083
Look, it just came in.
It is beautiful. Roses and leaves.

1101
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,567
First, you make yourself
a pair of trousers from these.

1102
01:12:00,602 --> 01:12:02,080
Wear it happily until it wears out.

1103
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,478
And finally this.
May the Lord delay the end.

1104
01:12:05,207 --> 01:12:07,767
Thanks. How much is it?

1105
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,920
Well, we don't charge for this.
You must have forgotten.

1106
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,885
- You don't charge?
- No. That is the tradition.

1107
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,441
OK, fine.

1108
01:12:16,727 --> 01:12:19,639
May the Lord give you
and your grandson a long life.

1109
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,320
Thanks very much.

1110
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:38,881
Their faces have all been
erased from my memory.

1111
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:48,040
Well, Ozan. You need to grow up
and take us with you across the sea.

1112
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:50,478
I never forgot that look.

1113
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,527
The long summer ended right there,
for you and me both.

1114
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:55,597
And right after the first cicada too.

1115
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,866
What is the yearning for?
Will you tell me?

1116
01:12:57,901 --> 01:12:59,485
Was that the day
you made your decision.

1117
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:02,161
That hot afternoon? In the middle of the day?
In the summer?

1118
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:03,692
It was not the thousands of stories...

1119
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:05,558
proverbs and pieces
of advice that raised me.

1120
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:08,847
It was that look of yours.
That look l couldn't understand.

1121
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:10,678
You.
The you I couldn't understand.

1122
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,561
Hey kid!

1123
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,160
Would you like some lemonade?

1124
01:13:31,527 --> 01:13:32,960
Do you like it, my little prince?

1125
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:34,881
Who is the man?

1126
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:37,237
A guest.
Somebody I've been expecting.

1127
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:38,836
Is he coming to your house?

1128
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:44,605
Yep. The length of the road symbolizes
the length of the wait, sir.

1129
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:49,995
The luludia flowers he is carrying
represent hope and happiness.

1130
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,636
Do you like metaphors, little prince?

1131
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:57,403
I do.

1132
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:01,565
Is that a suitcase in the distance?
Did he leave it there?

1133
01:14:02,247 --> 01:14:05,000
Bravo. You immediately understood
what l wanted to express.

1134
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:07,612
Bravo.
You immediately understood

1135
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,399
what l wanted to express.
I don't like suitcases.

1136
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:11,315
They are very depressing.

1137
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,085
They remind one
of returning and departing.

1138
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:21,002
He has left it behind because
he will never need it again.

1139
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,405
Then, he must be coming to stay?

1140
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:26,646
- Like for good.
- Now you deserve a kiss.

1141
01:14:30,687 --> 01:14:31,961
It's for good.

1142
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:38,237
That is such a nice expression.
For good.

1143
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,685
Grandma, what is a metaphor?

1144
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:43,844
They happen at sea
and when a storm comes up...

1145
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:46,475
...they spin and pull ships
and people down under.

1146
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:47,921
That's not right.

1147
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:49,840
Mom what is a metaphor?

1148
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:51,332
I sit something like camphor?

1149
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,164
You know, the stuff they
use in cough medicine?

1150
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:54,756
No, it's not.

1151
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:56,923
Meta is a Greek word.

1152
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:04,955
It means "later". And, "for" is English,
so it must mean, "for later."

1153
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:08,525
Dad, grandpa.

1154
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:10,326
What does metaphor mean?

1155
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,522
Metaphor. It means
to compare one thing to another.

1156
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,052
For example, if l were to say that

1157
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:20,726
my heart is an oyster
and you are the pearl...

1158
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:25,479
...then, l am comparing my heart
to an oyster and my love to a pearl.

1159
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:28,406
He hears it all the time on television.

1160
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:31,247
Metaphor, schmetaphor.
Forget it. Today, I made a decision.

1161
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:32,197
God help us.

1162
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,247
As soon as summer
is over and before school...

1163
01:15:34,282 --> 01:15:35,760
...opens we will go
on a family vacation.

1164
01:15:35,927 --> 01:15:37,121
Where, dad?

1165
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,625
First, we will go
by plane to Athens...

1166
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,483
...and then take a ferry
from there to Crete.

1167
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:43,086
Fantastic.

1168
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:46,321
As you know,
we can get our passports now.

1169
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,887
What's the matter? You are looking
at me like you just saw a ghost.

1170
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:53,487
We are going to travel.
Is that so bad?

1171
01:15:53,522 --> 01:15:54,556
The shop has tied us down.

1172
01:15:54,927 --> 01:15:57,521
For example, have you
ever boarded a ferryboat, darling?

1173
01:15:57,647 --> 01:15:59,126
No, l was on a rowboat once.

1174
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:02,636
- That doesn't count.
- But, what about the baby, dad?

1175
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:05,446
She'll come too.
Right, my little princess?

1176
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:06,477
Of course.

1177
01:16:07,927 --> 01:16:08,723
Ozan?

1178
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:14,116
Good for you, boy.

1179
01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:16,876
What about it, Nadire?

1180
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,612
Weren't you the one
who saw those senior

1181
01:16:20,647 --> 01:16:22,797
British tourists and said,
"They know how to live"...

1182
01:16:23,207 --> 01:16:25,801
...the one who said they were
seventy years old but still trucking?

1183
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:28,441
Stand up for a minute
and rouse yourself a bit.

1184
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,884
By God, you're talking now,
Mehmet.

1185
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,319
Let's go for real.
We should go see some people.

1186
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,527
Those infidels won't
kill us there, will they?

1187
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:49,362
- Grandpa is here!
- Don't yell.

1188
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:52,644
- Welcome home, grandpa.
- Good to be here.

1189
01:16:52,727 --> 01:16:54,877
Man, no shoes and no hat,
get inside.

1190
01:16:56,607 --> 01:16:57,835
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

1191
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:00,480
Come on, their mom
says dinner is ready.

1192
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:03,001
Mom! Grandma
is calling you to dinner.

1193
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:04,486
No need to shout.

1194
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:05,756
We're coming!

1195
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:07,640
Put that in the fridge, darling.

1196
01:17:08,967 --> 01:17:12,084
- Is that bottle back again?
- Was it hidden before?

1197
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:16,647
What's the matter? We kept the
fast all summer for Him above.

1198
01:17:16,682 --> 01:17:17,762
Now Ramadan is over.

1199
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:19,838
We have to look
out for ourselves a bit.

1200
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:22,886
Lord have mercy.
You're going to be struck down one day.

1201
01:17:23,447 --> 01:17:25,563
He knows my heart,
so nothing bad is going to happen.

1202
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:32,040
- Besides, we are celebrating tonight.
- What celebration?

1203
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:33,772
What do you mean,
what celebration?

1204
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,877
We've got them for all of us.
We leave next week.

1205
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:38,965
How in the world are we going to
get ready in one week, Mehmet?

1206
01:17:39,047 --> 01:17:42,801
Oh brother. It's just a suitcase.
Did you think we were moving?

1207
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:44,115
But, it is a bit shaky.

1208
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,038
They could turn us away
at the border at any time.

1209
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:50,364
Our situation is a bit complex,
you know, our place of birth and all.

1210
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,687
Maybe we should've stayed
at the vineyard a bit longer.

1211
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:58,084
It's still awfully hot.

1212
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:03,764
There is a James Stewart film tonight.
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

1213
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:05,161
Why is he going, grandpa?

1214
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:09,162
Huh, grandpa?

1215
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:12,675
- Yes.
- I asked why he is going?

1216
01:18:16,007 --> 01:18:18,396
I don't know, son.
We'll watch it and find out.

1217
01:18:18,807 --> 01:18:20,372
Why were you so
preoccupied that night

1218
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:22,398
when you were so close
to realizing your dream?

1219
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:24,567
I remember that you were
always a restless spirit

1220
01:18:24,602 --> 01:18:26,125
at the grape harvest.
But that year...

1221
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,892
All by himself against
the whole Congress.

1222
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:30,157
That is what it means to be an idealist.
Good for him.

1223
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:32,185
It was a different
restlessness, wasn't it?

1224
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,043
Something only l noticed.
Maybe l was making up.

1225
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:37,007
Who knows, maybe you were
going to say damn it all,

1226
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:39,567
let's go, fall in line,
we're out of here...

1227
01:18:39,647 --> 01:18:41,642
...but as always,
my wonderful country

1228
01:18:41,677 --> 01:18:43,637
is full of fresh surprises
that robust of...

1229
01:18:43,727 --> 01:18:45,887
...the opportunity to
reflect even for a moment.

1230
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,445
Just like an
adventure comic book.

1231
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:50,518
- What's going on?
- Oh my, good news I hope?

1232
01:18:55,207 --> 01:18:58,244
- What's happened, father?
- Nadire just got up to wash for prayers.

1233
01:18:58,327 --> 01:18:59,883
Dad, has something
happened to mother?

1234
01:18:59,918 --> 01:19:01,439
No. Don't worry.
She turned on the radio.

1235
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,721
There has been a coup, son.

1236
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:06,482
What!

1237
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:11,042
Easy son, take it easy.

1238
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:13,767
...9th Army Corps commander
Sabahattin Cambazoglu...

1239
01:19:13,802 --> 01:19:15,803
...the provinces of Erzurum,
Agri, Kars...

1240
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:18,760
Well, dad, the anarchists
are done for. Isn't that better?

1241
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,526
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Ibrahim! Ibrahim!

1242
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:33,686
Way to go Kenan Pasha.

1243
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:52,843
Have they come for us?

1244
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:58,446
- Dad. There's a military vehicle coming.
- The books, Nurdan. The books.

1245
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,166
Hold your horses, now.
Let's see what they want.

1246
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:04,286
How can I help you, son?

1247
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:06,797
- Are you Ibrahim Erdinç,
the deputy mayor? – Yes l am.

1248
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:08,116
You will come with us.

1249
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:10,243
Why are you taking him?
What has my husband done?

1250
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,127
Okay, Nurdan. Everything's fine.
It's obviously for questioning.

1251
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:14,481
- I'll come too.
- Not you, sir.

1252
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:15,716
What do you mean not me?

1253
01:20:15,807 --> 01:20:17,607
Dad. Just cool it.
Nothing's going to happen.

1254
01:20:17,642 --> 01:20:18,881
They just want to ask questions.

1255
01:20:19,087 --> 01:20:20,156
I'll come too.

1256
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,684
There is a curfew. They told us
to bring the deputy mayor, only him.

1257
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:25,723
Come on, man.
I can't walk in the neighborhood

1258
01:20:25,758 --> 01:20:27,399
I've lived in for 40 years?
What small minds!

1259
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:29,876
- Mister, don't give us trouble.
- Don't start with the 'mister'.

1260
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:34,438
- We respect the army, but don't piss me off.
- Get inside mister!

1261
01:20:35,207 --> 01:20:36,765
Father.

1262
01:20:56,207 --> 01:20:58,846
Welcome,
Mr. Mehmet, welcome.

1263
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:01,477
Thanks.

1264
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,402
- Ozan, how are you?
- I'm fine.

1265
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:06,478
Welcome, Mr. Mehmet
How're you Ozan?

1266
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,607
School opens tomorrow.
We thought we ought...

1267
01:21:08,642 --> 01:21:10,040
...to come down once
more with the boy.

1268
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:13,603
Good idea.
Just look how empty the place is.

1269
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:16,167
There is not much
to enjoy around here.

1270
01:21:16,202 --> 01:21:17,998
Autumn has come
early this year.

1271
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:20,642
Yeah, the joy has
gone out of everything.

1272
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:24,165
- What can l offer you?
- I'll have some tea if it's no trouble.

1273
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:25,566
Right away Mr. Mehmet.

1274
01:21:25,687 --> 01:21:27,967
Of course, your vacation
has gone up in smoke.

1275
01:21:28,002 --> 01:21:29,400
Forget the vacation, Mr. Ercan.

1276
01:21:29,487 --> 01:21:32,047
- Just look at what they've done.
- What's happened?

1277
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:34,242
They aren't pressuring
Ibrahim too much, are they?

1278
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:36,317
No, they just keep asking
him about this and that.

1279
01:21:36,407 --> 01:21:38,284
He just says he doesn't
know anything about it.

1280
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:41,001
They call him down there
every morning like it's a regular job.

1281
01:21:41,447 --> 01:21:43,517
Now, they are removing
the mayor from his post.

1282
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,882
They say the military
junta will appoint a new mayor.

1283
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:48,845
Ibrahim will keep his job,
but it won't be easy.

1284
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:52,046
Still, it's not too
bad around here.

1285
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:54,522
Istanbul and Ankara
are something else-total turmoil.

1286
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:56,962
Death sentences have been issued
for several young men.

1287
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:00,602
There is so much suffering.
I can't even talk about it.

1288
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:03,366
We are cannibalistically
eating our own young, like a crocodile.

1289
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:28,372
We just couldn't
get your haircut.

1290
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:30,921
Teacher won't say anything
on the first day.

1291
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:37,237
Stop it, Ozan. Stop it, son.
You're wearing me out.

1292
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:39,372
You're in the 5th grade now.

1293
01:22:39,407 --> 01:22:41,967
I did that on purpose
to make you laugh.

1294
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:48,281
And, one on this cheek
for your dad. Come on.

1295
01:22:48,367 --> 01:22:52,758
- Is Dad not getting up?
- He came home very late, son.

1296
01:23:05,367 --> 01:23:07,323
And, our apprentice is here too.

1297
01:23:07,447 --> 01:23:08,572
Give half of it to Tahsin.

1298
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,677
I don't have change,
but it is for both of you.

1299
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:13,235
My goodness,
is this little angle your sister?

1300
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:15,801
Goon then. May the Lord
give you all a sharp mind.

1301
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:21,356
Look, Ozan, this is my sister Kiraz.
She is starting first grade.

1302
01:23:21,407 --> 01:23:23,443
Kiraz? What a name?

1303
01:23:23,527 --> 01:23:25,757
I'm glad to meet you.
My name is Armut.

1304
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:27,718
- Is the first grade hard?
- Very hard!

1305
01:23:27,847 --> 01:23:31,044
I told you it was easy.
Why don't you believe me?

1306
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:34,762
My teacher's name is Necla.
Is she nice?

1307
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:37,441
Man, you are in for it.
She'll beat you black and blue.

1308
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:40,767
Just joking. She is really nice.
Never beats anyone.

1309
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:42,485
That is what
my brother said too.

1310
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:47,641
He also told me, "You have two
older brothers at school me and Ozan."

1311
01:23:56,807 --> 01:23:57,523
Here they come.

1312
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:12,605
Greetings friends.

1313
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:17,039
Thank you, thank you.
Which of you is Ibrahim Erdinç?

1314
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,123
That would be me.

1315
01:24:20,487 --> 01:24:22,239
Pleased to meet you.

1316
01:24:22,727 --> 01:24:24,682
I look forward to receiving
all of the personnel...

1317
01:24:24,717 --> 01:24:26,638
...in my office in half an
hour for introductions.

1318
01:24:26,727 --> 01:24:28,524
- Good day.
- Thank you.

1319
01:24:28,607 --> 01:24:30,086
Mr. Ibrahim, come to my office.

1320
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:33,239
Let's not waste any time.
You and I have a lot to do.

1321
01:24:33,727 --> 01:24:35,126
It sure looks that way.

1322
01:24:39,047 --> 01:24:40,241
This room, sir.

1323
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,158
And, just what is this?
Why isn't this gone?

1324
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:47,246
There hasn't been time since
everything happened so quickly.

1325
01:24:47,327 --> 01:24:50,000
They only told us your name yesterday.
We are just taking care of it.

1326
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:51,846
Taking care of it, ey?

1327
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:56,045
We are going to have to get used to
how you talk around here.

1328
01:24:56,247 --> 01:24:58,761
...In spite of what is commonly
held to be true...

1329
01:24:58,847 --> 01:25:01,441
...this word is never used around here
or in the Aegean region, sir.

1330
01:25:01,527 --> 01:25:02,972
It is an expression
of affirmation...

1331
01:25:03,007 --> 01:25:04,725
...that is used in other
areas of the country.

1332
01:25:05,007 --> 01:25:06,982
Unfortunately,
it is a word that poor theater script...

1333
01:25:07,017 --> 01:25:08,958
...writers unfamiliar with
the Aegean dialect...

1334
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:11,641
...have used on state television
programs and in village plays.

1335
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:13,572
You know,
how they have this idea...

1336
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:15,404
...that every villager
absolutely must use it.

1337
01:25:15,447 --> 01:25:16,880
They told me you were clever.

1338
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:21,325
No matter, I came well-supplied.

1339
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:26,926
Well, since they don't use 'ey' here...

1340
01:25:27,527 --> 01:25:30,862
...and, since you can,
when you want, employ your...

1341
01:25:30,897 --> 01:25:34,197
...pure Turkish perfectly,
then you'll say, "yes".

1342
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:37,837
I am delighted to say "yes"
to everything that is right, sir.

1343
01:25:41,127 --> 01:25:43,595
Where have you been, Ibrahim.

1344
01:25:47,407 --> 01:25:49,238
I hope you eat your own bullshit.

1345
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,725
Getup, Ibrahim.

1346
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:04,045
Be quiet, for God's sake.
I don't have the strength.

1347
01:26:04,687 --> 01:26:06,605
He knew how to
conduct a fair fight.

1348
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,523
But, he had no weapon
for a dirty one.

1349
01:26:08,607 --> 01:26:10,598
He didn't know how
to wage those battles.

1350
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:13,845
He had probably always thought
that the world was a place full of dignity.

1351
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,687
That was true for both of you.
Then, one day you looked around...

1352
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:18,412
...and saw that those
beautiful people...

1353
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:20,642
...had got on their beautiful
horses and ridden off.

1354
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:23,407
Now, this place they
call Partridge Island.

1355
01:26:23,442 --> 01:26:25,841
It seems like a pretty
destitute place.

1356
01:26:26,007 --> 01:26:27,235
- Miss Ayşen.
- Yes, sir.

1357
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:30,303
Prepare a report describing
the characteristics

1358
01:26:30,338 --> 01:26:32,920
of this region and send it
to the ministry of culture.

1359
01:26:33,007 --> 01:26:35,965
Mr. Gürkan, that would be a death knell
for all of the beaches there.

1360
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:38,681
Most of the locals make
their living from fishing.

1361
01:26:38,767 --> 01:26:41,679
We would destroy both
the beaches and the fishing.

1362
01:26:41,767 --> 01:26:43,247
From there search
we have conducted...

1363
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,600
...a chain of hotels in that area...

1364
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:47,606
...would harm the environment, and pollution.
- Do you have a better idea?

1365
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:49,126
We are researching it, sir.

1366
01:26:49,407 --> 01:26:50,892
For three months
you have opposed...

1367
01:26:50,927 --> 01:26:52,963
...everyone of my initiatives.
I'm tired of it.

1368
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:57,437
You are the deputy mayor
not the opposition.

1369
01:26:57,807 --> 01:27:00,321
You are supposed to be
making my job easier.

1370
01:27:01,127 --> 01:27:04,085
But we haven't moved forward
an inch in three months thanks to you.

1371
01:27:04,727 --> 01:27:07,007
This country has failed
to develop because of the...

1372
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:08,759
...backward mentality
of people like you.

1373
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:11,964
We have to develop and grow.
There is no other way.

1374
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:14,566
I have no objection to that.

1375
01:27:15,047 --> 01:27:17,003
But, if what you call
development means...

1376
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:19,202
...turning over the
beaches to your friends

1377
01:27:19,237 --> 01:27:21,317
in parliament for a song,
well l object to that.

1378
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:25,321
Effective immediately,
you no longer work for the city.

1379
01:27:25,447 --> 01:27:27,483
Empty your office and
get the hell out of here.

1380
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:31,561
I would have resigned long ago...

1381
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:35,396
...but l didn't want to leave
the place to jackals like you.

1382
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:38,645
But, don't forget the power
of the people, Mr. Mayor.

1383
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:41,235
They may have a thing or two
to say about all this.

1384
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:42,601
But, they didn't.

1385
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:45,679
Or, if they did, we didn't hear it.
Not even a whisper.

1386
01:27:46,447 --> 01:27:48,972
If you remember,
my father was sued for

1387
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:52,158
issuing a threat, abuse of power
and other things.

1388
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:20,998
Ibrahim,
what are you doing here?

1389
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:24,440
I'm sitting.

1390
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:28,238
Come inside and sit then.

1391
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:32,157
They are selling the country,
Nurdan.

1392
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:33,772
Selling it piece by piece.

1393
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:35,877
Whoever heard of such
brazen shamelessness.

1394
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:38,927
Not a single person
stood up for me either.

1395
01:28:39,567 --> 01:28:40,841
Cowards!

1396
01:28:40,927 --> 01:28:44,158
Ibrahim, for the love of God, don't yell.

1397
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:47,480
Let them sell it.
Let them all starve to death.

1398
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:49,612
Whatever happens will
happen to them and

1399
01:28:49,647 --> 01:28:51,842
they'll all be beating their
heads against the wall.

1400
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:53,878
Are you saying the
same thing, Nurdan?

1401
01:28:54,207 --> 01:28:56,767
What can I do, Ibrahim?
What do you want me to say?

1402
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,686
We have children.

1403
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,762
I'm thinking of them,
not a world of strangers.

1404
01:29:03,847 --> 01:29:07,886
We aren't hungry, we aren't homeless.
You can get another job.

1405
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:10,841
I can make clothes again.
It'll all workout.

1406
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:13,524
What do I care about
everybody else?

1407
01:29:13,607 --> 01:29:16,167
So, that is the kind of country
we leave to our children?

1408
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:21,803
How will we look them in the eye?
What will we say to them?

1409
01:29:23,127 --> 01:29:25,721
Are we just going to say:
"Sorry, kids. We couldn't do it.

1410
01:29:27,087 --> 01:29:30,012
And, if you want to
make it in this life

1411
01:29:30,047 --> 01:29:33,483
you're going to have to be
a thief and a fraud."

1412
01:29:38,647 --> 01:29:41,036
- I'm sorry, dad.
- That's alright, son.

1413
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:43,803
Listen...

1414
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:47,403
...we have a shop here.
- Dad, don't say that.

1415
01:29:47,487 --> 01:29:49,239
Hang on. Don't interrupt me.

1416
01:29:49,367 --> 01:29:52,484
You have this house. We have a vineyard.
You have me and Nadire.

1417
01:29:52,807 --> 01:29:56,516
Above all, you have a wife
and two kids here.

1418
01:29:56,607 --> 01:30:00,236
Right now, they are your country, son.
First, realize their value.

1419
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:04,644
You have done what you could for
your country and done it for years.

1420
01:30:04,807 --> 01:30:06,240
Now, it's up to them.

1421
01:30:07,927 --> 01:30:11,761
Seeing that some people
don't deserve it...

1422
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:13,599
...there is nothing you can do.

1423
01:30:15,487 --> 01:30:18,399
But, don't turn your back
on the people who do.

1424
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:24,607
Come and take care
of your family.

1425
01:30:25,127 --> 01:30:26,606
You're right, dad.

1426
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:33,442
You always said they
are our people.

1427
01:30:34,087 --> 01:30:35,679
And we are theirs.

1428
01:30:36,207 --> 01:30:38,926
Well, where are they, dad?
Are they hiding?

1429
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:40,800
Who knows, maybe they are.

1430
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:44,364
But, one day
they will certainly come out of hiding.

1431
01:31:17,887 --> 01:31:20,401
- How can I help you, Mehmet?
- I'm going to see the mayor.

1432
01:31:20,487 --> 01:31:22,364
- Do you have a rendezvous?
- Rendezvous?

1433
01:31:23,007 --> 01:31:25,396
That's what you have with a lover, son.
I came to see the mayor.

1434
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:27,444
You can't see him
without an appointment.

1435
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:31,042
Listen here. Aren't you
the son of Resul, the machinist?

1436
01:31:31,127 --> 01:31:33,925
- Yeah, that's me.
- Don't you recognize me, son?

1437
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:38,920
Are you a guard here now?
Who are you protecting and from whom?

1438
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:42,599
I'm going to talk to the
mayor not shoot him.

1439
01:31:42,807 --> 01:31:44,206
What is all this noise, man?

1440
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:49,242
Come, right in.

1441
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:55,367
Thanks. I'll stand.

1442
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:03,161
Ibrahim Erdinçis my son-in-law, mayor.
My name is Mehmet Yavaş.

1443
01:32:03,887 --> 01:32:05,161
Yes?

1444
01:32:05,247 --> 01:32:07,487
I have come to you alone
and of my own free will.

1445
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,000
No one knows anything about this.

1446
01:32:10,127 --> 01:32:11,765
I'm going to ask you a favor.

1447
01:32:12,007 --> 01:32:14,680
You are going to ask me
to bring your son-in-law back.

1448
01:32:14,767 --> 01:32:15,517
No.

1449
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:17,915
No.

1450
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:21,238
I want you to drop the lawsuits
that have been filed against him.

1451
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,079
Why should I drop the suits?

1452
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:25,721
Because my son-in-law
is not the sort of person...

1453
01:32:25,807 --> 01:32:28,640
...who would abuse his office
or threaten others. I can vouch for him.

1454
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:32,127
So you will vouch for him.
And just who are you?

1455
01:32:32,162 --> 01:32:33,480
Why should I believe you?

1456
01:32:33,847 --> 01:32:37,317
If there is a 65-year-old man
standing in front of you...

1457
01:32:37,607 --> 01:32:41,680
...who has never asked a favor of anyone,
then I reckon what he says can be believed.

1458
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:45,683
Sir, you know nothing about us.

1459
01:32:45,967 --> 01:32:49,323
Thank the Lord, we have never had to
depend on anyone all these years.

1460
01:32:49,407 --> 01:32:51,284
My son-in-law does
not need a job here.

1461
01:32:52,007 --> 01:32:53,887
But, making slanderous
accusations against...

1462
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:55,639
...a fellow and
sullying his reputation...

1463
01:32:57,487 --> 01:32:59,052
...is an affront to his rights.

1464
01:32:59,087 --> 01:33:01,396
I'm not going to tell you
how to do your job.

1465
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:03,478
I'm sure you got over-enthusiastic.

1466
01:33:03,607 --> 01:33:06,724
But, we are people who have lived
for years by a code of honor.

1467
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:09,327
This is more than we can bear.

1468
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:11,492
So, when you get in trouble...

1469
01:33:11,527 --> 01:33:14,997
...you always garner pity
with talk about honor and reputation.

1470
01:33:15,087 --> 01:33:17,442
- The same old story.
- Always the same?

1471
01:33:17,527 --> 01:33:19,882
This is the first time
I have stepped through that door.

1472
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:23,118
This is the first time that
I have ever had to say this to anyone.

1473
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:25,681
Or, maybe you are confusing
me with someone else.

1474
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,403
Okay, sir, okay.
Go on about your business.

1475
01:33:27,438 --> 01:33:29,039
Look, I've got work to do,
leave me alone.

1476
01:33:29,127 --> 01:33:30,372
Mr. Mayor, your work is the public.

1477
01:33:30,407 --> 01:33:32,363
And, since I am a member of the public,
I am your work.

1478
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,081
Alright, sir, alright.

1479
01:33:36,727 --> 01:33:38,763
Where were you, man?
Didn't you hear the bell, man?

1480
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:40,998
- Show this gentleman out.
- Come on, Uncle Mehmet.

1481
01:33:41,207 --> 01:33:43,562
Hold on, son. What are you doing?
You might as well beat me.

1482
01:33:43,647 --> 01:33:45,558
- Mehmet, come on now.
- Leave me alone.

1483
01:33:45,647 --> 01:33:46,966
I'll show myself out!

1484
01:33:50,327 --> 01:33:52,682
I have one last
thing to say to you.

1485
01:33:52,767 --> 01:33:54,723
This atrocity is going to
come back to haunt you.

1486
01:33:54,807 --> 01:33:58,561
And, let me tell you,
there will be no place for you to hide.

1487
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:03,999
What is this Tuncer? Do you have
one of these buttons in your office too?

1488
01:34:04,087 --> 01:34:05,172
Do all of you coming running...

1489
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,845
...like a dog when the mayor
pushes a button?

1490
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:09,964
- Mehmet, that's shameful talk.
- No, shame on you, shame on all of you.

1491
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:11,844
What small minds!

1492
01:34:12,487 --> 01:34:16,526
Damn you! Go to hell.

1493
01:34:31,927 --> 01:34:33,485
Ibrahim

1494
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:35,478
- It's alright. He's fine now.
- What? Tell me the truth.

1495
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:36,886
He's fine, mom.
Come here, mom.

1496
01:34:37,367 --> 01:34:40,245
Calm down ladies.
There's no need to be upset.

1497
01:34:40,527 --> 01:34:42,165
Why did you bring Ozan?
Take him out, man!

1498
01:34:42,487 --> 01:34:44,478
He heard about it at home and came.
What could I do?

1499
01:34:45,087 --> 01:34:47,078
Why doesn't grandpa
want me around?

1500
01:34:47,127 --> 01:34:49,163
That's crazy
He didn't want you to be frightened.

1501
01:34:49,247 --> 01:34:51,124
Why? Why would I be
afraid of my grandpa?

1502
01:34:51,447 --> 01:34:53,438
Everything's fine, Ozan.

1503
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:56,122
Tonight we'll go home and
it will all be over, son.

1504
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:58,078
Your grandpa is just feeling
a bit faint, that's all.

1505
01:34:58,167 --> 01:34:59,964
There's nothing to fear, son.

1506
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,465
One shouldn't complain
about their blessings...

1507
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,563
...but this damn stuff
is inedible without oil or salt.

1508
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:14,842
No, sir. You have to eat it.
And you have to take these too.

1509
01:35:15,207 --> 01:35:17,846
Fine, but do you have to scold me
like a little kid?

1510
01:35:17,927 --> 01:35:20,236
Look, the salad will
add some variety.

1511
01:35:22,327 --> 01:35:25,558
The food is just like everything else:
No taste or flavor.

1512
01:35:30,007 --> 01:35:32,999
I've eaten so many greens,
I think l will soon turn into a goat.

1513
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:35,203
I'll be climbing the
walls of the house and...

1514
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:37,079
...perching on the
TV before you know it.

1515
01:35:46,247 --> 01:35:47,396
Come here.

1516
01:38:03,487 --> 01:38:05,398
Uncle Ercan found you on the shore.

1517
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:07,807
On the telephone,
he said you had drowned.

1518
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,604
Your "drowning"
was like a bad joke.

1519
01:38:10,767 --> 01:38:15,238
No one believed it but they didn't
want to consider any other possibility.

1520
01:38:15,727 --> 01:38:17,732
My mother was
looking for proof of...

1521
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:20,235
...what it was she had
to come to grips with.

1522
01:38:20,287 --> 01:38:22,676
She wanted to put a period
at the end to finish it.

1523
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:26,062
Because, as you know,
finished sentences...

1524
01:38:26,097 --> 01:38:29,358
...are less painful
than unfinished ones.

1525
01:38:29,967 --> 01:38:32,959
Or, did you believe
exactly the opposite?

1526
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:35,726
In commas?
Is that so?

1527
01:39:11,607 --> 01:39:14,201
Don't come, Saime.
For the love of God, go back inside.

1528
01:39:37,207 --> 01:39:38,925
Daddy.

1529
01:39:39,527 --> 01:39:40,846
Nurdan.

1530
01:39:48,287 --> 01:39:49,561
Nurdan, please stop.

1531
01:39:49,927 --> 01:39:52,395
I beg you, stop.

1532
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:01,637
Brother Ibrahim, if you'll let me,
I'll take Ozan and the kids.

1533
01:40:02,007 --> 01:40:04,646
They can play together.
They shouldn't hang around here.

1534
01:40:04,727 --> 01:40:07,525
I'll bring them back tonight
when things have calmed down a bit.

1535
01:40:07,807 --> 01:40:09,567
In the letter,
you held no one responsible,

1536
01:40:09,602 --> 01:40:11,080
you apologized to all of us,
but said:

1537
01:40:11,167 --> 01:40:13,165
"I can no longer live in
a world like this."

1538
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,164
You said that you
loved me very much...

1539
01:40:15,447 --> 01:40:18,200
...but that you would rather die
and get it over with while still alive...

1540
01:40:18,247 --> 01:40:21,239
...than die bit by bit
right before my eyes.

1541
01:40:21,927 --> 01:40:23,918
You hoped that one day
I would understand.

1542
01:40:24,047 --> 01:40:26,541
Did you write this right
where the two seas meet

1543
01:40:26,576 --> 01:40:29,036
right between going and
not being able to go?

1544
01:40:29,807 --> 01:40:33,686
According to my mother, 'with a fountain
pen and in beautiful handwriting."

1545
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:37,205
Then you dragged almost
the whole town behind you.

1546
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:39,292
You started a game
of hide-n-seek and...

1547
01:40:39,327 --> 01:40:41,921
...tagged them all,
so they all came out of hiding.

1548
01:40:42,327 --> 01:40:43,840
All of your people.

1549
01:40:44,527 --> 01:40:46,199
And what a coming out it was.

1550
01:40:57,447 --> 01:41:00,245
Stop that, Muslim people,
that is a sin.

1551
01:41:08,007 --> 01:41:09,804
Take it, son.

1552
01:41:09,887 --> 01:41:13,163
Hang on. It should touch
the ground first. Throw it on, child.

1553
01:41:13,407 --> 01:41:15,462
The angel on your right
shoulder will mark it down...

1554
01:41:15,497 --> 01:41:17,518
...as a good deed about
as much as the sand grains.

1555
01:41:17,607 --> 01:41:20,246
May the Lord give you the days that
He took from your grandfather.

1556
01:41:20,327 --> 01:41:21,843
If you were to ask today,
they might say...

1557
01:41:21,878 --> 01:41:23,360
...this is too traumatic
for children.

1558
01:41:23,447 --> 01:41:26,343
I don't know what is right.
But, we confronted...

1559
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:29,240
...everything we faced.
That is how we grew up.

1560
01:41:30,967 --> 01:41:33,242
If he is there with you,
why don't you ask that angel...

1561
01:41:33,527 --> 01:41:36,246
...if he marked me down for a good deed
as much as the sand grains.

1562
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:37,972
No matter if he did or not...

1563
01:41:38,007 --> 01:41:40,919
...but you and your people are
what made me who I am.

1564
01:41:41,367 --> 01:41:44,040
May the sin and the merit
hang around all of our necks.

1565
01:41:44,527 --> 01:41:46,358
They are your people.

1566
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:49,407
Of course, with a genuine
and heartfelt humility.

1567
01:41:49,442 --> 01:41:51,523
The people to whom
we belong as well.

1568
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,597
Ladies can't come,
keep your distance.

1569
01:42:00,527 --> 01:42:02,597
What kind of a funeral is this,
anyhow?

1570
01:42:10,647 --> 01:42:13,286
Luludia will suit him perfectly.

1571
01:42:57,487 --> 01:42:59,523
Come here, Ozan.

1572
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:03,798
Let's see if you can
find the metaphor in this painting.

1573
01:43:06,007 --> 01:43:09,044
- I sit grandpa's hand?
- Bravo, Ozan.

1574
01:43:13,527 --> 01:43:15,043
Will the deceased
always wave his...

1575
01:43:15,078 --> 01:43:16,559
...hand at us from
up there on the wall?

1576
01:43:17,207 --> 01:43:18,481
What did my grandma say?

1577
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:20,292
We don't know if it's
the water or the air...

1578
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:22,363
...but everyone around
here is missing a few marbles.

1579
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,247
But l haven't told you the most
amazing news yet.

1580
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:25,236
Maybe you won't believe it.

1581
01:43:25,767 --> 01:43:28,527
I can only take refuge
in this very cliché expression.

1582
01:43:28,562 --> 01:43:30,643
Nothing is as surprising as life itself.

1583
01:43:31,367 --> 01:43:33,483
- How are you, Nadire?
- Thank you, son.

1584
01:43:34,247 --> 01:43:37,956
- There is a package for Mehmet Yavaş.
- Who's it from?

1585
01:43:38,447 --> 01:43:40,278
Well, the name is foreign.

1586
01:43:41,527 --> 01:43:43,085
It says Eleonora.

1587
01:43:43,727 --> 01:43:45,399
That's clearly a woman's name.

1588
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:48,206
What? A woman?
What are you saying, mister?

1589
01:43:49,407 --> 01:43:52,399
- Look, you gotta sign right here.
- I'm not signing that.

1590
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:54,524
And, l won't take
the package either.

1591
01:43:54,607 --> 01:43:57,917
- That's okay. It's not a problem.
- Mom, just hang on a second, will ya?

1592
01:43:58,247 --> 01:44:00,807
I know ya'll.
I'll just leave it right here.

1593
01:44:00,887 --> 01:44:03,685
- I can sign it myself, you know.
- Hang on. Bring it here.

1594
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:08,676
My hand is shaking from laughing
so hard. I can't even sign it.

1595
01:44:08,847 --> 01:44:10,599
- There, is that okay.
- Sure, that's fine.

1596
01:44:10,767 --> 01:44:12,962
- Here. Give that to me.
- Here, I'll take that.

1597
01:44:13,767 --> 01:44:14,995
- How about that?
- Good bye.

1598
01:44:16,967 --> 01:44:18,400
- I'm opening it.
- Open it!

1599
01:44:33,447 --> 01:44:35,327
What in the world is this?
May the Lord take...

1600
01:44:35,362 --> 01:44:36,726
...my life and rescue me
from the shame.

1601
01:44:36,847 --> 01:44:39,407
A whore sends
flowers to our house.

1602
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:43,243
Oh my, you are not done
with your surprises.

1603
01:44:43,327 --> 01:44:45,124
Hang on just a second, mom.

1604
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:48,119
It is written in Turkish!

1605
01:44:49,127 --> 01:44:52,119
- It has a few mistakes, but it is Turkish.
- Read it then, sir.

1606
01:44:52,207 --> 01:44:53,640
What does it say?

1607
01:44:54,567 --> 01:44:56,080
"Hello.

1608
01:44:56,447 --> 01:44:59,678
My name is Eleonora Theodorakis.

1609
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:01,605
The bottle you sent us...

1610
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:07,478
...are found by some neighbors,
Mr. Mehmet.

1611
01:45:08,727 --> 01:45:11,799
From the description you gave,
you were born in our house.

1612
01:45:12,047 --> 01:45:15,596
A neighbor who knows a bit of
Turkish is writing the letter now.

1613
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:18,998
After you left, my father-in-law
bought this house.

1614
01:45:19,087 --> 01:45:20,918
I moved in as a daughter-in-law.

1615
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:22,998
We have been here for 35 years.

1616
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:26,040
My husband passed away
two years ago.

1617
01:45:26,167 --> 01:45:28,601
As you say,
may Allah have mercy.

1618
01:45:28,847 --> 01:45:31,315
The children work in Athens.
One in Limni.

1619
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:34,241
One of them is married.
One is not.

1620
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:36,485
I live alone in Crete.

1621
01:45:37,767 --> 01:45:41,521
I would love to have you come
someday and be my guest.

1622
01:45:42,527 --> 01:45:46,998
I'm writing an address below,
both in Latin and Greek letters.

1623
01:45:47,927 --> 01:45:50,022
I'm also writing
a telephone number below.

1624
01:45:50,057 --> 01:45:52,118
It's Mr. Todor's
bed and breakfast.

1625
01:45:53,607 --> 01:45:55,359
He knows a bit of Turkish.

1626
01:45:56,327 --> 01:46:00,639
Before you come, call him
and have him let me know.

1627
01:46:02,367 --> 01:46:04,012
Wishing health and happiness...

1628
01:46:04,047 --> 01:46:06,515
...to you Mehmet and
greetings to your family.

1629
01:46:06,847 --> 01:46:09,287
I am sending a bottle of ouzo
as the gift of a neighbor.

1630
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:10,800
I hope you enjoy it,
my neighbor."

1631
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:14,127
No. I mean,
it's just a normal bottle, of course.

1632
01:46:14,162 --> 01:46:15,526
Look, the seal has
never been broken.

1633
01:46:16,007 --> 01:46:17,963
You can never be sure.
They're Greeks after all.

1634
01:46:18,047 --> 01:46:22,325
What if they injected the poison
with a syringe and didn't open it.

1635
01:46:22,407 --> 01:46:23,760
Come on now.
There is a letter.

1636
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:26,246
So, they had it written.

1637
01:46:32,607 --> 01:46:34,518
Damn,
it does look good though.

1638
01:46:35,047 --> 01:46:36,275
Damn sure does.

1639
01:46:37,647 --> 01:46:39,797
Why don't we have
the mayor drink it first?

1640
01:46:40,127 --> 01:46:42,197
If nothing happens to him,
we can continue.

1641
01:46:53,247 --> 01:46:54,885
Ozan Erdinç.

1642
01:47:27,807 --> 01:47:30,685
Years had passed after receiving
Eleonora's letter.

1643
01:47:30,807 --> 01:47:32,212
Our family just kept putting off...

1644
01:47:32,247 --> 01:47:34,203
...accepting the invitation
for various reasons.

1645
01:47:34,287 --> 01:47:35,746
My father's lawsuit,
which went on...

1646
01:47:35,781 --> 01:47:37,206
...for years,
but which he finally won.

1647
01:47:37,247 --> 01:47:39,082
The pain in
my grandmother's legs.

1648
01:47:39,117 --> 01:47:40,918
Nihal's school and
many more excuses.

1649
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:43,561
Even years later when we called
Mr. Todor's bed and breakfast...

1650
01:47:43,647 --> 01:47:45,652
...and learned that the
woman was still living...

1651
01:47:45,687 --> 01:47:48,076
...and still expecting us,
they still didn't come with me

1652
01:47:48,167 --> 01:47:49,852
Either they had
become really weary...

1653
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:52,196
...or they were unable
to face fresh disappointment.

1654
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:55,957
And that's right, you heard correctly.
I have embarked on the journey.

1655
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:04,372
Are these the waters
you crossed through...

1656
01:48:04,407 --> 01:48:06,523
...a thousand perils,
where you left your baby brother?

1657
01:48:06,607 --> 01:48:09,883
Are these the waters that defied us
and separated us; this haughty...

1658
01:48:09,967 --> 01:48:12,356
...and magnificent sea
that we loved even un to death?

1659
01:48:12,927 --> 01:48:14,962
Actually, if you had wanted,
you could...

1660
01:48:14,997 --> 01:48:16,997
...gotten over your hang ups
and come anytime.

1661
01:48:17,127 --> 01:48:18,612
But, I don't think you ever wanted to.

1662
01:48:18,647 --> 01:48:20,922
You just wanted to think that
everything you remembered...

1663
01:48:21,007 --> 01:48:22,452
...all of those crumbs of happiness,

1664
01:48:22,487 --> 01:48:24,557
were still there,
unchanged after all these years.

1665
01:48:24,647 --> 01:48:27,115
Holding on to your
own truth like Peruzat.

1666
01:48:27,207 --> 01:48:29,323
It's just like those
valuable crystal glasses...

1667
01:48:29,647 --> 01:48:31,092
...and have sat there for years...

1668
01:48:31,127 --> 01:48:33,595
...never used with the fear that
they would get broken...

1669
01:48:33,687 --> 01:48:35,884
...but always with the
hope of using them someday.

1670
01:48:35,919 --> 01:48:38,082
It's time for you metaphors
to get out of my head.

1671
01:51:30,487 --> 01:51:33,559
- You are Ozan, right?
- I am Mehmet's grandson, Ozan.

1672
01:51:36,687 --> 01:51:38,040
My dear.

1673
01:51:38,527 --> 01:51:40,040
Welcome.

1674
01:51:44,247 --> 01:51:45,475
Great.

1675
01:51:46,687 --> 01:51:50,600
I have been waiting
for you since morning.

1676
01:51:53,847 --> 01:51:55,678
Here you go.

1677
01:52:07,527 --> 01:52:08,755
Look what I've made.

1678
01:52:10,447 --> 01:52:16,795
Stuffed grape leaves.
Cucumbers and yoghurt. Salad.

1679
01:52:20,047 --> 01:52:21,241
Eat up, young man.

1680
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:50,795
- These are gifts from my mother.
- She shouldn't have troubled herself.

1681
01:52:51,007 --> 01:52:54,761
Thank you very much.

1682
01:52:57,927 --> 01:53:00,646
It's so beautiful.

1683
01:53:06,967 --> 01:53:09,435
Just wait, I'll be right back.

1684
01:53:24,207 --> 01:53:28,485
Something’s your family left.
My father-in-law found this first.

1685
01:53:28,847 --> 01:53:35,002
He said to keep it. Perhaps the person
who left it will come and get it, he said.

1686
01:53:35,647 --> 01:53:37,046
We found this too.

1687
01:53:38,207 --> 01:53:40,038
This must be your grandfather.

1688
01:53:46,727 --> 01:53:48,399
Grandpa.

1689
01:54:01,927 --> 01:54:04,487
That's life. What can you do?

1690
01:54:06,927 --> 01:54:08,963
Tavern? Tavern?

1691
01:54:09,127 --> 01:54:10,480
Yes

1692
01:54:10,767 --> 01:54:15,557
They start playing
in the evening. Listen.

1693
01:54:15,887 --> 01:54:19,402
They're playing "Gülbahar."
It's a beautiful song.

1694
01:54:20,607 --> 01:54:24,202
Everything is just like you left it, grandpa.
Nothing has changed.

1695
01:54:24,567 --> 01:54:26,478
This happy ending is for you.

1696
01:54:27,367 --> 01:54:28,332
I am sending a message...

1697
01:54:28,367 --> 01:54:30,244
...to you from the other
side of the same sea.

1698
01:54:30,327 --> 01:54:32,557
From the beach in front
of the white house.

1699
01:54:32,647 --> 01:54:35,719
All of the things that have transpired
since you left are in this letter.

1700
01:54:35,807 --> 01:54:38,605
The Sea Boy
will deliver this bottle to you.

1701
01:54:38,927 --> 01:54:41,264
Maybe, before that,
he will stop by my country...

1702
01:54:41,299 --> 01:54:43,602
...to pick up a prayer
for you from our people.

1703
01:54:44,047 --> 01:54:46,207
When you receive the letter,
greet the angels.

1704
01:54:46,242 --> 01:54:47,401
Say, "That's my grandson.

1705
01:54:47,487 --> 01:54:49,762
The little fellow grew up
and came like I asked him to."

1706
01:54:53,087 --> 01:54:55,760
Come on, Ozan!
Come on!

1707
01:55:23,447 --> 01:55:26,962
In memory of my grandfather
Mehmet Yavas
