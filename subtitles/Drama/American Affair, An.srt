This bed is on fire
with passionate love

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,760
The neighbors complain
about the noises above

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,320
But she only comes
when she's on top

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,960
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,600
You know,
living at my parents' house,

th-that's, um...
that's a temporary thing.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,320
Uh, we've been going out
for, what, three years.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,880
You're not, like, getting bored
with things, are you?

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,320
Michelle, I... I'm gonna
ask you something that
I've never asked you before.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,480
Is it kinky?
I don't think so. No.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,280
You don't have to be embarrassed
if you want to add more
spiciness to our relationship.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Actually, um,

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,320
maybe you couldjust, uh,
you know,

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,240
use your napkin.

Excuse me.
Thank you.

- Hello.
- Jim, it's Dad.
Uh, you left the ring at home.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,800
The box is empty.
But-But I'm on my way,

and I've got the...

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400

Bye-bye.

Uh, that was my dad.

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,600
That was, uh, my dad.
That was, uh...
He couldn't get through on...

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,680
I didn't answer my cell.
So he was, uh,

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,680
getting all, uh...
was getting all worried.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,640
You know how he is.
But everything is, uh...
everything is okay now.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
Everything is, uh...
Everything is perfectly fine.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,280
I think I know
what you're gonna ask me.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,360
And it's okay.
I... I don't have to use my napkin.

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,240
- Wha...
- I've got my own techniques.

Well, I made it.
Where's Michelle?
The washroom?

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,800
You know, I was so nervous
she was gonna spot me.
Here's the ring, son.

Ohh.
Let me tell you something.

Look at the rock

Hope you didn't
blow your wad on this, son.

thrilled for you, Jim.

popping what? What question?

No.

sometime.

Everything they tell you
is messing up your mind
Don't laugh at me.

They don't give up
and I don't give in
Okay, okay.

I'm just glad that's not me.

one girl you're destined to
spend your entire life with?

Not, uh...
Not so bad, huh?
All right.

Do this.

I'm sorry.

Jim.
Hey, John.

135
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,760
The food and the drink
are really bad.

"F" for presentation.

The good news for you...
What's that?

half the people in this place.

At least they all brought gifts.

Hello.
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

Oh, hello.

Please, please come in.
Lovely to meet you.

145
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,320
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,680
- Delightful.
- Who's excited
about the wedding?

147
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,920
Anxious might be
more accurate.

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Oh, w-w-we've never met
your son.

149
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,760
You'll get to meet him.

150
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Rudy and Sam
would like to meet him too.
Oh, yes.

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
Better bring them in
from the car.
They've been cooped up.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,880
Oh, for heaven sakes.
You brought your sons?

153
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,160
Our dogs.
We never travel
without them.

Oh, my goodness.
Well, honey,

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,960
why don't you go get those critters
out of the car and we'll start
on some cocktails?

156
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,920
Ah, thank you.
Right. I'll, uh,

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,880
Aw, beautiful.

308
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,920
Jim needs to learn
to dance for his wedding.

309
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,440
You know, I think he's screwed.

310
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,240
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

311
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,160
I can't wait to see this disaster.

312
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,880
What makes you think
you're invited?

[Slurping]

314
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,280
I already called upJim's mom,
got the info.

315
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm preparing
for the festivities.

316
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,240
It's time for me to
boom-boom with the bridesmaids,
Finch-fucker.

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,160
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,720
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

319
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,120
Ooh, yep, that's
what I'm talking about.
[Laughs]

320
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,360
[Jim]
All right, Stifler. Um,

321
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,760
this-this is a little, uh,
difficult to explain.

322
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,640
Look, you're... you're okay.

323
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,360
You're okay.
I-I-I mean, uh...
I mean, I like you.

324
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah, great.
You can blow me after practice.

325
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm working, dude.
Well, dude...

326

- [Yelling]
- Come on. Work it! Hustle!

327
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,280
See, my mom didn't know that
there was a misunderstanding.
Push it! Move it!

328
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,840
- You're not invited!
- Hold!

329
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,800
Dude, how the hell
do you even think
you're getting married?

330
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,200
I've been looking out for your
sex life since high school.
You what?

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,960
Ohhhh! Ohh!

[Laughs]

333
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,200
The first tits
this guy ever saw...

334
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,000
were because of me.

335
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,520
The first girl
he ever hooked up with...

336
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,960
was at my party
at my cottage.

337
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
That girl is the girl he's marrying.

338
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,040
The Stif-man showed him the way.

339
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,400
- Can I get a "Hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah, Stifler!

340
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
But, my fuckers,

341
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,520
this mofo right here
does not want the Stif-meister,

the grand, fucking facilitator
to attend the wedding.

343

Who sucks donkey dick?
Jim sucks donkey dick!

344
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,520
Jim sucks donkey dick!
The answer's no.
Okay? I'm sorry.

345
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,440
The answer's no.
I can dance.

346
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,320
What?
I can dance.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Okay. Now-Now what
exactly is this here?

Left box turn.
Left box turn.

351
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Hi. Stop looking into
my eyes.
Sorry. Sorry.

352
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
How do you...
How do you know how to do this?

353
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
My mom made me take it
for three fucking years.
Yeah?

354
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,240
Yeah, I hated it.
No, you're really good.

355
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,720
Uh, you should take ballet
or something.

356
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,480
Fuckface! What part of
"This sucks my ass"
do you not under-fuckin'-stand?

357
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,920
This is exactly
what I'm talking about, Steven.
You can't behave like this.

358
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,240
I-I-lf you want to come
to the wedding, I'm sorry,
you cannot act like this.

359
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,200
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

360
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,600
Impolite would be
an improvement. Look,

361
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,880
just... just try not to be,
uh, you know, uh,

00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,880

Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Hey, wait, Stifler.
Stifler, hold on.

366
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Wait. Okay. Wh-What if, uh...
What if you, uh, plan
the bachelor party?

367
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,000
With a dildo show?
Sure.

368
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,880
Look. Just...
If you can find the time,
uh, to fit it in,

go ahead, surprise me.

Sorry, chief. That only
gets you halfway there.

Why? Why ha...
What do you mean?

372
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,240
I need assurances that I'm gonna get
some quality action at this wedding.

373
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm sor... I can't...
I can't make that promise.

Well, let me put it to you
this way, Jimbo.

Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

Now, if we leave right now,

we can get there
by the time they close...

make the dress. And I'm afraid

she'd probably be at one of
these bars here on Halstead.

to find my fiancee
the wedding dress
that she deserves.

to make it for us.

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
Some of my favorites.
[Chuckles]

610
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,280
Excuse me, guys.

611
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,280
Finch, she thinks
you were being sarcastic.

612
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,920
[Stifler]
Okay. It's so good to see you.

613
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,800
You want some help?
Here. Let me...
Let me help you out there.

614
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,280
There you go. Okay.
You keep fighting
the good fight, sir.

615
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,200
It's great.

616
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,200
That was really sweet of you.

617
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,240
Yeah. I love old people.

618
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Hey, I hate to be nosy
and impolite, but, um,

619
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,640
do you know Jim Levenstein
and Michelle Flaherty?
Yeah.

620
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,080
Are they here?
Well, I'm Cadence,
Michelle's sister.

621
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,080
I had no idea.
I'm their good friend Steven.

622
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,560
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

623
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,320
Well, they're around town
doing some wedding stuff.
That's cool.

624
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,520
But there's still a few of us
in the other room
if you want to join us.

625
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,120
I don't know.
I mean, you look so nice,
I feel underdressed.

626
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,240
Well, I think you look great.
Thank you.

627
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,720
Oh, here they are.
Hi, boys.
Don't stand up.

628
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,560
- The dads aren't here yet?
- I'll go find him.

629
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,080
Now, which one of you
is the best man?

630
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,000
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he-he couldn't decide.

631
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,640
- Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.
- Mom, I want you to meet Steven.

632
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,000
He's friends ofJim's
and mine and, oh, everyone's.

633
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
[Chuckles]
You look very familiar,
Steven.

634
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,560
Really? Oh, I'm afraid
we've never met.
Oh.

635
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,680
Oh. Well, we have now.

636
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,960
Oh, looks like you found
Samantha's Sweets.

637
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,880
Oh, yes.
Isn't their chocolate
just to die for?

638
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,400
- Oh, well, you have no idea.
- Actually, I do.

639
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,800
I love chocolate
more than life itself.
More than life itself.

640
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
Yes.! I was just saying
to your friends that...

641
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,200
I have something
very precious here.

642
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,400
What is it?

643
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,920
Michelle's grandmother's...
my mother's... wedding ring.

644
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,120
Isn't that precious?

645
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,800
But since all of you
are the best man,

646
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,720
I don't know who should
ho-hold onto it.

647
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,800
- I think it's best if I...
- Oh, um...

648
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,160
I think you should
get to know us first
and then decide.

649
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,000
You are such
a gentleman, Steve.

650
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,120
I hear that all the time,
but it never gets old.
Aw.

651
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,320
Hey, Paul, uh,
do you have a camera?

652
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,200
How thoughtful.
[Mouthing Words]

653
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,400
I must have forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

654
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,760
Oh, m-maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

655
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,960
- [Chuckles]
- I won't forget this moment.

656
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
I bet you won't.
Would you care to join us?

657
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,320
I would love to.
Thank you.
Well, come on.

658
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,280
Lovely to see you fellas.
Thank you.
[Mouthing Words]

659
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,240
[Stifler]
Oh, amazing.

660
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,440
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

661
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,960
I love the way the tulips
accentuate the, um...

662
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,800
- What do you
call those again, sir?
- Double Lisianthus.

663
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Lisianthus.
Double "Lisianthums."

664
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,960
What a pretty name.

665
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,840
I told him to be nice,
or-or he couldn't come
to the wedding.

666
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
I will take care of this.
I will take care of this.
[Stifler] Hey. Hey, James.

667
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,440
Oh, great. Come on over.
Oh, great. Come on over.

668
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,720
See if I forgot anything.
I don't think...
Oh. Oh, oh.

669
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,120
We're having a great time.
I think I've got it all.

670
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,120
Oh, look, look, look, look.

671
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,520
- [Mouthing Words]
- Sahara and Desert Rose...

672
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,720
for your bridesmaids' bouquet.

673
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Oh, give me that.
Smell this.

674
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,440
It's fantastic.
Fantastic.

675
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,040
And, oh... Oh. Oh!

676
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Oh, oh, oh!
[Mouthing Words]

677
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,760
[Laughs, Squeals]
Look at this.

678
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,520
Oh, boy.
Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

679
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,680
I think with
the Summer Blossoms. Mm-hmm.

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
Cutie.
Thank you for everything.

681
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,240
What do you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable?
Bye, Cadence.

682
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,360
Okay, I know...
I know what you're doing.
Look. Have you seen yourself?

683
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,480
I can't believe
you're doing this.
Just calm down, dude.

684
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,400
It's all set.
What's set?

685
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm gonna teach you to dance
like a "Baryshiniankov."

686
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,240
Oh, yeah.
He is pretty good.

687
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,600
Jim, he's not doing it to be nice.
He's doing it to bone Cadence.

688
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,800
Look, maybe we should
give him a chance.
You know, I think... I think...

689
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,200
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes,

690
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,240
there's a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance.

691
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,240
That's-That's what I think.

692
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,760
Oh, Jim, you've gotta
stop masturbating.
It's melting your brain.

693
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,480
Observe the fuckin' Stif-meister.

694
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
What is his defining characteristic?

695
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,880
He uses the F-word excessively.

696
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,800
Thanks, man.

697
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,840
But I also have confidence.
You're one big floppy cock.

698
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,000
Look at you.
You've gotta stand like a man.

699
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,400
Your posture tells
your partner where to go.

700
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Okay. Okay.
Okay?

701
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,480
Follow my lead.

702
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,800
This is the waltz.
Waltz. Okay.

703
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,240
Waltz. Okay.

704
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,000
That's pretty good.
You're fuckin' right
it's good.

705
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,440
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

706
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,920
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

707
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,040
Should I shave my balls?
Do you shave your balls?
How do you do it?

708
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,120
Dude, no.

709
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,840
I... I... I'm just...

710
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,800
[Chuckles]
Shaving.

711
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:02,960
[Skipped item nr. 710]

712
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,720
You know, there's nothing like
a local pub.

713
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,640
Mm-hmm.
It's like real America...

714
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,160
without all that corporateness
and catchy jingles.
Well, what's wrong with a good jingle?

715
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,800
I think it was Voltaire who said,

716
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,880
"Ajingle witty proves everything
for my friends and I."

717
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,400
- [Chuckles]
- Cadence.

718
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,240
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

719
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,480
You're just in time
for Voltaire's greatest hits.

720
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,680
Voltaire?
Stifler, please, who was Voltaire?

721
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

722
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,920
Actually, I'm getting
a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff.

723
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,840
Yeah. Me too.

724
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,720
Being smart is so hard.
[Chuckles]

725
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,840
I'll give you some intelligence.

726
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,600
Voltaire can suck on my balls.

727
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
What?

728
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,280
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

729
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Hey, I'm gonna give you a quote to live by.

730
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
"Love life, get paid and then get laid."

731
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,800
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finch-meister.

732
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,160
I like that.
[Mouthing Words]

733
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,440
- Bet you do.
- But I don't know why you do...

734
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,640
because Finch-meister
doesn't make any friggin' sense.

735
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,600
- Sure, it does.
- No fuckin' shit it does.

736
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,320
Cadence, let's leave
the "crayton" here, shall we?

737
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,480
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walkin' anyway.

738
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,440
Wait. You know, actually,
I think I'm gonna go stretch my legs
with the Finch-meister.

739
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,000
- You don't mind, do you, Steven?
- No.

740
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,040
Ha!

741
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,400
[Huffing]

742
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,280
It's on like Donkey Kong, bi-i-itch.

743
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Pack it up, bitch.

744
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm on it. Thank you.

745
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,200
So, uh, Cadence say
anything about me?

746
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,320
[Scoffs]
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

747
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,840
Finch. Is she gonna be
around tomorrow night?

748
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,960
No, she's going up to Chicago
with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

749
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,200
What about her parents?
I think her mom kind of likes me.

750
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,200
They're going up north with,
uh... with my parents...

751
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,200
for, uh...
you know, to get things, uh,
ready for the rehearsal.

752
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
So, uh...
So that's where they'll be.

753
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
So don't bother
looking for them or anything, you know.

754
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,160
A wedding.
[Scoffs]

755
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,760
Shit. How do you know
she's the right girl?

756
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
I just do.

757
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,280
I'm a better person when
I'm with Michelle. Nobody else can...
No, no, no, shithead.

758
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,840
You hooked up with
one other girl for, what, 10 seconds.

759
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fuckin' thing ever.

760
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,720
You're like a blind man picking out
his favorite porno.

761
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,720
This shit is crazy.

762
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,280
[Jim's Dad]
This is just
the old pre-wedding jitters, son.

763
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,840
[Jim]
It's so forever, you know. It-It's, uh...

764
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,280
You know, Michelle is the only, uh,

765
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,200
girl that I've... I've been with.

766
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,920
Honestly, now...
Honestly, would you have
passed up sex with Nadia?

767
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,160
Why? Did she say something?

768
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,560
Hypothetically, Dad.
Oh, hypothetically.

769
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,080
Well, I mean, you know,
Jim, I'm a married man.

770
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,400
I'm...
If-lf-lf you weren't married.

771
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,400
She's a college girl.
If you were a college guy.

772
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,960
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

773
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,800
First of all,
what-what you're feeling is so normal
and perfectly natural.

774
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,600
Marriage is not about, uh,
animal lusting and-and kinky sex games.

775
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,000
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

776
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,920
It's-It's deeper than that.

777
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,800
The longer a marriage lasts,

778
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,720
uh, the longer you can go,

779
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,640
uh, without sex.

780
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,040
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

781
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,960
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

782
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,000
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

783
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

784
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,560
Uh, and I mean that
in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

785
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,080
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh...
I think I, uh...

786
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,800
Anything else you need?
No. No, that's, uh...

787
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,720
Anything I can do.

788
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,240
Don't make me listen
to this stupid broken record again

789
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,800
Don't make me listen
to this stupid broken record again

790
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,840
The needle's skipping and repeating
never reaching the end

791
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You know, you're bitching and complaining
like you got it so tough

792
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,880
We're sick of all your crying
Will you ever shut up

793
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,520
He's not here.
Park the cars down there
where he won't see them.

794
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,920
[Laughing]
Hoo! Fuckin' right!

795
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,120
So, you like my pants, Stiffy?
Whatever, dude.
As long as the girls are worth it.

796
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,800
They're worth it.
Oh, and if you've got some good wine too,
that'll score some points for you.

797
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,600
- We think there's some in the...
in the basement.
- I'll get it.

798
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,520
You ain't gonna want to miss this.

799
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,200
[Laughing]
Gentlemen.

800
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,600

Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Yeah.!

Wanna make ya bounce
Every single ounce

Whoops. Can you see my fanny?

Are you just gonna
stand there and drool?

Yeah? What?
I can't hear you.

just wait for... Jim.

and it does as it's told.

That you ever met was me

877
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,040
I used to have this pet bass.
Oh.

His name was Arnie, and...
Oh, he was so cute.

[Chuckles]
Yeah.

880
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,640

Maybe you could dance.

881
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,920
and make this face like...

I don't know. It was great.
God, I miss him, but...

883
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,280
Um, sometimes I watch
the Discovery Channel, and...

884
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,560
[Groans]
I don't care!

885
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,720
Could you just
dance for me, please?

886

No, that's my favorite...

You don't worry about him.

895
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,360
He's... He's a... He's a maniac.
And you're a maniac, you know that?

896

are you focused on me?

899

you don't have tits.

How can I clean you
if you are not dirty?

901
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,560
Go put something on
that I must clean off with my tongue.

902

Ohh. Anything
for a French person.

903

I see you, baby
Shaking that ass

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,040
Shaking that ass
Shaking that ass

906
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,880
- I see you, baby
shaking that ass
- Ah!

907
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,480
Oh, yeah.

908
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,800
Look at you,
you pathetic, little weasel.

909
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,480
Can't I just watch?

910
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Look, you don't have to do
anything if you don't want to.

911
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

912
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,200
Don't break character ever again.

913
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,120
Okay? I don't care if Kevin starts crying
because Finch bit his cock off.

914
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,800
You're a dirty cop, you're a prissy maid
and I am your filthy cabana boy
in need of much punishment and cleaning.

915
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,640
Don't you ever mouth off
to Officer Krystal,

916
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,400
- You dirty, little pervert!
- Okay.

917
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,880
Now, obey!
I obey! I obey!

918
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,240
Jesus!

919
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,760
Break it on down
Huh, what

920
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,960
Whoo
[Grunts]

921
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
What
Break it on down

922
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,000
Guys, are we having dinner?

923
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,640
Here, let me get that.

924
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,600
I see you, baby
shaking that ass

925
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,760
Holy shit!
Stifler.

926
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,440
I've got something really nice
cooking up for you.
Well, we love surprises.

927
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,320
Stifler, you said you spoke toJim.
I did.
I was secret about it and everything.

928
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,640
He said he'd be
the only one here tonight.
What the fuck, shit-brick?

929
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,800
Chocolate.
Ah, sh...

930
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,560
Now, I told everyone
that you were up north
with my parents.

931
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,960
Okay.
So we won't be bothered. We can
just, uh, totally relax and no worries.

932
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,240
[Mary Chuckles]
Please come on in.

933
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,480
Make yourselves at home.
Right this way.
Thank you.

934
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,440
Sir.

935
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,200
[Gasps]
What?

936
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,520
Pink roses.

937
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,440
[Jim]
Pink roses.
Yeah.

938
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,000
They're nice, aren't they?
Yes. Artificial. Nice try.

939
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,760
Well...
[Chuckles]
I almost got ya.

940
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,080
Yeah. Well.

941
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,320
So, has Michelle ever told you
the story ofhow we fell in love?

942
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,840
Oh, why don't you retell us now?

943
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
It's... It's one of my favorite stories.
Where should I begin?

944
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,400
Um...
[Clears Throat]

945
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,400
Let's see. Uh...

946
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,360
Well, I suppose, uh...
I suppose it all started at, um...

947
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,200
Tall Oaks.

948
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,560
That's-That's right.
At Tall Oaks.

949
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,480
That was the summer when, uh... Oh!

950
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,600
Oh! The summer that was so hot.

951
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,080
So hot.
All right. Look what I got.

952
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,000
Jesus!

953
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,920
Hey there.
Hi there.

954
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,440
Hey.
Jim, I cannot believe you.

955
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,480
- You can't?
- You hired help on our account?
That is entirely unnecessary.

956
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,960
But I will have some of that wine, sir.

957
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,320
- Say, "Please," Harold.
- Please. Of course.

958
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,360
[British Accent] Absolutely.
It's what he's here for,
is-is the wine, obviously.

959
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,200
Yes. Evidently.
What else would you be here for?

960
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,200
And-And-And I certainly appreciate
your-your-your courtesy, sir.

961
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,560
Ah. Uh, well, yes.

962
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,200
Uh, we have...
we have right here a 1999...

963
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,880
cabernet seve... um...

964
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,280
full-bodied, masculine wine.

965
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,160
Just shouts sophistication.

966
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,560
- James.
- Yes.

967
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,360
Well, I can see you're very surprised
to see me here.
A little bit.

968
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,680
I'm going to go
check on the dogs.
Yes, yes!

969
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,680
In fact, why don't you both
go check on the dogs and...

970
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,120
No, no, no.
Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

971
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,840
- How do you know?
- Because I just checked on the dogs.

972
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,360
Because he just checked on the dogs.
Good work, man.
I did.

973
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
- Jim, I'll help you with the turkey.
- Okay.

974
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,680
Um, and I'll keep you company.

975
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,600
Thank you. Whoo.

976
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,840
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mr., um...

977
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,360
Belvedere, ma'am.
Oh. Belvedere.

978
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,240
It's chilly in here.

979
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,840
So, how long do we have to
stay in here for?

980
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,360
I don't know.
They said to hide.

981
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,640
I guess we'll just wait
for 'em to call us.

982
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,640
[Krystal]
Who knows what kind of kinky shit
they're getting ready for us.

983
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,600
Do these go
in your ass tonight or mine?

984
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,000
Do you have a serving dish ready?

985
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,000
- Jim.
- Hmm?

986
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,320
We need a serving dish.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

987
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,080
- Oh!
- What?

988
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,760
- Nothing.
- Then why the excitement?

989
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,120
I thought, uh, the-the dish was broken.

990
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,320
Well, is it?
No.

991
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,280
Then, are you going to get it?
Yes.

992
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880
Here you go.
One serving dish.
Excellent.

993
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,640
Now what we need...
a cutting board.

994
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,280
Huh? No, no, no, no!
Stop!
What?

995
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,560
I-I will get it for you.
Nonsense.
I can get a cutting board.

996
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,880
Ah, let's see. There you go.
This should do nicely.

997
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,600
I presume we're having
white wine with the turkey.

998
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,560
Uh, let me go check.

999

[Mary Chuckles]

1000
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,840
What happened here?

1001
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,640
[Jim]
Oh, um, that... that's mud.

1002
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,000
I meant to clean
that up this morning.
How embarrassing.

1003
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,560
That's gonna stain.
We're gonna need a mop.

1004
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,920
I'll get it.
It's in this closet.

1005
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,600
Oh! No, no, no!
No, it's not.

1006
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,840
- It's in there.
- It's not in this closet...

1007
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,360
because I-I, um...
I moved it... I moved it.

1008
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,360
Well, where?
I'll go get it.

1009
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,520
I-I don't...
I don't remember.

1010
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,600
You don't remember?

1011
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,680
You know why I don't remember
is because I actually did not move it.

1012
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,160
The cleaning lady did.

1013
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,040
Your mother said
you don't have a cleaning lady.

1014
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,040
I don't know why
she would say such a...
You called, master?

1015
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,040
Holy...
Well, there you are.

1016
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Hello.
How do you do?

1017
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,080
Uh, so, cleaning lady,

1018
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,040
we were wondering
where... where the mop was.

1019
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,920
Master put the mop
in my fanny.

1020
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,480
- You what?
- Who put what where?

1021
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,160
I did no such thing anywhere.

1022
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,640
Shall I clean?

What are you doing?
You're not in Eastern Europe anymore.

1029
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:12,160
You can't do that.
I am so sorry about my... my cousin.
She's not used to our customs.

1030
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,160
Jim, I apologize
for recommending her to you.

1031

Oh, here's, uh...
here's this, by the way.

1032
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,440
Ah, yeah. Got the mop.

1033
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,440
Brandi, you left the mop
in the car.
Hmm?

1034
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,000
Now remember,
it's called a car, not a fanny.

1035
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,800
You remember last time when you wanted
me to take a ride in your fanny?
Of course.

We should probablyjust go.

I'm so sorry about this.
I just came by to make sure
everything was in order.

00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,680
- Okay.
- Who let this boy out of the closet?

1054

[Stammering]
You are all in for
a hard punishment now.

Don't you touch him.
He's been hurt.

1056
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,960
- No, this is hurt!
- Ow!

1057
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,120
You can't do that.
Silence, fucker!

1058
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,120
Ow!
Oh, you like it.

1059
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,080
Oh!
Harold!

1060
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,240
What's gotten into you?
I meant "ow."

1061

Dirty whore!
Shut your hole! Obey!

1062
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,000
[Screaming]
[Harold]
You can't do that.!

1063
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,200
- [Mary] You're a disgrace
to the police force.
- I'll be giving you an enema!

1064
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,440
Hey, somebody untie me.!

1065
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,600
Back off!
All right, forget it.
We give up.

1066
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,840
Oh, Steven! Steven!

1067
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,640
Oh, it's okay, Mary.
What's going on?

1068
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,640
Listen. This isn't
working, guys.

1069
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,320
Krystal, you can
drop the act.
This isn't a real cop.

1070
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,840
Kevin wasn't assaulted.
[Gasps]

1071
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,440
I just wanted to makeJim
look good for you guys.

1072
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,800
Like a real hero.
Kind of like me.

1073
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
So, we hired a fake cop
and we tied up Kevin
and put him in the closet.

1074
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,840
Jim was supposed to
rescue him, untie him,
give him mouth-to-mouth.

1075
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,880
I don't know
what he likes to do.

1076
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,200
You know, and then Paul Finch
hired an exotic dancer
instead of a real actor.

1077
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,320
Jim, is this true?

1078
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,040
- Every word of it.
- That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

1079
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,120
You've embarrassed me and Harold
and Mr. Belvedere.

1080
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,960
It's all my fault.
I'm a bad person.

1081
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:37,280
Oh, you're not a bad person.
You were just trying to
help out your best friend.

1082
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,160
And it was an awful idea.
But I suppose it's the thought
that counts.

1083
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,440
You know, actually, um...

1084
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,600
Actually, I-I never
should have allowed...

1085
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,440
such a... such a crazy plan
to happen in the first place.

1086
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,080
If you're gonna
blame anybody here, blame me.

1087
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,240
Well, I'm sorry, Jim.
I didn't realize how much pressure
we put on you.

1088
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,840
I'm sure you both
learned your lesson
and I suppose I understand.

1089
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,600
Jim, if you put half as much energy
into your marriage
as you put into tonight,

1090
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,880
I'm confident
that I can give you my blessing.

1091
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,520
And, Steven,
we still adore you, honey.

1092
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,200
In fact, I think I know
who should hold onto this.

1093
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,880
We adore you.
You'll take good care of it.

1094
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,640
You've gotta be kidding me.
No.

1095
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,240
Look it, Jim. Kevin.
Boy, this really makes me
important to the wedding, huh?

1096
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,280
Yes.

1097
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,160
Well, Mr. Belvedere, it's gonna
be one fucked-up wedding.

1098
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,200
Absolutely.

1099
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,560
Drive carefully.
There's more bags
in the study.

1100

Thank you.
You're welcome.

1101
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,400
But everything
it all just feels the same

1102
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,360
Ow! Is there any room
for me?

1103
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,640
Uh, nope.

1104
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,880
Oh, I'll just drive up north
all by myself.

1105
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,080
That sounds good.
We'll see you later.

1106
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,760
No, I'll drive with you.
Oh, thanks, Cadence.

- Beautiful lady.
- Sure.

1108

Hey, Finch...
I know, shut up.

playing with something unusual
this morning.

What?
I told her it was
a neck massager.

Oh, these are great.

[Skipped item nr. 1117]

But I could never live
the way they want

1120
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,520
Do you really wanna be like them

wanna be another trend

so lethargic to me.

you called two days ago
and canceled your reservation.

wish to stay here,

persuade Mr. Finch
to share his room.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I hope you'll be more careful
with the next one.

My kitchen
is not a toilet. Okay?

1204
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,800
Boy, pubic hair
was just not an issue
when I was dating.

1205
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,760
The ladies, uh,
never complained
when they were...

you know, down in
that general area.

Okay, if you never mention
that ever again, that'd be great.

1208
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,560
You're right. No, no, no. Okay.
Shouldn't have brought it up.
Maybe...

all of this?

I mean, do you act differently
around certain people?
Namely me.

1219
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,440
Of course not.
Why? Do you act
differently around me?

1220
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,800
Generally I'm just me.
If people don't like it,
then that's their problem, right?

Come on. Thanks for
watching the dogs.

Huh? There you go.

You kissed Stifler?
Yeah, but then he freaked.

And it's like he's been
paying more attention
to the dogs than me.

Can I stop worrying then?
Michelle, he's been nothing
but nice to me.

when Cadence kissed me.

It was something like this.
[Warbles]

You're a terrible liar, Stifler.

1258

If I were lying,
I'd think of something
better than a kiss.

I'm sorry if I freaked you out

special girl I've ever known.

Maybe you'd wanna make things
extra special tonight.

how it's always gonna be.

Something must have
disrupted the power.

01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,560
That's the spirit, sweetheart.

1496
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,480
Did you see the stylish kids
in the riot

1497
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,080
Shoveled up like muck
Set the night on fire

1498
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,280

Truncheons and shields

1499
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,920
You know I cherish you, my love
[Stifler]
Pick up the pace.

1500
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,920
[Continues]
You guys keep working this hard,
we'll be able to beat the Wildcats.

1501
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,600
You remember how tough
they were last year.

1502
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,800
Come on. Let's see
some determination.

1503
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,240
Determination.!

1504
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,040

Oh, how I cherish you, my love

1505

[Stifler]
Come on. Keep working.!

1506
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,720
Good, Connor. Very good.
Good, DeBoer.

1507
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,720
Really sucks.
Go fix it.

1508
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,600
Hey, party guy.
Having a good time, huh?
Can I get you a gin and tonic?

1509
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,000
Ring! Hold on a second.
Hello. [Laughs]
Okay.

1510
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,200
It's for you.
It's "get to work, fucker."

1511
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,360
We are gathered here today
to join these two great people...

1512
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,680
in a blessed union and bladdah,
bladdah, bladdah and crap.

1513
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,280
Coach, this is kinda gay.

1514
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,360
Yeah, it is.

1515
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,080
Good work.
Hey, no problem.

1516
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,040
So, you got a date
for this thing?

1517
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,960
Don't push it.
Sorry.

1518
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,800
Holy shit.

1519
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,880
[Jim]
How the hell did this happen?

1520
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,960
It's a miracle.

1521
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,920

Save it, dickhead.
I'm working.

You know
I cherish you, my love

1525
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,120
- You're an asshole.
- I know.

1526
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,240
You really are an asshole.

1527
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,880
Thanks.
[Clears Throat]

1528
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,600
I don't do apologies so good.

1529
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,240
Well, you get an "A" for effort.
This is amazing.

1530
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,440
[Laughs]
Cool.

1531
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,080
I was always kind of
a "C" student.

1532
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,600
So, did you do all this
just to have sex with me...

1533
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,880
or because you really care
about the wedding?

1534
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,080
Both.

1535
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,080
And, uh...
[Clears Throat]

1536
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,040
[Mumbles]
I like you.

1537
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,720
What?

1538
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,200
I like you.

1539
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,680
Well, that's an honest answer.

1540
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,640
I gotta go.

1541
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,720
Steve Stifler just gave
a rose to a girl and meant it.

1542
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,440
This is huge.
It's... It's like watching monkeys
use tools for the first time.

1543
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:06,640
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1544
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,440
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1545
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,360
No. Let's see.

1546
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,640
She wasn't into
the heavy intellectual stuff.

1547
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,320
She actually liked me
being that imbecile.

1548
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,360
No, no, somehow I think
she's probably better off with you.

1549
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,360
Thanks, shit-brick.

1550
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:28,120
Ooh. Dick.
Fucking hate not hating you.

1551
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,440
I did fuck your mom.

1552
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,720
Twice.

1553
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,600
Ooh! That's better, fucker!
[Knocking]

1554
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,440
Oh. Whoa!
Ready to go?

1555
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,040
Um, the wedding's
not for another hour.

1556
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,120
No, I mean you and me.

1557
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,160
[Gasps]
Hold on. Hold on.

1558
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,280
Do I still gotta do
this bullshit meeting?

1559
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,360
Stifler, you are not
bailing on Jim.

1560
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,120
Shit!
Give me 10 minutes?

1561
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,120
I'll meet you at the closet.
The closet.

1562
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,960
You wanted to see me,
Michelle?

1563
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,400
Oh! Okay, sit.

1564
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,200
So, uh, Jim said that you've always
kind ofbeen there for him...

1565
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,280
when he needed you,
so I thought maybe you could help me.

1566
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,720
Jim said that?

1567
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,840
What's, uh...
What's the problem?

1568
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,800
Okay. Well, I, uh...

1569
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,760
I still can't get
my vows right.

1570
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,560
Oh. I haven't been this confused
since I got my first period.

1571
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,000
That's a very confusing time
for any young lady.

1572
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,800
You know, your body
is going through, uh, changes.

1573
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,960
Um, stuff coming out,
stuff going in.

1574
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,960
Oh, no.
I need help with my vows,
not my period.

1575
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,160
Oh, your vows.
Your vows.

1576
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,960
Yes, uh, good.
Um, go on.

1577
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,480
Jim just wants
a groomsmen's meeting
before the wedding.

1578
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,280
It shouldn't take long.
Just don't let her
talk to anyone.

1579
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,480
Be careful.
She's feisty.

1580
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,040
Okay, let's go.

1581
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,640
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming out here
and meeting me.

1582
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,680
I, um... I just have
a couple of things
I wanna say.

1583
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,600
This sucks.

1584
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,280
Did I say that out loud?

1585
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,320
Keep going.
It's good.

1586
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,000
Now, I thought about
what you said, Kev.

1587
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,080
About, uh, about how my problems
always seem to work out.

1588
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:49,480
And I realized that the reason
things always work out...

1589
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,520
is because you guys have always
been there to back me up.

1590
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,480
Even you, Stifler.

1591
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,560
For the first time in my life...

1592
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,200
I actually feel like
I can't mess anything up.

1593
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,640
[Scoffs, Snickers]

1594
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,160
Which is pretty amazing.

1595
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,440
So, uh,

1596
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,600
I-I guess I just wanted
to say thank you.

1597
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,680
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks?

1598
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,960
This whole thing
was about thanks?

1599
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,280
Ooh! You're welcome,
cock-block!

1600
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,760
That was good, Jim.
Real nice.

1601
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,000
Let's get you married.
Hmm?

1602
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,120
Okay.

1603
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:36,440
[Skipped item nr. 1602]

1604
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,640
Love is very difficult
to describe.

1605
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,520
And I understand the angst.
I mean, it's your wedding.

1606
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,280
And it's natural.
It's perfectly natural.

1607
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,240
But it's impossible
to describe a feeling.

1608
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,440
Okay, first,
nothing is impossible.

1609
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,960
So, let's not focus
on that.

1610
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:59,400
Why do you think, Michelle,
they call it "making love"?

1611
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,360
I don't know.
I just call it "boning."

1612
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,080
Boning.

1613
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,320
Well, when you're doing
other things with Jim...

1614
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,840
when you're not,
um, boning...

1615
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,840
how does
he make you feel?

1616
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,160
Horny, like I wanna bone.

1617
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,000
But we can't be boning
from sunrise to sunset, dear.

1618
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,960
Oh, you've never tried it?

1619
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,840
I certainly have.
I have. I've boned.

1620
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,480
From sunrise
right through brunch,
on more than one occasion.

1621
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,200
But boning aside,
um, I think they call it
"making love"...

1622
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,480
because you have to
make love work.

1623
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,720
You know,
it's about compromise
and sacrifice.

1624
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,040
And I thinkJim
has sacrificed for you.

1625
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,280
My God, he shaved
his entire pubic region,

1626
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,240
which would baffle
most cultures around the world.

1627
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:55,080
But he did it,
and he did it for you.

1628
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:00,120
You're right.
Love isn't just a feeling.

1629
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,160
It's shaving your balls.

1630
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,800
Thanks, Dad.

1631
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,800
I wouldn't get
into too much detail on that.

Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

Uh-huh.

1635

You know, son,
I think this is probably
the right time to tell you that...

01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,640
that...

I had trouble finding the words

And I realized something.

Love isn't just a feeling.

Love is something you do.

1688

It's a dress,
a visit to band camp.

A special haircut.

everything I've ever wanted.

Just follow my lead.
I'll try.

and feel the sky

Let your soul and spirit
fly into the mystic

Well, seems like
everything worked out.
Magnificently.

I feel a bit sad
that tonight our little Michelle
is going to be a woman.

Honey, you don't honestly believe
that Michelle is still a...

I can't recall a single moment
with either one of them...

1711
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,920
that would make me
think otherwise.

I was curious.
Didn't see you here.

I try to keep a low profile.

I never really did
like these things anyway.

You know, this has actually
made quite an impression on me.

I have something to look for
in a woman now.

1724
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,960
Well, if this is your idea
of a proposal...

1725
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,120
Finchy, you gotta know
that I'm over you now.

And I'm over you.

we will always have Paris.

And the car.

I have upstairs.

you know I will be coming home

than I ever imagined.

How did a little perv like you
turn into such a great guy?

How did a little nympho like you
turn into such a great girl?

I'm still a nympho.
Oh, I'm still a perv.

Whoa

1800
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,800
So go ahead and take a picture

1801
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,800
And hang it up
so you can tear me down

1802
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,280
I don't care
Whoa, whoa

1803
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,280
'Cause I'm still here
Whoa, whoa

1804
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,240
And I've got nothing
left to lose

1805
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:15,520
With all the years
I've wasted on you

1806
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,040
Mom and Daddy's
got the best cocaine

1807
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,960
Ritalin's never gonna
feel the same

1808
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,640
Twenty-four hours
on an empty brain

1809
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:02,400
I got my finger on the trigger
and you're in my way

1810
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,280
I'm bouncing off the walls again
Whoa

1811
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,480
I'm looking like a fool again
Whoa

1812
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,920
Threw away my reputation

1813
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,280
One more song
for the radio station

1814
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,160
I'm bouncing off the walls again
Whoa

1815
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:20,360
I'm looking like a fool again
Whoa

1816
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,160
I'm bouncing off the walls again
Whoa

1817
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,520
I'm looking like a fool again

1818
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,062
