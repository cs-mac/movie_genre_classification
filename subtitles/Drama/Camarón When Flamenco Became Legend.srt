00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,699
I really composed this song?

3
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,399
Yeah, it is.

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,799
The songs you're going to
compose in the future--

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,799
This makes no sense.

6
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,699
Are you asking us to believe
what you're saying?

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,500
But how can we not believe it
after hearing this song?

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,600
Wait...

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
then you weren't joking when you said
all that future and past stuff?

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,700
Do you always think I'm joking?

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,500
I don't know what's going on here.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,899
Me too.

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,199
Ah Rin, can you simplify it
and explain it to us?

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>Ah Rin!</i>

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,200
What are you doing?
Let's go.

16
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,295
Are you daydreaming again?

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,799
Yeo Reum.

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,000
That was my third time back.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,299
And of course I thought that
I came back alone.

20
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,500
- But Eun Woo...
- Yes?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,799
Can't you reconcile with Bin?

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,899
- You don't have to worry.
- Huh?

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,500
Everything is going to be okay,
it's bound to work out.

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,799
Listening to Eun Woo that day,
I was suspicious

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,799
but then I doubted myself.

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
It was the first time coming back
to the past with someone else.

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,599
That's a different song from the one
we prepared in the past.

28
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,799
This isn't the song
we used in the future's past.

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,099
If it weren't for MJ...

30
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,899
I'd probably think I was still alone.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,700
So what you're saying is that...

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,200
Jin Jin, MJ, and I
all came from the future together.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,000
But somewhere along the way,
we lost our memories about it?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,900
There is a chance we could have
all came together from there.

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,048
Then it's a matter of remembering or not?

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,900
That's it!

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Ah Rin and I don't even know
when we'll lose our memories

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
and just live on like that.

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Wow, this is just like a movie.

40
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Hey, why didn't you tell us earlier?

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
Do you know how many times I did?

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
You guys didn't believe me!

43
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,199
- We thought you were joking.
- You joke around too much.

44
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,000
Because I didn't want to
interfere with your future.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right, haven't you guys
seen "Butterfly Effect"?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,379
If you change something in the past
whether it's big or small

47
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,110
it can have a huge impact on the future.

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,036
Usually in a negative way.

49
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:39,036
Wow, you said the same thing
the day we got here!

50
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:42,536
Really?
I guess people don't change.

51
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:45,536
Then in the past
Sun Hyuk plagiarized our song

52
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,036
and made us go through this hell?

53
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,436
No.

54
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:51,932
Honestly, this is different
from the past that I know of.

55
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,235
It's true, this is all my fault.

56
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:55,635
What do you mean it's not?

57
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,936
He held in it back all this time,
and blew up and took it out on Bin.

58
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,635
Is that true?

59
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:01,835
- You scared me.
- You scared me.

60
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,436
That little...

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
- I don't know where to start--
- Hey, Cha Eun Woo!

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>- We're screwed.
- We're screwed.</i>

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,300
That's when things started
changing from the past that I know.

64
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Us changing the song like this
never happened in the past.

65
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,699
Oh my, it sounds like fun!
I want to time travel, too.

66
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,699
Then, what do we have to do now?

67
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,799
What do you mean, what do we do?

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
We already know our future

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,100
we'll just need to
start working hard again.

70
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,900
There is nothing to worry about.

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
I really composed this song, right?

72
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,300
I'll put my finishing touches
to the last part of the song.

73
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
- Let's head to the practice room.
- Yes.

74
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,500
<i>From the first day I met you</i>

75
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>I doubted you.</i>

76
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,900
<i>The second day I met you</i>

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,800
<i>that's when I knew for sure.</i>

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,100
<i>Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho</i>

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,200
<i>I wanted to take more time with you.</i>

80
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,199
<i>Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho Uh ho</i>

81
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,800
They are so good.

82
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:36,593
<i>- That night you were kind of off</i>
- But...

83
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:40,394
isn't it similar to the song
Eun Woo's team was practicing?

84
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:43,394
What do you mean it's similar?
It's exactly the same.

85
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:47,394
<i>- I tried to avoid it as much as possible.</i>
- They plagiarized Eun Woo's song.

86
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:51,394
- Oh really?
<i>- All men are the same.</i>

87
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:55,899
<i>This is not the kind of love I wanted.</i>

88
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,899
Then what's going to happen?

89
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,099
Is Sun Hyuk's team performing
at the festival?

90
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,100
That's what I mean...
San Ha is so upset because of this.

91
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Let's see what San Ha is doing.

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,600
<i>All men are the same.</i>

93
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,463
San Ha!

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
Why are you leaving already
without practicing?

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,399
- Don't tell me you guys gave up.
- No...

96
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,199
We're headed to practice right now.

97
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,699
I'm so glad to hear that.

98
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,699
Don't worry. We already have
a killer song we're working with.

99
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,000
Eun Woo already came up with a new song?

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course, it's so much
better than the last one.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Please do a good job.
because I'm your fan now.

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Huh, my fan?

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay, I'll do my best.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
By the way...

106
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,500
I don't think we can meet until tryouts.

107
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,199
Of course. Don't worry about me
and focus on practice.

108
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
San Ha, can you...

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
Why is my heart...

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
pounding like this?

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,300
Me too.

112
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,500
What are we like in the future?

113
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
You and I?

114
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a secret.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Come on, you're going to start
keeping secrets between us.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,000
It's the same.
Same as it is right now.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,899
All right.

118
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,399
If I become disappointed now
subtitlesripped by riri13

119
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,399
then will our future change?

120
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,399
What do you mean disappointed?

121
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,599
Gosh, I guess I got rejected.

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,399
I was going to wait
until I was 20 and tell you

123
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,100
that I wanted to be more than
friends and go out with you.

124
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,600
Why are you laughing?
I really got rejected?

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,100
No...

126
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,600
you never confessed your feelings to me.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,300
You're better off confessing them
to Yeo Reum first.

128
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Huh, what does that mean?

129
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
Just...

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,100
things that are bound to happen
will happen.

131
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,699
Ah man, this is driving me nuts.

132
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,500
I swore I memorized everything,
but I can't remember it.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,199
Since our past already changed
according to Ah Rin

134
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,800
it should be fine even if the lyrics
are a little different.

135
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't feel too pressured,
and jot down whatever you remember.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Okay.

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,699
I think I'm pretty much done.

138
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,899
Ah... I'm the problematic one.

139
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,199
It's almost done

140
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,699
but I can't seem to finish off
this last part.

141
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,699
Am I slowly losing my memories?

142
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,699
Why can I only remember my part?

143
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,500
Why, is something wrong?

144
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,600
I can't seem to finish the last part,
and MJ can't recall the lyrics.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
Let me listen to it.

146
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,600
It went something like that.

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I can't remember it clearly either.

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh...

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,500
It's game over now.

150
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,884
Yes, Yeo Reum?

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,199
Okay.

152
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,500
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,900
Rocky can be in charge
of the center stage.

154
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,500
Since we don't have much time left

155
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
we can use the choreography
which Rocky and I used

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,299
and what we practiced with,
then use the moves that overlap.

157
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

158
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,100
Should we try it now?

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,700
I always felt like
you kept secrets from me

160
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
and that used to make me upset.

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Now I can understand.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,799
I didn't want to look like
a weird person.

163
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,799
It's quite amazing.

164
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,899
How does it feel
to come from the future?

165
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,899
I thought if I can come back,
I would make better choices.

166
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,799
But after I got here

167
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,799
it made me realized that
all those choices had a reason.

168
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,599
A kind of weird sensation.

169
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,899
When I found out Bin had a crush on you

170
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,899
it made me regret
becoming friends with you.

171
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,899
But even if we go back

172
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,899
you're saying we'd still
become friends, right?

173
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,167
Yes.

174
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,199
Hey!

175
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You regretted becoming friends
because of a guy?

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,900
Huh?

177
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,199
For a moment...

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
it was really just a moment.

179
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,900
Let's hurry.
The guys should be hungry.

180
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,299
<i>I'll help you not regret
becoming friends with me. </i>

181
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,299
How is it?

182
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,099
- Yes, woah.
- Hmmm.

183
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,299
- It's really good.
- I told you it's this song.

184
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,299
Let's really get it started!

185
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,299
- Yay!
- Yay!

186
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,000
Today is finally the decision day.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
There were rough patches along the road

188
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
but seeing you guys trust one another
and overcome those obstacle

189
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,485
made me proud of you guys.

190
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,100
The biggest reward for our hard work is...

191
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
the reflection of ourselves
making those progress.

192
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,216
You guys are already radiant.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Stars are most magnificent when
they're twinkling in the night sky.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Please show that you're the best
in our school on stage today.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

196
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,899
Let's do one more round.

197
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,899
- Should we bet on ice cream?
- Of course.

198
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,699
Rock, paper, scissors!

199
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,199
- Oh wait!
- Okay, okay, okay.

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Stop fooling around,
and let's start getting ready.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sun Hyuk's team goes first
since they submitted the song first.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,299
- Okay.
- Then it's Eun Woo's team.

203
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:30,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,924
We're going to start
once the teachers get seated

205
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:34,100
so get ready quickly.

206
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

207
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,700
We'll find out who's the real rat today.

208
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,199
Don't mind what he says.

209
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
They had to use what we threw out

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
they can't possibly be any good.

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,352
That's right. Let's just be ourselves.

213
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,399
Eun Woo, my heart feels like
it's shivering to death.

214
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,799
Me too.

215
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,799
We probably have done this before
yet it's still nerve racking.

216
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,251
Should we all cheer together?

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,700
One, two, three.

218
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,000
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Let's go.

220
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:32,827

221
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know what you're saying right now.
Oh no, no.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know when or how
I'll lose that memory

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
and live on like...

224
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,900
I can't be a hindrance to your future.

225
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:50,899
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Went to the future yesterday, I'm sorry.

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,899
I thought I was alone... I'm sorry.

228
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,399
How many times did I say it?

229
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,899
You guys once... didn't believe it.
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,899
Already know... I'm sorry.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,200
What happened to
"the guys will be hungry"?

232
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,158
Bang, bang, bang.

233
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,457
I'm sorry... getting ready for.

234
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:23,957
My heart feels like it's shivering.
I'm sorry.
