1
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,796
Hello?

2
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,304
What?...

3
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:30,151
I'll be right there.

4
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:40,319
Hello?

5
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
Hello?

6
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,470
It's me.

7
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:50,039
What is it?

8
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,444
Nothing.

9
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm just on my way to a client...

10
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:05,989
And I just began to think
about our house...

11
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,994
It just seems like
I was imagining things.

12
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:16,495
Were you having a bad dream?

13
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:20,268
When?

14
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:24,137
As I was leaving,
you were moving around.

15
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:28,576
I'm not sure... I don't know...

16
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:34,517
I never know whether or not
to wake you during a nightmare.

17
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:39,684
Hera!?

18
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,461
I work for your
insurance company.

19
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:14,996
I'm an adjuster.

20
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,577
Thank you...

21
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,517
Thank you...

22
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:47,996
Projection in theater ''A''
will commence immediately.

23
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:52,035
Running time is 92 minutes
and 43 seconds...

24
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,947
Yes chiquito la la la la la

25
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,957
La la la la

26
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:56,530
The boy has sat upon
his mother's lap

27
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:05,481
lost who have played love love

28
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:11,990
the boy has dreamed

29
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,799
God bless you my joy

30
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:34,807
the boy has lain
so close to my heart

31
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,015
I'm leaving now.

32
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:08,516
Ha! Ha! Ha!

33
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:09,676
Bye...

34
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,220
Bye... take care.

35
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,030
Ah...

36
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,033
I said: ''Lick it!''

37
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,038
lick it all over this cunt...

38
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,040
That's it...

39
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:34,044
Look at what I have for you!

40
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,549
It's your favourite toy...

41
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,052
Ooh!... ooh!... hum...

42
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,555
Does that feel good, daddy?

43
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,558
Does that feel good?

44
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:47,562
Tell me it feels good, daddy!

45
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:50,063
Oooh!... oooh!...

46
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,896
Here we go!

47
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,594
Your favourite part!

48
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,838
Well, it seems like it's electrical.

49
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,881
Did you sleep okay?

50
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,883
Was it too noisy?

51
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,890
Was the room okay?

52
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,892
I... I usually recommend it...

53
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:25,398
It's very important that
you stay some place that...

54
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,899
You feel comfortable.

55
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:32,941
You may not feel it but...
You're in a state of shock.

56
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,406
Ah!!!

57
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,910
Ah!... ah!... ah!...

58
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,912
No...

59
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,414
Stop!

60
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:44,918
Stop! Please! Stop! Please!

61
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,924
Ooh!... aah!... aah!...

62
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,934
Please, stop!...

63
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:03,874
Aah!... aah!...

64
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,895
Watch your step.

65
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,400
You must itemise
all the contents.

66
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:31,062
Everything that was in the house

67
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,699
at the time of the fire.

68
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,241
Beside each item,

69
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:37,903
you put the approximate value.

70
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,412
It helps to draw a plan.

71
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,416
It makes things clearer.

72
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,917
Unless you have
photographs, then...

73
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:58,232
I'll take you back to the motel.

74
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,233
No! No! Please! Stop!

75
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,469
We seem pretty much in accord.

76
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:17,951
25 a's, 13 b's, 2 c1's,
43 e's, 39 f's...

77
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,755
No g... surprising.

78
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,356
And 3 h's.

79
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,892
Any comments?

80
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,560
Questions?

81
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:27,363
Good.

82
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:30,434
Jerry, what have you got next?

83
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,004
It looks good.

84
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,113
I gave you my numbers,
if you need anything else...

85
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,373
Yes.

86
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,988
Do you eat out a lot?

87
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,855
Why?

88
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,860
It's an additional cost

89
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:28,294
we can cover.

90
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:33,162
There's a lot I need to know
before I can submit your claim.

91
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:35,366
What you had...

92
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:36,872
What your standard

93
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,465
of living was...

94
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,879
But you're tired.

95
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:45,751
We can start this tomorrow, okay?

96
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:05,336
Hi, Noah!

97
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,905
Hi, Noah!

98
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,507
Noah!

99
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,079
How are you?

100
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:17,350
Hello, Mr. Render.

101
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,852
How are you doing, Louise?

102
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,355
Fine... and you?

103
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,856
Good... good.

104
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,860
Listen, someone
just moved into 92.

105
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,862
Her name is Arianne.

106
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,363
She's very tired.

107
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:30,523
Fire?

108
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,361
A pretty bad one.

109
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:33,867
She'll stay long?

110
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,370
I think so.

111
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,372
I'll let her sleep.

112
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:38,874
Are these new?

113
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,375
The prayer cards?

114
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,876
No, we've always had them.

115
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,914
They're nice, aren't they?

116
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,268
Hi, Mr. Render.

117
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,411
Hi!
-Hi, Noah.

118
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,413
How are you doing?

119
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,688
Noah!

120
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,093
Hi, Tim.

121
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,598
What a surprise!

122
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,759
I was just passing by.

123
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,266
Come on in.

124
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:36,427
Sure?

125
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,936
Of course!

126
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,456
Where's Lorraine?

127
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,958
She went out.

128
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,460
They all work?

129
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:01,896
There's some water
damage on the shades,

130
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,059
but...

131
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,399
What's the matter, Tim?

132
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:07,404
I just don't seem

133
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:10,306
to see the end of this.

134
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,607
I understand.

135
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,309
Any word on the claim?

136
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:16,413
Why is it taking so long!

137
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,915
It's complicated when you live

138
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:21,417
at your place of business,

139
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,920
sorting out inventory

140
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,421
from personal belongings...

141
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,425
We did that weeks ago!

142
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,426
You have the list.

143
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,429
No, I'm waiting too.

144
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:33,227
The sooner we settle this,

145
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,235
the happier we'll be.

146
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,131
It won't be much longer.

147
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,842
We owe so much to you.

148
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,444
You've been so... caring.

149
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,016
Listen...

150
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,250
I deal with people, okay?

151
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:56,723
I mean, you're in shock, it's normal.

152
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,275
I'd better go.

153
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:30,427
Say hi...

154
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,623
Say hello to Lorraine.

155
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,868
He wants to know
if you're an Indian!

156
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:15,043
What if I say yes?

157
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:18,404
He'll believe you.

158
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:28,917
Yes!

159
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,433
Oh...

160
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:41,839
You're so good to me.

161
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:52,813
The boy has lain
so close to my heart

162
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,953
love a long day

163
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,053
hey!

164
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,921
No... no...

165
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:32,927
You were having a nightmare.

166
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,929
How do you know?

167
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,930
You were moving around.

168
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:40,935
I don't scare you
when you move around.

169
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,594
I move around?

170
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,766
Yes.

171
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:46,934
When?

172
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:50,445
All the time.

173
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,949
When I'm asleep?

174
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,957
Then too.

175
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,404
What's the matter?

176
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:15,907
I'm not sure.

177
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,069
Work?

178
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,912
I suppose.

179
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:30,923
It becomes so...

180
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:32,084
What?

181
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:35,254
Weird.

182
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:40,435
In what way?

183
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:47,944
Sorting things out...

184
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:52,050
Deciding what has value and...

185
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:55,452
What doesn't, you know?

186
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:59,956
I know what you mean.

187
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:02,291
It's the same thing I do.

188
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,729
You're a censor.

189
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:10,726
So?

190
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,066
You've got nothing to do

191
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,572
with my job.

192
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:21,380
Do I make you feel stupid?

193
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,418
What do you mean?

194
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:33,426
When I say something which
deserves consideration

195
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,929
and you respond without thinking,

196
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,057
how do you feel?

197
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:42,504
I feel fine.

198
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:45,101
I thought you might feel stupid.

199
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,843
Yes... that's it.

200
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,353
Look what I have for you.

201
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,855
It's your favourite toy.

202
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:02,255
Aah!... aah!...

203
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,664
Does that feel good, daddy?

204
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:16,265
It's like a high school
a high school confidential

205
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:24,784
it's like a high school
a high school confidential

206
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:33,316
she makes friends with those
who stop her in the halls

207
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:37,328
they tease her with catcalls

208
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:44,325
she's a combination Anita
Ekberg Mamie van Doren

209
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,736
a high school

210
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,300
high school confidential

211
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:56,712
a high school a high
school confidential

212
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:04,293
what's the principal doing with her

213
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:06,296
who's there

214
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,797
is he screwing with her

215
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,630
what's her perfume

216
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,965
tigress by faberge

217
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:18,304
it makes me cream my jeans
when she comes my way

218
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,778
a high school a high
school confidential

219
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:29,183
a high school a high school

220
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:31,279
confidential

221
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:36,828
she drives a great
big pink Cadillac

222
00:29:36,897 --> 00:29:41,834
if I don't get her soon
I'll have a heart attack

223
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:47,396
when she passes me a look
I want to burn my book...

224
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,425
''A''?

225
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,867
A graphic or prolonged scene

226
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,870
of violence torture, crime,

227
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,371
cruelty, horror

228
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,031
or human degradation.

229
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,473
''B''?

230
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:23,876
The depiction of physical abuse
or humiliation of human beings

231
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,883
for the purposes of
sexual gratification

232
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,546
or as pleasing to the victim.

233
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:30,883
''C''?

234
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,890
A scene where a person is

235
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,392
or intending to represent

236
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:38,692
a person under the age of 16.

237
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:39,857
One?

238
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,868
Nude or partially nude,

239
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:45,838
in a sexually suggestive
content or text, or...

240
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,066
Two?

241
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,072
A scene of explicit

242
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,574
sexual activity.

243
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,906
How old are you, Tyler?

244
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,070
28.

245
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:55,911
You still live at home?

246
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,816
How did you know?

247
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,850
I called your number yesterday,

248
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,755
and an older woman answered.

249
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,857
Your mom?

250
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,860
There's nothing to be

251
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:08,327
embarrassed about.

252
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,354
I lived at home till I was 35.

253
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:13,963
It's very common in some parts
of the world, Italy, for example.

254
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,235
Are you Italian?

255
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,775
Do I look Italian?

256
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:21,272
No...

257
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:23,376
Let's continue.

258
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:24,878
''D''?

259
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,881
Ah... d...

260
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,885
Explicit and gratuitous
depiction of urination,

261
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:31,886
defecation or vomiting.

262
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:33,182
''H''?

263
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,895
A scene where an animal has been
abused in the making of a film.

264
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,093
Good.

265
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:50,911
I like the way you recited
the guidelines, Tyler.

266
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,814
The slight hesitation
in your voice...

267
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:58,246
Your tone seemed to indicate

268
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,949
a certain flexibility.

269
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,852
It's important.

270
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,756
Our role here has changed
in the past few years.

271
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,258
We're here to classify.

272
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,329
Censorship is not a priority.

273
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,204
Ha! Ha! Ha!

274
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,505
Please...

275
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,379
I can't tell you

276
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,190
how helpful these are.

277
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,695
A friend took them last year.

278
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:43,398
This couch?

279
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:46,061
About... $800.

280
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:51,406
Was it a... foldaway?

281
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,239
Yeah.

282
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:56,176
This was a guest room?

283
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,548
I suppose.

284
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,352
These butterflies,
they're pictures?

285
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:04,855
They're butterflies.

286
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:07,357
They're real butterflies?

287
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:08,757
Yeah, mounted.

288
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:10,259
Wow!

289
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:11,760
What would be

290
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,763
the approximate value?

291
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:15,765
Hum...

292
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:17,767
That blue one, 60;

293
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,337
that one, 80...

294
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,772
340...

295
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,276
340 for the whole thing...

296
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:27,346
With the frame...

297
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,086
The certificate?

298
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:38,283
That's my diploma.

299
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,361
What did it cost to frame?

300
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:46,600
50... $50.

301
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,866
$50...

302
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:53,054
Let's try to itemise

303
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,809
the stuff on the fireplace.

304
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,715
They're mostly personal things.

305
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,852
The more we could list,
the more you could get back.

306
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:18,660
Okay...

307
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:40,892
Was this a pure-bred?

308
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:59,914
How much did you pay
for it, 500, $600?

309
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:05,747
What was...

310
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:08,117
The approximate value?

311
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:18,595
Noah?

312
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:19,758
Yes?

313
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,337
Any word about the claim?

314
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,674
Not yet.

315
00:35:27,678 --> 00:35:29,270
What's the problem?

316
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:30,778
It's complicated, Lorraine...

317
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:32,280
When you live

318
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,113
at your place of business...

319
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:38,279
Sorting inventory from
personal belongings...

320
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,289
I've been through that

321
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,859
weeks ago.

322
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:46,796
I'm as anxious as you are.

323
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:52,272
The sooner we get this settled,
the happier we'll both be.

324
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:56,507
It'll work out.

325
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:06,751
We owe you so much.

326
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:08,253
No, you don't.

327
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:10,085
Yes, you've done so..

328
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:12,419
you are two wonderful people

329
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:14,756
who had the bad luck

330
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,262
to meet with a catastrophe.

331
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:18,765
It's my responsibility

332
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,927
to get you back on your feet

333
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,936
as quickly as possible.

334
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:25,268
Okay?...

335
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:26,842
And you'll be.

336
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,350
Say hi to Tim.

337
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,780
What exactly are we
listing here, Noah?

338
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,184
Your valuables, Arianne.

339
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,987
Of a certain lifestyle.

340
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,489
Once that lifestyle's
been destroyed...

341
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,094
You build it up again.

342
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,894
From what, Noah?

343
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:48,663
To what?

344
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,801
To what it was.

345
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:54,962
Why?

346
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,472
Because that's what you had.

347
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,637
So that means that's
what I have to have.

348
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:03,746
That's what your
claim was based on.

349
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,748
What you need to...

350
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,751
Return things to normal.

351
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,081
Which is?

352
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:10,587
Whatever you need

353
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,457
to feel like you're
functioning in the right way.

354
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,564
This is where it started.

355
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:22,766
I know.

356
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:23,925
How?

357
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:25,935
The inspector told me.

358
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,837
Did he tell you what happened?

359
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:31,644
It was a short circuit.

360
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,185
I turned the light on...

361
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:44,961
I noticed a spark on the floor.

362
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:47,598
It started so small...

363
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:52,702
You didn't stop it?

364
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,761
Something had to change.

365
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,468
So I watched while it did.

366
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:16,560
Jesus! What the fuck,
what the fuck's going on?

367
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:46,752
Hey!

368
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:51,529
Were they singing?

369
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,032
Who?

370
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:55,236
The persons behind the curtain.

371
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:58,535
I don't remember...

372
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,608
They could've been.

373
00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:07,448
Don't you find that amazing?

374
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,749
What?

375
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:13,516
People singing in showers.

376
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:18,060
Ah...

377
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:21,064
I've never really
thought about it.

378
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:23,468
It's one of the only
times we touch ourselves.

379
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:28,572
All of ourselves...

380
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,374
Do you think that's the reason?

381
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:34,778
The sound.

382
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:37,580
Sound?...

383
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,586
Shhhhhhh...

384
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:47,158
Yes! The sound!

385
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:59,332
And the privacy.

386
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,611
No, it can't be the privacy.

387
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:10,249
We used to sing in the showers

388
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,853
after a game.

389
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,355
The whole team would.

390
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:20,260
There'd be a lot of steam...

391
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,764
A lot of joking around,

392
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:24,561
winding down...

393
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:28,468
Then, we'd just...

394
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:30,802
Start singing...

395
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:34,068
All of us...

396
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:35,577
Like...

397
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:38,581
Hum hum hum

398
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:43,185
like one big family.

399
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:48,556
So it's got to be the touching.

400
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,261
Yes, Mimi, it's gotta
be the touching.

401
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:56,162
Ha! Ha! Ha!

402
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:01,833
Where's that?

403
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,909
A place, not too far away.

404
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,978
Got any pictures of the inside?

405
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,484
Not yet.

406
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:13,889
Should I?

407
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:19,620
Yes!

408
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:26,569
Good morning!

409
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:28,739
Are you the owner of the house?

410
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:34,144
Do you speak English?

411
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,641
Does your husband speak English?

412
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:44,078
Is this your mom?

413
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:50,763
This is my card.

414
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,501
This is my job...

415
00:42:56,772 --> 00:43:01,874
And this is my name: Bubba.

416
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,772
Bubba.

417
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,019
That's right, Bubba...

418
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,593
So I was properly introduced.

419
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,095
Excuse me?

420
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:55,598
I'd like you to meet Tyler,

421
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:58,100
his first day with us.

422
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,535
He told me your names...

423
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:04,040
I was so nervous
I forgot them all.

424
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,575
I'm asking you.

425
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,076
Hera.

426
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:10,380
Have you been here long, Hera?

427
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:12,083
A while.

428
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,588
This is my first day.

429
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:17,489
So what do you think?

430
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:18,891
The process?

431
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:21,093
Yes.

432
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,754
It's pretty straightforward.

433
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:24,422
You've got guidelines,

434
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:25,791
you've got violations.

435
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:28,502
When you see one,
you push a button.

436
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,104
That's about it.

437
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:34,108
You can make it
more complicated,

438
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:35,609
if you want...

439
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:38,410
But...

440
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:41,384
That's a matter
of personal taste.

441
00:44:44,256 --> 00:44:48,893
Projection in theatre ''A''
will commence in one minute.

442
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:53,829
Can I sit beside you
for the next one?

443
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:58,364
I usually prefer to sit alone.

444
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:00,401
Why?

445
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,565
So I can concentrate.

446
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,073
On what?

447
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:06,343
The screen.

448
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:10,147
Oh...

449
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:35,610
Did you make that list yet?

450
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:38,338
No.

451
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:42,416
Any idea when it might be ready?

452
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:45,520
What if I don't make one?

453
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:48,724
Why not?

454
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,193
Why?

455
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,197
To make your claim.

456
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:00,402
Everything is destroyed.

457
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:04,072
That's not the point.

458
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,144
What is?

459
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:12,081
To have something to work with,

460
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:14,651
something... something to show.

461
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:18,889
We know what I'm covered for.

462
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:22,593
You saw the state of everything.

463
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:25,695
I don't see the
point of itemising

464
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,096
what we already know...

465
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:30,300
It's a complete loss.

466
00:46:31,237 --> 00:46:32,602
Oh...

467
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:34,604
It's not that simple.

468
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:37,108
What about the jewellery?

469
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,281
Now, they remained untouched.

470
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:43,816
So?...

471
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:47,289
That amount could be
deducted from your claim.

472
00:46:53,763 --> 00:46:58,400
Then why would we even... list it?

473
00:47:02,706 --> 00:47:04,571
What do you mean?

474
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,275
If any item I retrieve is...

475
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:11,080
Deducted from my claim,

476
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:14,483
wouldn't it be to my advantage

477
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,086
not to list anything...

478
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:19,588
Whose physical state...

479
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:22,621
Considering the
extent of the fire,

480
00:47:23,562 --> 00:47:26,457
is... surprisingly intact?

481
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:25,295
Isn't it a bit early?

482
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:28,166
Simone is sleeping.

483
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:32,901
When you first started
showing them to her,

484
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:34,332
she could barely watch.

485
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:36,267
Now, she's...

486
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:37,602
Addicted?

487
00:48:37,742 --> 00:48:39,676
That doesn't bother you?

488
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:43,713
That's the whole point of your job!

489
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,886
Since when have you
thought of my job?

490
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:52,591
How is your little colony?

491
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:56,328
I made an appointment

492
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:58,030
to see someone tomorrow.

493
00:48:58,867 --> 00:48:59,632
A specialist.

494
00:49:11,213 --> 00:49:12,178
Who's this?

495
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:14,581
He works for a film company.

496
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:17,854
I talked to him earlier today.

497
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:22,389
What did he want?

498
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,694
He wants to use our house

499
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,695
as a location.

500
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:30,597
He said he'd come by

501
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,201
first thing tomorrow morning.

502
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,204
He wants to take

503
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,607
some pictures of the inside.

504
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:39,908
That's great... that's great...

505
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,678
Ah!!!

506
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:47,183
Ah!!! Ah!!!

507
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:05,363
Hey!

508
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:09,701
Hey!

509
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,390
Oh!

510
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,167
Sorry...

511
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,169
It came like this.

512
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:39,373
I'm not sure I understand.

513
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:41,175
This is a model home.

514
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:44,579
They used it to show
prospective buyers.

515
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:47,780
Why did they sell it?

516
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:50,685
They didn't need it anymore.

517
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:53,157
And the price was so low.

518
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,994
We just assumed that the other units

519
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,257
had been sold as well.

520
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,264
That wasn't the case?

521
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:05,091
No.

522
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,633
They decided to stop building.

523
00:52:08,607 --> 00:52:09,596
Why?

524
00:52:09,774 --> 00:52:11,406
The developer went bankrupt.

525
00:52:13,077 --> 00:52:15,810
So then you're the only
ones who are staying

526
00:52:15,881 --> 00:52:17,312
in this whole development?

527
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:19,113
Well, for now.

528
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:20,615
They can't just...

529
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:22,417
Someone will take
over the project.

530
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:24,221
They can't leave it like this...

531
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,492
We don't know when.

532
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:29,626
Well!...

533
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:32,997
Isn't that special?

534
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,451
Our brother sends them.

535
00:52:52,822 --> 00:52:54,153
They are photographs

536
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:56,154
of our old neighbourhood.

537
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:58,225
He still lives there.

538
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:01,357
Why is she burning them?

539
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:10,234
She doesn't like to save things.

540
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:14,441
She doesn't like to save things...

541
00:53:17,214 --> 00:53:19,582
So tell us about the
movie you're making...

542
00:53:21,686 --> 00:53:23,686
Hum... what would
you like to know?

543
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,955
Who's in it?

544
00:53:27,058 --> 00:53:28,116
Nobody...

545
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:29,626
Nobody big.

546
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:31,428
So why did you choose this house?

547
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:33,693
Well...

548
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,160
I, uh, guess for the same reasons
that you did, I guess!

549
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:43,175
Hum... it's all alone,
it's unto itself...

550
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:50,680
Of course, you thought
that would be different,

551
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:52,043
that you would have neighbours...

552
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:52,919
But you don't...

553
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:54,582
Not yet.

554
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:58,581
Does that suit your character?

555
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,594
My character?

556
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,826
The character in the film

557
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,833
who's supposed to live here.

558
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,834
The person in the film!

559
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,941
Well... the persons who
are supposed to live here

560
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:16,645
are going through a very
strange time in their lives.

561
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:20,949
They have everything they want.

562
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:25,455
Or they have means to have
everything they want...

563
00:54:25,856 --> 00:54:28,658
But they don't know
what they need.

564
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,361
So they try different things...

565
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:35,465
And this house is one of them.

566
00:54:41,074 --> 00:54:42,274
I'm not sure I...

567
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,275
I'm not sure I understand.

568
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:56,088
Well...

569
00:54:57,491 --> 00:55:02,427
Some of the places you see,
you wouldn't think twice about.

570
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,330
They pass right through you.

571
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,132
And then...

572
00:55:08,536 --> 00:55:13,241
For no reason, you
can see a house and...

573
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:19,348
Find yourself wondering what is
going on inside of those walls?

574
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,751
And sometimes, the opportunity
comes to find out.

575
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:27,657
It could be a...

576
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,965
An open door that you're
passing at night...

577
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:42,072
It could be a quick peek into
someone else's family, or...

578
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:45,976
It could be...

579
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:59,323
An invitation to dinner,
though that's rare.

580
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:01,527
You have to have friends...

581
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,441
And other times, you've...

582
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,444
You would find alternatives.

583
00:56:28,056 --> 00:56:29,285
Am I keeping you

584
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,691
from work?

585
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:34,992
It's just that I have

586
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:36,297
an early appointment.

587
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:40,959
Ah...

588
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:43,664
So are you interested?

589
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:47,176
We will talk.

590
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,380
I... I will... I think so.

591
00:56:50,382 --> 00:56:52,684
We'll talk and
we'll let you know.

592
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:55,786
Okay... well, by tomorrow?

593
00:56:58,591 --> 00:56:59,590
I think so.

594
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:12,932
Does that hurt?

595
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:14,438
A bit.

596
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:17,543
What I'm doing is freezing them.

597
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:21,248
It should kill the warts
after a few applications.

598
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:23,748
Will they spread?

599
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:25,551
It's difficult to say.

600
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:27,713
I touch them all day,

601
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:28,822
I've never had one.

602
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:30,616
I suppose I'm immune.

603
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:34,354
Warts are very mysterious.

604
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:43,864
What happens if
you just leave them?

605
00:57:45,074 --> 00:57:46,474
They grow.

606
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:50,477
They may spread.

607
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:52,679
I've had people in here

608
00:57:52,683 --> 00:57:55,043
with warts covering
their entire sole.

609
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:58,352
It can get complicated.

610
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,330
Do you recognise me?

611
00:58:10,202 --> 00:58:11,601
Of course.

612
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,266
Ah...

613
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:20,444
Did that hurt?

614
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:32,859
These were taken by a friend.

615
00:58:47,576 --> 00:58:49,206
This is your bedroom?

616
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:50,970
Yeah.

617
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:06,653
These don't show

618
00:59:06,664 --> 00:59:07,894
too much of the background.

619
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:13,437
How are you two holding up?

620
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,939
All right.

621
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,440
Is this okay?

622
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:20,643
It's important to be staying

623
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:21,844
somewhere where you feel comfortable.

624
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:26,549
Because you may not feel it,

625
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:27,853
but you're in a state of shock.

626
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:30,155
I feel it.

627
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:57,383
To Noah!

628
00:59:57,587 --> 00:59:58,986
For the guidance

629
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:00,487
and tremendous care

630
01:00:00,623 --> 01:00:02,022
he's given us

631
01:00:02,124 --> 01:00:04,024
in this time of need.

632
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:05,225
To Noah!

633
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:16,239
It doesn't always work this way.

634
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:17,841
What do you mean?

635
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:20,143
That the claim comes through.

636
01:00:21,146 --> 01:00:23,046
Especially in a situation

637
01:00:23,146 --> 01:00:24,545
as complicated as yours.

638
01:00:24,649 --> 01:00:26,549
It did and we're celebrating!

639
01:00:32,557 --> 01:00:34,556
Sometimes, people are...

640
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:37,661
Are surprised by their policies.

641
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:41,665
They're not covered
for what they thought.

642
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:44,868
I'm stuck in the middle.

643
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:47,172
I didn't sell them the insurance,

644
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,577
I'm just there
when they need it...

645
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,580
To adjust the claim.

646
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:58,083
What are you saying, Noah?

647
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,524
I'm saying that sometimes I feel
that I come off as the bad guy

648
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:07,328
because some person...

649
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:12,664
The person who sold you
the policy jerked you around!

650
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:17,639
I'm just there

651
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,040
to clean up the mess.

652
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,708
But you cleaned up the mess
in our case?

653
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,451
Yes, I cleaned it up.

654
01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:31,883
Noah...

655
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:36,830
Might I just make a suggestion..
a bit of advice.

656
01:01:36,856 --> 01:01:38,483
Listen, you can't go around carrying

657
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,461
the weight of the world

658
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:40,363
on your shoulders!

659
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:41,965
It's just a job!

660
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,069
These people's lives...

661
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:47,871
People will always have their lives!

662
01:01:58,685 --> 01:01:59,884
Come on, boys...

663
01:02:01,954 --> 01:02:03,421
We're supposed
to be celebrating!

664
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:07,088
Noah, come on...

665
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:10,027
Come on.

666
01:02:12,633 --> 01:02:14,032
All right...

667
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:18,237
My turn to make a toast.

668
01:02:21,143 --> 01:02:23,243
To Tim and Lorraine...

669
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:28,949
For taking on a great policy.

670
01:02:33,355 --> 01:02:36,758
And for deserving exactly
what you were covered for.

671
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:39,294
Yes!

672
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:42,564
It's so warm...

673
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:44,565
Oh! Oh!

674
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:46,567
Come on!

675
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,069
Hum!

676
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:52,476
It's so warm... so warm!

677
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:55,078
Hum!

678
01:02:55,181 --> 01:02:57,081
Ooh!

679
01:03:10,631 --> 01:03:14,232
You seem to be
getting the wrong idea.

680
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,432
I'm not upset.

681
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:16,634
Not at all.

682
01:03:17,136 --> 01:03:18,936
In fact, I'm thanking you.

683
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:22,372
For what?

684
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:25,312
For bringing this out into the open.

685
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:34,445
You see, when I was first
appointed to this job,

686
01:03:34,456 --> 01:03:36,687
I used to think I was alone.

687
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:39,392
Alone?

688
01:03:40,095 --> 01:03:41,420
In what?

689
01:03:43,331 --> 01:03:45,767
In feeling, on occasion...

690
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:51,140
Aroused by some of the materials

691
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:53,176
I was expected to classify.

692
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:55,045
It used to disturb me.

693
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:59,281
Then when Tyler told me about

694
01:03:59,283 --> 01:04:00,415
what he saw you doing,

695
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,820
I suddenly felt liberated.

696
01:04:05,122 --> 01:04:06,151
What you acknowledged

697
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:07,292
was healthy...

698
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:09,918
Of course, it's exciting material!

699
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:14,430
It's our job is to make sure

700
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,827
that no one else sees it,

701
01:04:18,337 --> 01:04:20,697
we might as well preserve
it for our own pleasure.

702
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,536
I'm not doing it for myself.

703
01:04:24,644 --> 01:04:25,973
Even if it's for your husband,

704
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:26,779
for his friends,

705
01:04:27,982 --> 01:04:29,281
for your friends...

706
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,644
That's how I'd like you
to consider me...

707
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,254
As a friend.

708
01:04:42,664 --> 01:04:44,155
It's for my sister.

709
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,570
What do you mean?

710
01:04:50,173 --> 01:04:52,274
She likes to know what I do.

711
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:54,967
She always has.

712
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:58,076
She's my sister.

713
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:03,818
When I was at school, she always
wanted to know what I learned.

714
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,419
I'd tell her.

715
01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:11,628
That way, we'd learn it together.

716
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:14,631
She didn't go to school.

717
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:16,232
She's older than me.

718
01:05:16,635 --> 01:05:18,535
She had to stay home.

719
01:05:22,743 --> 01:05:24,843
That's how things are...

720
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:28,347
Where I'm from.

721
01:05:30,684 --> 01:05:33,248
She... watches your tapes?

722
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,656
You see, it's very strange

723
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:39,859
what we do here.

724
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:41,019
Very...

725
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:45,160
Difficult to explain.

726
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:51,970
Since I started taping, she
can actually see what we cut,

727
01:05:52,174 --> 01:05:55,203
what we don't allow to
other people to watch.

728
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,572
So, when I take
these tapes home

729
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:05,018
and she watches the decisions
I am making, she's very proud.

730
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:19,462
We all have impulses,
just admit that.

731
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:22,566
To you?

732
01:06:23,973 --> 01:06:24,698
Yes.

733
01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:27,238
Why?

734
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,459
Hi, Louise.

735
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:42,662
Night shift?

736
01:06:43,664 --> 01:06:45,664
You're working late tonight too
Mr. Render?

737
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,167
Work never stops.

738
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:54,373
You know, Mr. Render,
I hear them talking about you.

739
01:06:56,176 --> 01:06:57,175
Who?

740
01:06:57,678 --> 01:06:58,777
The people here.

741
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:01,711
They think you're an angel.

742
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:05,318
I do the best I can.

743
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,921
But you really
spend time with them.

744
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,928
You don't have to
visit at all hours...

745
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,132
These people are
in a state of shock.

746
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:21,635
Their whole lives
have been uprooted.

747
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:24,738
Some of them don't
even fully realise

748
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,840
the extent of what's
happened to them

749
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:27,843
and they...

750
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:30,146
They need all the support

751
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:31,248
that we can give them.

752
01:07:36,354 --> 01:07:38,254
You're wonderful, Mr. Render.

753
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:02,081
Don't you think?

754
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:04,482
If you stay at the motel,

755
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:05,380
we'll get a discount.

756
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:08,656
They'll still pay for two rooms.

757
01:08:09,157 --> 01:08:12,593
If we stay in one, we'll save
a couple of hundred a day.

758
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:14,598
That's above and beyond the fee.

759
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,500
I don't like the idea.

760
01:08:21,505 --> 01:08:22,864
What don't you like?

761
01:08:25,107 --> 01:08:27,305
Giving our house to strangers.

762
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,001
But look they're paying for it.

763
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:37,320
People dream about an
opportunity like this, you know?

764
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:17,294
I was afraid you wouldn't be in.

765
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:19,797
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

766
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:20,899
No, it's okay.

767
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:22,101
I'll come back..

768
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:22,904
No, come in.

769
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:23,806
You sure?
-Yes!

770
01:09:34,114 --> 01:09:35,014
You want some coffee?

771
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:35,775
Sure.

772
01:12:14,156 --> 01:12:14,855
Good morning.

773
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:16,558
What are you doing?

774
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:18,761
I do a bit of photography...

775
01:12:19,763 --> 01:12:20,964
It was such a nice image,

776
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:21,865
you lying there...

777
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:23,567
I hope you don't mind.

778
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:28,773
I can make you
copies, if you like.

779
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:36,980
What's going on?

780
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:42,323
You have a very
beautiful family.

781
01:12:45,892 --> 01:12:47,191
Have you made your decison yet?

782
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:07,648
If you could sign as well...

783
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,657
Now, there is one more favour

784
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,459
that we have to ask:

785
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:21,264
If we could have
access to the house

786
01:13:21,267 --> 01:13:22,367
as soon as possible...

787
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:26,768
When?

788
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,269
Well this afternoon.

789
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:31,273
That should be okay

790
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,875
No, we won't be here.

791
01:13:34,478 --> 01:13:36,478
Will there be someone here
to open the door?

792
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:37,580
Hera's sister.

793
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:39,783
It's very special to have a sister.

794
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:41,186
Don't you have a sister?

795
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:42,287
It's very special.

796
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:02,741
A discount?

797
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,545
Maybe that's
too much to ask, but...

798
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:08,246
You realise how much business

799
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,349
you've given us?

800
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:12,250
Quite a bit?

801
01:14:12,453 --> 01:14:13,953
More than quite a bit.

802
01:14:15,456 --> 01:14:17,558
You're the only reason
this place stays open.

803
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:20,459
You're in a great location.

804
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:23,263
I like your staff.

805
01:14:23,465 --> 01:14:24,565
And they like you.

806
01:14:25,467 --> 01:14:26,466
They love you.

807
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:31,572
We love you.

808
01:14:39,682 --> 01:14:40,682
Have you seen these?

809
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:43,284
We put them on our beds.

810
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:46,086
Have you read it?

811
01:14:46,089 --> 01:14:46,788
Yeah.

812
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:53,697
Why don't you read it for me?

813
01:15:06,144 --> 01:15:08,347
''We hope that God will
grant you peace and rest

814
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:09,783
''while you're under our roof.

815
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:13,652
''May this room be
your second home.

816
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:17,960
''May those you love be near you
in thoughts and dreams...

817
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:25,833
Go on.

818
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:33,175
''May the business that
brought you our way prosper.

819
01:15:34,477 --> 01:15:38,574
''May every call you make and every
message you receive add to your joy.

820
01:15:39,482 --> 01:15:40,281
''When you leave,

821
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,750
''may your journey be safe...

822
01:15:42,254 --> 01:15:43,683
''For we are all travellers.

823
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:47,459
''May your stay in our motel be
pleasant for you,

824
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:50,490
''profitable for society...

825
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:54,228
''Helpful for those you meet,

826
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,338
and a joy to those
who know and love you best.''

827
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:07,443
I just try to do my job.

828
01:16:07,947 --> 01:16:09,276
You've done it well.

829
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:11,115
Thank you.

830
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:14,243
It's time this place paid you back,
and you could stay and we could go.

831
01:16:14,353 --> 01:16:15,753
You've got a room.

832
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:16,723
Consider it a gift.

833
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:19,757
Thank you, that's very kind.

834
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:21,028
Noah...

835
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:23,963
You've looked after some
very unhappy people

836
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:26,966
whose lives have been
turned upside down.

837
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:29,971
In the process,
you've looked after us.

838
01:16:31,072 --> 01:16:32,264
Now it's our turn.

839
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:34,371
We're going to look after you.

840
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:40,981
Why do we have
to move everything?

841
01:16:42,284 --> 01:16:42,983
Why not?

842
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:45,687
We'll only be there a week.

843
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,189
You never know.

844
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:50,691
You never know what?

845
01:16:50,994 --> 01:16:52,027
What might happen.

846
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:54,699
What could happen?

847
01:16:56,099 --> 01:16:57,098
Who knows?

848
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:01,730
That's what makes
these things so exciting.

849
01:17:14,454 --> 01:17:16,655
Why would you want
to involve them?

850
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:19,456
They make a nice background.

851
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:24,261
A nice background...

852
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:27,665
Mimi, it's something

853
01:17:27,668 --> 01:17:28,668
that I would like.

854
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,375
I thought of the reason
why people sing in showers.

855
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,481
It's got something to do
with cleaning.

856
01:17:44,085 --> 01:17:46,015
The joy of washing things away.

857
01:17:47,323 --> 01:17:48,423
What do you mean?

858
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:50,985
Dirt...

859
01:17:52,296 --> 01:17:53,096
Hair...

860
01:17:54,898 --> 01:17:56,198
Dead skin...

861
01:18:00,704 --> 01:18:02,568
It makes me happy
just to think about it.

862
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,841
They'll be picked up
and brought back.

863
01:18:15,151 --> 01:18:16,250
What's bothering you?

864
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:18,655
I think it'll be
a great experience.

865
01:18:19,957 --> 01:18:21,758
I almost wish they'd ask me.

866
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:22,859
Why didn't they?

867
01:18:23,362 --> 01:18:24,020
What?

868
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,229
Ask you.

869
01:18:26,632 --> 01:18:27,832
I guess I wasn't right.

870
01:18:28,034 --> 01:18:28,733
For what?

871
01:18:29,735 --> 01:18:30,935
For what they needed.

872
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:33,168
So you rent them out instead?

873
01:18:34,775 --> 01:18:37,878
He's offered you a good price,
he's given them value.

874
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,379
You like that.

875
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:29,066
Yes?

876
01:19:32,971 --> 01:19:34,271
I'll be right there.

877
01:20:31,033 --> 01:20:31,732
Mr. Render...

878
01:20:32,634 --> 01:20:34,436
What are you doing
out at this time?

879
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,340
I'm going to a fire.

880
01:20:37,642 --> 01:20:38,741
What about you?

881
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:41,144
Finishing off some business.

882
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:43,849
The day is too short
for kind souls,

883
01:20:44,751 --> 01:20:46,251
isn't it, Mr. Render?

884
01:20:48,456 --> 01:20:49,355
I guess.

885
01:20:50,556 --> 01:20:52,558
It's so nice to have
your family with us.

886
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Yeah, they're enjoying it here.

887
01:20:57,363 --> 01:20:58,363
Anything we can do

888
01:20:58,365 --> 01:21:00,098
to make your stay
more memorable,

889
01:21:01,101 --> 01:21:02,200
just let us know.

890
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:05,704
Anything!

891
01:21:23,924 --> 01:21:24,624
This is the woman

892
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:25,726
whose house burned down.

893
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:36,136
Arianne!

894
01:21:38,539 --> 01:21:40,942
I'd like you to meet my family.

895
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:46,147
This is Hera, Simon and Seta.

896
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:48,316
Hello.

897
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,516
Would you like to sit with us?

898
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:53,250
No, thank you.

899
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:56,857
I actually just came in

900
01:21:56,861 --> 01:21:57,861
to look for somebody,

901
01:21:57,864 --> 01:21:59,296
but they're not here, so...

902
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,001
There's still no
word on your claim.

903
01:22:06,503 --> 01:22:08,004
It should be any day now.

904
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,107
Oh, good.

905
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:14,938
It was nice to meet you.

906
01:22:27,228 --> 01:22:28,427
She looks tired.

907
01:22:29,029 --> 01:22:30,829
It's been rough on her.

908
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:33,232
Good morning!

909
01:22:33,335 --> 01:22:33,934
Hello!

910
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,841
I was at the house this morning.

911
01:22:41,944 --> 01:22:43,945
They have done a great job!

912
01:22:44,848 --> 01:22:45,547
That's good.

913
01:22:46,249 --> 01:22:47,549
So what are you having?

914
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:48,609
Coffee.

915
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:49,918
No meal?

916
01:22:50,321 --> 01:22:51,220
We just finished.

917
01:22:52,023 --> 01:22:55,154
So I've come just in time.

918
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,860
These are gifts.

919
01:23:00,997 --> 01:23:02,397
This is for you.

920
01:23:05,803 --> 01:23:07,103
This is for you.

921
01:23:11,509 --> 01:23:12,509
This is for you.

922
01:23:19,317 --> 01:23:20,417
And this is for you.

923
01:24:15,913 --> 01:24:19,379
The next item is this
unusual selection of masks.

924
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:23,488
These can be purchased
separately or as a set.

925
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:56,523
Excuse me!

926
01:24:58,528 --> 01:24:59,227
Miss...

927
01:24:59,396 --> 01:25:03,866
Would you mind if I took a
picture of you standing there?

928
01:25:15,178 --> 01:25:16,714
It's just not fair
to the flowers.

929
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,483
By the way, my name is Greg.

930
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:26,822
What's yours?

931
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:28,524
Susan...

932
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:30,125
Sue...

933
01:25:30,594 --> 01:25:31,327
Suzy...

934
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:33,294
Suzanne...

935
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,532
Which do you prefer?

936
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,200
Suzanne, I guess.

937
01:25:57,024 --> 01:25:57,757
Okay.

938
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:58,858
Okay!

939
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:04,496
This is just a rehearsal,
so let's save our energy.

940
01:26:05,266 --> 01:26:06,900
You cannot move these wedges.

941
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:11,204
These wedges allow the
smooth movement of the camera.

942
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:14,707
Okay, it's really...

943
01:26:14,775 --> 01:26:17,111
So far, it's been going fairly well.

944
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:18,412
And please...

945
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,313
don't eat those.

946
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,116
Those are props.

947
01:26:21,984 --> 01:26:24,420
Only eat them when
the camera is moving.

948
01:26:26,589 --> 01:26:27,924
I think you guys have been...

949
01:26:29,892 --> 01:26:30,625
It's a party,

950
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:32,729
you look kind of pissed off!

951
01:26:33,798 --> 01:26:34,831
Enjoy yourselves!

952
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,935
Otherwise, this doesn't
really make any sense.

953
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:38,438
You look like you're being paid.

954
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:42,742
You are, I know that you are being
paid, but you can't look like it.

955
01:26:43,409 --> 01:26:44,443
Otherwise, this whole thing

956
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:45,912
doesn't make any sense to do.

957
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,714
Gentlemen. This is where
I make my entrance.

958
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:01,490
And this is where I stand...

959
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,393
Excuse me.

960
01:27:02,762 --> 01:27:03,576
Gather around now.

961
01:27:03,602 --> 01:27:05,922
And the candles will all be lit.
And this is the cake.

962
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:08,300
We're all gonna
gather around me

963
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:13,508
and everybody is gonna be very,
very happy and smile a lot.

964
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:16,509
And we're all gonna start singing.

965
01:27:17,276 --> 01:27:18,209
You like cake?

966
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:19,412
Yeah.
-Yeah.

967
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,279
Yeah, me too.

968
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:25,819
Okay, Jerry...

969
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:28,421
Aren't we going to wait?

970
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,124
They called in sick.

971
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,526
There's a flu bug going around.

972
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:34,429
I'm catching it myself...

973
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:36,632
Is three enough?

974
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:38,599
Oh, I think so.

975
01:27:56,019 --> 01:27:56,918
Hey, Bubba.

976
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:02,357
Do you want to play?

977
01:28:15,608 --> 01:28:19,203
You know what would
really turn me on,

978
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,114
really get me going?

979
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,515
Come on, take your cock out.

980
01:28:24,283 --> 01:28:27,219
Yeah, I want you to jerk off...

981
01:28:27,787 --> 01:28:30,422
Come on, show it to me...

982
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:34,191
Look how hard
you could be getting...

983
01:28:36,297 --> 01:28:37,430
Yeah!

984
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:39,132
Just watch me...

985
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:41,701
Watch me vibrate...

986
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:49,043
Yeah!

987
01:28:49,312 --> 01:28:53,214
I'll make it hard
for everybody to see...

988
01:28:54,816 --> 01:28:56,716
Hard! Hard! Hard!

989
01:29:00,758 --> 01:29:02,392
Do me everything!

990
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,159
Hum...

991
01:29:11,269 --> 01:29:19,177
Usually I call it a penis,
but now it's a cock.

992
01:30:19,343 --> 01:30:21,243
So, how did it go?

993
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:26,084
What?

994
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:27,953
The filming.

995
01:30:31,357 --> 01:30:32,390
All right.

996
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:34,994
What did you have to do?

997
01:30:35,862 --> 01:30:36,861
Nothing.

998
01:30:43,469 --> 01:30:45,470
Where did you spend the day?

999
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:49,273
Here.

1000
01:30:54,381 --> 01:30:56,281
With all your needy people.

1001
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,029
There was one couple...

1002
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:13,534
That had photographs.

1003
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:17,638
It makes things easier.

1004
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:19,574
Why?

1005
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:24,747
It just gives you a
place to start with.

1006
01:31:28,654 --> 01:31:30,254
We didn't have pictures...

1007
01:31:42,368 --> 01:31:44,268
But you started with us.

1008
01:31:54,482 --> 01:31:55,316
I won't be late.

1009
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,519
Are they in the motel?

1010
01:31:59,088 --> 01:31:59,678
Who?

1011
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:03,854
The people you see.

1012
01:32:06,061 --> 01:32:06,994
Yeah.

1013
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:09,061
What happened today?

1014
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:11,565
Fire...

1015
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,669
Family?

1016
01:32:17,373 --> 01:32:18,240
Sort of.

1017
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:30,482
I will rock you I will

1018
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:54,030
I will rock you
I will rock you

1019
01:35:54,108 --> 01:35:59,512
the boy has sat upon his lap

1020
01:36:01,051 --> 01:36:02,050
Hi!

1021
01:36:08,059 --> 01:36:12,086
These are a few of
my favourite things...

1022
01:36:12,163 --> 01:36:16,497
The boy has wings

1023
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:19,867
hum hum hum hum hum

1024
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:28,306
Now you've come in
just at the moment

1025
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:31,917
that the character in the film,

1026
01:36:32,384 --> 01:36:34,420
the person who is
supposed to live here,

1027
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:38,892
decides that he is
gonna stop playing house.

1028
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:45,698
So...

1029
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:55,608
Are you in?

1030
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:01,346
Or out?

1031
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:13,256
I will rock you I will

1032
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:05,751
Is that your house?

1033
01:38:09,948 --> 01:38:10,848
Where's your husband?

1034
01:38:15,564 --> 01:38:18,297
I work for your
insurance company okay.

1035
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,400
I'm an adjuster.
