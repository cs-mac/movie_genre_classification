00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:55,100
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,562
Hello, sir! I brought the samples!

3
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:30,218
You're always just on time.

4
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,829
Kim Mi-poong, you're the best!

5
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,848
You should check the samples.

6
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,235
You never made a mistake before.

7
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,226
It's obviously just right.

8
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,604
You should still check.

9
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,692
Mi-poong, out of the clothes here, which one of them do you think will sell the best?

10
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,792
You have good sense! Pick it again this time.

11
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:50,523
That one.

12
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,078
The length is just right, and the quality of the

13
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,439
material is good, so it would be flexible to wear.

14
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:56,758
You think so?

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,546
Then I should hang up this dress in the front.

16
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,622
By the way, did you move yet?

17
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,835
I'm moving tomorrow.

18
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,046
I'll finally be able to leave the semi-basement!

19
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,071
Is that so?

20
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,909
You worked so hard to make money. You've succeed!

21
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:15,223
Congratulations!

22
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you! Have a good day!

23
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:18,211
Bye!

24
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:22,873
I ate so well. I think I overate. I'm so full.

25
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:25,405
I'm glad the food was to your liking.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,955
The food was delicious, but why did you make

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,177
so much? It must have been tiring for you.

28
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,389
We could just have simply ate some noodles.

29
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,590
It wasn't tiring at all.

30
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,983
The maid did everything.

31
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,024
If I was struck by money like you were, I wouldn't do the household chores either.

32
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:46,577
But is the Elder not home?

33
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,289
He went out to attend a meeting today.

34
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,752
Maid!

35
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,400
Aren't you going to prepare the fruits and tea?

36
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,915
-Hold on a minute. -Sure.

37
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:00,683
Money really is good!

38
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:02,921
Chung-ja looks so nice!

39
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:07,399
But isn't the Elder's family in North Korea?

40
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:11,110
I heard you can give your inheritance to your family in North Korea nowadays.

41
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:14,824
He has no family in North Korea. They're all dead.

42
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,300
Really?

43
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,352
-Honey, I'm home- -Honey, you're home!

44
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,378
These are my friends. Say hello.

45
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,095
This is my husband Jo Dal-ho.

46
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,478
Oh, hello.

47
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,639
Hello.

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,016
Enjoy yourselves comfortably.

49
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,072
Excuse me.

50
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:42,753
Go ahead and talk amongst yourselves. I'll be back!

51
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,652
Is he really Chung-ja's husband?

52
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:52,189
Doesn't he look ten years younger than her?

53
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:55,089
Not ten years. He's only two years younger than her.

54
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,854
Chung-ja must have saved a country in her past life.

55
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,853
When she was little, she was shabby and had a difficult life.

56
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,290
Now she has a young, handsome husband and a 100 million dollar inheritance.

57
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:07,017
She must have saved the country ten times in her past life.

58
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,155
Your friends are here, so why did you ask me to come home early?

59
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:18,857
Just...You can meet my friends.

60
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,354
What's the point of me meeting your friends?

61
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,678
It's not like we're going to play patty cake.

62
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,048
I wanted to show off my handsome husband.

63
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,923
It's too wasteful for me to see you alone.

64
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,549
Come on. Don't say that anywhere else.

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,559
I'm not a young man anymore.

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,616
To other people, I'm just an old man.

67
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,871
How can you be just an old man?

68
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:50,009
You're still a handsome and firm young man!

69
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,904
Seriously.

70
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,598
You're like a little kid.

71
00:04:58,658 --> 00:04:59,658
We ate a lot.

72
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:05,903
Why are you already leaving? You don't have to mind my husband.

73
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:09,199
Since we know where you live, we can visit again next time.

74
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,430
You're right. Visit often.

75
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,047
But your husband isn't acting like a bachelor outside, is he?

76
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,761
You should keep an eye on him.

77
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:24,450
If he does, I'll kill him. I'll kill him slowly and painfully.

78
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:27,711
Oh my goodness! He would be too scared to cheat on you!

79
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,295
-We're leaving. Don't come out. -Bye!

80
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,524
I'll take you guys home.

81
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,095
-Oh, really? Okay! -No, go ahead.

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,336
I have somewhere to go.

83
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,491
-Okay then. Bye, Geum-sil. -See you again!

84
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,433
-Come out to our gatherings! -Bye!

85
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,711
Hello, Nam-yi.

86
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:17,301
Jang-go bought a lot of meat to celebrate his

87
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,482
winning today. So hurry up and come home.

88
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,159
All right. I'm on my way home right now.

89
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,047
That's right.

90
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:31,941
I have Jang-go and Jang-soo, so why should I feel pathetic or be envious?

91
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:35,914
Mister!

92
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,855
-Cheers! -Cheers!

93
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,547
It feels so refreshing!

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Grandma, eat a lot of meat.

95
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:58,825
All right.

96
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,818
Mom, you eat, too.

97
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,124
Aunt, you eat a lot, too.

98
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,729
You should eat a lot since you worked hard.

99
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,111
Mom, you should eat a lot. I'll eat, too.

100
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,136
Okay.

101
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:14,680
The meat is tastier since Jang-go bought it.

102
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:20,443
So you bought this meat today because you won the case?

103
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:21,993
Yes, grandma.

104
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:26,427
I see. Then you don't have to worry about the office rent anymore?

105
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,410
That's right!

106
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,924
The money hasn't come in yet, but it will.

107
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,465
Mom, eat a lot!

108
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,164
Okay!

109
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:42,794
But what about Jang-soo?

110
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,283
Aunt, did you call Jang-soo?

111
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,422
He said he'll be here soon.

112
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,288
Oh, Jang-soo is here! Hurry up and come sit here!

113
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,406
We have the pork belly you like so much.

114
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,475
We have a guest.

115
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,508
Who?

116
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,649
Hold on.

117
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:06,563
Come in.

118
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,172
Hello.

119
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,812
What are you doing here, Ms. Song?

120
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:24,343
Oh, are you the owner of the beauty parlor on the side of the street?

121
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,221
That's right! It's her!

122
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,255
But what are you doing here?

123
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:31,313
Jang-soo.

124
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:35,781
Everyone, don't be surprised.

125
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,273
Joo-ri is my girlfriend.

126
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:41,844
I'm going to marry her.

127
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,625
Please have a seat first.

128
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,369
You can't sit down!

129
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,891
What?

130
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,956
What? You're going to get married? To who?

131
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,251
With Ms. Song?

132
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:09,469
Yes.

133
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,946
-Jang-soo, you crazy fool! -Geum-sil!

134
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:13,164
Hold on.

135
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,721
Ms. Song, aren't you over forty years old?

136
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,009
Aunt!

137
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:22,101
She's not over forty! She's exactly forty years old! She's only forty years old!

138
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,347
She's only forty years old?

139
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,374
Do you think that makes any sense?

140
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:33,929
Do you not know how old Jang-soo is?

141
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,525
She knows I'm twenty-nine years old.

142
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,152
But what does age gap have to do with anything?

143
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:40,906
Our hearts are important.

144
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,978
And I'll be thirty soon!

145
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,407
How dare you, you crazy fool!

146
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,072
-Mom! -Geum-sil!

147
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:51,595
This is ridiculous!

148
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,212
Oh my goodness.

149
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,561
Look here, Ms. Song.

150
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,174
You must really have no conscience.

151
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:06,306
How dare you come after our pure baby Jang-soo?

152
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:10,124
We have nothing else to say to you. Get out of this house at once. Get out!

153
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,351
Grandma, why are you doing this to my Joo-ri?

154
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:16,904
-What? -And grandma, I'm not a baby! I'm twenty-nine years old!

155
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:21,744
Oh my goodness, you crazy idiot!

156
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,751
-You idiot! -Gosh, seriously!

157
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:32,665
All this time, you cut my hair for free and were really friendly to me.

158
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:37,134
Was that all because you wanted to seduce Jang-soo?

159
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,830
Get out of my house at once!

160
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,300
Get out! Get out at once!

161
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,736
It's not like that!

162
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:46,950
Joo-ri! Song Joo-ri!

163
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,048
Joo-ri!

164
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,651
-Oh my gosh. -This is ridiculous!

165
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,441
-Oh my goodness. -Mom!

166
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,040
Joo-ri! Song Joo-ri!

167
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,306
Joo-ri!

168
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,017
Wasn't Ms. Song married once?

169
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:34,556
That's not all. She has two kids, too. A son and a daughter.

170
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
What?

171
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,254
She has kids?

172
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,712
Are you serious?

173
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,234
Yes!

174
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,728
My goodness.

175
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,446
She has kids.

176
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,578
Is Jang-soo out of his mind?

177
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,287
Jang-soo is out of his mind. He's crazy!

178
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:50,993
Oh, no.

179
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,164
-Get out! How dare you come inside! -Mom!

180
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,078
Am I kid? Use your words! Your words!

181
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,767
Yes, yes. Just use your words.

182
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,665
Jang-soo, Ms. Song has kids.

183
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,724
That's not right, Jang-soo!

184
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:22,287
People marry people from different countries, so age gap doesn't really matter.

185
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,579
But what are you going to do about her kids?

186
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,388
Will you raise them?

187
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:27,884
Why? Can't I?

188
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,502
I can raise them!

189
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:30,962
Oh my goodness!

190
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:32,748
Hey, Lee Jang-soo!

191
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,759
Why? If they're the kids of the woman I love, they're my kids, too.

192
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:40,600
And once I get married to Joo-ri, I'm going to tie it up!

193
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,220
I'm not going to have kids!

194
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,814
-Oh my goodness! -What? Tie what up?

195
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,329
That thing! He's going to have that surgery where you can't have kids anymore!

196
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,149
Oh my goodness!

197
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:59,080
Jang-soo, you've gone completely mad!

198
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:05,182
What on earth did that old fox do to him to bewitch him like this? Jang-soo!

199
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:08,001
Grandma, don't talk about her like that!

200
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,565
Joo-ri is the woman I like.

201
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,654
She's the woman I love!

202
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,168
She's the only person who understands my dreams and talents of becoming an actor.

203
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:23,055
She said she would make money and feed me until I succeed.

204
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:28,615
And grandma, Joo-ri didn't bewitch me. I was the one who begged her to date me!

205
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,301
I was the first one to tell her that I like her and

206
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,283
I was the first one to tell her that I love her!

207
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,796
Joo-ri's parents were against us, but I finally

208
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,673
got permission after I knelt before them!

209
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,642
What did you just say?

210
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,407
Die. You should just die instead!

211
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,830
Mom!

212
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,548
Use your words!

213
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:51,892
Is it a crime to love someone?

214
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:57,579
-What did I do so wrong? -Grandma!

215
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,594
Lee Jang-soo, be quiet, will you?

216
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,470
Joo-ri is such a kind woman!

217
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,650
Is it a crime to love someone?

218
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,226
You don't deserve to talk back to me! What are you, a little kid?

219
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,393
Jang-go, do you know about love?

220
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,212
Do you know about love?

221
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,110
You don't know anything.

222
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:28,277
There's no solution for you.

223
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:32,891
If you're going to curse someone, you should curse me! Why curse my nice Joo-ri?

224
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,672
How can he become so crazy?

225
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,442
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

226
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,915
This is all your fault!

227
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,533
Pardon?

228
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,099
Ever since Jang-soo was little, you would only take

229
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:49,486
care of Jang-go and leave Jang-soo out in the dust.

230
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,416
Because of the lack of affection, he fell for an old woman!

231
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,649
Mom, stop it. Geum-sil is upset enough already.

232
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,924
Aren't I telling the truth?

233
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,963
Because you stopped Jang-soo from becoming an actor,

234
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,602
he fell for that old woman who encouraged him on!

235
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:19,805
Mother, you can't say that just because he isn't your son.

236
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,250
If he was your son, would you have allowed him to become a stage actor?

237
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,106
He doesn't make proper money from that, and

238
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:27,003
all he does is stick posters on street lamps!

239
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,891
What? Jang-soo is your son?

240
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:32,242
Jang-soo is my son. My son.

241
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:38,777
He's my son who I raised in my arms while you left him behind to do business!

242
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,406
What are you talking about?

243
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
Fine.

244
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,573
Jang-soo is not my son anymore. He's your son,

245
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,735
so you can take him out of this house and let him do whatever he wants.

246
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,316
He can become a stage actor or get married to that divorcee with children.

247
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:57,526
What did you say? Are you telling me to leave this house?

248
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:02,172
-Mom! That's not what she means! Go to your room!-You!

249
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:07,168
My son bought this house with money he worked hard to make!

250
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:10,988
Who are you to tell me to leave this house!

251
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:15,873
-How dare you tell me to leave! -What's wrong with you?

252
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:32,438
Mommy, hurry up!

253
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:33,464
Okay!

254
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:41,357
It's hot, so be careful.

255
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,026
Here you go.

256
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,704
There you go! Here.

257
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,226
This is okay, right?

258
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,679
Yes, it's perfect!

259
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,605
Yoo-sung, starting from tomorrow, we're going

260
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,529
to live in a house that has a lot of warm water.

261
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:05,846
Really?

262
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,425
Close your eyes, or they'll sting.

263
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,507
The new house that we're moving into isn't a semi-basement

264
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,443
like this one, so there will be plenty of sunshine and wind.

265
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,310
Sounds great, right?

266
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,335
Yes!

267
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,825
You're so cute, Yoo-sung!

268
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,971
Why aren't you sleeping?

269
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,754
I knew you would be like this.

270
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:07,057
After losing your dad in a car accident,

271
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,506
I thought I had lived pretty well.

272
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:17,997
Today he's on my mind a lot.

273
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,838
If your dad had been alive,

274
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,365
I wonder what he would have said about what happened tonight.

275
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,907
You still have me by your side.

276
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,076
I know.

277
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:36,693
Mom.

278
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:40,192
Don't worry about Jang-soo too much.

279
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:43,356
After a few days pass, I'll talk to him about it.

280
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,846
No matter what we tell him right now, he won't listen.

281
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,371
So just let it go.

282
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,451
Okay?

283
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,865
All right.

284
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,684
Mom.

285
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,785
I can't fall asleep thinking about moving tomorrow.

286
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,216
Me, too.

287
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,834
Yoo-sung, you need to hurry up and sleep so that we can

288
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,669
move tomorrow. If you don't sleep, tomorrow won't come.

289
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,447
You're right.

290
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,255
Mom.

291
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,966
You worked so hard all this time.

292
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,082
I didn't do anything.

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,560
Seung-hee, you were the one who worked hard.

294
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:50,748
Grandma, why do you keep calling aunt "Seung-hee?"

295
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,318
Aunt's name is Mi-poong. Kim Mi-poong.

296
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,973
Oh, you're right.

297
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,385
I forgot.

298
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:05,194
But why do you, my smarty-pants, call your aunt "mommy?"

299
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,346
That's because...

300
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,182
That's because...

301
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:15,198
Because I fed you milk, carried you on my back, and bathed you.

302
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,761
I am your mommy, right?

303
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,617
You can call me whatever you want.

304
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,544
What will you do if you never get married because of that?

305
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:24,870
What else will I do?

306
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:30,518
I'll keep living with you and Yoo-sung.

307
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,385
You really can't fall asleep? Huh?

308
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:43,558
One.

309
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
Two.

310
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:48,965
One.

311
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,933
Exhale.

312
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,379
Two.

313
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,222
Elder, when you're exercising, breathing is very important.

314
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:01,778
When you lower your arm, you should exhale like this.

315
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:03,808
Yes, just like that.

316
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,831
When I pull up my arm, I need to inhale?

317
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:10,069
Okay. Inhale.

318
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:12,659
Exhale.

319
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,308
I really hate that song.

320
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,519
Who on earth made that kind of song?

321
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,972
Why is everyone trying to live until they're a hundred years old?

322
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Goodness.

323
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:39,612
I'm so frustrated.

324
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:47,784
"Ask him when I'll naturally be able to go."

325
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,004
Is the green vegetable juice not done yet? Elder is thirsty.

326
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,712
For how much longer are you going to call him "Elder?"

327
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,897
If we decided to serve him as a father, then you should call him father.

328
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,811
Is it so hard to call him father?

329
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:05,732
Why are you getting mad at me over nothing so early in the morning?

330
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,821
This is "nothing?"

331
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,495
You need to call him father so that he'll think of you as his child!

332
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,576
Stop talking nonsense and hurry up!

333
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:21,388
Stop turning on that song.

334
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:23,394
I'm getting sick of it.

335
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:29,820
Do you really want father to live until he's a hundred years old?

336
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,185
Then?

337
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,005
You don't?

338
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:37,787
Well...

339
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,919
I just heard it's not good if you live for so long.

340
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,706
They say longevity is a disaster.

341
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,542
Don't you read the newspaper?

342
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:52,731
You need to live moderately. That's order.

343
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,435
Stop talking crap!

344
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,294
Crap?

345
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:02,536
Did he just say that I'm talking crap?

346
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,895
Elder, you're thirsty, aren't you?

347
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,763
Drink this.

348
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:23,940
Today, I mixed enough carrots and apples together, so it won't taste bitter.

349
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:25,232
Is that so?

350
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Thank you.

351
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:29,185
Let me try.

352
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
It's good.

353
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:43,706
Father, how's your condition today?

354
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:46,941
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

355
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:52,649
I feel great. Thanks to you, I'll be living for a long time.

356
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:54,615
Yes!

357
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:57,602
Of course!

358
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:01,551
You need to live a long life until you're two hundred years old!

359
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:02,794
Two hundred?

360
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:10,023
It's an insult to tell old people to live for a long time.

361
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,552
But as for me,

362
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,025
I won't ask for more or less.

363
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:23,731
I'm going to live until we're unified and I can step onto my home country.

364
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:25,999
Of course!

365
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,995
You need to be healthy until then, so drink up.

366
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:31,701
All right.

367
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,037
I'll drink it.

368
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,312
Oh, my. So is he saying he'll live over a hundred

369
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:43,404
years old if the countries aren't unified?

370
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,606
When on earth will that unification happen?

371
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:02,513
Mom!

372
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,021
Did you talk to grandfather about it?

373
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,576
Talk to him about what?

374
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,931
About buying me a fashion shop in Cheongdam-dong.

375
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:14,035
Cheongdam-dong fashion shop, my foot.

376
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,616
I sent you to study abroad, but you didn't even graduate. Shop, my foot!

377
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,476
Why do I need to graduate to own a shop? All I need is money!

378
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,787
Oh my goodness! Where did you get your stubbornness from?

379
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:29,816
Mom, I'm really confident about it!

380
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,309
Although I didn't graduate,

381
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,291
but I lived in New York! I have those senses!

382
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,994
What's more important for my career than the fact that I was once a New Yorker?

383
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,003
You didn't even study. You shopped and played around

384
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:45,575
while spending money. Is that part of your career?

385
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:51,731
I had such a hard time gathering money for your expenses when you were living abroad!

386
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,846
Grandfather paid for the tuition.

387
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,817
Tuition wasn't the only thing wasted on you!

388
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:59,004
I borrowed money without your dad or grandfather knowing in

389
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,138
order to cover up for your costs of living as a New Yorker!

390
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,398
That's why I'll pay you back once I make money.

391
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:08,904
Don't even lie.

392
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,412
Mom! Shop! Shop! Mom! Shop!

393
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,347
What if grandfather finds out you didn't even graduate?

394
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:19,763
If you get on grandfather's bad side, it will be the end of you!

395
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,161
If you don't have any brains, the least you should have is some tact!

396
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,090
Goodness. Who would know how I feel?

397
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,756
No one else will know that I didn't graduate as long as you and Hee-dong stay silent.

398
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,802
The two of you are the only ones who know.

399
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:34,232
My gosh!

400
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,988
Go and wake up your brother for breakfast!

401
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:44,824
If it hadn't been for Hee-dong, mom wouldn't have found out I hadn't graduated either.

402
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:47,552
Shit!

403
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:00,123
Jo Hee-dong.

404
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,377
Jo Hee-dong, you better wake up.

405
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:11,820
How can you act so rudely to your big brother?

406
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,699
Brother, my foot.

407
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,434
You rag-like blabbermouth!

408
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:18,538
Oh, really?

409
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:20,468
Rag-like?

410
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:24,059
You went to go study abroad after begging and

411
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,531
begging the adults that you wanted to study design.

412
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:32,293
Grandfather and father have no clue yet that you didn't graduate, do they?

413
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,335
Grandfather! Father! She-

414
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:38,703
Don't do it! Don't do it!

415
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,993
Watch what happens if you tell them!

416
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,749
Please don't do that.

417
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,000
If grandfather and dad finds out, they'll be so disappointed.

418
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:51,945
Please!

419
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,544
Big brother.

420
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,154
Big brother.

421
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,015
Okay. Go get me some water.

422
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,031
I'm very thirsty.

423
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,070
Got it.

424
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:14,312
Watch.

425
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:17,715
I'll get you back.

426
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,202
(Fasting)

427
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,079
Jang-soo said he's not going to eat.

428
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:48,527
Why not? If he doesn't feel like eating, he should

429
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,721
have some of this beansprout soup at least.

430
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:51,976
The thing is...

431
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,171
he's not just saying he won't eat.

432
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,975
He said he would rather die of starvation if we don't allow him to marry Ms. Song.

433
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,820
He said he would go on a hunger strike until we give them permission.

434
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:03,458
What? A hunger strike?

435
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,722
He can starve to death if he wants. He can get married to Ms. Song if he wants.

436
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,568
He's not my son anymore, so tell him to do whatever he wants.

437
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:16,413
Are you saying that towards me?

438
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:18,882
Fine.

439
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:22,015
Go ahead and pig out by yourself.

440
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,663
If Jang-soo starves to death, so will I.

441
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:28,242
Mom.

442
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,288
Why is she acting like this now?

443
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:37,319
Don't mind him. Jang-soo will stop soon enough.

444
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,635
It just doesn't make sense!

445
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,046
What about Jang-go?

446
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,919
He went out early to the police station for work.

447
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,847
Oh, it must be because of that grandmother yesterday.

448
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:52,061
Every day he only works on such small cases.

449
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:54,894
Jang-go needs to do something that will make money.

450
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:00,520
Hi, Young-soon.

451
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:02,479
Why are you calling me so early in the morning?

452
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:04,453
What?

453
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,218
Really?

454
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,477
Of course he can take that case!

455
00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:13,455
Okay, then bring him so my son's office later today.

456
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,856
I'll send you the address through a text message.

457
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,583
Okay. See you later!

458
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,796
Who is it? Did Jang-go get a new case?

459
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:24,374
My friend's brother-in-law runs some kind of business,

460
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,977
but the product he has been creating for over ten years

461
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,999
has been copied and released by another company.

462
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:32,085
Oh my goodness! So he's going to leave such a big case in Jang-go's hands?

463
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,515
It's a big case?

464
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,875
Of course! Not everyone can handle such a big case!

465
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,765
Those are only cases that can be gotten through lobbying by skillful office managers.

466
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:41,866
Oh my goodness!

467
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:43,741
I shouldn't just sit around like this.

468
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:48,912
Wait for me! Oh my goodness! It was such a big case? Oh my.

469
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:51,109
(Seoul Law Office)

470
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,285
Thank you for introducing such a big case to Jang-go.

471
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:59,171
If this works out well, make sure to buy a big meal for your friend.

472
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,547
That's not all.

473
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:02,483
I'll buy two or three meals.

474
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:04,319
Thank you so much, Young-soon.

475
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,079
It has to work out well.

476
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:09,278
Jang-go is very competent. It'll definitely work out well.

477
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,022
Maybe he can't find this place.

478
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:15,404
Why don't you call him?

479
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:17,804
I got a call.

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Hello.

481
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,009
Okay, I understand.

482
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:29,398
What do we do?

483
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,046
He decided to leave his lawsuit up to Jangaenggo Law Firm.

484
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,373
It's such an important matter for the company.

485
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:39,952
I'm so sorry.

486
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,398
No, it's fine.

487
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,366
I hope it gets solved nicely.

488
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm sorry, Geum-sil.

489
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,145
I'll call you next time.

490
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:58,147
"Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear!

491
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:03,310
Daddy bear is fat!

492
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:08,241
Mommy bear is skinny!

493
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:13,024
Baby bear is so pretty!

494
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,852
Shrug, shrug. You are growing tall!"

495
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,659
I wasted your time. I'm sorry.

496
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:30,382
Mom, it's fine.

497
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:33,046
Aunt, I'm going to the court.

498
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:34,903
-Bye. -Bye.

499
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,523
So what if he has skills? He has no connections.

500
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,497
Everyone looks down on him because this office is so small.

501
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:50,221
He needs to either get married to a wealthy woman or hire a skillful office manager.

502
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,210
Jang-go's skills are too wasteful to be stuck in here.

503
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,012
In order to try something, he needs an opportunity!

504
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,006
The truth is, a matchmaker introduced him to a wealthy business

505
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,818
family, but Jang-go said no, so we quit the whole thing.

506
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:07,101
Geum-sil, you should have still pushed him to do it!

507
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,473
Jang-go would become big if someone just supported him!

508
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,647
Try this just once.

509
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:22,115
-(Fasting) -Just take one bite.

510
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,438
This is the chicken you like the most. Have some.

511
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,492
Grandma, don't test my love.

512
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:31,624
I'm not going to eat it even if I die.

513
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:33,695
You can just pretend you didn't eat.

514
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:40,586
I'll take this secret to my grave. So just take one bite.

515
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,002
Good. That's it.

516
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,673
Really, grandma?

517
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,647
-You really have to take this secret to the grave. Okay? -Yes.

518
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:56,232
Don't ever say that you're going to tie it up again.

519
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:02,552
The day you tie that up will be my death day. Got it?

520
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,443
Eat slowly.

521
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:12,146
What is it?

522
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,490
Oh, my.

523
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,126
I'm the one who's eating this.

524
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,501
Jang-soo didn't even take a bite.

525
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,285
Darn it! Grandma, I said I wouldn't eat it!

526
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:33,732
Gosh, seriously!

527
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:39,200
Miss, hold on.

528
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:42,147
Come on, miss!

529
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:45,537
Starting from today, this is our house! Why aren't you

530
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:47,932
letting us go inside? Hurry up and open the door for us!

531
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:51,675
How many times do I have to tell you that this house is put up for auction?

532
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:55,334
This is our house, so how can it be put up for auction?

533
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:58,454
Look!

534
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,702
-(New House Contract) -It says Kim Mi-poong right here.

535
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,993
This is our house under my name Kim Mi-poong!

536
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:09,041
Oh, dear. You were conned.

537
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,509
Conned?

538
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:13,235
This house has been put up for auction ever since the owners were

539
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,001
indebted to the bank. You were conned into signing a fake contract.

540
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:18,821
That can't be.

541
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:23,150
My close friend introduced me to this house! This can't be!

542
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:25,875
Then your close friend must have teamed up with the con-artists.

543
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:27,251
Ma'am, go inside.

544
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:28,868
Teamed up?

545
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,219
That's impossible.

546
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:39,446
The phone number you have just dialed is a non-existent number.

547
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,193
What's wrong with her phone? What's going on?

548
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:47,860
-The phone number you have just dialed is a non-existent number. -This can't happen!

549
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:49,372
What on earth happened?

550
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,129
Did we really get conned?

551
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:54,095
No, mom.

552
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:58,370
Let me go meet my friend. Wait right here.

553
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,591
It's nearby, so I'll be back soon.

554
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:15,375
Open the door! Come out!

555
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:17,938
Open up!

556
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,933
No one lives there. She moved yesterday.

557
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,430
Where did she go?

558
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,309
I wouldn't know that.

559
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,028
Anyways, no one lives there, so stop making a ruckus.

560
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:52,809
We were both from North Korea, and she sympathized with me about living a hard life.

561
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,240
She said we should try our best together.

562
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:03,160
How can she do this to a fellow countrywoman?

563
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,305
I'm out.

564
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,063
I got it!

565
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:08,931
Three hundred more.

566
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:15,954
I'll see that and raise you a thousand.

567
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:23,084
A thousand? Deal.

568
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,509
Jangddaeng.

569
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,017
Hold on.

570
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:33,591
38 gwangddaeng.

571
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,696
Police! Don't move!

572
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:45,923
Damn it!

573
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:56,004
Ma'am. Ma'am, hurry up and come out.

574
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:01,352
Hurry up and come out, ma'am.

575
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:05,551
I didn't do anything. All I did was watch.

576
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,049
Hurry up and get up.

577
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:09,282
Let's go.

578
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,047
Oh, no.

579
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:13,953
-My money. -Seriously.

580
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,546
-Hurry up and come with me. -My money!

581
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:18,278
-Hurry. -Forget it!

582
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:19,892
Let go of my arm!

583
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:29,884
Who is it?

584
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,501
Hello?

585
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:36,747
Yes, I'm Ma Chung-ja. Who is this?

586
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:40,337
Pardon? The police station?

587
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,954
Why are you calling me?

588
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:45,131
Are you Chun Gwi-ok's daughter?

589
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,852
Chun Gwi-ok?

590
00:39:49,196 --> 00:39:51,921
No. I don't know such a person.

591
00:39:57,384 --> 00:40:00,821
I'm not her daughter! I don't know who she is!

592
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,782
Chung-ja.

593
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:06,167
It's me, your mom.

594
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:11,625
Who is my mom? I told you not to call me again!

595
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:16,548
I don't think of you as my mom, so you shouldn't think of me as your daughter either.

596
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,774
Chung-ja, just once.

597
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:21,424
Help me out just this once.

598
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:27,103
I really think I'm going to be stuck eating bean rice this time, Chung-ja.

599
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:30,471
Go ahead and pig out on bean rice.

600
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,430
Long time ago, we starved because of you.

601
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:36,782
-You should be grateful they're at least giving you bean rice! -What?

602
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,172
Are you really done talking, you wench?

603
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:44,530
That way you'll learn your lesson. How else will you fix that bad habit of yours? Huh?

604
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:46,695
Fine. Forget it.

605
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:48,955
Forget it, you little wench!

606
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:55,974
If you come out like this, I'll call that Elder of yours.

607
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,938
You're going to call who?

608
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,917
What right do you have to contact him?

609
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:07,508
You serve him so well. I deserve to get this much help from him.

610
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:12,433
You better not. You better not call Elder!

611
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:14,793
Why are you getting angry?

612
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:17,584
Are you getting angry because I'll tell him

613
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,689
the reason why you're being so good to him?

614
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,276
You serve that Elder who is just a distant relative so

615
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:29,358
well, but you ignore your own mother who calls you for help! You terrible wench!

616
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:31,946
You think I don't know your ulterior motives?

617
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:36,678
All right! All right! I got it! I'm coming!

618
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:41,942
She's my enemy, not my mom!

619
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:47,743
It would've been better if I had been born as an orphan.

620
00:41:58,181 --> 00:41:59,181
That's right.

621
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:03,892
Geum-sil said her son is a lawyer.

622
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:17,946
He needs to either get married to a wealthy woman or hire a skillful office manager.

623
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:21,313
Jang-go's skills are too wasteful to be stuck in here.

624
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:24,603
In order to try something, he needs an opportunity!

625
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,845
(Blue Thread Red Thread. Name: Lee Ji-hee)

626
00:42:51,595 --> 00:42:53,156
Hi, Chung-ja.

627
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:02,465
She said there were no problems with the house.

628
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:06,021
My friend was from North Korea, too.

629
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,729
That's why I trusted her.

630
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:11,457
In South Korea, you can't just sign a contract

631
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:13,465
for a house just because you know the person.

632
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:16,485
When you want to buy a house, you need to get a certified

633
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,743
copy of register and check for collateral security.

634
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,579
You need to get proper help from a real estate agent.

635
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:25,102
Many people become conned because they try to save money like you.

636
00:43:25,642 --> 00:43:28,314
Mr. Detective, please help me out.

637
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:31,850
That money was all I had.

638
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,322
Gosh. People should help each other out, not con each other like this.

639
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,786
Then sue your friend first.

640
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:41,915
Sue?

641
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,613
You need to sue her so that we can catch her.

642
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:49,455
First, hire a lawyer, and go through the lawsuit process.

643
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,579
Sir...

644
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:09,871
Chung-ja! My daughter! This time, it is really unfair for me!

645
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:11,321
Hello.

646
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:12,727
Who are you?

647
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,363
I'm Chung-ja's friend, Hwang Geum-sil.

648
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:19,301
Long time ago when I visited your home, you used to make pancakes for me.

649
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,239
I did?

650
00:44:21,265 --> 00:44:24,566
Oh, dear. I'm getting old now. I can't remember very well.

651
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,144
That happens when you get old.

652
00:44:26,245 --> 00:44:29,297
You can't remember people because you're getting old,

653
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:32,678
but how can you remember those flower cards so well?

654
00:44:32,868 --> 00:44:34,001
What did you say?

655
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,819
She's so mean like this.

656
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:41,517
She doesn't treat me very well.

657
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:45,472
I was dragged to the police station when I didn't do anything wrong, and

658
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:48,916
she doesn't pity me when I'm suffering. All she does is act like this!

659
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:51,813
Do you think our country's policemen have nothing better to

660
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:54,946
do than to catch innocent people and lock them up in jail?

661
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:59,587
Ms. Chun, my son will take care of everything, so just wait a little bit.

662
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:02,682
Hello. I'm Lee Jang-go.

663
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:05,680
You're very handsome!

664
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,118
Jang-go, what does she need to do now?

665
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,976
Just wait here for a moment. Let me go meet the detective-in-charge.

666
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:14,495
Don't worry too much.

667
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,876
My son is a lawyer.

668
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:20,485
A lawyer?

669
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Yes!

670
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,844
He looks like a lawyer! No wonder!

671
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:54,868
Hi, mom.

672
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,790
Seung-hee, where are you right now?

673
00:45:58,493 --> 00:46:01,883
The moving truck dumped all our things here and left.

674
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,859
Hurry up and come here! I'm so scared!

675
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:06,422
What did you say?

676
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:10,880
Mom, I'll be there soon, so just hang on for a little bit.

677
00:46:19,337 --> 00:46:20,337
Thank you.

678
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:22,595
-Are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine.

679
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,070
I'm sorry.

680
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,860
I'm sorry.

681
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:26,885
Wait.

682
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:48,368
Detective!

683
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:59,540
Thank you so much!

684
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,506
Make sure you get re-compensation from my daughter.

685
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:03,649
Yes, ma'am.

686
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:07,267
But I have work to do, so I have to leave first.

687
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:08,696
Yes, go on!

688
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,060
Thank you so much.

689
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,524
You must be busy, but you helped us out.

690
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,209
I'll call you.

691
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:17,657
Okay.

692
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,443
See you at home.

693
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:21,068
-Bye, mom. -Bye.

694
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:32,216
Let me make myself clear. This is definitely the end!

695
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,763
Even if you use Elder to threaten me, it won't work!

696
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,051
This is so embarrassing!

697
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,623
How can you humiliate me in front of my friend and her son?

698
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,640
From now on, don't contact me even if you die.

699
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:52,865
Geum-sil, I'm sorry.

700
00:47:54,231 --> 00:47:55,231
I'll call you later.

701
00:47:56,536 --> 00:47:57,747
Okay.

702
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,741
Fine! I don't need a daughter like you either!

703
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:10,556
If I look for you again, I'll become your daughter, you brat.

704
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:15,932
It's been a while since we met again, but all I did

705
00:48:16,198 --> 00:48:18,334
was trouble you. I'll pay you back later, okay?

706
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:20,715
-Okay. -Bye.

707
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,740
Good-bye.

708
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:44,958
Seung-hee!

709
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:49,302
Mommy!

710
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,958
Yoo-sung, it's okay. There, there. It's all right.

711
00:48:55,747 --> 00:48:57,991
Mom, what happened?

712
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:00,844
Where did the moving center man go?

713
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:05,486
He had other things to move, so he just left us.

714
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,791
He's too much.

715
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:20,712
What are we supposed to do if he just leaves our things here?

716
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,502
It's raining, too.

717
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:37,363
What do we do now?

718
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:05,013
Did the center deposit their money?

719
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:09,278
Yes, sir. They deposited two hundred thousand dollars today.

720
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:12,722
That's why they wanted to call the reporters,

721
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,015
take photos, and release an article, too.

722
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:16,943
Tell them no.

723
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:19,193
Yes, sir.

724
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:33,622
Hello!

725
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,700
Who is he?

726
00:50:35,725 --> 00:50:38,110
He's the lawyer of the law firm in room 305.

727
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,944
Oh, you're a young one.

728
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:45,175
Work hard and pay your rent on time.

729
00:50:45,934 --> 00:50:46,934
Yes, sir!

730
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:48,286
I'll work hard!

731
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:49,528
Good.

732
00:51:34,013 --> 00:51:38,598
Why is it raining again?

733
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:43,020
I'm so sick and tired of it.

734
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,466
Mom, this won't do.

735
00:51:55,419 --> 00:51:58,980
If it keeps raining, Yoo-sung might catch a cold.

736
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,321
You and Yoo-sung should go to a motel.

737
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:04,251
I have money for a motel.

738
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,208
I...

739
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:13,003
hate your father so much.

740
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,916
I can't forgive him.

741
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,122
How can he make us like this...

742
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:25,955
and die by himself?

743
00:52:27,755 --> 00:52:29,209
Is death all there is to it?

744
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,247
Mom.

745
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,215
Why would you say that?

746
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:35,505
Fine.

747
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,989
There's nothing to it.

748
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:42,582
Seung-hee.

749
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,724
The three of us should end it here.

750
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,708
Mom.

751
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:52,501
What are you saying?

752
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:59,102
What's the point of living a worthless life that's lower than dirt?

753
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,219
Mom, what's wrong with you?

754
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,695
Don't be like this. Please!

755
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:11,970
I can't handle this any longer!

756
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:15,717
The three of us should just die together.

757
00:53:16,544 --> 00:53:22,387
We can go meet your brother and your father.

758
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:24,607
What's wrong with you?

759
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:27,170
No matter how hard life is,

760
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,127
you shouldn't say that to me.

761
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:33,304
We worked so hard to come this far!

762
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:40,371
We survived when that wench Kang Mi-Jung fled with our money.

763
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:45,294
We survived when we had to beg on the streets in China.

764
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,301
We even survived...

765
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,161
when we saw father and brother being shot to death in front of our eyes.

766
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:59,943
But now you want to give up?

767
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:03,614
Seung-hee, I...

768
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:09,122
feel like this is all just a dream.

769
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:13,216
A nightmare that I won't be able to wake up from unless I die.

770
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:15,822
Mom, this isn't a dream.

771
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:17,829
This isn't a dream.

772
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:21,311
This is reality that we must overcome!

773
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,465
Seung-hee...

774
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,137
Mom, what did dad say?

775
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:30,964
He told us that we had to live no matter what!

776
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:33,497
We can do this.

777
00:54:34,435 --> 00:54:35,825
We can survive through this.

778
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:39,770
Seung-hee.

779
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:41,888
Mom.

780
00:55:35,653 --> 00:55:36,653
Soon-ok!

781
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:40,107
Soon-ok!

782
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,755
Soon-ok!

783
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,950
Soon-ok.

784
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,853
I don't have much time left.

785
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:06,824
Wait a little bit longer.

786
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:08,881
Just a little longer.

787
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:40,434
Well, the thing is...

788
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,005
I wanted to check if you and I were meant to be.

789
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:46,385
I don't want to!

790
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:50,678
I can't go! I'll never go until I hear that song!

791
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,107
Stay here by yourself.

792
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,435
Don't ask me for help even when a ghost appears.

793
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:06,849
-It's a ghost! -It's a ghost!

794
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:07,874
Help!

795
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:55,165
Come on now. How can you do this in a park?

796
00:58:57,803 --> 00:58:59,956
I'm sorry. We have nowhere else to go.

797
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,159
We'll go as soon as we get a place.

798
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:05,330
-Please let it slide. -If we could, we would.

799
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,927
We're getting complaints that someone set up a home underneath the bridge.

800
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:12,053
Excuse me! Hold on!

801
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:14,396
Mr. Jung?

802
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:17,514
Oh, hi mister!

803
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:18,693
Hi!

804
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:21,191
I'll take care of this matter.

805
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:24,591
-(Home of Free Immigrants. Name: Jung Woo-Jin.) Don't worry.

806
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,110
Then we'll leave it up to you.

807
00:59:36,912 --> 00:59:38,045
Ms. Kim Mi-poong,

808
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:41,407
why didn't you contact me when things have become so terrible for you?

809
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:44,606
I felt so bad that you always had to help us.

810
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:47,487
My goodness. Why would you feel bad about this?

811
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,227
It's my job to make sure you and your family live well in this country.

812
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:55,516
Anyways, I found a temporary place for you to live in, so let's go there first.

813
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:57,898
You'll do as I say, right?

814
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:46,134
-Hello. -Hello.

815
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:48,139
Sorry for troubling you.

816
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:49,978
It's no trouble at all.

817
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,896
It's an empty storage room anyways.

818
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,561
Is Mr. Kim in today?

819
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,177
I would like to say hi.

820
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:56,912
He's not here today.

821
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,467
I'll tell him you said hi.

822
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:00,998
Yes, thank you.

823
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:08,909
I heard your story from Mr. Jung.

824
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:11,560
How did something so terrible happen to you?

825
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,770
You can stay here comfortably until you find a new home.

826
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,425
I don't know how we can pay you back.

827
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,913
Thank you so much.

828
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:27,209
Hi.

829
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:32,592
Go on in.

830
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,201
Hello.

831
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:56,177
She did seem a bit immature, but she was bright and pretty.

832
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,450
Speaking of the devil...

833
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:04,779
Hi, Chung-ja.

834
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,895
I'm so grateful about yesterday that I think I should pay you back.

835
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:13,560
Come on. You don't need to pay me back when we're friends.

836
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:16,444
It's because I'm grateful and sorry to you.

837
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:19,885
Then buy my son dinner.

838
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:23,287
Tomorrow? Sure, that's fine.

839
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:28,474
My son won't have any fun eating with just you and me.

840
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:32,234
Your daughter seems to have a bright personality. Bring her out with you.

841
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:34,994
Okay. See you tomorrow.

842
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:39,623
Yes.

843
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,201
I did well.

844
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:44,974
I'm going to make Hee-Ra into Jang-go's wife.

845
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:50,186
If Jang-go gets support from wealthy in-laws, he'll be able to thrive in his work.

846
01:02:50,779 --> 01:02:53,732
It'll be good for Chung-ja since they'll have a lawyer as a son-in-law.

847
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:00,324
I'm going to create a sturdy support system for Jang-go.

848
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:12,181
Mom, lie down.

849
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:18,693
Yes. This is a much better place than under that bridge.

850
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:25,253
But Yoo-sung, what's wrong?

851
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:28,568
Aunt, does this mean I can't go to kindergarten anymore?

852
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:30,993
Why not? You can go.

853
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,903
It's too far from here.

854
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:36,996
It's not far at all.

855
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:39,568
If you ride a bus, you'll be there in no time.

856
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:45,595
Grandma and I will take you to kindergarten every day.

857
01:03:45,975 --> 01:03:46,975
Really?

858
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:48,553
Of course!

859
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:52,109
Yoo-sung, stay here with grandma.

860
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:56,972
Where are you going?

861
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:03,025
Well, I saw a law office on the third floor of this building.

862
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:06,611
I want to ask if there's a way I can get my money back.

863
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,606
We need to get our money back, mom.

864
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:25,556
Ms. Lawyer, that security deposit is money that we

865
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:29,372
saved over the year while not eating and not shopping.

866
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:30,912
Please.

867
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:33,417
Please help me get that money back.

868
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:35,867
That's so pitiful.

869
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,367
All right. We'll be able to come up with a way together.

870
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,122
Thank you! Thank you, Ms. Lawyer!

871
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,776
But I'm not a lawyer.

872
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:48,596
Excuse me?

873
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:50,951
You're not a lawyer?

874
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:54,326
Isn't this a law firm?

875
01:04:55,013 --> 01:05:00,143
This is a law firm, but the lawyer is away for the moment. I'm the office manager.

876
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:02,404
If you wait here for a moment-

877
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:06,794
Speaking of the devil. He came right on time.

878
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,800
You have a client.

879
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,740
Hello.

880
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,977
What brings you here?

881
01:05:18,826 --> 01:05:21,162
She lost her entire security deposit.

882
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:31,553
(Lawyer Lee Jang-go)

883
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,369
Lawyer Lee Jang-go?

884
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:39,053
Jang-go?

885
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,724
Jang-go?

886
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,260
(Blow Breeze)

887
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:07,943
No! Where the heck did she go?

888
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,873
Your daughter is coming, too, right?

889
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:11,823
Why is she so interested in Hee-Ra?

890
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,084
There was this crazy psycho in the parking lot.

891
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:15,130
Crazy psycho?

892
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:17,873
He blocked me so that I couldn't even move!

893
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:20,224
I have no choice but to get the money from your husband.

894
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,380
I'll pay you back this week along with the interest.

895
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:24,786
-Let go! -What are you doing to my friend?

896
01:06:24,811 --> 01:06:27,689
Jang-go. Fish boy, it's me.

897
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:29,912
Get on. I'll give you a ride.

898
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:31,935
If you don't eat, you'll become a fish.

899
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,927
Kim Seung-hee. You're Seung-hee, aren't you?
