Episode 49

2
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,227
What is it?

3
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:48,466
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

4
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,516
directors, you can turn the tables?

5
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,907
It's not that simple in the real world.

6
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:57,547
Is that your way of doing things?

7
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:01,506
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

8
00:01:01,507 --> 00:01:04,027
and stealing all of his money?

9
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:07,716
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

10
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:09,506
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

11
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,356
I said he was already
dead when I got there!

12
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,956
Sure.

13
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:22,195
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

14
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:23,996
keep telling that story.

15
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,976
Even if

16
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:30,286
you made my father die,

17
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,415
don't ever speak of it.

18
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,037
Ever.

19
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:38,097
If not,

20
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,555
I would have to feel sorry for my father

21
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,036
for being too foolish

22
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,446
to have trusted you so much.

23
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,037
It was for you.

24
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,056
For you,

25
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:01,227
for an ingrate like you,

26
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,627
my father did all the work.

27
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,505
From the beginning, my father prepared

28
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:18,076
all the money and paperwork for you.

29
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:22,845
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

30
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:26,225
if you just let things run its course,

31
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,736
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

32
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:36,495
I understand that you're an engineer,

33
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,516
but what about running the company?

34
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:41,155
Asking me to manage the money is...

35
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,435
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

36
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:45,696
Sangjun, still...

37
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,505
On top of that,

38
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:50,435
I don't know if I need to run the company.

39
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,585
I want to hire someone capable,

40
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,125
and have him run it the way he wants.

41
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,886
I can focus on technology development,

42
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,797
and he can help grow the company.

43
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:07,857
(President Kim Sangjun)

44
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,147
Sangjun.

45
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,136
Sangjun!

46
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,417
Hey, Sangjun!

(Taehu Industry Stock
Certificate, $2.5 Million)

48
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,816
Talk about lying through your teeth.

49
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,515
Who in the world

50
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,125
gives all his money to his friend

51
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,616
when he has his own family,

52
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,666
his own parents, and a wife?

53
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,936
I don't understand, either.

54
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:40,026
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

55
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,067
why he trusted someone like you.

56
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:48,236
What kind of crazy idiot would

57
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:51,787
trust his friend with all his money?

58
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,327
You think I would believe that nonsense?

59
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,277
Taehu Industry's attorney Hong Mungi.

60
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,406
He was one of the people you fired

61
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,877
when Taehu Industry filed for bankruptcy.

62
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,396
You can ask him.

63
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,977
(President Kim Sangjun)

64
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,367
(Registration Certificate,
Owner Jang Taesu)

65
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:26,426
Taesu, what time will you be back?

66
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,895
Well, I think I'll finish around 5.

67
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,765
I'll see you then.

68
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,305
I have something to tell you.

69
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,046
What is it? Tell me now.

70
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:36,967
I'll tell you later.

71
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,546
Don't be late.

72
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,625
I have a favor to ask you,

73
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:44,086
and something to give you.

74
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,326
Your mother's waiting.

75
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:36,075
If

76
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,836
Anything happens to me,

77
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,597
ask Taesu for help.

78
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,566
Don't say such a thing.

79
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,456
I'm saying, just in case.

80
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,106
Hello?

81
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,517
Who is this, so early in the morning?

82
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,576
Do you remember me?

83
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,276
President Jang!

84
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:27,716
- Come in. / - No, no, wait.

85
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,527
My coming in isn't important right now.

86
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:34,395
Did you meet Sangjun's son Kim Jiwan?

87
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,966
Did you see him a few days ago?

88
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:40,337
Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

89
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,716
What did you two talk about?

90
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,306
He asked about the financial state

91
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,966
of Mr. Kim when he passed away.

92
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:56,237
Is there any legal problems?

93
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,226
Yes,

94
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:01,535
when Sangjun died,

95
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,655
what happened to his assets?

96
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:07,196
You know that better than I do.

97
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:10,255
He turned everything into cash,

98
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:12,966
and invested it into his company.

99
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,236
Invested it,

100
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:15,515
yes.

101
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:16,846
Yes, that's right.

102
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,255
He invested all of it.

103
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,466
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

104
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:27,645
He said he was making you the president.

105
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:32,087
Isn't that the same thing?

106
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:44,856
I want to give Taesu a chance.

107
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,405
I want to make it

108
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,165
so that he can make this company grow.

109
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,836
Mr. Kim,

110
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,457
what about your family?

111
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,897
Putting him in charge of the money is...

112
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,806
This investment is for my family.

113
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,377
Excuse me?

114
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:07,275
I'm not sure

115
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:09,556
how much longer

116
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,357
my heart will last.

117
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:16,706
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

118
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,217
my wife, and kids?

119
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,745
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

120
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:25,306
any document they want, and my wife

121
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:29,366
does not know how to deal with my mother.

122
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:33,885
I need someone to be there for my family.

123
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:37,255
Money aside, I know Taesu will

124
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:40,056
take great care of my family.

125
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:45,796
I know what kind of man he is.

126
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:57,297
President Jang...

127
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,686
You,

128
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,456
you're lying, aren't you?

129
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,696
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

130
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,387
How much did it take to pay you off?

131
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:09,896
President Jang...

132
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,875
I need to see you right now.

133
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,175
Come to my office.

134
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,415
I'm not interested in seeing you.

135
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,746
I'm hanging up.

136
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,607
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

137
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,175
I just

138
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:15,586
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

139
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,356
Then you must've heard everything.

140
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,786
Yes.

141
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:27,636
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

142
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:31,736
Your family's become quite crafty.

143
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,505
Was it money, or something else?

144
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,795
How did you make him lie to me like that?

145
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,236
I remember him as a man of integrity,

146
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,227
so how did you buy him off?

147
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:47,616
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

148
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:50,175
Turning Sangjun into a saint

149
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:52,566
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

150
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,007
On top of stealing money, I'd become

151
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:58,056
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

152
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,096
Is that the plan?

153
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,645
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

154
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:05,036
That's what you're afraid of?

155
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,665
I'm relieved.

156
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,096
At least you know what you did was wrong.

157
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:20,717
Why did you do it?

158
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:25,467
You're not that type of person.

159
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,706
You valued people,

160
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,277
and you were very understanding.

161
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:36,326
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

162
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,635
trusted you with everything.

163
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,347
You were upright and kindhearted.

164
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,817
What happened to you?

165
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:54,326
How did you end up here like this,

166
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:58,957
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

167
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,836
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

168
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,316
bought that lawyer off.

169
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,476
Taesu, what if...

170
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:16,045
What if, what?

171
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:17,905
You think it might be true?

172
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,826
But if it's true, I'm...

173
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,545
No.

174
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:29,706
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

175
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:32,885
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

176
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:33,696
Wait...

177
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,236
Wait, this means

178
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:38,307
he can buy my people off, too.

179
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,457
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

180
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,756
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,167
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

182
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,106
I'm Kim Jiwan.

183
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,406
Have a seat.

184
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:08,716
I heard the news from a former employee.

185
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:11,096
You've been contacting former directors?

186
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,556
How many people have you met with?

187
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,167
About twenty.

188
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,816
And I've been preparing

189
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,775
the recordings of their accounts.

190
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,135
I think I can report the story right away

191
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,895
if I had a copy of those recordings.

192
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:25,245
Can you give me a copy?

193
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,505
Of course.

194
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,847
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

195
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,657
Can't fall asleep?

196
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,676
I can't seem to understand Father.

197
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:43,635
Why did he try to put someone like

198
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,276
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

199
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,316
That was so foolish.

200
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,697
Jiwan.

201
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,477
Don't blame your father.

202
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:59,505
Back then, the only person he could trust

203
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:02,046
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

204
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:06,476
With his health deteriorating,

205
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:10,066
your father was afraid of the future.

206
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,456
And he thought

207
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:18,025
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

208
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,197
He was wrong.

209
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:23,035
He trusted the man

210
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,676
who stole all his money the day he died.

211
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,535
If it were me,

212
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,286
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

213
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,555
He was a different man

214
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:36,765
from who he is now.

215
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,815
And that's why I can't forgive him.

216
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,896
As a human being,

217
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,037
you cannot betray someone

218
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:43,856
who trusts you.

219
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,487
Hyeondo.

220
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:37,147
Why not resign from your father's company?

221
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:45,496
I'll look into another job for you.

222
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,107
I should go to work.

223
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,245
Sugyeong came to see you?

224
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,667
She really begged for your forgiveness?

225
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:12,106
Sugyeong looked really bad.

226
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,476
I think she's miserable.

227
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,025
She should be.

228
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,476
Of course.

229
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:21,586
If she's not, she's not human.

230
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:25,906
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

231
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,477
What?

232
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,605
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

233
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,956
Oh, my.

234
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:36,207
You sure are a saint.

235
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,706
She's going through a rough time after

236
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:41,966
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

237
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:45,227
You're the one I feel sorry for.

238
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:51,805
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

239
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,605
He's at the hospital.

240
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,626
Hyeondo?

241
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,245
How could a child be healthy

242
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:59,575
when his parents have no morals?

243
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:03,346
Karma passes down to children.

244
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:09,847
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

245
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:11,976
How could I say no to you?

246
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:14,285
I had to do it.

247
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,676
So I was thinking,

248
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:17,605
I heard you might end up

249
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:20,416
taking over the company.

250
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,686
There's an idea

251
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:26,206
I've been developing for five years,

252
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,025
and going to Russia gave me

253
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,095
reaffirmation on my idea.

254
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,515
So I was wondering

255
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,765
if you could give me a chance

256
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:39,217
to present that idea to you.

257
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:44,796
Please don't joke around with me.

258
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,946
I'm not...

259
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:50,626
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

260
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,706
and made your life difficult.

261
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:56,646
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

262
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:58,676
yes, like in Chinese novels,

263
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,226
in order to make someone a hero,

264
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,305
people around him

265
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:05,095
create hardships for him.

266
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:07,045
All Chinese heroes are like that.

267
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,176
They prevail over and over again,

268
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,167
and accomplish...

269
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,765
It's okay.

270
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:12,697
No, I...

271
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,737
I said it's okay!

272
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:16,716
Why do you keep bugging me!

273
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,216
I said it's okay!

274
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,756
Something great.

275
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,436
I think you're mistaken.

276
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:24,896
It's okay.

277
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:27,256
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

278
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,216
No, I'm not mistaken.

279
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:31,176
I think you're mistaken.

280
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:34,046
It's not like that. Just think about it.

281
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,355
When you asked me for a favor like that,

282
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,126
wasn't it because we are close?

283
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,795
- Yes. / - Right?

284
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:49,355
So since we share a special relationship,

285
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:50,326
let me present it in a special...

286
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,436
Jiwan.

287
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:52,916
Hi, Eunsu.

288
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,245
Ms. Han Eunsu!

289
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,345
Oh? Hello.

290
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:57,836
What are you doing here?

291
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,636
Huh?

292
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:05,727
She's my little sister.

293
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,245
Your real sister?

294
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:09,366
Yes.

295
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:14,317
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

296
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:17,505
Jiwan, Eunsu.

297
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,397
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

298
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:20,995
Remember?

299
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,686
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

300
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:25,075
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

301
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,036
Oh, Aunt.

302
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,576
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

303
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,146
Hi.

304
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:35,396
I'm Park Haengsuk.

305
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,615
Excuse me?

306
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,456
Park...

307
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:42,237
You're his aunt, but
your last name is Park?

308
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:49,285
Kim, Han and Park.

309
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:51,906
A family with different last names?

310
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,876
What happened?

311
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,456
Why is that office empty?

312
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:04,176
All the desks and chairs are gone.

313
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,775
Oh, that office?

314
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,275
They moved out.

315
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,025
They moved out?

316
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:11,206
Where did they go?

317
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,926
Where are my daughter and husband?

318
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:17,927
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

319
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,276
A, a tent?

320
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,255
Oh,

321
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:33,745
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

322
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:35,025
When is the phone guy coming?

323
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:36,886
He'll be here at 3.

324
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,876
Where should the line go?

325
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,387
I'll find a spot.

326
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,076
I'll take that, Yeongju.

327
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:51,216
You shouldn't bite off
more than you can chew,

328
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,847
and mingle with your own kind!

329
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:56,045
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

330
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:57,946
It's my fault for signing a contract

331
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:00,515
that says the owner can
evict us at any time.

332
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:02,226
How dare you side with Jiwan!

333
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,197
I'm going to get him for this!

334
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:06,436
Honey, Mi...

335
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,346
What did Mom say?

336
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:15,986
She's going to get Jiwan.

337
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:17,296
What?

338
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:19,016
Seriously...

339
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,346
Let's hurry up.

340
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:25,796
Jiwan, you!

341
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:26,906
Hello.

342
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,207
Just a second.

343
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:29,917
Hello.

344
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,457
It's an important meeting. This way.

345
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,976
Everything looks great.

346
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:39,676
I can see, now that I'm here.

347
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:43,305
You put up a makeshift
office near the farm.

348
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:47,186
It shows your concern for quality control.

349
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:48,476
I just need to sign here, yes?

350
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:49,877
Yes.

351
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,525
Thank you.

352
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:57,496
I hope this works out great.

353
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,526
Thank you.

354
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,245
Goodbye.

355
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:07,525
That guy

356
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,226
is great at many things.

357
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:11,075
He's amazing.

358
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,496
He performs better under pressure.

359
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,386
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

360
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:18,817
And it's such a hot day.

361
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:21,396
Let me get you something cool to drink.

362
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:22,717
Mr. Jang.

363
00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:30,816
This is worth $30,000.

364
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:38,716
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

365
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,505
Hey, cut me some slack.

366
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:41,916
I was caught off guard.

367
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,245
It slipped out.

368
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:44,536
I can't believe you.

369
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,686
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

370
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:50,085
Director, you're here.

371
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:51,495
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

372
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:52,856
Yes.

373
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,346
What are you doing here?

374
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,295
What do you think?

375
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,115
They are working so hard on a hot day,

376
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:00,636
so I bought them Korean pork

377
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:03,236
to help them restore some energy.

378
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:06,115
Domestic is always the best.

379
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,506
Of course. You're a wise man.

380
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,706
Honey, don't just stand there.
Come and sit.

381
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,315
- Come here. / - Yeongju,
come and sit down.

382
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:15,785
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

383
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:16,886
Let me go get some more lettuce.

384
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,097
Okay.

385
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,525
Wait,

386
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,686
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

387
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,035
What's going on?

388
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:30,315
Oh, I can't believe you.

389
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,376
When? People might actually believe that.

390
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:34,476
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

391
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:37,946
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

392
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,736
so I bought him Korean pork,

393
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,676
to help him restore energy.

394
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,136
Why are you just sitting there?

395
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:46,916
Go and help wash the lettuce.

396
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,107
Go help Jiwan.

397
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,026
Okay.

398
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:55,456
I'm a great judge of character.

399
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:59,265
Mom, just have one spoonful.

400
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,136
Say ah.

401
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,115
I don't want any chicken porridge.

402
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:06,045
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

403
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:08,545
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

404
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:11,216
so you can restore energy, okay?

405
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,436
Just have one spoonful.

406
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:14,567
Say ah.

407
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,416
See?

408
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,305
You're upset because of what you said.

409
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,726
I didn't say anything wrong.

410
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:31,085
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

411
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:34,026
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

412
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:37,406
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

413
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,857
and meets someone nice.

414
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:43,136
I'm sure she will.

415
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,397
Couples form and break up all the time.

416
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,595
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

417
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,846
Jiwan has no time for that.

418
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,197
This?

419
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:02,996
You see,

420
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:07,107
here are the size and unit.

421
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,346
Hi.

422
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:17,867
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

423
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,317
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

424
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:21,996
But why are you here?

425
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:26,876
Oh, I'm stuffed.

426
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:30,755
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

427
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,236
You ate a lot of it.

428
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,737
Because it was delicious.

429
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:39,825
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

430
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:41,946
It's okay. I can go home alone.

431
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:43,297
Don't say that.

432
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,575
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

433
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,676
Take her home.

434
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,186
No, that's not going to happen.

435
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,745
Don't say that. Just go.

436
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,315
What are you two doing?

437
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:52,716
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

438
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:54,626
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

439
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,906
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

440
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:56,867
Okay.

441
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:58,226
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

442
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:12,267
Are those two dating?

443
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,075
They're not together yet,

444
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,996
but they are testing the waters.

445
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:22,495
It's frustrating to watch them.

446
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:24,127
Yeongju...

447
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,285
She's nice.

448
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:27,626
She is.

449
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,815
She's pretty and pleasant.

450
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:33,065
And she's a teacher.

451
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,216
Don't you think they look good together?

452
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:35,907
Yes, they do.

453
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:47,576
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

454
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,456
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

455
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,316
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

456
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,586
I'm just practicing.

457
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:21,536
Practicing?

458
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,355
Oh, I get it.

459
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:28,386
Girl...

460
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,775
You have a good eye.

461
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:32,586
What do you mean?

462
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:34,466
Jiwan.

463
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,146
Who cares about education?

464
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:39,646
To me, money trumps everything.

465
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,647
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

466
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,005
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

467
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,285
Eunsu is easy.

468
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:52,717
The grandmother-in-law
will become forgetful.

469
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:57,265
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

470
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,156
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

471
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:00,515
I told you it's not like that.

472
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:01,386
Just leave me alone.

473
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,275
How could I leave you alone?

474
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:05,926
You won't go on blind dates,

475
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,256
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

476
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,795
If it were me in the old days,

477
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,717
I would've already...

478
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,186
What's the use of giving you my looks?

479
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:16,835
Just look at yourself.

480
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:19,916
You're dressed like a tomboy,

481
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,797
and you haven't taken a shower.

482
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,745
You need to make yourself look pretty!

483
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:27,436
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

484
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:29,936
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

485
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,406
You have to look pretty!

486
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,265
What good will cooking do for you?

487
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,636
Besides your pretty face,

488
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:37,386
you got nothing from me!

489
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:39,697
What do you mean? Like this?

490
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:43,827
Oh, you're impossible.

491
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,275
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

492
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:49,146
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

493
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:52,795
Minja.

494
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,717
Oh!

495
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:54,687
Ms. Lee!

496
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:55,736
What are you doing here?

497
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:59,035
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

498
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:00,526
What about you?

499
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:04,016
Yeongju's been complaining
about neck pain, too.

500
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:06,585
Well,

501
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:10,196
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

502
00:33:11,677 --> 00:33:13,005
I've given up on that.

503
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:14,355
How they feel about each
other is important,

504
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:16,086
not their background.

505
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,345
You're right!

506
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:24,526
But I heard you hold education very high.

507
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:28,696
If they're in love,
education doesn't matter.

508
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:31,737
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

509
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:37,596
But isn't a small family better?

510
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:41,765
I would prefer a small family,

511
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,166
but these days, as complicated as it is,

512
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,456
people don't live with married children.

513
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,877
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

514
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,575
But that's...

515
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,416
Well...

516
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,785
Old people don't live forever.

517
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,487
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

518
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:01,535
I'm not going to let my daughter

519
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,345
date anyone with a large family.

520
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,755
What if she gets stuck with them?

521
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:07,576
That won't be good.

522
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:12,386
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

523
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,495
As long as they live separately,

524
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:17,066
you don't mind a big family?

525
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,615
Of course not.

526
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,917
As long as they are in love.

527
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:22,687
Why do you ask?

528
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:26,476
You have someone in mind?

529
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:27,926
Of course.

530
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,906
- You do? / - Yes.

531
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:45,845
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

532
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:49,606
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

533
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:52,646
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

534
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:55,856
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

535
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,436
There are protocols for reporters...

536
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:59,026
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

537
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:01,745
former directors will be giving statements!

538
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,135
Tell me if it's true,

539
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,385
or if it's slander!

540
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:08,296
President Jang!

541
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,417
Please leave.

542
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,757
Refuse all interviews.

543
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:16,917
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

544
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:20,245
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

545
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:22,286
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

546
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,385
If he had all the evidence,

547
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:27,506
he would've written about it already.

548
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:30,756
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

549
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:34,106
I told you to find him, by any means!

550
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:34,947
What are you doing?

551
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,776
Is it that you can't or won't?

552
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,856
Seokjin was

553
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:43,595
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

554
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:45,596
and is still with us today.

555
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:49,885
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

556
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:52,296
whenever we reach a new milestone.

557
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:57,546
Hyeokju practically lived with us

558
00:35:57,547 --> 00:35:59,227
at the factory.

559
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,805
So how could I

560
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:06,216
dig into their past, and make threats?

561
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,727
Taesu!

562
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:14,687
You've been paid off, too?

563
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:20,235
I know you met with Seokjin.

564
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,416
I wasn't sure.

565
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:24,226
So, what did you get from them?

566
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:27,156
How much did they pay you!

567
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,175
Taesu...

568
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,425
Get out.

569
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:31,406
You're fired!

570
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:32,776
Get lost!

571
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,576
Hyeondo,

572
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,035
I once told your father

573
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:42,326
to watch his back because of you.

574
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:47,317
And he said to me,

575
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,036
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

576
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,216
Because you're his son.

577
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,346
Look after Taesu.

578
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,067
I can't seem to do it anymore.

579
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:02,305
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

580
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,176
This is Kim Jiwan.

581
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:08,796
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

582
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:17,486
Yes, Mr. Han.

583
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:20,426
I'm on my way.

584
00:40:19,107 --> 00:40:20,667
Your father was going to

585
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,467
hand over his company to my father?

586
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:31,246
I couldn't understand him at first,

587
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:36,526
but now that I think about it,

588
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,457
I can understand him a little bit.

589
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:54,127
This is all the evidence I've collected.

590
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,376
Why are you giving them to me?

591
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,535
Why did you

592
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:09,696
give me that notebook?

593
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,417
Have you had a lot to drink?

594
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:49,266
You asked me here, so why are you late?

595
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,816
I met Jiwan.

596
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:01,527
Uncle Sangjun

597
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:06,516
was going to give you all his money?

598
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:09,176
That's a lie.

599
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:11,866
Right?

600
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:18,186
Who would actually do that?

601
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:20,515
Why would he give you his company

602
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:23,135
when he has a son and a family?

603
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:25,056
That's ridiculous.

604
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:27,536
You were just a friend.

605
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,446
Not his blood.

606
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:36,386
Don't you agree?

607
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:39,607
Yes.

608
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:42,187
I'm not his blood.

609
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,386
But,

610
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:50,965
even though I wasn't his blood,

611
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:54,606
Sangjun might have actually really

612
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:58,757
wanted to give me his company.

613
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,316
But why...

614
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:07,837
How could he trust me so much?

615
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:46,546
Jiwan.

616
00:43:49,946 --> 00:43:53,285
Do you

617
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:56,167
remember Dad?

618
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:01,056
A little bit.

619
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:09,906
What kind of person was he?

620
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,977
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

621
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,087
Why did

622
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:32,266
Dad trust a man like him?

623
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:37,056
He was so foolish.

624
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:44,507
You think so, too, don't you?

625
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:56,627
How have you been?

626
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:11,577
Don't turn bad.

627
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,717
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

628
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:29,257
I should go.

629
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,506
The Korean Businessmen's Association

630
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:14,327
recommended you as a next chairperson.

631
00:47:14,786 --> 00:47:18,716
You're to give an acceptance speech.

632
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,405
Okay.

633
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,886
I got it.

634
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,916
Oh, and

635
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:27,015
call my wife's lawyer,

636
00:47:27,016 --> 00:47:29,035
and have him visit me here.

637
00:47:29,036 --> 00:47:30,477
Yes, sir.

638
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,515
President Jang wants to see you

639
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,397
before going to court.

640
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:45,325
What is it about?

641
00:47:45,326 --> 00:47:47,917
He said he will tell you in person.

642
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:44,606
You like the coffee here, don't you?

643
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:47,535
You didn't call me here for coffee.

644
00:48:47,536 --> 00:48:49,536
What is this about?

645
00:48:50,587 --> 00:48:52,797
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

646
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:55,266
Excuse me.

647
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:20,285
I came because you like it here,

648
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:21,905
but to me, the company

649
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:25,056
vending machine coffee's the best.

650
00:49:26,277 --> 00:49:30,336
You've always had cheap taste.

651
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:31,675
What?

652
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:33,856
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

653
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:36,805
No,

654
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:39,036
it was easy for me.

655
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:43,405
Successful men

656
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:46,956
always get a mistress first.

657
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:49,256
But

658
00:49:49,257 --> 00:49:52,316
you have simple taste in everything.

659
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:54,465
Vending machine coffee, soju,

660
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:56,506
and roasted rice tea after meals.

661
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,377
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

662
00:50:02,136 --> 00:50:05,325
I did have simple taste,

663
00:50:05,326 --> 00:50:07,926
but it was never cheap.

664
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:15,715
I loved having you

665
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:17,506
as my husband.

666
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:23,675
I respected you

667
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:28,496
more than anyone.

668
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:36,416
If you are willing to change,

669
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:39,346
nothing will change between us.

670
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:52,026
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

671
00:50:52,027 --> 00:50:55,297
without his money and honor?

672
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:02,427
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

673
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:14,916
This is the divorce papers.

674
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,936
I already signed it,

675
00:51:16,937 --> 00:51:18,967
so you take care of the rest.

676
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:05,716
Are you sure you want to let this go?

677
00:53:06,846 --> 00:53:09,336
You won't regret it?

678
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:13,586
That was what Father wanted.

679
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,106
If President Jang

680

681
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:24,576
what Father wanted, he'll
be more miserable.

682
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:48,035
Hello, everyone.

683
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:50,546
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

684
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:53,987
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

685
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:03,836
There are many senior entrepreneurs

686
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:05,646
and colleagues who deserve the award,

687
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:07,376
so I feel a very big responsibility

688
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,616
to win this accolade.

689
00:54:10,056 --> 00:54:14,726
And it's an honor to have the position

690
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:17,727
to represent all entrepreneurs.

691
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:22,936
Sitting here

692
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:25,547
brings back old memories.

693
00:54:28,317 --> 00:54:33,757
I had a friend.

694
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:38,316
He trusted me when I had nothing,

695
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:42,897
and helped me get to where I am today.

696
00:54:43,496 --> 00:54:45,715
He was the president of Taehu Industry

697
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,816
where Best Global began.

698
00:54:52,196 --> 00:54:54,596
Kim Sangjun.

699
00:54:56,536 --> 00:55:00,306
That was my friend's name.

700
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:04,245
He was naively trusting,

701
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:06,726
and honest

702
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:10,397
even to a fault.

703
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:14,465
I considered his company

704
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:17,916
as my own,

705
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:22,166
and worked hard.

706
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:33,265
But,

707
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:37,316
I

708
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:40,437
Stole...

709
00:55:53,156 --> 00:55:55,576
All of his money.

710
00:55:58,477 --> 00:55:59,946
What did he just say?

711
00:56:18,227 --> 00:56:21,966
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

712
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,536
May I help you?

713
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:31,586
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

714
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:34,326
How dare you come here!

715
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:37,147
Jang Hyeondo?

716
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,126
You're that guy?

717
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:41,467
How dare you show your face here?

718
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:43,156
Get out.

719
00:56:56,556 --> 00:56:58,746
I'm sorry.

720
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:03,207
That's all I can say.

721
00:57:13,357 --> 00:57:14,897
Yes.

722
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:21,336
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

723
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:24,956
and bought their shares for pennies.

724
00:57:24,957 --> 00:57:29,336
And I even kicked his family out

725
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:32,266
from their house.

726
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:39,095
And so I used

727
00:57:39,096 --> 00:57:43,167
the stolen money,

728
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:49,297
and built my own company.

01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:14,666
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

735
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:17,126
Sangjun

736
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:20,016
might have died because of me.

737
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:23,195
He's giving you what?

738
01:00:23,196 --> 01:00:24,376
Stocks.

739
01:00:24,377 --> 01:00:27,516
And he's resigning from his position.

740
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:31,305
Why are they so dense,

741
01:00:31,306 --> 01:00:32,456
when I'm trying to help them?

742
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,465
They should at least try to

743
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:35,816
go on a few dates.

744
01:00:35,817 --> 01:00:37,987
You're going to let Father be as he is?

745
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:41,226
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!

What is it?

748
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:31,175
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

749
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:33,227
directors, you can turn the tables?

750
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:35,616
It's not that simple in the real world.

751
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:40,257
Is that your way of doing things?

752
01:01:41,636 --> 01:01:44,215
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

753
01:01:44,216 --> 01:01:46,736
and stealing all of his money?

754
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,425
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

755
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:52,215
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

756
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:55,066
I said he was already
dead when I got there!

757
01:01:58,346 --> 01:01:59,667
Sure.

758
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:04,905
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

759
01:02:04,906 --> 01:02:06,707
keep telling that story.

760
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:09,686
Even if

761
01:02:09,687 --> 01:02:12,995
you made my father die,

762
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:15,126
don't ever speak of it.

763
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:16,746
Ever.

764
01:02:18,227 --> 01:02:20,806
If not,

765
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:24,265
I would have to feel sorry for my father

766
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:26,745
for being too foolish

767
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:28,156
to have trusted you so much.

768
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:35,746
It was for you.

769
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:39,766
For you,

770
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:43,937
for an ingrate like you,

771
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:48,337
my father did all the work.

772
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:57,215
From the beginning, my father prepared

773
01:02:57,216 --> 01:03:00,786
all the money and paperwork for you.

774
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,555
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

775
01:03:05,556 --> 01:03:08,936
if you just let things run its course,

776
01:03:08,937 --> 01:03:11,447
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

777
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:19,206
I understand that you're an engineer,

778
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:21,226
but what about running the company?

779
01:03:21,227 --> 01:03:23,865
Asking me to manage the money is...

780
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:27,146
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

781
01:03:27,147 --> 01:03:28,405
Sangjun, still...

782
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:30,215
On top of that,

783
01:03:30,216 --> 01:03:33,146
I don't know if I need to run the company.

784
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:34,296
I want to hire someone capable,

785
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:35,836
and have him run it the way he wants.

786
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:37,597
I can focus on technology development,

787
01:03:37,598 --> 01:03:40,506
and he can help grow the company.

his own parents, and a wife?

798
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:18,647
I don't understand, either.

799
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,737
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

800

why he trusted someone like you.

801

802
01:05:30,946 --> 01:05:34,496
trust his friend with all his money?

803
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:40,036
You think I would believe that nonsense?

Did you meet Sangjun's son Kim Jiwan?

Did you see him a few days ago?

833

Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

What did you two talk about?

835

840
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,366
what happened to his assets?

841
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,906
You know that better than I do.

842
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:52,965
He turned everything into cash,

843
01:09:52,966 --> 01:09:55,675
and invested it into his company.

844
01:09:55,676 --> 01:09:56,946
Invested it,

845
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:58,226
yes.

Yes, that's right.

847

He invested all of it.

848
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:03,175
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

849

01:10:10,357 --> 01:10:14,796
Isn't that the same thing?

851
01:10:22,796 --> 01:10:27,566
I want to give Taesu a chance.

852
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,116
I want to make it

853
01:10:29,117 --> 01:10:31,875
so that he can make this company grow.

854
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:33,545
Mr. Kim,

855
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:36,166
what about your family?

856
01:10:36,777 --> 01:10:40,607
Putting him in charge of the money is...

857
01:10:41,477 --> 01:10:44,515
This investment is for my family.

858
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:46,086
Excuse me?

859
01:10:47,907 --> 01:10:49,986
I'm not sure

860
01:10:49,987 --> 01:10:52,265
how much longer

861
01:10:52,266 --> 01:10:54,067
my heart will last.

862
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:59,415
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

863
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,926
my wife, and kids?

864
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:05,455
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

865
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:08,015
any document they want, and my wife

866
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:12,076
does not know how to deal with my mother.

867
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:16,595
I need someone to be there for my family.

868
01:11:16,596 --> 01:11:19,965
Money aside, I know Taesu will

869
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:22,766
take great care of my family.

870
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:28,507
I know what kind of man he is.

871
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:40,006
President Jang...

872
01:11:44,227 --> 01:11:46,396
You,

873
01:11:46,397 --> 01:11:48,165
you're lying, aren't you?

874
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,406
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

875
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:51,095
How much did it take to pay you off?

876
01:11:51,096 --> 01:11:52,607
President Jang...

877
01:12:07,206 --> 01:12:09,585
I need to see you right now.

878
01:12:09,586 --> 01:12:10,885
Come to my office.

879
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:13,125
I'm not interested in seeing you.

880
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:14,456
I'm hanging up.

881
01:12:20,867 --> 01:12:22,317
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

882
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:54,885
I just

883
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:58,296
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

884
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,066
Then you must've heard everything.

885
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:03,497
Yes.

886
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:10,346
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

887
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,446
Your family's become quite crafty.

888
01:13:14,447 --> 01:13:16,217
Was it money, or something else?

889
01:13:16,218 --> 01:13:19,505
How did you make him lie to me like that?

890
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:21,946
I remember him as a man of integrity,

891
01:13:21,947 --> 01:13:23,937
so how did you buy him off?

892
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:30,326
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

893
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,885
Turning Sangjun into a saint

894
01:13:32,886 --> 01:13:35,276
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

895
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:36,715
On top of stealing money, I'd become

896
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:40,765
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

897
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:42,805
Is that the plan?

898
01:13:42,806 --> 01:13:45,356
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

899
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:47,747
That's what you're afraid of?

900
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:53,375
I'm relieved.

901
01:13:53,376 --> 01:13:56,806
At least you know what you did was wrong.

902
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,426
Why did you do it?

903
01:14:05,466 --> 01:14:08,176
You're not that type of person.

904
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:11,415
You valued people,

905
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:13,986
and you were very understanding.

906
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:19,036
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

907
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:22,345
trusted you with everything.

908
01:14:22,346 --> 01:14:25,056
You were upright and kindhearted.

909
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:30,527
What happened to you?

910
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:37,036
How did you end up here like this,

911
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:41,667
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

912
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:54,545
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

913
01:14:54,546 --> 01:14:56,026
bought that lawyer off.

914
01:14:56,027 --> 01:14:57,186
Taesu, what if...

915
01:14:57,187 --> 01:14:58,755
What if, what?

916
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:00,616
You think it might be true?

917
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:02,537
But if it's true, I'm...

918
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:09,255
No.

919
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:12,415
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

920
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:15,595
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

921
01:15:15,596 --> 01:15:16,407
Wait...

922
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:17,946
Wait, this means

923
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:21,016
he can buy my people off, too.

924
01:15:22,437 --> 01:15:25,166
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

925
01:15:26,176 --> 01:15:27,466
Yes, sir.

926
01:15:37,176 --> 01:15:39,876
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

927
01:15:40,756 --> 01:15:41,816
I'm Kim Jiwan.

928
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:43,117
Have a seat.

929
01:15:47,937 --> 01:15:51,425
I heard the news from a former employee.

930
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:53,805
You've been contacting former directors?

931
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:55,265
How many people have you met with?

932
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:56,876
About twenty.

933
01:15:57,747 --> 01:15:59,526
And I've been preparing

934
01:15:59,527 --> 01:16:01,486
the recordings of their accounts.

935
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:02,845
I think I can report the story right away

936
01:16:02,846 --> 01:16:05,606
if I had a copy of those recordings.

937
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,955
Can you give me a copy?

938
01:16:07,956 --> 01:16:09,215
Of course.

939
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:11,556
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

940
01:17:13,766 --> 01:17:16,367
Can't fall asleep?

941
01:17:18,886 --> 01:17:21,386
I can't seem to understand Father.

942
01:17:22,886 --> 01:17:26,345
Why did he try to put someone like

943
01:17:26,346 --> 01:17:28,987
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

944
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:32,026
That was so foolish.

945
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,407
Jiwan.

946
01:17:35,546 --> 01:17:38,187
Don't blame your father.

947
01:17:38,747 --> 01:17:42,215
Back then, the only person he could trust

948
01:17:42,216 --> 01:17:44,756
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

949
01:17:45,907 --> 01:17:49,186
With his health deteriorating,

950
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:52,777
your father was afraid of the future.

951
01:17:53,437 --> 01:17:56,165
And he thought

952
01:17:56,166 --> 01:18:00,736
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

953
01:18:00,737 --> 01:18:02,907
He was wrong.

954
01:18:03,697 --> 01:18:05,746
He trusted the man

955
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,387
who stole all his money the day he died.

956
01:18:08,388 --> 01:18:11,246
If it were me,

957
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:12,997
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

958
01:18:14,376 --> 01:18:17,265
He was a different man

959
01:18:17,266 --> 01:18:19,476
from who he is now.

960
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:21,526
And that's why I can't forgive him.

961
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:23,606
As a human being,

962
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:24,746
you cannot betray someone

963
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,567
who trusts you.

964
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:13,197
Hyeondo.

965
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:19,857
Why not resign from your father's company?

966
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:28,207
I'll look into another job for you.

967
01:20:31,937 --> 01:20:33,817
I should go to work.

968
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,955
Sugyeong came to see you?

969
01:20:46,956 --> 01:20:50,376
She really begged for your forgiveness?

970
01:20:51,487 --> 01:20:54,817
Sugyeong looked really bad.

971
01:20:55,926 --> 01:20:58,186
I think she's miserable.

972
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,736
She should be.

973
01:20:59,737 --> 01:21:01,186
Of course.

974
01:21:01,187 --> 01:21:04,296
If she's not, she's not human.

975
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:08,616
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

976
01:21:08,617 --> 01:21:10,187
What?

977
01:21:10,937 --> 01:21:14,316
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

978
01:21:14,317 --> 01:21:16,665
Oh, my.

979
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:18,916
You sure are a saint.

980
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,417
She's going through a rough time after

981
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,675
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

982
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:27,937
You're the one I feel sorry for.

983
01:21:28,987 --> 01:21:34,515
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

984
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:36,316
He's at the hospital.

985
01:21:36,317 --> 01:21:38,335
Hyeondo?

986
01:21:38,336 --> 01:21:39,955
How could a child be healthy

987
01:21:39,956 --> 01:21:42,286
when his parents have no morals?

988
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:46,057
Karma passes down to children.

989
01:21:48,846 --> 01:21:52,556
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

990
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:54,686
How could I say no to you?

991
01:21:54,687 --> 01:21:56,996
I had to do it.

992
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:58,385
So I was thinking,

993
01:21:58,386 --> 01:22:00,316
I heard you might end up

994
01:22:00,317 --> 01:22:03,125
taking over the company.

995
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:05,396
There's an idea

996
01:22:05,397 --> 01:22:08,915
I've been developing for five years,

997
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:11,736
and going to Russia gave me

998
01:22:11,737 --> 01:22:13,805
reaffirmation on my idea.

999
01:22:13,806 --> 01:22:16,226
So I was wondering

1000
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:19,476
if you could give me a chance

1001
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:21,926
to present that idea to you.

1002
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,506
Please don't joke around with me.

1003
01:22:28,197 --> 01:22:29,656
I'm not...

1004
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:33,335
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

1005
01:22:33,336 --> 01:22:35,415
and made your life difficult.

1006
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:39,356
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

1007
01:22:39,357 --> 01:22:41,385
yes, like in Chinese novels,

1008
01:22:41,386 --> 01:22:42,936
in order to make someone a hero,

1009
01:22:42,937 --> 01:22:45,015
people around him

1010
01:22:45,016 --> 01:22:47,805
create hardships for him.

1011
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:49,755
All Chinese heroes are like that.

1012
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,885
They prevail over and over again,

1013
01:22:51,886 --> 01:22:52,876
and accomplish...

1014
01:22:52,877 --> 01:22:54,476
It's okay.

1015
01:22:54,477 --> 01:22:55,407
No, I...

1016
01:22:55,408 --> 01:22:57,447
I said it's okay!

1017
01:22:58,117 --> 01:22:59,427
Why do you keep bugging me!

1018
01:22:59,428 --> 01:23:00,925
I said it's okay!

1019
01:23:00,926 --> 01:23:02,466
Something great.

1020
01:23:04,817 --> 01:23:06,146
I think you're mistaken.

1021
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,606
It's okay.

1022
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,966
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

1023
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:11,927
No, I'm not mistaken.

1024
01:23:11,928 --> 01:23:13,885
I think you're mistaken.

1025
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:16,756
It's not like that. Just think about it.

1026
01:23:17,237 --> 01:23:20,066
When you asked me for a favor like that,

1027
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:23,837
wasn't it because we are close?

1028
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:26,505
- Yes. / - Right?

1029
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:32,066
So since we share a special relationship,

1030
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,037
let me present it in a special...

1031
01:23:33,038 --> 01:23:34,147
Jiwan.

1032
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:35,625
Hi, Eunsu.

1033
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:36,955
Ms. Han Eunsu!

1034
01:23:36,956 --> 01:23:39,055
Oh? Hello.

1035
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,546
What are you doing here?

1036
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:44,346
Huh?

1037
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,437
She's my little sister.

1038
01:23:49,437 --> 01:23:50,955
Your real sister?

1039
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:52,076
Yes.

1040
01:23:52,397 --> 01:23:57,027
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

1041
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,215
Jiwan, Eunsu.

1042
01:24:00,216 --> 01:24:02,107
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

1043
01:24:02,697 --> 01:24:03,705
Remember?

1044
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:06,396
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

1045
01:24:06,397 --> 01:24:07,786
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

1046
01:24:07,787 --> 01:24:08,747
Oh, Aunt.

1047
01:24:08,748 --> 01:24:12,287
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

1048
01:24:13,806 --> 01:24:14,856
Hi.

1049
01:24:14,857 --> 01:24:18,106
I'm Park Haengsuk.

1050
01:24:18,107 --> 01:24:19,326
Excuse me?

1051
01:24:19,327 --> 01:24:21,165
Park...

1052
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:24,946
You're his aunt, but
your last name is Park?

1053
01:24:26,676 --> 01:24:31,996
Kim, Han and Park.

1054
01:24:31,997 --> 01:24:34,617
A family with different last names?

1055
01:24:39,956 --> 01:24:42,585
What happened?

1056
01:24:42,586 --> 01:24:44,165
Why is that office empty?

1057
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,885
All the desks and chairs are gone.

1058
01:24:46,886 --> 01:24:48,486
Oh, that office?

1059
01:24:48,487 --> 01:24:49,986
They moved out.

1060
01:24:49,987 --> 01:24:51,736
They moved out?

1061
01:24:51,737 --> 01:24:53,915
Where did they go?

1062
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,635
Where are my daughter and husband?

1063
01:24:55,636 --> 01:25:00,636
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

1064
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:04,987
A, a tent?

1065
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:12,965
Oh,

1066
01:25:12,966 --> 01:25:16,455
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

1067
01:25:16,456 --> 01:25:17,736
When is the phone guy coming?

1068
01:25:17,737 --> 01:25:19,595
He'll be here at 3.

1069
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:21,585
Where should the line go?

1070
01:25:21,586 --> 01:25:23,096
I'll find a spot.

1071
01:25:23,477 --> 01:25:24,787
I'll take that, Yeongju.

1072
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:33,925
You shouldn't bite off
more than you can chew,

1073
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,555
and mingle with your own kind!

1074
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:38,755
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

1075
01:25:38,756 --> 01:25:40,656
It's my fault for signing a contract

1076
01:25:40,657 --> 01:25:43,226
that says the owner can
evict us at any time.

1077
01:25:43,227 --> 01:25:44,936
How dare you side with Jiwan!

1078
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:46,907
I'm going to get him for this!

1079
01:25:48,037 --> 01:25:49,147
Honey, Mi...

1080
01:25:52,506 --> 01:25:54,056
What did Mom say?

1081
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:58,696
She's going to get Jiwan.

1082
01:25:58,697 --> 01:26:00,007
What?

1083
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:01,727
Seriously...

1084
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,056
Let's hurry up.

1085
01:26:07,016 --> 01:26:08,506
Jiwan, you!

1086
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,617
Hello.

1087
01:26:09,618 --> 01:26:10,917
Just a second.

1088
01:26:11,357 --> 01:26:12,627
Hello.

1089
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:16,167
It's an important meeting. This way.

1090
01:26:16,617 --> 01:26:18,686
Everything looks great.

1091
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:22,385
I can see, now that I'm here.

1092
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:26,015
You put up a makeshift
office near the farm.

1093
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:29,896
It shows your concern for quality control.

1094
01:26:29,897 --> 01:26:31,186
I just need to sign here, yes?

1095
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:32,586
Yes.

1096
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:39,236
Thank you.

1097
01:26:39,237 --> 01:26:40,207
I hope this works out great.

1098
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,236
Thank you.

1099
01:26:46,897 --> 01:26:47,955
Goodbye.

1100
01:26:47,956 --> 01:26:50,236
That guy

1101
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:51,936
is great at many things.

1102
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:53,786
He's amazing.

1103
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:56,207
He performs better under pressure.

1104
01:26:57,586 --> 01:27:00,095
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

1105
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,526
And it's such a hot day.

1106
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:04,106
Let me get you something cool to drink.

1107
01:27:04,107 --> 01:27:05,426
Mr. Jang.

1108
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:13,527
This is worth $30,000.

1109
01:27:18,056 --> 01:27:21,425
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

1110
01:27:21,426 --> 01:27:23,215
Hey, cut me some slack.

1111
01:27:23,216 --> 01:27:24,625
I was caught off guard.

1112
01:27:24,626 --> 01:27:25,955
It slipped out.

1113
01:27:25,956 --> 01:27:27,246
I can't believe you.

1114
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:30,397
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

1115
01:27:31,676 --> 01:27:32,795
Director, you're here.

1116
01:27:32,796 --> 01:27:34,205
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

1117
01:27:34,206 --> 01:27:35,566
Yes.

1118
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:38,056
What are you doing here?

1119
01:27:38,607 --> 01:27:40,005
What do you think?

1120
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:41,826
They are working so hard on a hot day,

1121
01:27:41,827 --> 01:27:43,347
so I bought them Korean pork

1122
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:45,946
to help them restore some energy.

1123
01:27:45,947 --> 01:27:48,826
Domestic is always the best.

1124
01:27:48,827 --> 01:27:51,217
Of course. You're a wise man.

1125
01:27:52,756 --> 01:27:55,415
Honey, don't just stand there.
Come and sit.

1126
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,026
- Come here. / - Yeongju,
come and sit down.

1127
01:27:57,027 --> 01:27:58,496
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

1128
01:27:58,497 --> 01:27:59,597
Let me go get some more lettuce.

1129
01:27:59,598 --> 01:28:00,806
Okay.

1130
01:28:07,027 --> 01:28:08,236
Wait,

1131
01:28:08,237 --> 01:28:10,396
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

1132
01:28:10,397 --> 01:28:11,746
What's going on?

1133
01:28:11,747 --> 01:28:13,026
Oh, I can't believe you.

1134
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:15,087
When? People might actually believe that.

1135
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:17,186
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

1136
01:28:17,187 --> 01:28:20,656
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

1137
01:28:20,657 --> 01:28:23,446
so I bought him Korean pork,

1138
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:25,385
to help him restore energy.

1139
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:27,845
Why are you just sitting there?

1140
01:28:27,846 --> 01:28:29,625
Go and help wash the lettuce.

1141
01:28:29,626 --> 01:28:30,816
Go help Jiwan.

1142
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:32,737
Okay.

1143
01:28:34,386 --> 01:28:38,165
I'm a great judge of character.

1144
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:41,976
Mom, just have one spoonful.

1145
01:28:41,977 --> 01:28:42,846
Say ah.

1146
01:28:42,847 --> 01:28:45,826
I don't want any chicken porridge.

1147
01:28:45,827 --> 01:28:48,755
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

1148
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:51,255
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

1149
01:28:51,256 --> 01:28:53,925
so you can restore energy, okay?

1150
01:28:53,926 --> 01:28:56,146
Just have one spoonful.

1151
01:28:56,147 --> 01:28:57,277
Say ah.

1152
01:29:03,206 --> 01:29:05,125
See?

1153
01:29:05,126 --> 01:29:08,015
You're upset because of what you said.

1154
01:29:08,016 --> 01:29:10,436
I didn't say anything wrong.

1155
01:29:10,437 --> 01:29:13,795
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

1156
01:29:13,796 --> 01:29:16,736
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

1157
01:29:18,447 --> 01:29:20,116
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

1158
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:22,567
and meets someone nice.

1159
01:29:23,527 --> 01:29:25,846
I'm sure she will.

1160
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:29,107
Couples form and break up all the time.

1161
01:29:31,237 --> 01:29:34,305
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

1162
01:29:34,306 --> 01:29:37,556
Jiwan has no time for that.

1163
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:40,907
This?

1164
01:29:44,206 --> 01:29:45,706
You see,

1165
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:49,817
here are the size and unit.

1166
01:29:53,077 --> 01:29:55,056
Hi.

1167
01:29:57,367 --> 01:30:00,577
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1168
01:30:00,876 --> 01:30:03,026
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

1169
01:30:03,027 --> 01:30:04,707
But why are you here?

1170
01:30:07,147 --> 01:30:09,585
Oh, I'm stuffed.

1171
01:30:09,586 --> 01:30:13,465
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

1172
01:30:13,466 --> 01:30:14,946
You ate a lot of it.

1173
01:30:14,947 --> 01:30:16,447
Because it was delicious.

1174
01:30:19,407 --> 01:30:22,536
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

1175
01:30:22,537 --> 01:30:24,657
It's okay. I can go home alone.

1176
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,006
Don't say that.

1177
01:30:26,007 --> 01:30:28,286
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

1178
01:30:28,287 --> 01:30:29,385
Take her home.

1179
01:30:29,386 --> 01:30:30,896
No, that's not going to happen.

1180
01:30:30,897 --> 01:30:32,457
Don't say that. Just go.

1181
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:34,026
What are you two doing?

1182
01:30:34,027 --> 01:30:35,425
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

1183
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:37,335
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

1184
01:30:37,336 --> 01:30:38,616
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

1185
01:30:38,617 --> 01:30:39,577
Okay.

1186
01:30:39,578 --> 01:30:40,937
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

1187
01:30:52,846 --> 01:30:54,977
Are those two dating?

1188
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,786
They're not together yet,

1189
01:30:57,787 --> 01:31:00,707
but they are testing the waters.

1190
01:31:02,527 --> 01:31:05,205
It's frustrating to watch them.

1191
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:06,836
Yeongju...

1192
01:31:07,567 --> 01:31:08,996
She's nice.

1193
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:10,335
She is.

1194
01:31:10,336 --> 01:31:12,526
She's pretty and pleasant.

1195
01:31:12,527 --> 01:31:15,776
And she's a teacher.

1196
01:31:15,777 --> 01:31:16,925
Don't you think they look good together?

1197
01:31:16,926 --> 01:31:18,616
Yes, they do.

1198
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:30,287
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

1199
01:31:54,636 --> 01:31:57,165
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

1200
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,026
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

1201
01:32:00,716 --> 01:32:02,296
I'm just practicing.

1202
01:32:02,706 --> 01:32:04,246
Practicing?

1203
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,066
Oh, I get it.

1204
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:11,095
Girl...

1205
01:32:11,096 --> 01:32:14,486
You have a good eye.

1206
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:15,297
What do you mean?

1207
01:32:15,298 --> 01:32:17,175
Jiwan.

1208
01:32:17,176 --> 01:32:18,856
Who cares about education?

1209
01:32:18,857 --> 01:32:22,356
To me, money trumps everything.

1210
01:32:22,357 --> 01:32:25,357
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

1211
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,715
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

1212
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:31,996
Eunsu is easy.

1213
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:35,427
The grandmother-in-law
will become forgetful.

1214
01:32:36,037 --> 01:32:39,976
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

1215
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:41,866
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

1216
01:32:41,867 --> 01:32:43,226
I told you it's not like that.

1217
01:32:43,227 --> 01:32:44,096
Just leave me alone.

1218
01:32:44,097 --> 01:32:46,986
How could I leave you alone?

1219
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:48,635
You won't go on blind dates,

1220
01:32:48,636 --> 01:32:50,966
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

1221
01:32:52,016 --> 01:32:53,505
If it were me in the old days,

1222
01:32:53,506 --> 01:32:55,426
I would've already...

1223
01:32:56,176 --> 01:32:57,896
What's the use of giving you my looks?

1224
01:32:57,897 --> 01:32:59,545
Just look at yourself.

1225
01:32:59,546 --> 01:33:02,625
You're dressed like a tomboy,

1226
01:33:02,626 --> 01:33:04,505
and you haven't taken a shower.

1227
01:33:04,506 --> 01:33:07,455
You need to make yourself look pretty!

1228
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,146
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

1229
01:33:10,147 --> 01:33:12,646
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

1230
01:33:12,647 --> 01:33:14,116
You have to look pretty!

1231
01:33:14,117 --> 01:33:15,976
What good will cooking do for you?

1232
01:33:15,977 --> 01:33:17,345
Besides your pretty face,

1233
01:33:17,346 --> 01:33:20,095
you got nothing from me!

1234
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:22,407
What do you mean? Like this?

1235
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:26,536
Oh, you're impossible.

1236
01:33:26,537 --> 01:33:28,986
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

1237
01:33:28,987 --> 01:33:31,857
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

1238
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:35,505
Minja.

1239
01:33:35,506 --> 01:33:36,426
Oh!

1240
01:33:36,426 --> 01:33:37,397
Ms. Lee!

1241
01:33:37,398 --> 01:33:38,446
What are you doing here?

1242
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:41,746
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

1243
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:43,237
What about you?

1244
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:46,727
Yeongju's been complaining
about neck pain, too.

1245
01:33:48,016 --> 01:33:49,295
Well,

1246
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:52,906
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

1247
01:33:54,386 --> 01:33:55,715
I've given up on that.

1248
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:57,066
How they feel about each
other is important,

1249
01:33:57,067 --> 01:33:58,796
not their background.

1250
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:02,055
You're right!

1251
01:34:02,056 --> 01:34:07,237
But I heard you hold education very high.

1252
01:34:08,117 --> 01:34:11,406
If they're in love,
education doesn't matter.

1253
01:34:11,407 --> 01:34:14,447
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

1254
01:34:15,187 --> 01:34:20,306
But isn't a small family better?

1255
01:34:21,136 --> 01:34:24,476
I would prefer a small family,

1256
01:34:24,477 --> 01:34:25,875
but these days, as complicated as it is,

1257
01:34:25,876 --> 01:34:29,165
people don't live with married children.

1258
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:31,586
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

1259
01:34:32,727 --> 01:34:34,286
But that's...

1260
01:34:34,287 --> 01:34:36,125
Well...

1261
01:34:36,126 --> 01:34:38,496
Old people don't live forever.

1262
01:34:38,497 --> 01:34:41,197
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

1263
01:34:41,727 --> 01:34:44,246
I'm not going to let my daughter

1264
01:34:44,247 --> 01:34:46,057
date anyone with a large family.

1265
01:34:46,058 --> 01:34:48,465
What if she gets stuck with them?

1266
01:34:48,466 --> 01:34:50,286
That won't be good.

1267
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:55,096
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

1268
01:34:55,437 --> 01:34:57,207
As long as they live separately,

1269
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:59,776
you don't mind a big family?

1270
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,326
Of course not.

1271
01:35:01,327 --> 01:35:03,627
As long as they are in love.

1272
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:05,397
Why do you ask?

1273
01:35:05,398 --> 01:35:09,186
You have someone in mind?

1274
01:35:09,187 --> 01:35:10,636
Of course.

1275
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:14,616
- You do? / - Yes.

1276
01:35:25,787 --> 01:35:28,555
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

1277
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:32,316
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

1278
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:35,356
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

1279
01:35:35,357 --> 01:35:38,566
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

1280
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,146
There are protocols for reporters...

1281
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:41,736
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

1282
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:44,457
former directors will be giving statements!

1283
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:45,845
Tell me if it's true,

1284
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:48,095
or if it's slander!

1285
01:35:48,096 --> 01:35:51,005
President Jang!

1286
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:52,126
Please leave.

1287
01:35:55,437 --> 01:35:57,466
Refuse all interviews.

1288
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,626
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

1289
01:36:00,516 --> 01:36:02,955
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

1290
01:36:02,956 --> 01:36:04,996
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

1291
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:08,095
If he had all the evidence,

1292
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,216
he would've written about it already.

1293
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:13,465
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

1294
01:36:13,466 --> 01:36:16,816
I told you to find him, by any means!

1295
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:17,657
What are you doing?

1296
01:36:17,658 --> 01:36:19,487
Is it that you can't or won't?

1297
01:36:21,846 --> 01:36:23,566
Seokjin was

1298
01:36:23,567 --> 01:36:26,305
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

1299
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:28,306
and is still with us today.

1300
01:36:29,386 --> 01:36:32,595
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

1301
01:36:32,596 --> 01:36:35,006
whenever we reach a new milestone.

1302
01:36:36,397 --> 01:36:40,255
Hyeokju practically lived with us

1303
01:36:40,256 --> 01:36:41,937
at the factory.

1304
01:36:43,056 --> 01:36:45,515
So how could I

1305
01:36:45,516 --> 01:36:48,926
dig into their past, and make threats?

1306
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:51,437
Taesu!

1307
01:36:54,867 --> 01:36:57,397
You've been paid off, too?

1308
01:36:59,857 --> 01:37:02,946
I know you met with Seokjin.

1309
01:37:02,947 --> 01:37:05,127
I wasn't sure.

1310
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:06,936
So, what did you get from them?

1311
01:37:06,937 --> 01:37:09,867
How much did they pay you!

1312
01:37:10,497 --> 01:37:11,885
Taesu...

1313
01:37:11,886 --> 01:37:13,135
Get out.

1314
01:37:13,136 --> 01:37:14,116
You're fired!

1315
01:37:14,117 --> 01:37:15,487
Get lost!

1316
01:38:17,636 --> 01:38:19,286
Hyeondo,

1317
01:38:20,016 --> 01:38:22,746
I once told your father

1318
01:38:22,747 --> 01:38:25,037
to watch his back because of you.

1319
01:38:27,647 --> 01:38:30,027
And he said to me,

1320
01:38:31,687 --> 01:38:33,747
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

1321
01:38:34,947 --> 01:38:36,926
Because you're his son.

1322
01:38:41,037 --> 01:38:43,057
Look after Taesu.

1323
01:38:45,277 --> 01:38:47,777
I can't seem to do it anymore.

1324
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:45,015
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

1325
01:39:45,016 --> 01:39:46,886
This is Kim Jiwan.

1326
01:39:48,117 --> 01:39:51,507
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

1327
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,197
Yes, Mr. Han.

1328
01:40:01,456 --> 01:40:03,136
I'm on my way.

1329
01:41:01,817 --> 01:41:03,377
Your father was going to

1330
01:41:04,586 --> 01:41:08,176
hand over his company to my father?

1331
01:41:11,456 --> 01:41:13,956
I couldn't understand him at first,

1332
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:19,236
but now that I think about it,

1333
01:41:19,237 --> 01:41:21,167
I can understand him a little bit.

1334
01:41:34,716 --> 01:41:36,836
This is all the evidence I've collected.

1335
01:41:41,197 --> 01:41:43,087
Why are you giving them to me?

1336
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:50,246
Why did you

1337
01:41:50,247 --> 01:41:52,407
give me that notebook?

1338
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,126
Have you had a lot to drink?

1339
01:42:28,456 --> 01:42:31,977
You asked me here, so why are you late?

1340
01:42:36,596 --> 01:42:38,527
I met Jiwan.

1341
01:42:41,956 --> 01:42:44,236
Uncle Sangjun

1342
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:49,227
was going to give you all his money?

1343
01:42:49,977 --> 01:42:51,886
That's a lie.

1344
01:42:52,657 --> 01:42:54,577
Right?

1345
01:42:58,037 --> 01:43:00,896
Who would actually do that?

1346
01:43:00,897 --> 01:43:03,226
Why would he give you his company

1347
01:43:03,227 --> 01:43:05,845
when he has a son and a family?

1348
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,766
That's ridiculous.

1349
01:43:08,426 --> 01:43:10,246
You were just a friend.

1350
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:13,157
Not his blood.

1351
01:43:17,187 --> 01:43:19,096
Don't you agree?

1352
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:22,317
Yes.

1353
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:24,896
I'm not his blood.

1354
01:43:27,787 --> 01:43:30,097
But,

1355
01:43:30,926 --> 01:43:33,675
even though I wasn't his blood,

1356
01:43:33,676 --> 01:43:37,316
Sangjun might have actually really

1357
01:43:37,317 --> 01:43:41,466
wanted to give me his company.

1358
01:43:44,456 --> 01:43:48,026
But why...

1359
01:43:48,027 --> 01:43:50,547
How could he trust me so much?

1360
01:44:28,016 --> 01:44:29,256
Jiwan.

1361
01:44:32,657 --> 01:44:35,996
Do you

1362
01:44:35,997 --> 01:44:38,877
remember Dad?

1363
01:44:41,907 --> 01:44:43,766
A little bit.

1364
01:44:46,876 --> 01:44:52,616
What kind of person was he?

1365
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:58,687
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

1366
01:45:06,237 --> 01:45:08,797
Why did

1367
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:14,977
Dad trust a man like him?

1368
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:19,766
He was so foolish.

1369
01:45:24,237 --> 01:45:27,216
You think so, too, don't you?

1370
01:46:37,916 --> 01:46:39,336
How have you been?

1371
01:46:52,216 --> 01:46:54,286
Don't turn bad.

1372
01:46:56,756 --> 01:46:59,426
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

1373
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:11,966
I should go.

1374
01:47:51,977 --> 01:47:53,215
The Korean Businessmen's Association

1375
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:57,036
recommended you as a next chairperson.

1376
01:47:57,497 --> 01:48:01,427
You're to give an acceptance speech.

1377
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:04,116
Okay.

1378
01:48:04,117 --> 01:48:05,596
I got it.

1379
01:48:06,176 --> 01:48:07,625
Oh, and

1380
01:48:07,626 --> 01:48:09,726
call my wife's lawyer,

1381
01:48:09,727 --> 01:48:11,746
and have him visit me here.

1382
01:48:11,747 --> 01:48:13,187
Yes, sir.

1383
01:48:21,277 --> 01:48:23,226
President Jang wants to see you

1384
01:48:23,227 --> 01:48:25,107
before going to court.

1385
01:48:26,407 --> 01:48:28,036
What is it about?

1386
01:48:28,037 --> 01:48:30,627
He said he will tell you in person.

1387
01:49:24,117 --> 01:49:27,316
You like the coffee here, don't you?

1388
01:49:27,317 --> 01:49:30,246
You didn't call me here for coffee.

1389
01:49:30,247 --> 01:49:32,247
What is this about?

1390
01:49:33,296 --> 01:49:35,506
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

1391
01:49:36,357 --> 01:49:37,977
Excuse me.

1392
01:49:59,756 --> 01:50:02,996
I came because you like it here,

1393
01:50:02,997 --> 01:50:04,616
but to me, the company

1394
01:50:04,617 --> 01:50:07,766
vending machine coffee's the best.

1395
01:50:08,987 --> 01:50:13,045
You've always had cheap taste.

1396
01:50:13,046 --> 01:50:14,385
What?

1397
01:50:14,386 --> 01:50:16,567
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

1398
01:50:17,136 --> 01:50:19,515
No,

1399
01:50:19,516 --> 01:50:21,746
it was easy for me.

1400
01:50:24,437 --> 01:50:26,116
Successful men

1401
01:50:26,117 --> 01:50:29,665
always get a mistress first.

1402
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:31,965
But

1403
01:50:31,966 --> 01:50:35,026
you have simple taste in everything.

1404
01:50:35,027 --> 01:50:37,175
Vending machine coffee, soju,

1405
01:50:37,176 --> 01:50:39,216
and roasted rice tea after meals.

1406
01:50:40,497 --> 01:50:43,087
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

1407
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:48,036
I did have simple taste,

1408
01:50:48,037 --> 01:50:50,637
but it was never cheap.

1409
01:50:53,527 --> 01:50:58,425
I loved having you

1410
01:50:58,426 --> 01:51:00,216
as my husband.

1411
01:51:03,046 --> 01:51:06,385
I respected you

1412
01:51:06,386 --> 01:51:11,206
more than anyone.

1413
01:51:16,056 --> 01:51:19,125
If you are willing to change,

1414
01:51:19,126 --> 01:51:22,056
nothing will change between us.

1415
01:51:30,077 --> 01:51:34,736
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

1416
01:51:34,737 --> 01:51:38,007
without his money and honor?

1417
01:51:41,777 --> 01:51:45,136
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

1418
01:51:56,037 --> 01:51:57,627
This is the divorce papers.

1419
01:51:57,628 --> 01:51:59,646
I already signed it,

1420
01:51:59,647 --> 01:52:01,676
so you take care of the rest.

1421
01:53:45,206 --> 01:53:48,426
Are you sure you want to let this go?

1422
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:52,046
You won't regret it?

1423
01:53:53,867 --> 01:53:56,297
That was what Father wanted.

1424
01:53:57,537 --> 01:53:59,816
If President Jang

1425
01:53:59,817 --> 01:54:03,687
doesn't change his ways after finding out

1426
01:54:04,586 --> 01:54:07,286
what Father wanted, he'll
be more miserable.

1427
01:54:27,607 --> 01:54:30,746
Hello, everyone.

1428
01:54:30,747 --> 01:54:33,255
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

1429
01:54:33,256 --> 01:54:36,696
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

1430
01:54:42,647 --> 01:54:46,545
There are many senior entrepreneurs

1431
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,356
and colleagues who deserve the award,

1432
01:54:48,357 --> 01:54:50,085
so I feel a very big responsibility

1433
01:54:50,086 --> 01:54:52,326
to win this accolade.

1434
01:54:52,766 --> 01:54:57,436
And it's an honor to have the position

1435
01:54:57,437 --> 01:55:00,437
to represent all entrepreneurs.

1436
01:55:01,836 --> 01:55:05,646
Sitting here

1437
01:55:05,647 --> 01:55:08,256
brings back old memories.

1438
01:55:11,027 --> 01:55:16,466
I had a friend.

1439
01:55:17,056 --> 01:55:21,026
He trusted me when I had nothing,

1440
01:55:21,027 --> 01:55:25,607
and helped me get to where I am today.

1441
01:55:26,206 --> 01:55:28,425
He was the president of Taehu Industry

1442
01:55:28,426 --> 01:55:31,527
where Best Global began.

1443
01:55:34,907 --> 01:55:37,306
Kim Sangjun.

1444
01:55:39,247 --> 01:55:43,017
That was my friend's name.

1445
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:46,955
He was naively trusting,

1446
01:55:46,956 --> 01:55:49,436
and honest

1447
01:55:49,437 --> 01:55:53,107
even to a fault.

1448
01:55:54,437 --> 01:55:57,175
I considered his company

1449
01:55:57,176 --> 01:56:00,626
as my own,

1450
01:56:01,947 --> 01:56:04,877
and worked hard.

1451
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:15,976
But,

1452
01:56:15,977 --> 01:56:20,026
I

1453
01:56:20,027 --> 01:56:23,147
Stole...

1454
01:56:35,867 --> 01:56:38,287
All of his money.

1455
01:56:41,187 --> 01:56:42,657
What did he just say?

1456
01:57:00,937 --> 01:57:04,676
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

1457
01:57:06,626 --> 01:57:08,246
May I help you?

1458
01:57:12,107 --> 01:57:14,295
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

1459
01:57:14,296 --> 01:57:17,036
How dare you come here!

1460
01:57:18,126 --> 01:57:19,856
Jang Hyeondo?

1461
01:57:20,737 --> 01:57:22,835
You're that guy?

1462
01:57:22,836 --> 01:57:24,175
How dare you show your face here?

1463
01:57:24,176 --> 01:57:25,866
Get out.

1464
01:57:39,266 --> 01:57:41,456
I'm sorry.

1465
01:57:42,687 --> 01:57:45,916
That's all I can say.

1466
01:57:56,067 --> 01:57:57,607
Yes.

1467
01:57:58,497 --> 01:58:04,045
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

1468
01:58:04,046 --> 01:58:07,665
and bought their shares for pennies.

1469
01:58:07,666 --> 01:58:12,045
And I even kicked his family out

1470
01:58:12,046 --> 01:58:14,977
from their house.

1471
01:58:19,067 --> 01:58:21,805
And so I used

1472
01:58:21,806 --> 01:58:25,876
the stolen money,

1473
01:58:27,836 --> 01:58:32,006
and built my own company.

1474
01:58:42,796 --> 01:58:44,956
(Taehu Industry Stock
Certificate, $2.5 Million)

(Best Global's Jang Taesu
Confesses to Embezzlement)

02:00:53,367 --> 02:00:57,375
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

1480
02:00:57,376 --> 02:00:59,835
Sangjun

1481
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:02,727
might have died because of me.

1482
02:01:03,926 --> 02:01:05,906
He's giving you what?

1483
02:01:05,907 --> 02:01:07,085
Stocks.

1484
02:01:07,086 --> 02:01:10,227
And he's resigning from his position.

1485
02:01:11,056 --> 02:01:14,015
Why are they so dense,

1486
02:01:14,016 --> 02:01:15,165
when I'm trying to help them?

1487
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:17,175
They should at least try to

1488
02:01:17,176 --> 02:01:18,526
go on a few dates.

1489
02:01:18,527 --> 02:01:20,696
You're going to let Father be as he is?

1490
02:01:20,697 --> 02:01:23,937
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!

(Episode 49)

1492
02:02:09,117 --> 02:02:10,647
What is it?

1493
02:02:11,416 --> 02:02:13,885
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

1494
02:02:13,886 --> 02:02:15,937
directors, you can turn the tables?

1495
02:02:16,386 --> 02:02:18,326
It's not that simple in the real world.

1496
02:02:20,777 --> 02:02:22,966
Is that your way of doing things?

1497
02:02:24,346 --> 02:02:26,925
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

1498
02:02:26,926 --> 02:02:29,447
and stealing all of his money?

1499
02:02:30,157 --> 02:02:33,135
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

1500
02:02:33,136 --> 02:02:34,925
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

1501
02:02:34,926 --> 02:02:37,777
I said he was already
dead when I got there!

1502
02:02:41,056 --> 02:02:42,376
Sure.

1503
02:02:44,477 --> 02:02:47,616
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

1504
02:02:47,617 --> 02:02:49,417
keep telling that story.

1505
02:02:50,367 --> 02:02:52,396
Even if

1506
02:02:52,397 --> 02:02:55,705
you made my father die,

1507
02:02:55,706 --> 02:02:57,835
don't ever speak of it.

1508
02:02:57,836 --> 02:02:59,456
Ever.

1509
02:03:00,937 --> 02:03:03,516
If not,

1510
02:03:04,197 --> 02:03:06,976
I would have to feel sorry for my father

1511
02:03:06,977 --> 02:03:09,455
for being too foolish

1512
02:03:09,456 --> 02:03:10,866
to have trusted you so much.

1513
02:03:16,367 --> 02:03:18,457
It was for you.

1514
02:03:20,626 --> 02:03:22,477
For you,

1515

From the beginning, my father prepared

1518
02:03:39,926 --> 02:03:43,496
all the money and paperwork for you.

1519
02:03:44,956 --> 02:03:48,265
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

1520
02:03:48,266 --> 02:03:51,646
if you just let things run its course,

1521
02:03:51,647 --> 02:03:54,157
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

1522
02:03:58,117 --> 02:04:01,915
I understand that you're an engineer,

1523
02:04:01,916 --> 02:04:03,936
but what about running the company?

1524
02:04:03,937 --> 02:04:06,576
Asking me to manage the money is...

1525
02:04:06,577 --> 02:04:09,856
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

1526
02:04:09,857 --> 02:04:11,116
Sangjun, still...

1527
02:04:11,117 --> 02:04:12,925
On top of that,

1528
02:04:12,926 --> 02:04:15,856
I don't know if I need to run the company.

1529
02:04:15,857 --> 02:04:17,005
I want to hire someone capable,

1530
02:04:17,006 --> 02:04:18,545
and have him run it the way he wants.

1531
02:04:18,546 --> 02:04:20,305
I can focus on technology development,

1532
02:04:20,306 --> 02:04:23,216
and he can help grow the company.

Who in the world

1540

gives all his money to his friend

when he has his own family,

1542
02:05:56,037 --> 02:05:59,085
his own parents, and a wife?

1543
02:05:59,086 --> 02:06:01,357
I don't understand, either.

1544
02:06:02,857 --> 02:06:05,447
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

1545
02:06:07,077 --> 02:06:09,487
why he trusted someone like you.

1546
02:06:11,187 --> 02:06:13,656
What kind of crazy idiot would

1547
02:06:13,657 --> 02:06:17,207
trust his friend with all his money?

1548
02:06:19,327 --> 02:06:22,747
You think I would believe that nonsense?

Taehu Industry's attorney Hong Mungi.

He was one of the people you fired

when Taehu Industry filed for bankruptcy.

1552

Well, I think I'll finish around 5.

I'll see you then.

1558
02:07:57,187 --> 02:07:59,726
I have something to tell you.

1559
02:07:59,727 --> 02:08:01,465
What is it? Tell me now.

1560

I'll tell you later.

Don't say such a thing.

1569
02:09:12,176 --> 02:09:13,876
I'm saying, just in case.

1570
02:09:29,067 --> 02:09:30,527
Hello?

1571
02:09:40,647 --> 02:09:43,937
Who is this, so early in the morning?

1572
02:09:46,157 --> 02:09:47,997

- Come in. / - No, no, wait.

02:09:53,136 --> 02:09:54,947
My coming in isn't important right now.

1576
02:09:55,277 --> 02:09:59,816
Did you meet Sangjun's son Kim Jiwan?

1577
02:09:59,817 --> 02:10:01,385
Did you see him a few days ago?

1578
02:10:01,386 --> 02:10:05,756
Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

1579
02:10:06,586 --> 02:10:09,136
What did you two talk about?

1580
02:10:09,796 --> 02:10:12,726
He asked about the financial state

1581
02:10:12,727 --> 02:10:16,385
of Mr. Kim when he passed away.

1582
02:10:16,386 --> 02:10:21,657
Is there any legal problems?

1583
02:10:23,247 --> 02:10:24,646
Yes,

1584
02:10:24,647 --> 02:10:26,955
when Sangjun died,

1585
02:10:26,956 --> 02:10:29,076
what happened to his assets?

1586
02:10:29,077 --> 02:10:32,616
You know that better than I do.

1587
02:10:32,617 --> 02:10:35,675
He turned everything into cash,

1588
02:10:35,676 --> 02:10:38,385
and invested it into his company.

1589
02:10:38,386 --> 02:10:39,656
Invested it,

1590
02:10:39,657 --> 02:10:40,936
yes.

1591
02:10:40,937 --> 02:10:42,265
Yes, that's right.

1592
02:10:42,266 --> 02:10:43,675
He invested all of it.

1593
02:10:43,676 --> 02:10:45,885
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

1594
02:10:45,886 --> 02:10:53,066
He said he was making you the president.

1595
02:10:53,067 --> 02:10:57,506
Isn't that the same thing?

1596
02:11:05,506 --> 02:11:10,276
I want to give Taesu a chance.

1597
02:11:10,277 --> 02:11:11,826
I want to make it

1598
02:11:11,827 --> 02:11:14,585
so that he can make this company grow.

1599
02:11:14,586 --> 02:11:16,255
Mr. Kim,

1600
02:11:16,256 --> 02:11:18,876
what about your family?

1601
02:11:19,487 --> 02:11:23,317
Putting him in charge of the money is...

1602
02:11:24,187 --> 02:11:27,226
This investment is for my family.

1603
02:11:27,227 --> 02:11:28,796
Excuse me?

1604
02:11:30,617 --> 02:11:32,696
I'm not sure

1605
02:11:32,697 --> 02:11:34,976
how much longer

1606
02:11:34,977 --> 02:11:36,777
my heart will last.

1607
02:11:38,147 --> 02:11:42,125
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

1608
02:11:42,126 --> 02:11:43,636
my wife, and kids?

1609
02:11:45,407 --> 02:11:48,165
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

1610
02:11:48,166 --> 02:11:50,726
any document they want, and my wife

1611
02:11:50,727 --> 02:11:54,786
does not know how to deal with my mother.

1612
02:11:54,787 --> 02:11:59,305
I need someone to be there for my family.

1613
02:11:59,306 --> 02:12:02,675
Money aside, I know Taesu will

1614
02:12:02,676 --> 02:12:05,477
take great care of my family.

1615
02:12:06,697 --> 02:12:11,217
I know what kind of man he is.

1616
02:12:19,857 --> 02:12:22,716
President Jang...

1617
02:12:26,937 --> 02:12:29,106
You,

1618
02:12:29,107 --> 02:12:30,875
you're lying, aren't you?

1619
02:12:30,876 --> 02:12:32,116
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

1620
02:12:32,117 --> 02:12:33,805
How much did it take to pay you off?

1621
02:12:33,806 --> 02:12:35,317
President Jang...

1622
02:12:49,916 --> 02:12:52,295
I need to see you right now.

1623
02:12:52,296 --> 02:12:53,595
Come to my office.

1624
02:12:53,596 --> 02:12:55,835
I'm not interested in seeing you.

1625
02:12:55,836 --> 02:12:57,166
I'm hanging up.

1626
02:13:03,577 --> 02:13:05,027
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

1627
02:13:35,687 --> 02:13:37,595
I just

1628
02:13:37,596 --> 02:13:41,006
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

1629
02:13:42,997 --> 02:13:44,776
Then you must've heard everything.

1630
02:13:44,777 --> 02:13:46,207
Yes.

1631
02:13:48,426 --> 02:13:53,056
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

1632
02:13:53,977 --> 02:13:57,156
Your family's become quite crafty.

1633
02:13:57,157 --> 02:13:58,927
Was it money, or something else?

1634
02:13:58,928 --> 02:14:02,215
How did you make him lie to me like that?

1635
02:14:02,216 --> 02:14:04,656
I remember him as a man of integrity,

1636
02:14:04,657 --> 02:14:06,647
so how did you buy him off?

1637
02:14:09,187 --> 02:14:13,036
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

1638
02:14:13,037 --> 02:14:15,595
Turning Sangjun into a saint

1639
02:14:15,596 --> 02:14:17,986
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

1640
02:14:17,987 --> 02:14:19,425
On top of stealing money, I'd become

1641
02:14:19,426 --> 02:14:23,476
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

1642
02:14:23,477 --> 02:14:25,515
Is that the plan?

1643
02:14:25,516 --> 02:14:28,066
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

1644
02:14:28,067 --> 02:14:30,457
That's what you're afraid of?

1645
02:14:33,897 --> 02:14:36,085
I'm relieved.

1646
02:14:36,086 --> 02:14:39,516
At least you know what you did was wrong.

1647
02:14:43,947 --> 02:14:46,136
Why did you do it?

1648
02:14:48,176 --> 02:14:50,886
You're not that type of person.

1649
02:14:51,697 --> 02:14:54,125
You valued people,

1650
02:14:54,126 --> 02:14:56,696
and you were very understanding.

1651
02:14:58,237 --> 02:15:01,746
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

1652
02:15:01,747 --> 02:15:05,055
trusted you with everything.

1653
02:15:05,056 --> 02:15:07,766
You were upright and kindhearted.

1654
02:15:11,157 --> 02:15:13,237
What happened to you?

1655
02:15:15,336 --> 02:15:19,746
How did you end up here like this,

1656
02:15:19,747 --> 02:15:24,377
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

1657
02:15:34,567 --> 02:15:37,255
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

1658
02:15:37,256 --> 02:15:38,736
bought that lawyer off.

1659
02:15:38,737 --> 02:15:39,896
Taesu, what if...

1660
02:15:39,897 --> 02:15:41,465
What if, what?

1661
02:15:41,466 --> 02:15:43,326
You think it might be true?

1662
02:15:43,327 --> 02:15:45,247
But if it's true, I'm...

1663
02:15:50,386 --> 02:15:51,965
No.

1664
02:15:51,966 --> 02:15:55,125
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

1665
02:15:55,126 --> 02:15:58,305
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

1666
02:15:58,306 --> 02:15:59,117
Wait...

1667
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:00,656
Wait, this means

1668
02:16:00,657 --> 02:16:03,727
he can buy my people off, too.

1669
02:16:05,147 --> 02:16:07,876
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

1670
02:16:08,886 --> 02:16:10,176
Yes, sir.

1671
02:16:19,886 --> 02:16:22,586
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

1672
02:16:23,466 --> 02:16:24,526
I'm Kim Jiwan.

1673
02:16:24,527 --> 02:16:25,827
Have a seat.

1674
02:16:30,647 --> 02:16:34,135
I heard the news from a former employee.

1675
02:16:34,136 --> 02:16:36,516
You've been contacting former directors?

1676
02:16:36,517 --> 02:16:37,976
How many people have you met with?

1677
02:16:37,977 --> 02:16:39,587
About twenty.

1678
02:16:40,456 --> 02:16:42,236
And I've been preparing

1679
02:16:42,237 --> 02:16:44,195
the recordings of their accounts.

1680
02:16:44,196 --> 02:16:45,555
I think I can report the story right away

1681
02:16:45,556 --> 02:16:48,316
if I had a copy of those recordings.

1682
02:16:48,317 --> 02:16:50,666
Can you give me a copy?

1683
02:16:50,667 --> 02:16:51,926
Of course.

1684
02:16:51,927 --> 02:16:54,267
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

1685
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:59,077
Can't fall asleep?

1686
02:18:01,597 --> 02:18:04,097
I can't seem to understand Father.

1687
02:18:05,597 --> 02:18:09,055
Why did he try to put someone like

1688
02:18:09,056 --> 02:18:11,696
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

1689
02:18:13,526 --> 02:18:14,736
That was so foolish.

1690
02:18:14,737 --> 02:18:16,116
Jiwan.

1691
02:18:18,257 --> 02:18:20,897
Don't blame your father.

1692
02:18:21,456 --> 02:18:24,926
Back then, the only person he could trust

1693
02:18:24,927 --> 02:18:27,467
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

1694
02:18:28,616 --> 02:18:31,896
With his health deteriorating,

1695
02:18:31,897 --> 02:18:35,487
your father was afraid of the future.

1696
02:18:36,147 --> 02:18:38,875
And he thought

1697
02:18:38,876 --> 02:18:43,445
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

1698
02:18:43,446 --> 02:18:45,616
He was wrong.

1699
02:18:46,407 --> 02:18:48,455
He trusted the man

1700
02:18:48,456 --> 02:18:51,096
who stole all his money the day he died.

1701
02:18:51,097 --> 02:18:53,955
If it were me,

1702
02:18:53,956 --> 02:18:55,706
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

1703
02:18:57,087 --> 02:18:59,976
He was a different man

1704
02:18:59,977 --> 02:19:02,185
from who he is now.

1705
02:19:02,186 --> 02:19:04,236
And that's why I can't forgive him.

1706
02:19:04,237 --> 02:19:06,316
As a human being,

1707
02:19:06,317 --> 02:19:07,455
you cannot betray someone

1708
02:19:07,456 --> 02:19:09,276
who trusts you.

1709
02:20:54,136 --> 02:20:55,907
Hyeondo.

1710
02:20:58,147 --> 02:21:02,567
Why not resign from your father's company?

1711
02:21:06,536 --> 02:21:10,916
I'll look into another job for you.

1712
02:21:14,647 --> 02:21:16,526
I should go to work.

1713
02:21:27,417 --> 02:21:29,666
Sugyeong came to see you?

1714
02:21:29,667 --> 02:21:33,087
She really begged for your forgiveness?

1715
02:21:34,196 --> 02:21:37,526
Sugyeong looked really bad.

1716
02:21:38,636 --> 02:21:40,896
I think she's miserable.

1717
02:21:40,897 --> 02:21:42,445
She should be.

1718
02:21:42,446 --> 02:21:43,896
Of course.

1719
02:21:43,897 --> 02:21:47,007
If she's not, she's not human.

1720
02:21:47,696 --> 02:21:51,326
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

1721
02:21:51,327 --> 02:21:52,897
What?

1722
02:21:53,647 --> 02:21:57,025
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

1723
02:21:57,026 --> 02:21:59,375
Oh, my.

1724
02:21:59,376 --> 02:22:01,626
You sure are a saint.

1725
02:22:02,276 --> 02:22:04,125
She's going through a rough time after

1726
02:22:04,126 --> 02:22:07,385
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

1727
02:22:07,386 --> 02:22:10,647
You're the one I feel sorry for.

1728
02:22:11,696 --> 02:22:17,226
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

1729
02:22:17,227 --> 02:22:19,025
He's at the hospital.

1730
02:22:19,026 --> 02:22:21,045
Hyeondo?

1731
02:22:21,046 --> 02:22:22,666
How could a child be healthy

1732
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:24,996
when his parents have no morals?

1733
02:22:24,997 --> 02:22:28,767
Karma passes down to children.

1734
02:22:31,556 --> 02:22:35,266
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

1735
02:22:35,886 --> 02:22:37,396
How could I say no to you?

1736
02:22:37,397 --> 02:22:39,705
I had to do it.

1737
02:22:39,706 --> 02:22:41,096
So I was thinking,

1738
02:22:41,097 --> 02:22:43,025
I heard you might end up

1739
02:22:43,026 --> 02:22:45,836
taking over the company.

1740
02:22:45,837 --> 02:22:48,105
There's an idea

1741
02:22:48,106 --> 02:22:51,625
I've been developing for five years,

1742
02:22:51,626 --> 02:22:54,445
and going to Russia gave me

1743
02:22:54,446 --> 02:22:56,516
reaffirmation on my idea.

1744
02:22:56,517 --> 02:22:58,935
So I was wondering

1745
02:22:58,936 --> 02:23:02,185
if you could give me a chance

1746
02:23:02,186 --> 02:23:04,636
to present that idea to you.

1747
02:23:08,517 --> 02:23:10,217
Please don't joke around with me.

1748
02:23:10,907 --> 02:23:12,365
I'm not...

1749
02:23:12,366 --> 02:23:16,045
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

1750
02:23:16,046 --> 02:23:18,125
and made your life difficult.

1751
02:23:18,126 --> 02:23:22,066
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

1752
02:23:22,067 --> 02:23:24,096
yes, like in Chinese novels,

1753
02:23:24,097 --> 02:23:25,646
in order to make someone a hero,

1754
02:23:25,647 --> 02:23:27,726
people around him

1755
02:23:27,727 --> 02:23:30,516
create hardships for him.

1756
02:23:30,517 --> 02:23:32,467
All Chinese heroes are like that.

1757
02:23:32,468 --> 02:23:34,596
They prevail over and over again,

1758
02:23:34,597 --> 02:23:35,587
and accomplish...

1759
02:23:35,588 --> 02:23:37,185
It's okay.

1760
02:23:37,186 --> 02:23:38,116
No, I...

1761
02:23:38,117 --> 02:23:40,157
I said it's okay!

1762
02:23:40,827 --> 02:23:42,135
Why do you keep bugging me!

1763
02:23:42,136 --> 02:23:43,635
I said it's okay!

1764
02:23:43,636 --> 02:23:45,177
Something great.

1765
02:23:47,526 --> 02:23:48,855
I think you're mistaken.

1766
02:23:48,856 --> 02:23:50,316
It's okay.

1767
02:23:50,317 --> 02:23:52,677
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

1768
02:23:53,247 --> 02:23:54,635
No, I'm not mistaken.

1769
02:23:54,636 --> 02:23:56,596
I think you're mistaken.

1770
02:23:56,597 --> 02:23:59,467
It's not like that. Just think about it.

1771
02:23:59,946 --> 02:24:02,775
When you asked me for a favor like that,

1772
02:24:02,776 --> 02:24:06,546
wasn't it because we are close?

1773
02:24:07,587 --> 02:24:09,215
- Yes. / - Right?

1774
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:14,775
So since we share a special relationship,

1775
02:24:14,776 --> 02:24:15,746
let me present it in a special...

1776
02:24:15,747 --> 02:24:16,857
Jiwan.

1777
02:24:17,267 --> 02:24:18,336
Hi, Eunsu.

1778
02:24:18,337 --> 02:24:19,666
Ms. Han Eunsu!

1779
02:24:19,667 --> 02:24:21,766
Oh? Hello.

1780
02:24:21,767 --> 02:24:23,257
What are you doing here?

1781
02:24:25,487 --> 02:24:27,056
Huh?

1782
02:24:29,126 --> 02:24:31,147
She's my little sister.

1783
02:24:32,147 --> 02:24:33,666
Your real sister?

1784
02:24:33,667 --> 02:24:34,787
Yes.

1785
02:24:35,106 --> 02:24:39,736
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

1786
02:24:41,376 --> 02:24:42,926
Jiwan, Eunsu.

1787
02:24:42,927 --> 02:24:44,817
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

1788
02:24:45,407 --> 02:24:46,416
Remember?

1789
02:24:46,417 --> 02:24:49,105
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

1790
02:24:49,106 --> 02:24:50,496
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

1791
02:24:50,497 --> 02:24:51,456
Oh, Aunt.

1792
02:24:51,457 --> 02:24:54,997
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

1793
02:24:56,517 --> 02:24:57,566
Hi.

1794
02:24:57,567 --> 02:25:00,816
I'm Park Haengsuk.

1795
02:25:00,817 --> 02:25:02,035
Excuse me?

1796
02:25:02,036 --> 02:25:03,875
Park...

1797
02:25:03,876 --> 02:25:07,657
You're his aunt, but
your last name is Park?

1798
02:25:09,386 --> 02:25:14,705
Kim, Han and Park.

1799
02:25:14,706 --> 02:25:17,327
A family with different last names?

1800
02:25:22,667 --> 02:25:25,295
What happened?

1801
02:25:25,296 --> 02:25:26,875
Why is that office empty?

1802
02:25:26,876 --> 02:25:29,596
All the desks and chairs are gone.

1803
02:25:29,597 --> 02:25:31,195
Oh, that office?

1804
02:25:31,196 --> 02:25:32,695
They moved out.

1805
02:25:32,696 --> 02:25:34,445
They moved out?

1806
02:25:34,446 --> 02:25:36,625
Where did they go?

1807
02:25:36,626 --> 02:25:38,346
Where are my daughter and husband?

1808
02:25:38,347 --> 02:25:43,347
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

1809
02:25:46,147 --> 02:25:47,696
A, a tent?

1810
02:25:54,556 --> 02:25:55,676
Oh,

1811
02:25:55,677 --> 02:25:59,166
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

1812
02:25:59,167 --> 02:26:00,447
When is the phone guy coming?

1813
02:26:00,448 --> 02:26:02,305
He'll be here at 3.

1814
02:26:02,306 --> 02:26:04,295
Where should the line go?

1815
02:26:04,296 --> 02:26:05,806
I'll find a spot.

1816
02:26:06,186 --> 02:26:07,496
I'll take that, Yeongju.

1817
02:26:14,587 --> 02:26:16,635
You shouldn't bite off
more than you can chew,

1818
02:26:16,636 --> 02:26:18,266
and mingle with your own kind!

1819
02:26:18,267 --> 02:26:21,465
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

1820
02:26:21,466 --> 02:26:23,365
It's my fault for signing a contract

1821
02:26:23,366 --> 02:26:25,935
that says the owner can
evict us at any time.

1822
02:26:25,936 --> 02:26:27,646
How dare you side with Jiwan!

1823
02:26:27,647 --> 02:26:29,616
I'm going to get him for this!

1824
02:26:30,747 --> 02:26:31,857
Honey, Mi...

1825
02:26:35,216 --> 02:26:36,766
What did Mom say?

1826
02:26:38,507 --> 02:26:41,406
She's going to get Jiwan.

1827
02:26:41,407 --> 02:26:42,716
What?

1828
02:26:43,497 --> 02:26:44,437
Seriously...

1829
02:26:44,438 --> 02:26:45,766
Let's hurry up.

1830
02:26:49,727 --> 02:26:51,216
Jiwan, you!

1831
02:26:51,456 --> 02:26:52,327
Hello.

1832
02:26:52,328 --> 02:26:53,626
Just a second.

1833
02:26:54,067 --> 02:26:55,337
Hello.

1834
02:26:56,116 --> 02:26:58,876
It's an important meeting. This way.

1835
02:26:59,327 --> 02:27:01,396
Everything looks great.

1836
02:27:01,397 --> 02:27:05,096
I can see, now that I'm here.

1837
02:27:05,097 --> 02:27:08,726
You put up a makeshift
office near the farm.

1838
02:27:08,727 --> 02:27:12,605
It shows your concern for quality control.

1839
02:27:12,606 --> 02:27:13,896
I just need to sign here, yes?

1840
02:27:13,897 --> 02:27:15,296
Yes.

1841
02:27:20,776 --> 02:27:21,945
Thank you.

1842
02:27:21,946 --> 02:27:22,916
I hope this works out great.

1843
02:27:22,917 --> 02:27:23,947
Thank you.

1844
02:27:29,606 --> 02:27:30,666
Goodbye.

1845
02:27:30,667 --> 02:27:32,945
That guy

1846
02:27:32,946 --> 02:27:34,646
is great at many things.

1847
02:27:34,647 --> 02:27:36,496
He's amazing.

1848
02:27:36,497 --> 02:27:38,917
He performs better under pressure.

1849
02:27:40,296 --> 02:27:42,805
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

1850
02:27:42,806 --> 02:27:44,236
And it's such a hot day.

1851
02:27:44,237 --> 02:27:46,816
Let me get you something cool to drink.

1852
02:27:46,817 --> 02:27:48,136
Mr. Jang.

1853
02:27:54,227 --> 02:27:56,237
This is worth $30,000.

1854
02:28:00,767 --> 02:28:04,135
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

1855
02:28:04,136 --> 02:28:05,926
Hey, cut me some slack.

1856
02:28:05,927 --> 02:28:07,336
I was caught off guard.

1857
02:28:07,337 --> 02:28:08,666
It slipped out.

1858
02:28:08,667 --> 02:28:09,957
I can't believe you.

1859
02:28:10,257 --> 02:28:13,107
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

1860
02:28:14,386 --> 02:28:15,506
Director, you're here.

1861
02:28:15,507 --> 02:28:16,916
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

1862
02:28:16,917 --> 02:28:18,277
Yes.

1863
02:28:19,477 --> 02:28:20,767
What are you doing here?

1864
02:28:21,317 --> 02:28:22,715
What do you think?

1865
02:28:22,716 --> 02:28:24,535
They are working so hard on a hot day,

1866
02:28:24,536 --> 02:28:26,055
so I bought them Korean pork

1867
02:28:26,056 --> 02:28:28,656
to help them restore some energy.

1868
02:28:28,657 --> 02:28:31,535
Domestic is always the best.

1869
02:28:31,536 --> 02:28:33,926
Of course. You're a wise man.

1870
02:28:35,466 --> 02:28:38,125
Honey, don't just stand there.
Come and sit.

1871
02:28:38,126 --> 02:28:39,736
- Come here. / - Yeongju,
come and sit down.

1872
02:28:39,737 --> 02:28:41,205
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

1873
02:28:41,206 --> 02:28:42,305
Let me go get some more lettuce.

1874
02:28:42,306 --> 02:28:43,516
Okay.

1875
02:28:49,737 --> 02:28:50,945
Wait,

1876
02:28:50,946 --> 02:28:53,105
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

1877
02:28:53,106 --> 02:28:54,455
What's going on?

1878
02:28:54,456 --> 02:28:55,736
Oh, I can't believe you.

1879
02:28:55,737 --> 02:28:57,795
When? People might actually believe that.

1880
02:28:57,796 --> 02:28:59,896
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

1881
02:28:59,897 --> 02:29:03,365
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

1882
02:29:03,366 --> 02:29:06,156
so I bought him Korean pork,

1883
02:29:06,157 --> 02:29:08,096
to help him restore energy.

1884
02:29:08,097 --> 02:29:10,555
Why are you just sitting there?

1885
02:29:10,556 --> 02:29:12,336
Go and help wash the lettuce.

1886
02:29:12,337 --> 02:29:13,527
Go help Jiwan.

1887
02:29:13,977 --> 02:29:15,446
Okay.

1888
02:29:17,097 --> 02:29:20,875
I'm a great judge of character.

1889
02:29:20,876 --> 02:29:24,685
Mom, just have one spoonful.

1890
02:29:24,686 --> 02:29:25,556
Say ah.

1891
02:29:25,557 --> 02:29:28,535
I don't want any chicken porridge.

1892
02:29:28,536 --> 02:29:31,465
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

1893
02:29:31,466 --> 02:29:33,965
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

1894
02:29:33,966 --> 02:29:36,635
so you can restore energy, okay?

1895
02:29:36,636 --> 02:29:38,855
Just have one spoonful.

1896
02:29:38,856 --> 02:29:39,986
Say ah.

1897
02:29:45,917 --> 02:29:47,836
See?

1898
02:29:47,837 --> 02:29:50,726
You're upset because of what you said.

1899
02:29:50,727 --> 02:29:53,146
I didn't say anything wrong.

1900
02:29:53,147 --> 02:29:56,506
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

1901
02:29:56,507 --> 02:29:59,447
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

1902
02:30:01,157 --> 02:30:02,826
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

1903
02:30:02,827 --> 02:30:05,277
and meets someone nice.

1904
02:30:06,237 --> 02:30:08,556
I'm sure she will.

1905
02:30:09,147 --> 02:30:11,817
Couples form and break up all the time.

1906
02:30:13,946 --> 02:30:17,016
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

1907
02:30:17,017 --> 02:30:20,267
Jiwan has no time for that.

1908
02:30:22,407 --> 02:30:23,616
This?

1909
02:30:26,917 --> 02:30:28,417
You see,

1910
02:30:28,897 --> 02:30:32,526
here are the size and unit.

1911
02:30:35,786 --> 02:30:37,766
Hi.

1912
02:30:40,077 --> 02:30:43,286
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1913
02:30:43,587 --> 02:30:45,736
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

1914
02:30:45,737 --> 02:30:47,417
But why are you here?

1915
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:52,295
Oh, I'm stuffed.

1916
02:30:52,296 --> 02:30:56,176
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

1917
02:30:56,177 --> 02:30:57,656
You ate a lot of it.

1918
02:30:57,657 --> 02:30:59,157
Because it was delicious.

1919
02:31:02,116 --> 02:31:05,246
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

1920
02:31:05,247 --> 02:31:07,367
It's okay. I can go home alone.

1921
02:31:07,796 --> 02:31:08,716
Don't say that.

1922
02:31:08,717 --> 02:31:10,996
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

1923
02:31:10,997 --> 02:31:12,096
Take her home.

1924
02:31:12,097 --> 02:31:13,607
No, that's not going to happen.

1925
02:31:13,608 --> 02:31:15,166
Don't say that. Just go.

1926
02:31:15,167 --> 02:31:16,736
What are you two doing?

1927
02:31:16,737 --> 02:31:18,135
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

1928
02:31:18,136 --> 02:31:20,045
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

1929
02:31:20,046 --> 02:31:21,326
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

1930
02:31:21,327 --> 02:31:22,286
Okay.

1931
02:31:22,287 --> 02:31:23,647
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

1932
02:31:35,556 --> 02:31:37,686
Are those two dating?

1933
02:31:38,376 --> 02:31:40,496
They're not together yet,

1934
02:31:40,497 --> 02:31:43,417
but they are testing the waters.

1935
02:31:45,237 --> 02:31:47,916
It's frustrating to watch them.

1936
02:31:47,917 --> 02:31:49,546
Yeongju...

1937
02:31:50,276 --> 02:31:51,705
She's nice.

1938
02:31:51,706 --> 02:31:53,045
She is.

1939
02:31:53,046 --> 02:31:55,236
She's pretty and pleasant.

1940
02:31:55,237 --> 02:31:58,486
And she's a teacher.

1941
02:31:58,487 --> 02:31:59,635
Don't you think they look good together?

1942
02:31:59,636 --> 02:32:01,327
Yes, they do.

1943
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:12,996
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

1944
02:32:37,347 --> 02:32:39,875
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

1945
02:32:39,876 --> 02:32:41,737
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

1946
02:32:43,427 --> 02:32:45,007
I'm just practicing.

1947
02:32:45,417 --> 02:32:46,957
Practicing?

1948
02:32:50,606 --> 02:32:52,775
Oh, I get it.

1949
02:32:52,776 --> 02:32:53,805
Girl...

1950
02:32:53,806 --> 02:32:57,195
You have a good eye.

1951
02:32:57,196 --> 02:32:58,006
What do you mean?

1952
02:32:58,007 --> 02:32:59,885
Jiwan.

1953
02:32:59,886 --> 02:33:01,566
Who cares about education?

1954
02:33:01,567 --> 02:33:05,066
To me, money trumps everything.

1955
02:33:05,067 --> 02:33:08,067
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

1956
02:33:10,587 --> 02:33:12,426
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

1957
02:33:12,427 --> 02:33:14,705
Eunsu is easy.

1958
02:33:14,706 --> 02:33:18,136
The grandmother-in-law
will become forgetful.

1959
02:33:18,747 --> 02:33:22,685
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

1960
02:33:22,686 --> 02:33:24,576
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

1961
02:33:24,577 --> 02:33:25,935
I told you it's not like that.

1962
02:33:25,936 --> 02:33:26,806
Just leave me alone.

1963
02:33:26,807 --> 02:33:29,695
How could I leave you alone?

1964
02:33:29,696 --> 02:33:31,346
You won't go on blind dates,

1965
02:33:31,347 --> 02:33:33,677
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

1966
02:33:34,727 --> 02:33:36,215
If it were me in the old days,

1967
02:33:36,216 --> 02:33:38,136
I would've already...

1968
02:33:38,886 --> 02:33:40,605
What's the use of giving you my looks?

1969
02:33:40,606 --> 02:33:42,256
Just look at yourself.

1970
02:33:42,257 --> 02:33:45,336
You're dressed like a tomboy,

1971
02:33:45,337 --> 02:33:47,215
and you haven't taken a shower.

1972
02:33:47,216 --> 02:33:50,166
You need to make yourself look pretty!

1973
02:33:50,167 --> 02:33:52,857
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

1974
02:33:52,858 --> 02:33:55,355
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

1975
02:33:55,356 --> 02:33:56,826
You have to look pretty!

1976
02:33:56,827 --> 02:33:58,687
What good will cooking do for you?

1977
02:33:58,688 --> 02:34:00,055
Besides your pretty face,

1978
02:34:00,056 --> 02:34:02,805
you got nothing from me!

1979
02:34:02,806 --> 02:34:05,116
What do you mean? Like this?

1980
02:34:08,077 --> 02:34:09,246
Oh, you're impossible.

1981
02:34:09,247 --> 02:34:11,697
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

1982
02:34:11,698 --> 02:34:14,567
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

1983
02:34:17,147 --> 02:34:18,215
Minja.

1984
02:34:18,216 --> 02:34:19,136
Oh!

1985
02:34:19,136 --> 02:34:20,106
Ms. Lee!

1986
02:34:20,107 --> 02:34:21,156
What are you doing here?

1987
02:34:21,157 --> 02:34:24,455
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

1988
02:34:24,456 --> 02:34:25,946
What about you?

1989
02:34:26,587 --> 02:34:29,437
Yeongju's been complaining
about neck pain, too.

1990
02:34:30,727 --> 02:34:32,006
Well,

1991
02:34:32,007 --> 02:34:35,617
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

1992
02:34:37,097 --> 02:34:38,426
I've given up on that.

1993
02:34:38,427 --> 02:34:39,777
How they feel about each
other is important,

1994
02:34:39,778 --> 02:34:41,506
not their background.

1995
02:34:41,956 --> 02:34:44,766
You're right!

1996
02:34:44,767 --> 02:34:49,947
But I heard you hold education very high.

1997
02:34:50,827 --> 02:34:54,115
If they're in love,
education doesn't matter.

1998
02:34:54,116 --> 02:34:57,157
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

1999
02:34:57,897 --> 02:35:03,017
But isn't a small family better?

2000
02:35:03,847 --> 02:35:07,185
I would prefer a small family,

2001
02:35:07,186 --> 02:35:08,586
but these days, as complicated as it is,

2002
02:35:08,587 --> 02:35:11,875
people don't live with married children.

2003
02:35:11,876 --> 02:35:14,296
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

2004
02:35:15,436 --> 02:35:16,996
But that's...

2005
02:35:16,997 --> 02:35:18,836
Well...

2006
02:35:18,837 --> 02:35:21,205
Old people don't live forever.

2007
02:35:21,206 --> 02:35:23,907
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

2008
02:35:24,436 --> 02:35:26,955
I'm not going to let my daughter

2009
02:35:26,956 --> 02:35:28,766
date anyone with a large family.

2010
02:35:28,767 --> 02:35:31,176
What if she gets stuck with them?

2011
02:35:31,177 --> 02:35:32,997
That won't be good.

2012
02:35:34,626 --> 02:35:37,806
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

2013
02:35:38,147 --> 02:35:39,916
As long as they live separately,

2014
02:35:39,917 --> 02:35:42,486
you don't mind a big family?

2015
02:35:42,487 --> 02:35:44,035
Of course not.

2016
02:35:44,036 --> 02:35:46,336
As long as they are in love.

2017
02:35:47,216 --> 02:35:48,106
Why do you ask?

2018
02:35:48,107 --> 02:35:51,896
You have someone in mind?

2019
02:35:51,897 --> 02:35:53,347
Of course.

2020
02:35:55,167 --> 02:35:57,327
- You do? / - Yes.

2021
02:36:08,497 --> 02:36:11,266
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

2022
02:36:11,267 --> 02:36:15,025
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

2023
02:36:15,026 --> 02:36:18,066
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

2024
02:36:18,067 --> 02:36:21,275
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

2025
02:36:21,276 --> 02:36:22,855
There are protocols for reporters...

2026
02:36:22,856 --> 02:36:24,445
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

2027
02:36:24,446 --> 02:36:27,166
former directors will be giving statements!

2028
02:36:27,167 --> 02:36:28,555
Tell me if it's true,

2029
02:36:28,556 --> 02:36:30,805
or if it's slander!

2030
02:36:30,806 --> 02:36:33,715
President Jang!

2031
02:36:33,716 --> 02:36:34,837
Please leave.

2032
02:36:38,147 --> 02:36:40,177
Refuse all interviews.

2033
02:36:40,796 --> 02:36:42,337
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

2034
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:45,666
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

2035
02:36:45,667 --> 02:36:47,707
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

2036
02:36:49,577 --> 02:36:50,805
If he had all the evidence,

2037
02:36:50,806 --> 02:36:52,927
he would've written about it already.

2038
02:36:53,686 --> 02:36:56,176
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

2039
02:36:56,177 --> 02:36:59,525
I told you to find him, by any means!

2040
02:36:59,526 --> 02:37:00,366
What are you doing?

2041
02:37:00,367 --> 02:37:02,196
Is it that you can't or won't?

2042
02:37:04,556 --> 02:37:06,275
Seokjin was

2043
02:37:06,276 --> 02:37:09,016
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

2044
02:37:09,017 --> 02:37:11,017
and is still with us today.

2045
02:37:12,097 --> 02:37:15,305
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

2046
02:37:15,306 --> 02:37:17,716
whenever we reach a new milestone.

2047
02:37:19,106 --> 02:37:22,965
Hyeokju practically lived with us

2048
02:37:22,966 --> 02:37:24,647
at the factory.

2049
02:37:25,767 --> 02:37:28,226
So how could I

2050
02:37:28,227 --> 02:37:31,636
dig into their past, and make threats?

2051
02:37:32,616 --> 02:37:34,147
Taesu!

2052
02:37:37,577 --> 02:37:40,107
You've been paid off, too?

2053
02:37:42,567 --> 02:37:45,656
I know you met with Seokjin.

2054
02:37:45,657 --> 02:37:47,837
I wasn't sure.

2055
02:37:48,327 --> 02:37:49,646
So, what did you get from them?

2056
02:37:49,647 --> 02:37:52,577
How much did they pay you!

2057
02:37:53,206 --> 02:37:54,596
Taesu...

2058
02:37:54,597 --> 02:37:55,846
Get out.

2059
02:37:55,847 --> 02:37:56,827
You're fired!

2060
02:37:56,828 --> 02:37:58,197
Get lost!

2061
02:39:00,347 --> 02:39:01,997
Hyeondo,

2062
02:39:02,727 --> 02:39:05,455
I once told your father

2063
02:39:05,456 --> 02:39:07,747
to watch his back because of you.

2064
02:39:10,356 --> 02:39:12,736
And he said to me,

2065
02:39:14,397 --> 02:39:16,456
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

2066
02:39:17,657 --> 02:39:19,636
Because you're his son.

2067
02:39:23,747 --> 02:39:25,767
Look after Taesu.

2068
02:39:27,987 --> 02:39:30,487
I can't seem to do it anymore.

2069
02:40:24,376 --> 02:40:27,726
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

2070
02:40:27,727 --> 02:40:29,597
This is Kim Jiwan.

2071
02:40:30,827 --> 02:40:34,216
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

2072
02:40:41,286 --> 02:40:42,907
Yes, Mr. Han.

2073
02:40:44,167 --> 02:40:45,847
I'm on my way.

2074
02:41:44,526 --> 02:41:46,086
Your father was going to

2075
02:41:47,296 --> 02:41:50,886
hand over his company to my father?

2076
02:41:54,167 --> 02:41:56,667
I couldn't understand him at first,

2077
02:41:58,946 --> 02:42:01,945
but now that I think about it,

2078
02:42:01,946 --> 02:42:03,876
I can understand him a little bit.

2079
02:42:17,427 --> 02:42:19,547
This is all the evidence I've collected.

2080
02:42:23,907 --> 02:42:25,796
Why are you giving them to me?

2081
02:42:30,936 --> 02:42:32,955
Why did you

2082
02:42:32,956 --> 02:42:35,116
give me that notebook?

2083
02:43:08,517 --> 02:43:09,837
Have you had a lot to drink?

2084
02:43:11,167 --> 02:43:14,687
You asked me here, so why are you late?

2085
02:43:19,306 --> 02:43:21,237
I met Jiwan.

2086
02:43:24,667 --> 02:43:26,947
Uncle Sangjun

2087
02:43:28,626 --> 02:43:31,936
was going to give you all his money?

2088
02:43:32,686 --> 02:43:34,596
That's a lie.

2089
02:43:35,366 --> 02:43:37,286
Right?

2090
02:43:40,747 --> 02:43:43,605
Who would actually do that?

2091
02:43:43,606 --> 02:43:45,935
Why would he give you his company

2092
02:43:45,936 --> 02:43:48,555
when he has a son and a family?

2093
02:43:48,556 --> 02:43:50,477
That's ridiculous.

2094
02:43:51,136 --> 02:43:52,956
You were just a friend.

2095
02:43:54,077 --> 02:43:55,867
Not his blood.

2096
02:43:59,897 --> 02:44:01,806
Don't you agree?

2097
02:44:03,446 --> 02:44:05,026
Yes.

2098
02:44:05,626 --> 02:44:07,606
I'm not his blood.

2099
02:44:10,497 --> 02:44:12,806
But,

2100
02:44:13,636 --> 02:44:16,385
even though I wasn't his blood,

2101
02:44:16,386 --> 02:44:20,025
Sangjun might have actually really

2102
02:44:20,026 --> 02:44:24,176
wanted to give me his company.

2103
02:44:27,167 --> 02:44:30,736
But why...

2104
02:44:30,737 --> 02:44:33,257
How could he trust me so much?

2105
02:45:10,727 --> 02:45:11,966
Jiwan.

2106
02:45:15,366 --> 02:45:18,705
Do you

2107
02:45:18,706 --> 02:45:21,586
remember Dad?

2108
02:45:24,616 --> 02:45:26,477
A little bit.

2109
02:45:29,587 --> 02:45:35,327
What kind of person was he?

2110
02:45:38,206 --> 02:45:41,397
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

2111
02:45:48,946 --> 02:45:51,506
Why did

2112
02:45:53,376 --> 02:45:57,686
Dad trust a man like him?

2113
02:45:59,876 --> 02:46:02,477
He was so foolish.

2114
02:46:06,946 --> 02:46:09,926
You think so, too, don't you?

2115
02:47:20,626 --> 02:47:22,046
How have you been?

2116
02:47:34,927 --> 02:47:36,997
Don't turn bad.

2117
02:47:39,466 --> 02:47:42,136
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

2118
02:47:53,067 --> 02:47:54,677
I should go.

2119
02:48:34,686 --> 02:48:35,926
The Korean Businessmen's Association

2120
02:48:35,927 --> 02:48:39,747
recommended you as a next chairperson.

2121
02:48:40,206 --> 02:48:44,136
You're to give an acceptance speech.

2122
02:48:45,587 --> 02:48:46,826
Okay.

2123
02:48:46,827 --> 02:48:48,306
I got it.

2124
02:48:48,886 --> 02:48:50,336
Oh, and

2125
02:48:50,337 --> 02:48:52,435
call my wife's lawyer,

2126
02:48:52,436 --> 02:48:54,455
and have him visit me here.

2127
02:48:54,456 --> 02:48:55,897
Yes, sir.

2128
02:49:03,987 --> 02:49:05,937
President Jang wants to see you

2129
02:49:05,938 --> 02:49:07,816
before going to court.

2130
02:49:09,116 --> 02:49:10,746
What is it about?

2131
02:49:10,747 --> 02:49:13,337
He said he will tell you in person.

2132
02:50:06,827 --> 02:50:10,025
You like the coffee here, don't you?

2133
02:50:10,026 --> 02:50:12,955
You didn't call me here for coffee.

2134
02:50:12,956 --> 02:50:14,956
What is this about?

2135
02:50:16,007 --> 02:50:18,216
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

2136
02:50:19,067 --> 02:50:20,687
Excuse me.

2137
02:50:42,466 --> 02:50:45,705
I came because you like it here,

2138
02:50:45,706 --> 02:50:47,326
but to me, the company

2139
02:50:47,327 --> 02:50:50,477
vending machine coffee's the best.

2140
02:50:51,696 --> 02:50:55,756
You've always had cheap taste.

2141
02:50:55,757 --> 02:50:57,096
What?

2142
02:50:57,097 --> 02:50:59,277
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

2143
02:50:59,847 --> 02:51:02,226
No,

2144
02:51:02,227 --> 02:51:04,456
it was easy for me.

2145
02:51:07,147 --> 02:51:08,826
Successful men

2146
02:51:08,827 --> 02:51:12,375
always get a mistress first.

2147
02:51:12,376 --> 02:51:14,676
But

2148
02:51:14,677 --> 02:51:17,736
you have simple taste in everything.

2149
02:51:17,737 --> 02:51:19,885
Vending machine coffee, soju,

2150
02:51:19,886 --> 02:51:21,927
and roasted rice tea after meals.

2151
02:51:23,206 --> 02:51:25,796
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

2152
02:51:27,556 --> 02:51:30,746
I did have simple taste,

2153
02:51:30,747 --> 02:51:33,347
but it was never cheap.

2154
02:51:36,237 --> 02:51:41,135
I loved having you

2155
02:51:41,136 --> 02:51:42,927
as my husband.

2156
02:51:45,757 --> 02:51:49,096
I respected you

2157
02:51:49,097 --> 02:51:53,917
more than anyone.

2158
02:51:58,767 --> 02:52:01,836
If you are willing to change,

2159
02:52:01,837 --> 02:52:04,767
nothing will change between us.

2160
02:52:12,786 --> 02:52:17,445
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

2161
02:52:17,446 --> 02:52:20,716
without his money and honor?

2162
02:52:24,487 --> 02:52:27,847
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

2163
02:52:38,747 --> 02:52:40,336
This is the divorce papers.

2164
02:52:40,337 --> 02:52:42,355
I already signed it,

2165
02:52:42,356 --> 02:52:44,386
so you take care of the rest.

2166
02:54:27,917 --> 02:54:31,136
Are you sure you want to let this go?

2167
02:54:32,267 --> 02:54:34,757
You won't regret it?

2168
02:54:36,577 --> 02:54:39,007
That was what Father wanted.

2169
02:54:40,247 --> 02:54:42,525
If President Jang

2170
02:54:42,526 --> 02:54:46,397
doesn't change his ways after finding out

2171
02:54:47,296 --> 02:54:49,997
what Father wanted, he'll
be more miserable.

2172
02:55:10,317 --> 02:55:13,455
Hello, everyone.

2173
02:55:13,456 --> 02:55:15,965
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

2174
02:55:15,966 --> 02:55:19,407
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

2175
02:55:25,356 --> 02:55:29,256
There are many senior entrepreneurs

2176
02:55:29,257 --> 02:55:31,066
and colleagues who deserve the award,

2177
02:55:31,067 --> 02:55:32,795
so I feel a very big responsibility

2178
02:55:32,796 --> 02:55:35,036
to win this accolade.

2179
02:55:35,477 --> 02:55:40,146
And it's an honor to have the position

2180
02:55:40,147 --> 02:55:43,147
to represent all entrepreneurs.

2181
02:55:44,546 --> 02:55:48,355
Sitting here

2182
02:55:48,356 --> 02:55:50,966
brings back old memories.

2183
02:55:53,737 --> 02:55:59,177
I had a friend.

2184
02:55:59,767 --> 02:56:03,736
He trusted me when I had nothing,

2185
02:56:03,737 --> 02:56:08,317
and helped me get to where I am today.

2186
02:56:08,917 --> 02:56:11,135
He was the president of Taehu Industry

2187
02:56:11,136 --> 02:56:14,237
where Best Global began.

2188

Kim Sangjun.

2189
02:56:21,956 --> 02:56:25,727
That was my friend's name.

2190
02:56:26,347 --> 02:56:29,666
He was naively trusting,

2191
02:56:29,667 --> 02:56:32,146
and honest

2192
02:56:32,147 --> 02:56:35,817
even to a fault.

2193
02:56:37,147 --> 02:56:39,885
I considered his company

2194
02:56:39,886 --> 02:56:43,337
as my own,

2195
02:56:44,657 --> 02:56:47,587
and worked hard.

2196
02:56:55,427 --> 02:56:58,685
But,

2197
02:56:58,686 --> 02:57:02,736
I

2198
02:57:02,737 --> 02:57:05,857
Stole...

2199
02:57:18,577 --> 02:57:20,997
All of his money.

2200
02:57:23,897 --> 02:57:25,366
What did he just say?

2201
02:57:43,647 --> 02:57:47,386
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

2202
02:57:49,337 --> 02:57:50,957
May I help you?

2203
02:57:54,817 --> 02:57:57,006
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

2204
02:57:57,007 --> 02:57:59,747
How dare you come here!

2205
02:58:00,837 --> 02:58:02,567
Jang Hyeondo?

2206
02:58:03,446 --> 02:58:05,545
You're that guy?

2207
02:58:05,546 --> 02:58:06,885
How dare you show your face here?

2208
02:58:06,886 --> 02:58:08,577
Get out.

2209
02:58:21,977 --> 02:58:24,167
I'm sorry.

2210
02:58:25,397 --> 02:58:28,626
That's all I can say.

2211
02:58:38,776 --> 02:58:40,317
Yes.

2212
02:58:41,206 --> 02:58:46,756
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

2213
02:58:46,757 --> 02:58:50,375
and bought their shares for pennies.

2214
02:58:50,376 --> 02:58:54,756
And I even kicked his family out

2215
02:58:54,757 --> 02:58:57,687
from their house.

2216
02:59:01,776 --> 02:59:04,516
And so I used

2217
02:59:04,517 --> 02:59:08,587
the stolen money,

2218
02:59:10,546 --> 02:59:14,716
and built my own company.

Stocks.

2229
03:01:49,796 --> 03:01:52,936
And he's resigning from his position.

2230
03:01:53,767 --> 03:01:56,726
Why are they so dense,

2231
03:01:56,727 --> 03:01:57,875
when I'm trying to help them?

2232
03:01:57,876 --> 03:01:59,885
They should at least try to

go on a few dates.

2238
03:02:54,126 --> 03:02:56,596
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

2240

It's not that simple in the real world.

2241
03:03:03,487 --> 03:03:05,677
Is that your way of doing things?

and stealing all of his money?

2244
03:03:12,866 --> 03:03:15,846
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

2245
03:03:15,847 --> 03:03:17,637
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

2246
03:03:17,638 --> 03:03:20,487
I said he was already
dead when I got there!

2247
03:03:23,767 --> 03:03:25,087
Sure.

2248
03:03:27,186 --> 03:03:30,326
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

2249

keep telling that story.

2250

Even if

2251
03:03:35,106 --> 03:03:38,416
you made my father die,

2252
03:03:38,417 --> 03:03:40,545
don't ever speak of it.

2253
03:03:40,546 --> 03:03:42,167
Ever.

2254
03:03:43,647 --> 03:03:46,227
If not,

2255
03:03:46,907 --> 03:03:49,685
I would have to feel sorry for my father

2256
03:03:49,686 --> 03:03:52,166
for being too foolish

2257
03:03:52,167 --> 03:03:53,577
to have trusted you so much.

2258
03:03:59,077 --> 03:04:01,167
It was for you.

2259
03:04:03,337 --> 03:04:05,187
For you,

2260
03:04:06,827 --> 03:04:09,357
for an ingrate like you,

2261
03:04:11,647 --> 03:04:13,757
my father did all the work.

2262
03:04:19,487 --> 03:04:22,635
From the beginning, my father prepared

2263
03:04:22,636 --> 03:04:26,206
all the money and paperwork for you.

2264
03:04:27,667 --> 03:04:30,976
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

2265
03:04:30,977 --> 03:04:34,355
if you just let things run its course,

2266
03:04:34,356 --> 03:04:36,866
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

2267
03:04:40,827 --> 03:04:44,625
I understand that you're an engineer,

2268
03:04:44,626 --> 03:04:46,646
but what about running the company?

2269
03:04:46,647 --> 03:04:49,285
Asking me to manage the money is...

2270
03:04:49,286 --> 03:04:52,566
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

2271

Sangjun, still...

2272
03:04:53,827 --> 03:04:55,635
On top of that,

2273
03:04:55,636 --> 03:04:58,566
I don't know if I need to run the company.

2274
03:04:58,567 --> 03:04:59,715
I want to hire someone capable,

2275
03:04:59,716 --> 03:05:01,256
and have him run it the way he wants.

2276
03:05:01,257 --> 03:05:03,016
I can focus on technology development,

2277
03:05:03,017 --> 03:05:05,927

I don't understand, either.

why he trusted someone like you.

You know that better than I do.

2332

He turned everything into cash,

2333

and invested it into his company.

2334

03:12:02,196 --> 03:12:06,026
Putting him in charge of the money is...

2347
03:12:06,897 --> 03:12:09,935
This investment is for my family.

2348
03:12:09,936 --> 03:12:11,506
Excuse me?

2349
03:12:13,327 --> 03:12:15,406
I'm not sure

2350
03:12:15,407 --> 03:12:17,685
how much longer

2351
03:12:17,686 --> 03:12:19,486
my heart will last.

2352
03:12:20,856 --> 03:12:24,836
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

2353
03:12:24,837 --> 03:12:26,347
my wife, and kids?

2354
03:12:28,116 --> 03:12:30,875
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

2355
03:12:30,876 --> 03:12:33,435
any document they want, and my wife

2356
03:12:33,436 --> 03:12:37,496
does not know how to deal with my mother.

2357
03:12:37,497 --> 03:12:42,016
I need someone to be there for my family.

2358
03:12:42,017 --> 03:12:45,385
Money aside, I know Taesu will

2359
03:12:45,386 --> 03:12:48,186
take great care of my family.

2360
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:53,927
I know what kind of man he is.

2361
03:13:02,567 --> 03:13:05,427
President Jang...

2362
03:13:09,647 --> 03:13:11,816
You,

2363
03:13:11,817 --> 03:13:13,586
you're lying, aren't you?

2364
03:13:13,587 --> 03:13:14,826
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

2365
03:13:14,827 --> 03:13:16,516
How much did it take to pay you off?

2366
03:13:16,517 --> 03:13:18,027
President Jang...

2367
03:13:32,626 --> 03:13:35,006
I need to see you right now.

2368
03:13:35,007 --> 03:13:36,305
Come to my office.

2369
03:13:36,306 --> 03:13:38,545
I'm not interested in seeing you.

2370
03:13:38,546 --> 03:13:39,876
I'm hanging up.

2371
03:13:46,286 --> 03:13:47,737
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

2372
03:14:18,397 --> 03:14:20,305
I just

2373
03:14:20,306 --> 03:14:23,716
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

2374
03:14:25,706 --> 03:14:27,486
Then you must've heard everything.

2375
03:14:27,487 --> 03:14:28,917
Yes.

2376
03:14:31,136 --> 03:14:35,766
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

2377
03:14:36,686 --> 03:14:39,865
Your family's become quite crafty.

2378
03:14:39,866 --> 03:14:41,635
Was it money, or something else?

2379
03:14:41,636 --> 03:14:44,926
How did you make him lie to me like that?

2380
03:14:44,927 --> 03:14:47,367
I remember him as a man of integrity,

2381
03:14:47,368 --> 03:14:49,356
so how did you buy him off?

2382
03:14:51,897 --> 03:14:55,746
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

2383
03:14:55,747 --> 03:14:58,305
Turning Sangjun into a saint

2384
03:14:58,306 --> 03:15:00,695
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

2385
03:15:00,696 --> 03:15:02,135
On top of stealing money, I'd become

2386
03:15:02,136 --> 03:15:06,185
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

2387
03:15:06,186 --> 03:15:08,226
Is that the plan?

2388
03:15:08,227 --> 03:15:10,775
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

2389
03:15:10,776 --> 03:15:13,166
That's what you're afraid of?

2390
03:15:16,606 --> 03:15:18,795
I'm relieved.

2391
03:15:18,796 --> 03:15:22,227
At least you know what you did was wrong.

2392
03:15:26,657 --> 03:15:28,847
Why did you do it?

2393
03:15:30,886 --> 03:15:33,596
You're not that type of person.

2394
03:15:34,407 --> 03:15:36,836
You valued people,

2395
03:15:36,837 --> 03:15:39,407
and you were very understanding.

2396
03:15:40,946 --> 03:15:44,455
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

2397
03:15:44,456 --> 03:15:47,766
trusted you with everything.

2398
03:15:47,767 --> 03:15:50,477
You were upright and kindhearted.

2399
03:15:53,866 --> 03:15:55,946
What happened to you?

2400
03:15:58,046 --> 03:16:02,455
How did you end up here like this,

2401
03:16:02,456 --> 03:16:07,086
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

2402
03:16:17,276 --> 03:16:19,965
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

2403
03:16:19,966 --> 03:16:21,445
bought that lawyer off.

2404
03:16:21,446 --> 03:16:22,605
Taesu, what if...

2405
03:16:22,606 --> 03:16:24,176
What if, what?

2406
03:16:24,177 --> 03:16:26,035
You think it might be true?

2407
03:16:26,036 --> 03:16:27,956
But if it's true, I'm...

2408
03:16:33,097 --> 03:16:34,676
No.

2409
03:16:34,677 --> 03:16:37,836
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

2410
03:16:37,837 --> 03:16:41,016
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

2411
03:16:41,017 --> 03:16:41,827
Wait...

2412
03:16:41,828 --> 03:16:43,365
Wait, this means

2413
03:16:43,366 --> 03:16:46,436
he can buy my people off, too.

2414
03:16:47,856 --> 03:16:50,586
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

2415
03:16:51,597 --> 03:16:52,887
Yes, sir.

2416
03:17:02,597 --> 03:17:05,297
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

2417
03:17:06,177 --> 03:17:07,236
I'm Kim Jiwan.

2418
03:17:07,237 --> 03:17:08,536
Have a seat.

2419
03:17:13,356 --> 03:17:16,846
I heard the news from a former employee.

2420
03:17:16,847 --> 03:17:19,226
You've been contacting former directors?

2421
03:17:19,227 --> 03:17:20,685
How many people have you met with?

2422
03:17:20,686 --> 03:17:22,296
About twenty.

2423
03:17:23,167 --> 03:17:24,945
And I've been preparing

2424
03:17:24,946 --> 03:17:26,906
the recordings of their accounts.

2425
03:17:26,907 --> 03:17:28,266
I think I can report the story right away

2426
03:17:28,267 --> 03:17:31,025
if I had a copy of those recordings.

2427
03:17:31,026 --> 03:17:33,375
Can you give me a copy?

2428
03:17:33,376 --> 03:17:34,635
Of course.

2429
03:17:34,636 --> 03:17:36,977
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

2430
03:18:39,186 --> 03:18:41,786
Can't fall asleep?

2431
03:18:44,306 --> 03:18:46,806
I can't seem to understand Father.

2432
03:18:48,306 --> 03:18:51,766
Why did he try to put someone like

2433
03:18:51,767 --> 03:18:54,407
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

2434
03:18:56,237 --> 03:18:57,445
That was so foolish.

2435
03:18:57,446 --> 03:18:58,826
Jiwan.

2436
03:19:00,966 --> 03:19:03,606
Don't blame your father.

2437
03:19:04,167 --> 03:19:07,635
Back then, the only person he could trust

2438
03:19:07,636 --> 03:19:10,177
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

2439
03:19:11,327 --> 03:19:14,605
With his health deteriorating,

2440
03:19:14,606 --> 03:19:18,196
your father was afraid of the future.

2441
03:19:18,856 --> 03:19:21,586
And he thought

2442
03:19:21,587 --> 03:19:26,156
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

2443
03:19:26,157 --> 03:19:28,327
He was wrong.

2444
03:19:29,116 --> 03:19:31,166
He trusted the man

2445
03:19:31,167 --> 03:19:33,805
who stole all his money the day he died.

2446
03:19:33,806 --> 03:19:36,666
If it were me,

2447
03:19:36,667 --> 03:19:38,417
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

2448
03:19:39,796 --> 03:19:42,685
He was a different man

2449
03:19:42,686 --> 03:19:44,896
from who he is now.

2450
03:19:44,897 --> 03:19:46,945
And that's why I can't forgive him.

2451
03:19:46,946 --> 03:19:49,025
As a human being,

2452
03:19:49,026 --> 03:19:50,166
you cannot betray someone

2453
03:19:50,167 --> 03:19:51,987
who trusts you.

2454
03:21:36,847 --> 03:21:38,617
Hyeondo.

2455
03:21:40,856 --> 03:21:45,276
Why not resign from your father's company?

2456
03:21:49,247 --> 03:21:53,626
I'll look into another job for you.

2457
03:21:57,356 --> 03:21:59,236
I should go to work.

2458
03:22:10,126 --> 03:22:12,375
Sugyeong came to see you?

2459
03:22:12,376 --> 03:22:15,796
She really begged for your forgiveness?

2460
03:22:16,907 --> 03:22:20,237
Sugyeong looked really bad.

2461
03:22:21,347 --> 03:22:23,605
I think she's miserable.

2462
03:22:23,606 --> 03:22:25,156
She should be.

2463
03:22:25,157 --> 03:22:26,605
Of course.

2464
03:22:26,606 --> 03:22:29,716
If she's not, she's not human.

2465
03:22:30,407 --> 03:22:34,035
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

2466
03:22:34,036 --> 03:22:35,606
What?

2467
03:22:36,356 --> 03:22:39,736
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

2468
03:22:39,737 --> 03:22:42,086
Oh, my.

2469
03:22:42,087 --> 03:22:44,337
You sure are a saint.

2470
03:22:44,987 --> 03:22:46,836
She's going through a rough time after

2471
03:22:46,837 --> 03:22:50,096
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

2472
03:22:50,097 --> 03:22:53,357
You're the one I feel sorry for.

2473
03:22:54,407 --> 03:22:59,935
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

2474
03:22:59,936 --> 03:23:01,736
He's at the hospital.

2475
03:23:01,737 --> 03:23:03,756
Hyeondo?

2476
03:23:03,757 --> 03:23:05,377
How could a child be healthy

2477
03:23:05,378 --> 03:23:07,705
when his parents have no morals?

2478
03:23:07,706 --> 03:23:11,477
Karma passes down to children.

2479
03:23:14,267 --> 03:23:17,977
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

2480
03:23:18,597 --> 03:23:20,107
How could I say no to you?

2481
03:23:20,108 --> 03:23:22,416
I had to do it.

2482
03:23:22,417 --> 03:23:23,805
So I was thinking,

2483
03:23:23,806 --> 03:23:25,736
I heard you might end up

2484
03:23:25,737 --> 03:23:28,545
taking over the company.

2485
03:23:28,546 --> 03:23:30,816
There's an idea

2486
03:23:30,817 --> 03:23:34,336
I've been developing for five years,

2487
03:23:34,337 --> 03:23:37,156
and going to Russia gave me

2488
03:23:37,157 --> 03:23:39,226
reaffirmation on my idea.

2489
03:23:39,227 --> 03:23:41,646
So I was wondering

2490
03:23:41,647 --> 03:23:44,896
if you could give me a chance

2491
03:23:44,897 --> 03:23:47,347
to present that idea to you.

2492
03:23:51,227 --> 03:23:52,927
Please don't joke around with me.

2493
03:23:53,616 --> 03:23:55,076
I'm not...

2494
03:23:55,077 --> 03:23:58,756
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

2495
03:23:58,757 --> 03:24:00,836
and made your life difficult.

2496
03:24:00,837 --> 03:24:04,775
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

2497
03:24:04,776 --> 03:24:06,805
yes, like in Chinese novels,

2498
03:24:06,806 --> 03:24:08,355
in order to make someone a hero,

2499
03:24:08,356 --> 03:24:10,435
people around him

2500
03:24:10,436 --> 03:24:13,226
create hardships for him.

2501
03:24:13,227 --> 03:24:15,176
All Chinese heroes are like that.

2502
03:24:15,177 --> 03:24:17,305
They prevail over and over again,

2503
03:24:17,306 --> 03:24:18,296
and accomplish...

2504
03:24:18,297 --> 03:24:19,896
It's okay.

2505
03:24:19,897 --> 03:24:20,827
No, I...

2506
03:24:20,828 --> 03:24:22,867
I said it's okay!

2507
03:24:23,536 --> 03:24:24,846
Why do you keep bugging me!

2508
03:24:24,847 --> 03:24:26,346
I said it's okay!

2509
03:24:26,347 --> 03:24:27,887
Something great.

2510
03:24:30,237 --> 03:24:31,566
I think you're mistaken.

2511
03:24:31,567 --> 03:24:33,025
It's okay.

2512
03:24:33,026 --> 03:24:35,386
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

2513
03:24:35,956 --> 03:24:37,346
No, I'm not mistaken.

2514
03:24:37,347 --> 03:24:39,305
I think you're mistaken.

2515
03:24:39,306 --> 03:24:42,177
It's not like that. Just think about it.

2516
03:24:42,657 --> 03:24:45,486
When you asked me for a favor like that,

2517
03:24:45,487 --> 03:24:49,257
wasn't it because we are close?

2518
03:24:50,296 --> 03:24:51,926
- Yes. / - Right?

2519
03:24:51,927 --> 03:24:57,486
So since we share a special relationship,

2520
03:24:57,487 --> 03:24:58,456
let me present it in a special...

2521
03:24:58,457 --> 03:24:59,567
Jiwan.

2522
03:24:59,977 --> 03:25:01,045
Hi, Eunsu.

2523
03:25:01,046 --> 03:25:02,375
Ms. Han Eunsu!

2524
03:25:02,376 --> 03:25:04,476
Oh? Hello.

2525
03:25:04,477 --> 03:25:05,966
What are you doing here?

2526
03:25:08,196 --> 03:25:09,766
Huh?

2527
03:25:11,837 --> 03:25:13,857
She's my little sister.

2528
03:25:14,856 --> 03:25:16,375
Your real sister?

2529
03:25:16,376 --> 03:25:17,497
Yes.

2530
03:25:17,817 --> 03:25:22,446
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

2531
03:25:24,087 --> 03:25:25,635
Jiwan, Eunsu.

2532
03:25:25,636 --> 03:25:27,526
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

2533
03:25:28,116 --> 03:25:29,125
Remember?

2534
03:25:29,126 --> 03:25:31,816
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

2535
03:25:31,817 --> 03:25:33,205
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

2536
03:25:33,206 --> 03:25:34,166
Oh, Aunt.

2537
03:25:34,167 --> 03:25:37,707
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

2538
03:25:39,227 --> 03:25:40,275
Hi.

2539
03:25:40,276 --> 03:25:43,525
I'm Park Haengsuk.

2540
03:25:43,526 --> 03:25:44,746
Excuse me?

2541
03:25:44,747 --> 03:25:46,586
Park...

2542
03:25:46,587 --> 03:25:50,367
You're his aunt, but
your last name is Park?

2543
03:25:52,097 --> 03:25:57,416
Kim, Han and Park.

2544
03:25:57,417 --> 03:26:00,037
A family with different last names?

2545
03:26:05,376 --> 03:26:08,006
What happened?

2546
03:26:08,007 --> 03:26:09,586
Why is that office empty?

2547
03:26:09,587 --> 03:26:12,305
All the desks and chairs are gone.

2548
03:26:12,306 --> 03:26:13,906
Oh, that office?

2549
03:26:13,907 --> 03:26:15,406
They moved out.

2550
03:26:15,407 --> 03:26:17,156
They moved out?

2551
03:26:17,157 --> 03:26:19,336
Where did they go?

2552
03:26:19,337 --> 03:26:21,055
Where are my daughter and husband?

2553
03:26:21,056 --> 03:26:26,056
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

2554
03:26:28,856 --> 03:26:30,406
A, a tent?

2555
03:26:37,267 --> 03:26:38,385
Oh,

2556
03:26:38,386 --> 03:26:41,875
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

2557
03:26:41,876 --> 03:26:43,156
When is the phone guy coming?

2558
03:26:43,157 --> 03:26:45,016
He'll be here at 3.

2559
03:26:45,017 --> 03:26:47,006
Where should the line go?

2560
03:26:47,007 --> 03:26:48,517
I'll find a spot.

2561
03:26:48,897 --> 03:26:50,206
I'll take that, Yeongju.

2562
03:26:57,296 --> 03:26:59,346
You shouldn't bite off
more than you can chew,

2563
03:26:59,347 --> 03:27:00,976
and mingle with your own kind!

2564
03:27:00,977 --> 03:27:04,176
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

2565
03:27:04,177 --> 03:27:06,076
It's my fault for signing a contract

2566
03:27:06,077 --> 03:27:08,646
that says the owner can
evict us at any time.

2567
03:27:08,647 --> 03:27:10,355
How dare you side with Jiwan!

2568
03:27:10,356 --> 03:27:12,326
I'm going to get him for this!

2569
03:27:13,456 --> 03:27:14,567
Honey, Mi...

2570
03:27:17,927 --> 03:27:19,477
What did Mom say?

2571
03:27:21,216 --> 03:27:24,115
She's going to get Jiwan.

2572
03:27:24,116 --> 03:27:25,426
What?

2573
03:27:26,206 --> 03:27:27,147
Seriously...

2574
03:27:27,148 --> 03:27:28,477
Let's hurry up.

2575
03:27:32,436 --> 03:27:33,926
Jiwan, you!

2576
03:27:34,167 --> 03:27:35,037
Hello.

2577
03:27:35,038 --> 03:27:36,336
Just a second.

2578
03:27:36,776 --> 03:27:38,046
Hello.

2579
03:27:38,827 --> 03:27:41,587
It's an important meeting. This way.

2580
03:27:42,036 --> 03:27:44,105
Everything looks great.

2581
03:27:44,106 --> 03:27:47,805
I can see, now that I'm here.

2582
03:27:47,806 --> 03:27:51,435
You put up a makeshift
office near the farm.

2583
03:27:51,436 --> 03:27:55,316
It shows your concern for quality control.

2584
03:27:55,317 --> 03:27:56,607
I just need to sign here, yes?

2585
03:27:56,608 --> 03:27:58,006
Yes.

2586
03:28:03,487 --> 03:28:04,656
Thank you.

2587
03:28:04,657 --> 03:28:05,626
I hope this works out great.

2588
03:28:05,627 --> 03:28:06,657
Thank you.

2589
03:28:12,317 --> 03:28:13,375
Goodbye.

2590
03:28:13,376 --> 03:28:15,656
That guy

2591
03:28:15,657 --> 03:28:17,355
is great at many things.

2592
03:28:17,356 --> 03:28:19,205
He's amazing.

2593
03:28:19,206 --> 03:28:21,626
He performs better under pressure.

2594
03:28:23,007 --> 03:28:25,516
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

2595
03:28:25,517 --> 03:28:26,947
And it's such a hot day.

2596
03:28:26,948 --> 03:28:29,525
Let me get you something cool to drink.

2597
03:28:29,526 --> 03:28:30,846
Mr. Jang.

2598
03:28:36,936 --> 03:28:38,946
This is worth $30,000.

2599
03:28:43,477 --> 03:28:46,846
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

2600
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:48,635
Hey, cut me some slack.

2601
03:28:48,636 --> 03:28:50,045
I was caught off guard.

2602
03:28:50,046 --> 03:28:51,375
It slipped out.

2603
03:28:51,376 --> 03:28:52,667
I can't believe you.

2604
03:28:52,966 --> 03:28:55,817
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

2605
03:28:57,097 --> 03:28:58,217
Director, you're here.

2606
03:28:58,218 --> 03:28:59,625
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

2607
03:28:59,626 --> 03:29:00,987
Yes.

2608
03:29:02,186 --> 03:29:03,477
What are you doing here?

2609
03:29:04,026 --> 03:29:05,426
What do you think?

2610
03:29:05,427 --> 03:29:07,246
They are working so hard on a hot day,

2611
03:29:07,247 --> 03:29:08,766
so I bought them Korean pork

2612
03:29:08,767 --> 03:29:11,365
to help them restore some energy.

2613
03:29:11,366 --> 03:29:14,246
Domestic is always the best.

2614
03:29:14,247 --> 03:29:16,636
Of course. You're a wise man.

2615
03:29:18,177 --> 03:29:20,836
Honey, don't just stand there.
Come and sit.

2616
03:29:20,837 --> 03:29:22,447
- Come here. / - Yeongju,
come and sit down.

2617
03:29:22,448 --> 03:29:23,916
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

2618
03:29:23,917 --> 03:29:25,016
Let me go get some more lettuce.

2619
03:29:25,017 --> 03:29:26,227
Okay.

2620
03:29:32,446 --> 03:29:33,656
Wait,

2621
03:29:33,657 --> 03:29:35,816
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

2622
03:29:35,817 --> 03:29:37,166
What's going on?

2623
03:29:37,167 --> 03:29:38,447
Oh, I can't believe you.

2624
03:29:38,448 --> 03:29:40,506
When? People might actually believe that.

2625
03:29:40,507 --> 03:29:42,607
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

2626
03:29:42,608 --> 03:29:46,076
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

2627
03:29:46,077 --> 03:29:48,865
so I bought him Korean pork,

2628
03:29:48,866 --> 03:29:50,805
to help him restore energy.

2629
03:29:50,806 --> 03:29:53,266
Why are you just sitting there?

2630
03:29:53,267 --> 03:29:55,047
Go and help wash the lettuce.

2631
03:29:55,048 --> 03:29:56,237
Go help Jiwan.

2632
03:29:56,686 --> 03:29:58,156
Okay.

2633
03:29:59,806 --> 03:30:03,586
I'm a great judge of character.

2634
03:30:03,587 --> 03:30:07,396
Mom, just have one spoonful.

2635
03:30:07,397 --> 03:30:08,267
Say ah.

2636
03:30:08,268 --> 03:30:11,246
I don't want any chicken porridge.

2637
03:30:11,247 --> 03:30:14,176
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

2638
03:30:14,177 --> 03:30:16,676
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

2639
03:30:16,677 --> 03:30:19,346
so you can restore energy, okay?

2640
03:30:19,347 --> 03:30:21,566
Just have one spoonful.

2641
03:30:21,567 --> 03:30:22,696
Say ah.

2642
03:30:28,626 --> 03:30:30,545
See?

2643
03:30:30,546 --> 03:30:33,435
You're upset because of what you said.

2644
03:30:33,436 --> 03:30:35,855
I didn't say anything wrong.

2645
03:30:35,856 --> 03:30:39,215
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

2646
03:30:39,216 --> 03:30:42,157
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

2647
03:30:43,866 --> 03:30:45,535
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

2648
03:30:45,536 --> 03:30:47,987
and meets someone nice.

2649
03:30:48,946 --> 03:30:51,266
I'm sure she will.

2650
03:30:51,856 --> 03:30:54,526
Couples form and break up all the time.

2651
03:30:56,657 --> 03:30:59,726
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

2652
03:30:59,727 --> 03:31:02,977
Jiwan has no time for that.

2653
03:31:05,116 --> 03:31:06,326
This?

2654
03:31:09,626 --> 03:31:11,126
You see,

2655
03:31:11,606 --> 03:31:15,236
here are the size and unit.

2656
03:31:18,497 --> 03:31:20,477
Hi.

2657
03:31:22,786 --> 03:31:25,996
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

2658
03:31:26,296 --> 03:31:28,445
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

2659
03:31:28,446 --> 03:31:30,126
But why are you here?

2660
03:31:32,567 --> 03:31:35,006
Oh, I'm stuffed.

2661
03:31:35,007 --> 03:31:38,885
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

2662
03:31:38,886 --> 03:31:40,365
You ate a lot of it.

2663
03:31:40,366 --> 03:31:41,866
Because it was delicious.

2664
03:31:44,827 --> 03:31:47,955
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

2665
03:31:47,956 --> 03:31:50,077
It's okay. I can go home alone.

2666
03:31:50,507 --> 03:31:51,427
Don't say that.

2667
03:31:51,428 --> 03:31:53,707
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

2668
03:31:53,708 --> 03:31:54,805
Take her home.

2669
03:31:54,806 --> 03:31:56,316
No, that's not going to happen.

2670
03:31:56,317 --> 03:31:57,875
Don't say that. Just go.

2671
03:31:57,876 --> 03:31:59,445
What are you two doing?

2672
03:31:59,446 --> 03:32:00,846
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

2673
03:32:00,847 --> 03:32:02,756
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

2674
03:32:02,757 --> 03:32:04,035
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

2675
03:32:04,036 --> 03:32:04,996
Okay.

2676
03:32:04,997 --> 03:32:06,357
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

2677
03:32:18,267 --> 03:32:20,397
Are those two dating?

2678
03:32:21,087 --> 03:32:23,205
They're not together yet,

2679
03:32:23,206 --> 03:32:26,126
but they are testing the waters.

2680
03:32:27,946 --> 03:32:30,625
It's frustrating to watch them.

2681
03:32:30,626 --> 03:32:32,256
Yeongju...

2682
03:32:32,987 --> 03:32:34,416
She's nice.

2683
03:32:34,417 --> 03:32:35,756
She is.

2684
03:32:35,757 --> 03:32:37,945
She's pretty and pleasant.

2685
03:32:37,946 --> 03:32:41,195
And she's a teacher.

2686
03:32:41,196 --> 03:32:42,346
Don't you think they look good together?

2687
03:32:42,347 --> 03:32:44,037
Yes, they do.

2688
03:32:54,487 --> 03:32:55,706
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

2689
03:33:20,056 --> 03:33:22,586
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

2690
03:33:22,587 --> 03:33:24,447
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

2691
03:33:26,136 --> 03:33:27,716
I'm just practicing.

2692
03:33:28,126 --> 03:33:29,667
Practicing?

2693
03:33:33,317 --> 03:33:35,486
Oh, I get it.

2694
03:33:35,487 --> 03:33:36,516
Girl...

2695
03:33:36,517 --> 03:33:39,906
You have a good eye.

2696
03:33:39,907 --> 03:33:40,716
What do you mean?

2697
03:33:40,717 --> 03:33:42,596
Jiwan.

2698
03:33:42,597 --> 03:33:44,277
Who cares about education?

2699
03:33:44,278 --> 03:33:47,775
To me, money trumps everything.

2700
03:33:47,776 --> 03:33:50,776
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

2701
03:33:53,296 --> 03:33:55,135
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

2702
03:33:55,136 --> 03:33:57,416
Eunsu is easy.

2703
03:33:57,417 --> 03:34:00,847
The grandmother-in-law
will become forgetful.

2704
03:34:01,456 --> 03:34:05,396
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

2705
03:34:05,397 --> 03:34:07,285
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

2706
03:34:07,286 --> 03:34:08,646
I told you it's not like that.

2707
03:34:08,647 --> 03:34:09,517
Just leave me alone.

2708
03:34:09,518 --> 03:34:12,406
How could I leave you alone?

2709
03:34:12,407 --> 03:34:14,055
You won't go on blind dates,

2710
03:34:14,056 --> 03:34:16,386
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

2711
03:34:17,436 --> 03:34:18,926
If it were me in the old days,

2712
03:34:18,927 --> 03:34:20,847
I would've already...

2713
03:34:21,597 --> 03:34:23,316
What's the use of giving you my looks?

2714
03:34:23,317 --> 03:34:24,965
Just look at yourself.

2715
03:34:24,966 --> 03:34:28,045
You're dressed like a tomboy,

2716
03:34:28,046 --> 03:34:29,926
and you haven't taken a shower.

2717
03:34:29,927 --> 03:34:32,875
You need to make yourself look pretty!

2718
03:34:32,876 --> 03:34:35,566
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

2719
03:34:35,567 --> 03:34:38,066
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

2720
03:34:38,067 --> 03:34:39,535
You have to look pretty!

2721
03:34:39,536 --> 03:34:41,396
What good will cooking do for you?

2722
03:34:41,397 --> 03:34:42,766
Besides your pretty face,

2723
03:34:42,767 --> 03:34:45,516
you got nothing from me!

2724
03:34:45,517 --> 03:34:47,827
What do you mean? Like this?

2725
03:34:50,786 --> 03:34:51,955
Oh, you're impossible.

2726
03:34:51,956 --> 03:34:54,406
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

2727
03:34:54,407 --> 03:34:57,277
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

2728
03:34:59,856 --> 03:35:00,926
Minja.

2729
03:35:00,927 --> 03:35:01,847
Oh!

2730
03:35:01,847 --> 03:35:02,817
Ms. Lee!

2731
03:35:02,818 --> 03:35:03,865
What are you doing here?

2732
03:35:03,866 --> 03:35:07,166
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

2733
03:35:07,167 --> 03:35:08,657
What about you?

2734
03:35:09,296 --> 03:35:12,147
Yeongju's been complaining
about neck pain, too.

2735
03:35:13,436 --> 03:35:14,715
Well,

2736
03:35:14,716 --> 03:35:18,327
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

2737
03:35:19,806 --> 03:35:21,135
I've given up on that.

2738
03:35:21,136 --> 03:35:22,486
How they feel about each
other is important,

2739
03:35:22,487 --> 03:35:24,216
not their background.

2740
03:35:24,667 --> 03:35:27,476
You're right!

2741
03:35:27,477 --> 03:35:32,657
But I heard you hold education very high.

2742
03:35:33,536 --> 03:35:36,826
If they're in love,
education doesn't matter.

2743
03:35:36,827 --> 03:35:39,867
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

2744
03:35:40,606 --> 03:35:45,727
But isn't a small family better?

2745
03:35:46,556 --> 03:35:49,896
I would prefer a small family,

2746
03:35:49,897 --> 03:35:51,295
but these days, as complicated as it is,

2747
03:35:51,296 --> 03:35:54,586
people don't live with married children.

2748
03:35:54,587 --> 03:35:57,007
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

2749
03:35:58,147 --> 03:35:59,705
But that's...

2750
03:35:59,706 --> 03:36:01,545
Well...

2751
03:36:01,546 --> 03:36:03,916
Old people don't live forever.

2752
03:36:03,917 --> 03:36:06,617
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

2753
03:36:07,147 --> 03:36:09,666
I'm not going to let my daughter

2754
03:36:09,667 --> 03:36:11,476
date anyone with a large family.

2755
03:36:11,477 --> 03:36:13,885
What if she gets stuck with them?

2756
03:36:13,886 --> 03:36:15,706
That won't be good.

2757
03:36:17,337 --> 03:36:20,517
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

2758
03:36:20,856 --> 03:36:22,625
As long as they live separately,

2759
03:36:22,626 --> 03:36:25,195
you don't mind a big family?

2760
03:36:25,196 --> 03:36:26,746
Of course not.

2761
03:36:26,747 --> 03:36:29,046
As long as they are in love.

2762
03:36:29,927 --> 03:36:30,817
Why do you ask?

2763
03:36:30,818 --> 03:36:34,605
You have someone in mind?

2764
03:36:34,606 --> 03:36:36,056
Of course.

2765
03:36:37,876 --> 03:36:40,036
- You do? / - Yes.

2766
03:36:51,206 --> 03:36:53,976
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

2767
03:36:53,977 --> 03:36:57,736
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

2768
03:36:57,737 --> 03:37:00,775
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

2769
03:37:00,776 --> 03:37:03,986
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

2770
03:37:03,987 --> 03:37:05,566
There are protocols for reporters...

2771
03:37:05,567 --> 03:37:07,156
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

2772
03:37:07,157 --> 03:37:09,875
former directors will be giving statements!

2773
03:37:09,876 --> 03:37:11,266
Tell me if it's true,

2774
03:37:11,267 --> 03:37:13,516
or if it's slander!

2775
03:37:13,517 --> 03:37:16,426
President Jang!

2776
03:37:16,427 --> 03:37:17,547
Please leave.

2777
03:37:20,856 --> 03:37:22,886
Refuse all interviews.

2778
03:37:23,507 --> 03:37:25,047
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

2779
03:37:25,936 --> 03:37:28,375
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

2780
03:37:28,376 --> 03:37:30,417
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

2781
03:37:32,286 --> 03:37:33,516
If he had all the evidence,

2782
03:37:33,517 --> 03:37:35,637
he would've written about it already.

2783
03:37:36,397 --> 03:37:38,885
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

2784
03:37:38,886 --> 03:37:42,236
I told you to find him, by any means!

2785
03:37:42,237 --> 03:37:43,077
What are you doing?

2786
03:37:43,078 --> 03:37:44,907
Is it that you can't or won't?

2787
03:37:47,267 --> 03:37:48,986
Seokjin was

2788
03:37:48,987 --> 03:37:51,726
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

2789
03:37:51,727 --> 03:37:53,727
and is still with us today.

2790
03:37:54,806 --> 03:37:58,016
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

2791
03:37:58,017 --> 03:38:00,427
whenever we reach a new milestone.

2792
03:38:01,817 --> 03:38:05,676
Hyeokju practically lived with us

2793
03:38:05,677 --> 03:38:07,357
at the factory.

2794
03:38:08,477 --> 03:38:10,935
So how could I

2795
03:38:10,936 --> 03:38:14,346
dig into their past, and make threats?

2796
03:38:15,327 --> 03:38:16,857
Taesu!

2797
03:38:20,286 --> 03:38:22,817
You've been paid off, too?

2798
03:38:25,276 --> 03:38:28,365
I know you met with Seokjin.

2799
03:38:28,366 --> 03:38:30,546
I wasn't sure.

2800
03:38:31,036 --> 03:38:32,355
So, what did you get from them?

2801
03:38:32,356 --> 03:38:35,286
How much did they pay you!

2802
03:38:35,917 --> 03:38:37,305
Taesu...

2803
03:38:37,306 --> 03:38:38,555
Get out.

2804
03:38:38,556 --> 03:38:39,536
You're fired!

2805
03:38:39,537 --> 03:38:40,907
Get lost!

2806
03:39:43,056 --> 03:39:44,706
Hyeondo,

2807
03:39:45,436 --> 03:39:48,166
I once told your father

2808
03:39:48,167 --> 03:39:50,457
to watch his back because of you.

2809
03:39:53,067 --> 03:39:55,446
And he said to me,

2810
03:39:57,106 --> 03:39:59,166
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

2811
03:40:00,366 --> 03:40:02,346
Because you're his son.

2812
03:40:06,456 --> 03:40:08,477
Look after Taesu.

2813
03:40:10,696 --> 03:40:13,196
I can't seem to do it anymore.

2814
03:41:07,087 --> 03:41:10,435
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

2815
03:41:10,436 --> 03:41:12,306
This is Kim Jiwan.

2816
03:41:13,536 --> 03:41:16,926
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

2817
03:41:23,997 --> 03:41:25,617
Yes, Mr. Han.

2818
03:41:26,876 --> 03:41:28,556
I'm on my way.

2819
03:42:27,237 --> 03:42:28,796
Your father was going to

2820
03:42:30,007 --> 03:42:33,597
hand over his company to my father?

2821
03:42:36,876 --> 03:42:39,376
I couldn't understand him at first,

2822
03:42:41,657 --> 03:42:44,656
but now that I think about it,

2823
03:42:44,657 --> 03:42:46,587
I can understand him a little bit.

2824
03:43:00,136 --> 03:43:02,257
This is all the evidence I've collected.

2825
03:43:06,616 --> 03:43:08,506
Why are you giving them to me?

2826
03:43:13,647 --> 03:43:15,666
Why did you

2827
03:43:15,667 --> 03:43:17,827
give me that notebook?

2828
03:43:51,227 --> 03:43:52,546
Have you had a lot to drink?

2829
03:43:53,876 --> 03:43:57,397
You asked me here, so why are you late?

2830
03:44:02,017 --> 03:44:03,947
I met Jiwan.

2831
03:44:07,376 --> 03:44:09,657
Uncle Sangjun

2832
03:44:11,337 --> 03:44:14,647
was going to give you all his money?

2833
03:44:15,397 --> 03:44:17,306
That's a lie.

2834
03:44:18,077 --> 03:44:19,997
Right?

2835
03:44:23,456 --> 03:44:26,316
Who would actually do that?

2836
03:44:26,317 --> 03:44:28,646
Why would he give you his company

2837
03:44:28,647 --> 03:44:31,266
when he has a son and a family?

2838
03:44:31,267 --> 03:44:33,187
That's ridiculous.

2839
03:44:33,847 --> 03:44:35,667
You were just a friend.

2840
03:44:36,786 --> 03:44:38,577
Not his blood.

2841
03:44:42,606 --> 03:44:44,516
Don't you agree?

2842
03:44:46,157 --> 03:44:47,737
Yes.

2843
03:44:48,337 --> 03:44:50,317
I'm not his blood.

2844
03:44:53,206 --> 03:44:55,516
But,

2845
03:44:56,347 --> 03:44:59,096
even though I wasn't his blood,

2846
03:44:59,097 --> 03:45:02,736
Sangjun might have actually really

2847
03:45:02,737 --> 03:45:06,886
wanted to give me his company.

2848
03:45:09,876 --> 03:45:13,445
But why...

2849
03:45:13,446 --> 03:45:15,966
How could he trust me so much?

2850
03:45:53,436 --> 03:45:54,676
Jiwan.

2851
03:45:58,077 --> 03:46:01,416
Do you

2852
03:46:01,417 --> 03:46:04,296
remember Dad?

2853
03:46:07,327 --> 03:46:09,187
A little bit.

2854
03:46:12,296 --> 03:46:18,036
What kind of person was he?

2855
03:46:20,917 --> 03:46:24,107
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

2856
03:46:31,657 --> 03:46:34,216
Why did

2857
03:46:36,087 --> 03:46:40,397
Dad trust a man like him?

2858
03:46:42,587 --> 03:46:45,187
He was so foolish.

2859
03:46:49,657 --> 03:46:52,636
You think so, too, don't you?

2860
03:48:03,337 --> 03:48:04,757
How have you been?

2861
03:48:17,636 --> 03:48:19,706
Don't turn bad.

2862
03:48:22,177 --> 03:48:24,847
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

2863
03:48:35,776 --> 03:48:37,386
I should go.

2864
03:49:17,397 --> 03:49:18,635
The Korean Businessmen's Association

2865
03:49:18,636 --> 03:49:22,456
recommended you as a next chairperson.

2866
03:49:22,917 --> 03:49:26,847
You're to give an acceptance speech.

2867
03:49:28,296 --> 03:49:29,535
Okay.

2868
03:49:29,536 --> 03:49:31,016
I got it.

2869
03:49:31,597 --> 03:49:33,045
Oh, and

2870
03:49:33,046 --> 03:49:35,146
call my wife's lawyer,

2871
03:49:35,147 --> 03:49:37,166
and have him visit me here.

2872
03:49:37,167 --> 03:49:38,607
Yes, sir.

2873
03:49:46,696 --> 03:49:48,646
President Jang wants to see you

2874
03:49:48,647 --> 03:49:50,526
before going to court.

2875
03:49:51,827 --> 03:49:53,455
What is it about?

2876
03:49:53,456 --> 03:49:56,046
He said he will tell you in person.

2877
03:50:49,536 --> 03:50:52,736
You like the coffee here, don't you?

2878
03:50:52,737 --> 03:50:55,666
You didn't call me here for coffee.

2879
03:50:55,667 --> 03:50:57,667
What is this about?

2880
03:50:58,716 --> 03:51:00,926
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

2881
03:51:01,776 --> 03:51:03,397
Excuse me.

2882
03:51:25,177 --> 03:51:28,416
I came because you like it here,

2883
03:51:28,417 --> 03:51:30,035
but to me, the company

2884
03:51:30,036 --> 03:51:33,186
vending machine coffee's the best.

2885
03:51:34,407 --> 03:51:38,465
You've always had cheap taste.

2886
03:51:38,466 --> 03:51:39,805
What?

2887
03:51:39,806 --> 03:51:41,987
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

2888
03:51:42,556 --> 03:51:44,935
No,

2889
03:51:44,936 --> 03:51:47,166
it was easy for me.

2890
03:51:49,856 --> 03:51:51,535
Successful men

2891
03:51:51,536 --> 03:51:55,086
always get a mistress first.

2892
03:51:55,087 --> 03:51:57,385
But

2893
03:51:57,386 --> 03:52:00,445
you have simple taste in everything.

2894
03:52:00,446 --> 03:52:02,596
Vending machine coffee, soju,

2895
03:52:02,597 --> 03:52:04,637
and roasted rice tea after meals.

2896
03:52:05,917 --> 03:52:08,507
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

2897
03:52:10,267 --> 03:52:13,455
I did have simple taste,

2898
03:52:13,456 --> 03:52:16,056
but it was never cheap.

2899
03:52:18,946 --> 03:52:23,846
I loved having you

2900
03:52:23,847 --> 03:52:25,637
as my husband.

2901
03:52:28,466 --> 03:52:31,805
I respected you

2902
03:52:31,806 --> 03:52:36,626
more than anyone.

2903
03:52:41,477 --> 03:52:44,545
If you are willing to change,

2904
03:52:44,546 --> 03:52:47,477
nothing will change between us.

2905
03:52:55,497 --> 03:53:00,156
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

2906
03:53:00,157 --> 03:53:03,427
without his money and honor?

2907
03:53:07,196 --> 03:53:10,556
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

2908
03:53:21,456 --> 03:53:23,045
This is the divorce papers.

2909
03:53:23,046 --> 03:53:25,066
I already signed it,

2910
03:53:25,067 --> 03:53:27,097
so you take care of the rest.

2911
03:55:10,626 --> 03:55:13,846
Are you sure you want to let this go?

2912
03:55:14,977 --> 03:55:17,466
You won't regret it?

2913
03:55:19,286 --> 03:55:21,716
That was what Father wanted.

2914
03:55:22,956 --> 03:55:25,236
If President Jang

2915
03:55:25,237 --> 03:55:29,107
doesn't change his ways after finding out

2916
03:55:30,007 --> 03:55:32,707
what Father wanted, he'll
be more miserable.

2917
03:55:53,026 --> 03:55:56,166
Hello, everyone.

2918
03:55:56,167 --> 03:55:58,676
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

2919
03:55:58,677 --> 03:56:02,117
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

2920
03:56:08,067 --> 03:56:11,965
There are many senior entrepreneurs

2921
03:56:11,966 --> 03:56:13,775
and colleagues who deserve the award,

2922
03:56:13,776 --> 03:56:15,506
so I feel a very big responsibility

2923
03:56:15,507 --> 03:56:17,747
to win this accolade.

2924
03:56:18,186 --> 03:56:22,855
And it's an honor to have the position

2925
03:56:22,856 --> 03:56:25,856
to represent all entrepreneurs.

2926
03:56:27,257 --> 03:56:31,066
Sitting here

2927
03:56:31,067 --> 03:56:33,677
brings back old memories.

2928
03:56:36,446 --> 03:56:41,886
I had a friend.

2929
03:56:42,477 --> 03:56:46,445
He trusted me when I had nothing,

2930
03:56:46,446 --> 03:56:51,026
and helped me get to where I am today.

2931
03:56:51,626 --> 03:56:53,846
He was the president of Taehu Industry

2932
03:56:53,847 --> 03:56:56,947
where Best Global began.

2933
03:57:00,327 --> 03:57:02,727
Kim Sangjun.

2934
03:57:04,667 --> 03:57:08,437
That was my friend's name.

2935
03:57:09,056 --> 03:57:12,375
He was naively trusting,

2936
03:57:12,376 --> 03:57:14,855
and honest

2937
03:57:14,856 --> 03:57:18,526
even to a fault.

2938
03:57:19,856 --> 03:57:22,596
I considered his company

2939
03:57:22,597 --> 03:57:26,047
as my own,

2940
03:57:27,366 --> 03:57:30,296
and worked hard.

2941
03:57:38,136 --> 03:57:41,396
But,

2942
03:57:41,397 --> 03:57:45,445
I

2943
03:57:45,446 --> 03:57:48,567
Stole...

2944
03:58:01,286 --> 03:58:03,706
All of his money.

2945
03:58:06,606 --> 03:58:08,076
What did he just say?

2946
03:58:26,356 --> 03:58:30,096
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

2947
03:58:32,046 --> 03:58:33,667
May I help you?

2948
03:58:37,526 --> 03:58:39,715
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

2949
03:58:39,716 --> 03:58:42,456
How dare you come here!

2950
03:58:43,546 --> 03:58:45,276
Jang Hyeondo?

2951
03:58:46,157 --> 03:58:48,256
You're that guy?

2952
03:58:48,257 --> 03:58:49,596
How dare you show your face here?

2953
03:58:49,597 --> 03:58:51,287
Get out.

2954
03:59:04,686 --> 03:59:06,876
I'm sorry.

2955
03:59:08,106 --> 03:59:11,336
That's all I can say.

2956
03:59:21,487 --> 03:59:23,027
Yes.

2957
03:59:23,917 --> 03:59:29,465
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

2958
03:59:29,466 --> 03:59:33,086
and bought their shares for pennies.

2959
03:59:33,087 --> 03:59:37,465
And I even kicked his family out

2960
03:59:37,466 --> 03:59:40,397
from their house.

2961
03:59:44,487 --> 03:59:47,226
And so I used

2962
03:59:47,227 --> 03:59:51,296
the stolen money,

2963
03:59:53,257 --> 03:59:57,427
and built my own company.

2964
04:00:08,216 --> 04:00:10,376
(Taehu Industry Stock
Certificate, $2.5 Million)

2965
04:00:51,417 --> 04:00:52,847
Dad!

2966
04:02:13,556 --> 04:02:16,516
(KBS 2TV, Weekend Drama, Bluebird's House)

2967
04:02:16,517 --> 04:02:17,465
I knew then,

2968
04:02:17,466 --> 04:02:18,397
(Best Global's Jang Taesu
Confesses to Embezzlement)

2969
04:02:18,786 --> 04:02:22,795
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

2970
04:02:22,796 --> 04:02:25,256
Sangjun

2971
04:02:25,257 --> 04:02:28,147
might have died because of me.

2972
04:02:29,347 --> 04:02:31,326
He's giving you what?

2973
04:02:31,327 --> 04:02:32,506
Stocks.

2974
04:02:32,507 --> 04:02:35,647
And he's resigning from his position.

2975
04:02:36,477 --> 04:02:39,435
Why are they so dense,

2976
04:02:39,436 --> 04:02:40,586
when I'm trying to help them?

2977
04:02:40,587 --> 04:02:42,596
They should at least try to

2978
04:02:42,597 --> 04:02:43,945
go on a few dates.

2979
04:02:43,946 --> 04:02:46,115
You're going to let Father be as he is?

2980
04:02:46,116 --> 04:02:49,356
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!
