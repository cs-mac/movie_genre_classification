1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,560
My pops used to always say,
''Dreaming is the luxury of children ''...

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,360
...and that I should enjoy it.

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,040
He was right.

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,000
Here it is, the last year of high school
for me and my friends...

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
...and this is all I can
ever really see myself doing.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,040
When you got responsibilities,
you ain't got time to dream.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,960
I guess it's the difference between
being a boy and a man.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
And down South...

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,000
...you grow up quick.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,880
Especially in the A TL.

11
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,160
This here is my 'hood.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
Mechanicsville.

13
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
752 Mandeville Lane.

14
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,080
Middle of the city, center of our universe.

15
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Wake up, A TL, it's 6:23.
It's your boy, Frank Ski in the morning.

16
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
And we've got another scorcher planned
for you here in the Dirty South.

17
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm talking Dirty South hot
A TL weather today.

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,760
I tell you what, another heat index,
another record-breaking day.

19
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
''What is your ethnic background?''

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,280
I am a brother.

21
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
Uncle George,
my mama's brother.

22
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,080
He supposed to be raising us...

23
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,920
...but responsibility was not really
his strong point.

24
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,720
''Bisex-- HeterosexuaI.''

25
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Don't get it twisted, baby.

26
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,960
Hey, Ant. You want a ride, homeboy,
you better act Iike it.

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,120
-That's my little brother, Ant.
-AII right.

28
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
I call him ''Jellybean. ''

29
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Hardheaded on the outside,
soft on the inside.

30
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
And that's me, Rashad.

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,480
Heir to the family business,
Swann Cleaning Service...

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,120
...and man of the house.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
''How wouId you describe your physique?

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Trim, muscuIar, pIeasantIy pIump.''

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,840
-What?
-Hey, Iet us get a box of cereaI, man.

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,760
We ran out.

37
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,440
Man, they aIways eating.

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,200
MuscuIar.

39
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,480
I know how much is in there too.

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
One bowI each.

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
Yeah.

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
My boy, Esquire.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,040
He's basically my best friend.
He got accepted to an Ivy League school.

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
There goes four.

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,160
Check out this brother, just grinning,
jogging through campus with a white girI.

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
ProbabIy running from that crowd of
white boys on the opposite page.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,560
Either way you Iook at it, man, you Iucky.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah, man. It ain't paid for yet.

49
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm gonna need grants, Ioans,
a job and a dream to pay this tuition off.

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
''Ex-bIackIy.''

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
We had to drive across town
because E went to Mount Paran.

52
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
My boy book smart...

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,720
...maybe even borderline brilliant
to these kids...

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
...but he's just plain old Esquire to us.

55
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
Why you aIways be driving in our car?

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
-Get out the car.
-Look, boy.

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
With your stupid IittIe outfit, man.

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
Rashad, I'm gonna hurt him.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Man, get out of here.

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
-Peace.
-You mean ''War,'' brother.

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
War!

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,560
-How you doing, Mr. Sapp?
-Hey, Ben.

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
-Have a seat.
-Right.

64
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,080
I got the information you wanted
regarding the FaIcon Society.

65
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Let's have a Iook.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
GPA is over 4.0.

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Test scores are high.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,760
Essay's strong.

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
AII you need is a good Ietter
of recommendation.

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
You're in great shape.

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
I was wondering if
you couId write that for me.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm fIattered, Ben, I am,
but I'm not reaIIy the right person.

73
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm sure your parents know a judge,
a businessman?

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I don't think my parents
know anybody Iike that, sir.

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Sometimes it's not what you know...

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,560
...but who you know.

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,600
Our school was a little different.

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,840
See, we in the Trey, Mechanicsville High.

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,120
Alma mater to some of
the greatest players in the city.

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,080
That's my boy Teddy right there.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,040
He A TL for real.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,600
Never been outside of 285.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey, what you doing here, man?
You must have Iost your job.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Had to get my breakfast on.
Brother gotta eat.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
Get it how you Iive, pimp.

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
-Brooklyn, from New y ork.
-No means no, man.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,480
And reminds us of it every chance he get.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,320
-Shining, ain't you?
-Can't you teII, man?

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Guess you gonna fake it
tiII you make it, huh?

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,720
Man, these gonna be getting me the girIs.

91
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,080
-Not without no game, it ain't.
-What up, Tondie?

92
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,400
-Can we taIk right quick?
-Just did, bye.

93
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
Working aIready.

94
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,120
Seniors, it's almost graduation.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,680
If you haven't done it yet,
get your cap and gowns ordered.

96
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,600
We were five weeks from graduation.
I had all my credits.

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,920
And all I had to do was cruise for
the next month and I'd be straight.

98
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Please give them
a Tiger round of applause.

99
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
And one more thing.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,400
We have a lot of sports
going on this week.

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,120
And we want to thank the people...

102
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,880
-...who were involved this weekend.
-Everybody in a seat.

103
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,080
Year's aImost over. Thank you, Jesus.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Y'aII sIackers better figure out
what to do for the summer.

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,360
My little brother wasn't exactly
a troublemaker.

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,040
-That ain't right.
-But he ran his mouth too much.

107
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
-Why ain't it?
-And he was definitely hardheaded.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,720
I know what I'II be doing this summer.

109
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
I'm gonna be getting paid.

110
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Ms. Jackson...

111
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,160
...can you pIease cut on the a.c.?

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Man, it feeI Iike a sIave ship in here.

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,160
Air conditioning is for honors cIasses.

114
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,880
Kids who wanna make something
out of themseIves.

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
Was you in honors cIasses?

116
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Because you ain't got no a.c. either.

117
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
See what I'm saying?

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
He stayed in trouble.

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
But I couldn't wait on him
to get out of detention.

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
We had to scoop Teddy.

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
How your sister doing, man?

122
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,120
I been caIIing her,
and she ain't been caIIing me back.

123
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,640
She trying to pIay me?
She seeing somebody eIse?

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,000
Come on, man, keep it reaI with me.

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
What's happening, Teddy?

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
-What up, man? You pIaying?
-I got next.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,040
Party on the Ieft, man.
You know how it is.

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
Now open wide, wide, wide.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Bite down on that. CooI, cooI.

130
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,920
Hey, man. Ready?

131
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh, heII, yeah. I'm gone.

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Hey, man, peace.

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,200
After we pick up Teddy, we shoot on
over to the Shady Grove Country Club.

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
That's where Esquire works.

135
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,760
We expected him to be late...

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,040
...because he was always out there on
the golf course, hustling the rich kids.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,160
Yes, yes, and yes.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, my God, I Iove poetry.

139
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
I write in my diary every day.

140
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
Oh, reaIIy?
Let me kick something for you.

141
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,080
She sits there
Pain filling the back of her eyes

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Forcing them to leak

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
So aII I need to do is
I need to get your digits.

144
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Your daddy ain't around, is he?

145
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,600
Even though her tolerance
Has reached its peak

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,320
Now, Iook here, when you caII me,
don't even trip, okay?

147
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,480
If a Iady answer the phone,
that's my mama.

148
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,400
She staying with me
because she going through some things.

149
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,240
She's so soft

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,040
She could have been
The spokesperson for cotton

151
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,160
You know, that's just IittIe things
that I Iike do to...

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
...because I Iike to throw stuff in the air.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
These guys don't know anything
about poetry.

154
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,160
They're not reaIIy cuItured.

155
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,880
-Hey, what's up, Esquire, man?
-Man....

156
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,480
-Hey, man.
-WiII you aII come on? Excuse me.

157
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,640
-Can't you see I'm over here--
-You reciting poetry and shit.

158
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,560
-Come on, man.
-Damn.

159
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,880
-Can we go pIease? PIease?
-Hey, man, scoot over, man. PIease?

160
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,440
You skinny enough. Scoot over, man!

161
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,680
You aIways sit in the front.
Sit in the back.

162
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,160
What the heII wrong with you,
Tiger Hood?

163
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,440
BIack NickIaus?

164
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,720
I think I miss home or whatever,
but, yo, it's so country out here, man.

165
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,840
It's Iike the fIies--
Why are there so many fIies out here?

166
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,320
-Man, I know you not gonna get into this.
-For reaI.

167
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,280
Okay, so why is there a rat on
every corner in New York City?

168
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,400
Why, after every sentence,
you caII me ''shorty''?

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,320
''Yo, shorty, shorty.'' I'm taIIer than you.

170
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,800
Let me ask you this, then.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,960
In New York City, why y'aII say,
''Yo, son,'' after every sentence?

172
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
-I'm not your kid. I'm not your chiId.
-Right.

173
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
Why I gotta be your son?

174
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,200
-Money?
-B?

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,920
I caII you ''sun'' because you shine Iike one.

176
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,840
-You feeI me?
-Yeah, that was reaI sentimentaI, thanks.

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,280
-Oh, heII, yeah.
-Thank you.

178
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,080
-Y'aII need anything eIse?
-No, we aII right.

180
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
-ActuaIIy, Iet me get some iced tea?
-Sweet or unsweet?

181
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,600
-Sweet.
-She choosing, huh, BrookIyn?

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Shut up.

183
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,000
BrookIyn! Oh, good Lord!

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,320
That ass fatter than
a swamp possum with the mumps.

185
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,560
-Okay, you got a point.
-See what I'm saying?

186
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,000
That's country.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
Y'aII get y'aII cap and gowns yet?

188
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
-Oh, yeah, I got mine.
-I know you do.

189
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,200
Yo, you sure you graduating, Teddy?

190
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,440
Like, come on, for reaI, B,
just give it up. Like, come on, Teddy.

191
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,520
That ain't funny, man. I'm trying.

192
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,360
-Wait a minute.
-I'm trying.

193
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Ain't you about
in the 1 4th grade now, dog?

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah, I'm in the same cIass
with your mama.

195
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
By the way, I ain't seen her IateIy.

196
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,160
You gotta teII her to come in and
check in with Daddy at the house.

197
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,240
I need my money on time.

198
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
Hey, don't make jokes about me, okay?
I'm sensitive.

199
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,040
Y'aII know where that girI New New
go to schooI at?

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,440
Seem Iike she onIy be around
when we be kicking it.

201
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,320
-She ghetto, man.
-Yeah, boy, just how I Iike them.

202
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
You better Iean back, shorty.

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
You know she Rashad's girI.

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,800
-Rashad.
-Now, how you figure that?

205
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
-Come on, man.
-Come on, man.

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
Shut up, you know you Iike her too.

207
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,880
I don't even be taIking to that girI.

208
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
So why you just wave at her?

209
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,560
Shut up, man.

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
He put you out there, homeboy.

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,720
We were all at the same place
in our lives...

212
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
...trying to figure out what's next.

213
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
The one thing I did know:
These were my friends.

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
I could trust them.

215
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,040
And Sunday night, we got loose.

216
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
-That's right.
-Let's go and do the damn thing, man.

217
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
-Let's do it.
-Big oId head.

218
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Let's go.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Sunday night at Cascade.

220
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,680
Fine Georgia peaches and wet paint.

221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,160
It was a beautiful place to be.

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm gonna knock him out next time.

223
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,160
We'd been coming to Cascade
since we were kids.

224
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
What's up, man?

225
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,120
I had my first fistfight here,
and my first kiss.

226
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
We knew everybody...

227
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,760
...from the security guards
to the hottest shorties.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,760
Rashad. Rashad!

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,920
-I know you heard me.
-Don't he know chocoIate meIt in the heat?

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,680
-I'm gIad somebody recognize.
-Don't try to get no feeI, neither.

231
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,600
GirI, I got grandkids oIder than you.

232
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Cascade's is a rite of passage
to every kid in the A...

233
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,280
...but for us, it was something more.

234
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,840
AII right, everybody,
Iet's get it on the fIoor.

235
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,960
Y'aII Iooking a IittIe rusty tonight.
Y'aII better be practicing out there.

236
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,640
There's something wrong
with these wheeIs.

237
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Ain't nothing wrong with these wheeIs.
You can't skate.

238
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,160
Inside here,
it's like all our problems don't exist.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,760
It's the only place where
we all felt like we could be free.

240
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,960
Man, it's crazy out here tonight.

241
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, yeah, y'aII, here we go again.
Cascade's on a Sunday night.

242
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,600
If you can't skate,
get your ass off the fIoor.

243
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,080
If you got skiIIs,
then, shorty, you got to prove it.

244
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,400
School sucks, rent past due,
your girl left you.

245
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,280
On Sunday night,
don't none of that matter.

246
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,360
y ou could be
whoever you wanted to be here.

247
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,800
Can't take bIack foIks nowhere.

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,400
Man, get off the fIoor.
Get off the fIoor.

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,880
HandIe that, Mr. Referee.

250
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,960
HeIIo? HeIIo?

251
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,360
-Who was that?
-I don't know. They keep hanging up.

252
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
Star-69 them.

253
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,960
Excuse me, I am not a ho.

254
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,720
There's all kinds of characters here.

255
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,880
y ou got the Cool Cats and they crew.

256
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,520
y ou got the Fly Girls.

257
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
And the D-boys is in here too.

258
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,520
Somebody always dying from their clique.

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,160
But nobody matters like the skate crew.

260
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,360
And we were the Ones.

261
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,440
This year, we was taking Skate Wars.

262
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,120
Let's go, man.

263
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,520
Even when the rink was crunk
on Sunday night...

264
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,040
...sometimes I felt like
I was out there all by myself.

265
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,000
Floating above it all.

266
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
No lies, no pain...

267
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,240
...and no worries about
what tomorrow might bring.

268
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Shantay, hurry up,
we got dance rehearsaI.

269
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Guess you don't know nobody
no more, huh?

270
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Man.

271
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
No, I guess not.

272
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm saying, Rashad,
you know I didn't mean what I said.

273
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,120
Man, whatever. That don't even matter.

274
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
Look, my mama not home.

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,040
You wanna give me a ride?

276
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,840
Man, your mama ain't never home.

277
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
Take care, though.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
I ain't have time to mess with Tonya.

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,360
If we was gonna win the war,
we was gonna need practice.

280
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,600
Some of us more than others.

281
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,440
-We have identified the weakest Iink.
-Shut up, boy.

282
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,920
You aIways taIking.
Rashad, get your brother.

283
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,280
-He might be right this time.
-Yeah, for reaI.

284
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Two, three, four. Oh, goddamn.

285
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,640
Hey, girI, hey!

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
I wonder what her career path is.

287
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,400
Excuse me, gorgeous.
Can I get at you for a second?

288
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,880
I got that. Fine ass.

289
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,160
-So where you going?
-Boy, you know you need to quit.

290
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
You see I'm getting hot.
I'm sweating and aII that.

291
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,280
I can't take him no more, son.

292
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,280
-That's it. That's it.
-And here he go.

293
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,920
-What happened, man?
-I'm done.

294
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,040
-I'm done.
-Again?

295
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,000
-Wanna try that one more time?
-I got this. I'm good.

296
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,040
Yo, BrookIyn, you're fired, man.
Quit Ioitering here.

297
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,960
Keep it moving, son. Keep it moving.

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,640
AII right.
I don't know if you that good, but....

299
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,760
Leave your uniform before
I take it out of your check.

300
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,240
-HoId up, man.
-Get the heII out of here, you idiot.

301
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,960
-''Keep moving, son''?
-I cannot run my pizza pIace without you?

302
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,520
Man, be that way, then.
That's why you need a timing beIt, bitch.

303
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,520
Shut up! Grow some hair on your chest!

304
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,800
You see what I mean?

305
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,680
-Watch out, man.
-See what I'm saying?

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,160
If you're not so lucky

318
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,600
...a pool is the place to be.

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,560
Head down to your neighborhood pool...

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,560
...because it is the coolest place
you want to be today.

-And when you gonna get that door fixed?

386
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,400
What, whoa, wait a minute.

387
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Considering the fact that both of y'aII broke,
those better be knockoffs.

388

Why you don't cut across the middIe

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,000
She must have went

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh, sh--

Somebody caII the ambuIance.

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,080
But you don't fall.

450
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
This is humiIiating.

-Did you say John Garnett?
-Yeah.

572
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,600

580
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,640
See, aII that is unnecessary.

581
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm just kidding, shorty.

582
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,840
-So how do I skate?
-What you mean?

583

00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,560
What's up, boy?

612
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,120
You sure you ain't scared of dogs?

613
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,440
-No.
-Good, then.

614
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,480
It's feeding time. Come on.

615
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,120
Back up.

616
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,880
You go first.

617
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,000
Get back in there.
What's up?

618
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,160
Young buck, so what's shaking?
You got a broad?

619
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,840
No.

620
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,320
Jumping and stuff.

621
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,720
Hit that bowI right there.
Come here, baby.

622
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,600
Scare, come here.

623
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,080
Oh, man, Iook at that.

624
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,840
You put more food
on the ground than in the bowI.

625
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,240
You costing me money aIready.

626
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,480
How about kids?

627
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,960
Not that I know of.

628
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,280
You doing something?

629
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,000
-You know, a IittIe something.
-Boy, you ain't doing nothing, boy.

630
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,800
You smoke? You smoke? You smoking?

631
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,840
I don't, but, you know, to each his own.

632
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,360
That's cooI, boy. Say no to drugs.
Dare to be different.

633
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,440
So, what was your Iast
pIace of empIoyment, young buck?

634
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,000
-CIeaning.
-CIeaning?

635
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,920
Look to me Iike the Swann CIeaning Service

636
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,720
You wanna work, right?

637
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,040
But you know
this is grown-man business, don't you?

638
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,960
-I know.
-You sure?

639
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,920
Okay.

640
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,040
We gonna see.

641
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,240
-Hey.
-Yo.

642
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,120
Where you been?

643
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,000

644
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,000
Out? Come here.

645
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,160
I know you ain't been out there
being stupid.

646
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,280
-I'm teIIing you, Ant, I ain't pIaying.
-What?

647
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,280
''What?'' Don't ''what'' me, man.

648
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,160
What's up with you missing history cIass?
That's what.

649
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,320
Man, you probabIy caught me
on bathroom break or something.

650
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,720
I Iook stupid?

651
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,200
Man, I'm saying, though...

652
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,520
...I don't see
how the Great WaII of China...

653
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,080
...heIps me cIean the fIoor

654
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,080
Man, what, you hustIing?

655
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,040
You shouId know better than that.

656
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,680
You ain't gotta be
a dope boy to have money.

657
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,040
This what cIeaning the fIoors gets you.

658
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,440
I been saving this for three years now.

659
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,120
Ever since the accident.

660
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,080
-Been saving for what?
-For you.

661
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,760
So you can get out of here.

662
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,040
Do something with yourseIf.
Go to schooI.

663
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,760
Get away from dumb-ass UncIe George.

664
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,280
Man, you shouId spend that
on some rims...

665
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,400
...or skates or something.

666
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,560
Don't be wasting that on me.

667
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,800
I guess just because your head big,
that don't make you smart.

668
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,000
Hey, I beIieve in you, even when you

669
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,920

670
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,640
-Man, I hear you hoIding now.
-Man, who toId you that?

671
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,040
Why you tripping?

672
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,680
Yeah, but you been out of schooI

674
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,920
-No.
-AII right, that's what's up.

675
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,040
Narc.

676
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,520
Hey, Ben.

677
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,360
Oh, hey, Mr. Garnett.

678
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,840
Nice to see you again.

679
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,080
My buddies and I, we Iost our fourth.
Afraid of a IittIe weather.

680
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,800
You pIay?

681
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,360
That's my partner.

682
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
Oh, damn.

683
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah!

684
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,960
So your famiIy's from the city, Ben?

685
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,000
You're not
a MechanicsviIIe hood product.

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,520
No, not me, sir.
You wouIdn't catch me in a pIace Iike that.

687
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,800
That shot on 1 7 was about 200 yards.

688
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,400
HeII of a game, man.
We whipped their asses.

689
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,520
Yes, we did.

690
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Oh, man.

691
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,520
Oh, no, no, sir.

692
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,600
-It was my pIeasure.
-Oh, no, don't be siIIy. You earned it.

693
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,160
And if there's anything I can ever
do for you, you Iet me know.

694
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,480
WeII, actuaIIy, there is something
you couId heIp me out with.

695
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,000
TaIk to me.

696
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I couId use a Ietter of recommendation.

697
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,240
And she had the nerve to step to me.

698
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,720
-She know she Iucky too.
-Forget her.

699
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
The question is, what happened
when Rashad gave you a ride, nasty?

700
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,040
-''I'II take her.''
-Nothing happened.

701
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,800
-You Iying.
-It's aII in your griII.

702
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,440
That's him right there. Come on.

703
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,680
Men, grab your Iadies.
Ladies, grab your weaves.

704
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,000
It's about to be on.
Y'aII got three minutes tiII coupIes' skate...

705
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,040
...and four weeks tiII Skate Wars.

706
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,120
But untiI then, hoId this.

707
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,760
Man, I got that good...

708
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,360

709
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,360
...and, man, the ugIy herbaI.

710
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,640
-I gotta smoke something.
-Hey.

711
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,200
Man, I don't understand
a word that you been saying.

712
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,760
What you want, man?

713
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,080
WeII, weII, weII.
So we meet again.

714
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
What's up, gorgeous?

715
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,000
You teII me.
You're the one that's shining.

716
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,560
Oh, you know, that's how we do.
But you Iook mighty fine yourseIf.

717
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,760
Oh, thank you.

718
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,080
So do you wanna hook up or what?

719
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,880
Yeah, you know, Iike...

720
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,000

721
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,040
You know, I be reaI--

722
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,360
-Stepped on that shit.
-Yeah, boy.

723
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,600
This thing's off the chain, tonight, man.

724
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,040
I got shotgun.

725
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey, whoa, whoa.

726
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,680
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

727
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,120
Come on, BrookIyn.

728
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,200

00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,240
-Damn.
-Come on, I don't Iike him, man.

733
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,040
He never sits in the front.
Now he wanna sit in the front.

734
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,160
-Sit your ass over.
-Shut up.

735
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,680
Hey, man, what you doing?

736
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,760
-Ain't you gonna wait on Ant?
-He say he got a ride.

737
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,080
That tickIes.

738
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,400
That's my beIIy button, baby.

739
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,840
Yeah, yeah. I know.

740
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,720
Good, baby.

741
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,120
You're getting cIoser.

742
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,040
-That's strong, baby.
-What's up? What's up?

743
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,000
-Was it a good idea to keep my money?
-No, no!

744
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,120
Shut up. Come on. Get up.

745
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,080
Come on. Come on.

746
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,920
Boy,
don't you know I graduated with a 3.68?

747
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,160
Lord, I'm parched.
Let me get my drink.

748
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,520
This supposed to be my famiIy,
my bIood cousin.

749
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,160
-Give me the money. Give me the money.
-AII right.

750
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,000
-It was onIy 1 00 doIIars.
-That's it?

751
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,720
Shut up.

752
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,600
Shut up.

753
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,520
You better not teII my mama.

754
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,000
Come on, baby.

755
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,560
That empty space right there on the bar,
that's for this year's trophy.

756
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Don't even worry about that.

757
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,200
A IittIe confident, aren't we?

758
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,120
For good reason. You Iike the poIe?

759
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,000
You wish.

760
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
What's this?

761
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,840
Nothing.

762
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,600
These are fIy. You did these?

763
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,720
Yeah, but it was just
me fooIing around, though.

764
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,280
This ain't somebody just fooIing around.

765
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,200
This is good, Rashad.

766
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,840
Is this me?

767
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,360
-My mouth is not that big.
-Hey.

768
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,000
It's artistic expression.

769
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,680
And I'm sensitive about my shit,
so I'd appreciate it....

770
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,200
Thank you.

771
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,880
Cute.

772
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
But for reaI, Rashad...

773
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,440
...you got taIent.

774
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,720
-I don't know.
-Like you can't have no taIent.

775
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
Be reaI with me. Come on.

776
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
Be reaI with me. I'm serious.

777
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,840
AII right.

778
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,680
WeII, when I was younger,
every Sunday...

779
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,280
...my pops used to give me...

780
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
...the comics out the of Sunday paper.

781
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I guess I kind of had this dream...

782
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,800
...that one day I couId be the one...

783
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,040
...who drew the comics
in the Sunday paper.

784
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,440
-That's it.
-You stiII can.

785
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
What's happening, UncIe G?

786
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,080
How you doing this morning?

787
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,400
Get myseIf some orange juice.
Good morning, brother.

788
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,760
-Good morning, UncIe George.
-What's happening?

789
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,160
What is y'aII so happy about?

790
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,360
How come you here grinning?
You just grinning.

791
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Grinning, Iike you
a new man or something.

792
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,680
No, Rashad's a New New man.
He got some cutty Iast night.

793
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
Shut up.

794
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
You got some booty
in this house?

795
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,360
I toId you I don't want
no company in my house.

796
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,160
I toId you I don't want
them fast girIs in my house.

797
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,480
No femaIes in this house, that's the ruIe.

798
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,760
There's a one-bowI ruIe in effect.

799
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay, UncIe George.

800
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,400
One bowI.

801
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,320
What is with you?

802
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,360
I ain't gonna Iie.

803
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,320
-I got some cutty Iast night.
-Stop Iying.

804
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
You ain't got no cutty.

805
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,800
With your IittIe scrawny ass.

806
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,240
If anybody gets some cutty,
it's supposed to be me.

807
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,320
I gets the booty here.
I gets the drawers.

808
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,440
I gets the booty. I gets the trim.

809
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm the one supposed to be getting cutty.
I'm a grown man.

810
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,120
I get the cutty, not y'aII.
Understand what I'm saying?

811
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
UncIe George. Me.

812
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,360
WeII, I guess we see
who didn't get the cutty Iast night, huh?

813
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,960
Give me my cereaI.

814
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
I hope your IittIe weenie faII off.

815
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
You say something?

816
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
-No, man, Iet me see this.
-See what?

817
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
This thing gonna make
her neck turn green.

818
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,600
Man, shut up, man.
It got the 1 4-karat stamp on it.

819
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,080
I don't know how you bought that.
You never bought a girI anything.

820
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,520
-So what, man?
-You need to watch it, Rashad.

821
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,360
This girI got your nose wide open.

822
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
Let you teII it.

823
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,440
Yeah, it ain't even Iike that.
She reaI, man.

824
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,680
He bought a cheap-ass neckIace
for New New.

825
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
I was about to buy her some shit, man.

826
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,560
-Yeah, right.
-We gotta go, man.

827
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
It's my first day, B.

828
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,040

829

I'm with my peopIe now, homey.

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Free coIIards. Free coIIard greens.

831
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
Why you bIocking, man?

832
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,960
That's what I'm taIking about.

833
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,880
Who this?

834
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,960
-New New.
-Shut up, man.

835
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,760
-What you want?
-I need a ride tomorrow.

-Who this?
-It's New New.

839
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,680
Y'aII need to find something to do,

Hello?

846
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
My bad, man.

847
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,080
I just wanted to see what was popping.

848
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
Hey, y'all going to the pool tomorrow?

849
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,160

I gotta take Esquire up to Sandy Springs.

850
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Teddy? Teddy.

851
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,120
If you don't get off that damn phone
and clean them dishes....

852
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,240
Hey, Ma, I'm 21 years oId, man.

853
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,960
StiII getting on the phone?

854
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,800
I never feeI comfortabIe

855
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,960
Man, kind of how I feeI

856
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,120
I don't see what this cat making you

857
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,120
He invited me to dinner, fooI.

858
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,280
Man, this is John Garnett.

859

One thing you shouId Iearn
earIy in this Iife:

873
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,920
It's not aIways what you know.

874
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Sometimes it's who you know.

875
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes, sir.

876
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Erin, I'd Iike you to meet Ben.

890
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,480

-Hi.

891
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,040
I gotta go. Bye.

892
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
Bye.

893
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
Strange chick.

894
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,040
Erin, nice to meet you.

895
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,800
It's aIways a pIeasure
meeting new peopIe.

896
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,480
It's nice to meet you too.

897
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
You're not teIIing Rashad.

898
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,160
Wow, you even taIk different.

899
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,960
You're not teIIing him.

900
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,880
Oh, I'm teIIing him. PIease beIieve that.

901
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,160
You're not saying anything to him...

902
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,360
...and I'm not teIIing my dad about you.

903
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,880
If I teII him where you're from,
you're done.

904
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
-Is that a threat?
-CaII it what you want.

905
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
I gotta teII him in my own way.

906
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,440
I knew it. Because Rashad was
teIIing me how ''New New is this'' ...

907
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,440
...and ''New New's so reaI.''

908
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,600
-I am reaI.
-You ain't shit.

909
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Excuse you?

910
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
How did you even find Cascade?

911
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,760
What, you go buy you a 99-cent ghetto
handbook to show you how to keep it reaI?

912
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,520
The saIad fork goes on the other side.

913
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm from the Trey.

914
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,040
You from the Trey? That's funny.

915
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,600
-WeII, my dad is.
-I never read that.

916
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,280
-He never taIks about it.
-I don't bIame him.

917
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,280
Are you serious?

918
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
He's a seIIout.

919
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
You reaIIy wanna be ghetto.

920
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,880
BeIieve me, you can have
the piss in the haIIway.

921
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,480
I'II take the Picasso.

922
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
You got a Picasso in your house!

923
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
You need to Iower your voice. Shut up.

924
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I bet when you go to Brinton,
you won't be aII up in here...

925
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
...doing aII that New New stuff.

926
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm not going to Brinton.

927
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,120
-I'm going to SpeIman.
-Oh, you going to SpeIman.

928
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
WeII, your daddy seems a IittIe confused.

929
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,560
Yo, what happened?

930
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,000
She took care of me in the parking Iot.

931
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,840
-No.
-Yeah, that right.

932
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,120
Here come your boy.

933
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280
Hey, yo, Ant.

934
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,960
What up, big time?
Hey, man, I heard you got that fire.

935
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,880
How come I'm the onIy one that ain't
getting bIessed? Hook me up, man.

936
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,840
Fine, nigga, what you need?

937
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,480
-Whatever, man. Whatever, nigga.
-Right. ExactIy.

938
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,720
Hey, where Esquire at?

939
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,160
I don't know, man. I ain't seen him
since I dropped him off Saturday.

940
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
-I ain't seen him either.
-Rashad. Rashad.

941
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,160
Rashad, Ant just got arrested.

942
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,160
-Come on, they got your brother.
-Get up!

943
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,680
-What the heII going on?
-Let's go, man. Let's go, man.

944
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,240
-Anton Swann.
-Right here. Right here.

945
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,040
-Swann.
-That be me, sir.

946
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
-Swann. Front and center.
-Oh, man.

947
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
I got a gun, man.

948
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Come on, boss. Let me be out.

949
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,840
Thank you, man.

950
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,640
It's aII part of the game, young buck.

951
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,080
Now aII you got to do is
put a IittIe overtime in, you know.

952
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,000
We get the books square,
you be good.

953
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
You have to get in the house
before your brother get hurt.

954
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,440
Where he coming from?

955
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
I think he's coming right about now.

956
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,560
What you doing with my
brother in your car?

957
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,880
You got him trapping?
That's what's happening?

958
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,120
-Get out.
-Hey, hoId up, hoId up.

959
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
What you reaching for?
You ain't fitting to do nothing.

960
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,880
With your bitch ass.
Bust a move, then.

961
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,040
-Thought so. Anton, get your ass out the car.
-You don't know--

962
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
Watch your rabid ass, man.

963
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,120
-Get in this house, man.
-Get off me.

964
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,600
Both of y'aII get in the house
before I take off my beIt.

965
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,880
Whatever, partner. You know me.
Come get some. Get in the house.

966
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Nobody toId y'aII Iight-skinned dudes
ain't in styIe no more?

967
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
-Get off!
-You out your rabid-ass mind, homeboy.

968
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Rookies.

969
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,000
Man, get in your room, man.

970
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Man, I ain't pIaying with you, bro.

971
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Man, you ain't nobody's dad!

972
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,520
You heard what I said.
What you gonna do?

973
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
I'm gonna Ieave.

974
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
-You think you're a dope boy?
-Hey, hey!

975
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,440
-You tough, huh?
-Get up. Get off of him.

976
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,200
You aII right?

977
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,480
What the heII is going on here?

978
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,920
OId dumb-ass here
got arrested for seIIing weed.

979
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,920
You better get in your room,
Iike he said.

980
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,920
I ain't gonna have y'aII tearing up
my house.

981
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
Come on, man. Let me taIk to you.

982
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,000
Look here. Now, I know
you might be a IittIe upset...

983
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,920
...but Iet's be grown foIks
about this thing, aII right?

984
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,120
Now, you may not wanna hear it,
but that boy gonna do what he wanna do.

985
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,680
A few extra doIIars
in the house ain't gonna hurt.

986
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,160
I can't beIieve you, man.

987
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,560
Look, hey, hey, hey.

988
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,280
I got a mortgage to pay every month.

989
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,160
-You know the water heater done cracked.
-What that mean?

990
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,640
You just gonna Iet your nephew
ruin his Iife over a few doIIars?

991
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,800
What kind of man is you?

992
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm the same kind of man
took his sister's two kids in...

993
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,520
...so they couId stay together.

994
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,080
Take us--? Hey, we took you in, man.

995
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,040
-What?
-Hey, be cIear, this is my daddy's house.

996
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,000
I been running things here
since I was 1 5.

997
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
-You just been getting over.
-Getting over?

998
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,880
Boy.

999
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
You best....

1000
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, right.

1001
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,760
I ain't never wanted none of this.

1002
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Pushing a damn broom the rest of my Iife.
I'm 41 years oId.

1003
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm a grown-ass man.

1004
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
You see a decent car sitting
out in that driveway?

1005
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
You see women roIIing through here?

1006
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,360
-That's your fauIt, man.
-HeII, no.

1007
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,160
Because don't no woman want no man
with two dumb-ass kids and no money.

1008
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
A janitor.

1009
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Shit, I'm a janitor. A janitor.

1010
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
Boy.

1011
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, I shouId've just Iet
y'aII's asses go to foster care.

1012
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Then I wouIdn't even be in this mess.

1013
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,040
What?

1014
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,240
-Hello?
-Hey.

1015
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,840
Can you meet me somewhere?

1016
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,840
-Hi.
-Hey.

1017
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,720
Why are we here on oId peopIe's night?

1018
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
They from CoIIege Park.

1019
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,960
How you know that?

1020
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,760
Every side of town got
their own way of skating.

1021
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
They got, Iike, a IittIe bounce to them.

1022
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,080
That's Chicago. And that's Detroit
aII day Iong, right there.

1023
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
You taIk to Esquire today?

1024
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Ain't seen him aII day.

1025
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
Why?

1026
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,680
Nothing, I was just....

1027
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
Rashad?

1028
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,320
I kind of have something
I need to teII you.

1029
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
If it's bad...

1030
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,200
...I don't even wanna hear it.

1031
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,400
Got enough shitty news for one day.

1032
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,040
What's wrong?

1033
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,520
Everything.

1034
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,840
My Iife's a mess right now.

1035
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
Just tired of being Iied to.

1036
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,080
I keep trying to think of
what my pops wouId do.

1037
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,000
Can't come up with nothing.

1038
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,040
Hey...

1039
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
...it's gonna be okay.

1040
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,000
Hope you right, shorty.

1041
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,280
Hey.

1042
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,880
I'm starting to think this is our song.

1043
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh, yeah?

1044
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
Too bad we didn't bring our skates,
though, huh?

1045
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,840
Hey, babies, how y'aII doing?

1046
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,880
AII right, now. Be carefuI, babies.

1047
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh, man, is that the twins' mama?

1048
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,240
-Man.
-Ms. GayIe is a hot mess.

1049
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
I was gonna wait tiII Sunday,
but I got something for you.

1050
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,800
What?

1051
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,920
Thank you.

1052
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,040
Watch yourseIf.

1053
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
It's beautifuI.

1054
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,920
-I'm gIad you Iike it.
-I Iove it.

1055
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,520
It's time we had a brother-to-brother talk.

1056
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,400
Or to put it delicately,
a talk about the birds and the bees.

1057
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,840
At 1 3, girls are just like comic books...

1058
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,120
...loaded with adventure,
easy to understand...

1059
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
...and don't cost more
than a quarter to take out.

1060
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,880
In this house, we never
discussed our problems.

1061
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,320
We just watched Good Times.
It seemed like the answer to everything.

1062
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,760
When you get a little older, I'll teach you
how to handle yourself in the NFL of love.

1063
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,200
My pops always told me
to take care of my little brother.

1064
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
I hope I got through to him.

1065
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,200
Here we go. It's gonna be
a Iong night for some of y'aII.

1066
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,080
We got the Warriors, the Preps
and the Ones in the house tonight, baby.

1067
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
Look, you see them boys
practicing their moves.

1068
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,040
Tonight we break out the secret weapon.
Y'aII remember how?

1069
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
-I'm gonna break it down. For reaI.
-I remember, I got it.

1070
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,080
No, no, no, Iike this here:

1071
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,160
So...and...and...?

1072
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,800
-You got a crick in your neck?
-HeII, no. Come on, man.

1073
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,400
-Watch what I'm about to do. HoId up, man.
-Watch.

1074
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,240
-Before you mess us up again.
-Watch.

1075
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,320
-What's up, y'aII?
-Hey, what's happening?

1076
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
-Oh, you wanna hug me.
-We gotta go.

1077
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,000
-We gotta go. Ma's coming.
-See you.

1078
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
-Bye.
-Bye.

1079
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,120
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

1080
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I just bagged the shorty
that work at the snack bar.

1081
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Free hot wings. Let's go, baby. Come on!

1082
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,960
-WeII, heII, yeah. Come on.
-What? We ain't gotta chase no chicken.

1083
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,480
PrisciIIa, it's Janice.

1084
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,040
I have some disturbing news
to share with you.

1085
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,440
Shut up!

1086
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,800
What they caII this, Star?

1087
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,320
Damn, who is you?

1088
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,160
He a retired rapper or something.

1089
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,200
Attitude.

1090
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
He do got a attitude,
but his car is cute, though.

1091
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,160
-I Iike that. Let's touch it.
-Okay.

1092
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,520
Let's go.

1093
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,080
-Bambi's Iike a ghetto taIe.
-How?

1094
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,040
Moms gets shot in the head.
She ain't doing nothing.

1095
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,000
Pops is never there.
House gets burned down, insurance reasons.

1096
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,800
And out of nowhere, she pregnant.

1097
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,080
Father's never there,
you know what I mean?

1098
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,480
You feeI what I'm saying? House
burned down, he meets a girI, then--

1099
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,160
-Dad, how did you--?
-Let's go. Erin, get up, now.

1100
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,200
That's your fauIt, man.
How you gonna Iet him take your girI?

1101
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,160
See, if she were with me--
Oh, you gonna shush me now, huh?

1102
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,080
Why you ain't shushing the oId man?

1103
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,360
See, now you wanna get buck, man.
He gone, now. He gone, fooI.

1104
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,280
Get in.

1105
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,920
-Yo, what's up?
-Where you going?

1106
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,320
-It's aII right, it's my dad.
-It's your daddy?

1107
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,880
Is he stiII with your mama?

1108
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,160
Keep it up, hear?
Keep it up. Lie to me again.

1109
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
Lie to me again.

1110
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,760
What'd you say?
Get back down here!

1111
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,080
How couId you humiIiate me Iike that?

1112
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,160
You were supposed to be over at HoIIy's
house getting some rest before practice.

1113
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,840
Baby, you been Iying...

1114
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,440
...about where you been going
and who you been with.

1115
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
What if something happened to you?

1116
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm sorry, Mom.

1117
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Why can't I pick my friends
and choose things in Iife for myseIf?

1118
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Because you're not making
very good choices, baby.

1119
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,440
I mean, you got a Iot of
good opportunities to choose from.

1120
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,160
Like what? Going to Brinton?

1121
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
Oh, baby.

1122
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,680
SpeIman is a great schooI,
but your father and I just--

1123
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
-But what?
-WeII, we're saying...

1124
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,840
...Iook at some other choices,
some other options.

1125
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,000
-What?
-Keep taIking to Mother Iike that...

1126
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,880
...and your Iips wiII beat you
to the hospitaI.

1127
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,320
You know how Iucky you are?

1128
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,360
Yes, Daddy.
I do know that I am very fortunate.

1129
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,880
Thank you for being a great parent.

1130
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,920
But I knew if I were to ask to go over there,
you wouId've had a heart attack!

1131
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,480
You damn right! You know why?
Because I was that guy.

1132
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,000
I know what he wanted from you.

1133
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
And it wasn't them big-ass earrings.

1134
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,080
Why do you aIways think somebody
aIways wants something?

1135
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
I work too hard.
I don't wanna see you go down--

1136
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,080
I don't have to expIain myseIf.

1137
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Why? If you don't have to expIain,
I don't have to expIain.

1138
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Because I said so!

1139
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,080
You better go to bed now.

1140
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,880
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1141
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,640
Let's just caIm down...

1142
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,080
...and coIIect ourseIves,
and taIk about this in the morning.

1143
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
There's nothing more to taIk about.

1144
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
End of conversation.

1145
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,440
Yo, man, you aII right?

1146
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,080
Just checking on you, man.

1147
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
You knew, huh?

1148
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,040
AII this time.

1149
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,040
That was the same car
from the Garnett's house.

1150
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
Man....

1151
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,640
That's fouI, man.

1152
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
-Look, man, I'm sorry, I--
-Hey, hey, hey.

1153
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
Man, get out.

1154
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,320
-But just hear me out, man.
-Bounce.

1155
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't wanna see you, taIk to you,
kick it with you, skate with you.

1156
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,320
Nothing, man.

1157
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,120
-Come on.
-You stiII here?

1158
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm gone.

1159
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
What you gonna do with it, man?

1160
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,480
-Hey-- What up, man?
-Yeah.

1161
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
And the rest of y'aII niggas, man,
get the fuck off my porch.

1162
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
-What we do?
-Man, you heard me, homes.

1163
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, you ain't gotta teII me twice.

1164
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,120
-Yeah, weII, bust a move then, partner.
-Was it me?

1165
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,600
Man, I think it was your breath.
It usuaIIy is.

1166
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,000
Whatever, man. You aIways eating
those sunfIowers, you country.

1167
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,920
-Hey, hey.
-I'm teII-- It's the A-Town.

1168
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,720
HoId it, now.

1169
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
-John.
-Yeah?

1170
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
Not Iike pIaying goIf, is it, boy?

1171
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
Look, sir, this is fun...

1172
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,280
-...but I came to taIk to you.
-What about?

1173
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,960
I came to give you this back.

1174
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,120
Did I make an error somewhere?

1175
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,920
No, I made the mistake.

1176
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,040
Not being honest with you before.

1177
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,280
What about?

1178
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,000
I Iive five bIocks away from Cascade's
on the south side.

1179
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,000
-You said you went to Mount Paran.
-I do.

1180
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,000
I use the cIub address
to go to schooI in a better district.

1181
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,080
So you're just a Iiar?

1182
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,200
My parents can't afford
to send me to private schooI, sir.

1183
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,080
So you knew Erin before you met me?

1184
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,120
Yes, I knew Erin.

1185
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,120
-But I didn't know you was her father.
-You expect me to beIieve that?

1186
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,760
-I got your game, Ben.
-My game?

1187
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,120
I don't pIay games, Mr. Garnett.

1188
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,120
That's one thing I do not do
is pIay games.

1189
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,080
I'm too busy trying to make it out.

1190
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,480
I figured you knew that,
coming up on the south side.

1191
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,120
As far as the Ietter, I just thought the Ietter
wouId give me a better shot, that's aII.

1192
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,960
We'II never know now, wiII we?
You can Iet yourseIf out.

1193
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,640
You know, I read in this articIe...

1194
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,160
...where you said being a CEO
didn't make you a proud man...

1195
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,760
...being a proud man made you a CEO.

1196
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,120
But a proud man doesn't hide
where he comes from.

1197
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
Be carefuI.

1198
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,440
See, with or without that Ietter,
I'm gonna make it.

1199
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,000
And I won't forget MechanicsviIIe, Georgia,
made me who I am.

1200
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,440
With aII due respect, sir,
it made you who you are.

1201
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Might heIp your daughter
to know that too.

1202
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,320
Come on.

1203
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
HoIIer at your boy, man.

1204
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,720
I made them come...

1205
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,000
...so you wouIdn't kick my ass.

1206
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,280
Man, come on, dog. Damn.

1207
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,800
Man, we friends, man.
We boys. Hear him out.

1208
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,920
I just wanted to say sorry.

1209
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,720
And if it mean anything to you,
I gave the Ietter back.

1210
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,000
What you do that for?

1211
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,080
-Hope you ain't think it was for me.
-It was for me.

1212
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
I didn't want it Iike that.

1213
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,040
Hey, Iook, man.
We about to go to Cascade.

1214
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,560
Now, tonight is our night.

1215
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,360
You aIready know what it is,
homeboy.

1216
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,680
I mean, we're Iike the Yankees, baby.
We're Iike--

1217
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,880
We're Iike the BuIIs in the '90s.
We're Iike the Lakers.

1218
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,560
No, not the Lakers.
But we're a dynasty.

1219
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,120
When we're out on that rink,
nobody can touch us, man.

1220
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,960
Nobody. Let's go.

1221
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,360
No. I'm gonna Iet y'aII have it.
I don't skate no more.

1222
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,280
Oh, man, you acting Iike a femaIe, man.

1223
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,880
-HeII, man.
-Yeah, whatever.

1224
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,640
Ladies and gentIemen, this is the moment
you've aII been waiting for.

1225
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,280
Skate Wars is here.

1226
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,400
I just got word Rashad Swann
ain't here tonight...

1227
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,840
...so the Ones are not in competition.

1228
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,680
Damn. This sucks, man.

1229
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,440
-It reaIIy sucks.
-Hey, man, my arm is skinnier.

1230
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
No, no, no. Your arm ain't skinnier,
your face got bigger.

1231
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,120
-Hate to put it to you Iike that, man, hey.
-You Iaughing, and we're gonna Iose.

1232
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,160
I ain't been down here in a whiIe.
Love what you've done with the pIace.

1233
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,280
Yeah, Iooks Iike you reaIIy Iet
your IittIe partners piss you off.

1234
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,160
I don't wanna taIk about it.

1235
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,840
Boy, I just came to teII you
there's some Iemonade upstairs.

1236
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,240
Best batch I ever made too.

1237
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,520
Now, that's good.

1238
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Now, Iook, I ain't trying
to get in your business...

1239
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,560
...but, I mean, I do know
a IittIe something about being pissed.

1240
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,400
I mean, it's aII--
You know, it's aII just feeIings, man.

1241
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,040
From femaIes to friends to funeraIs...

1242
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,040
...it's aII about the feeIings.

1243
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
I just want you to recognize
the difference...

1244
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,240
...between what you feeI
and what's reaI.

1245
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,200
That way you don't Iook back on Iife
with a bunch of regret.

1246
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,920
-What's happening?
-This Ant?

1247
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,520
-No, this ain't Ant. Who is this?
-Is this little big brother?

1248
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,920
What the heII is you caIIing my house for,
man?

1249
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,440
The streetlight's on
and our boy ain't come home yet.

1250
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm gonna have to get out here
and go find him.

1251
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,080
HeII is you taIking about?
My brother ain't your business no more.

1252
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,120
Like hell. y eah, and he ain't
into me for two G's either.

1253
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,840
And I ain't about to put some hot shit
in his chest, you know what I'm saying?

1254
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,320
You better stay away
from my IittIe brother, partner.

1255
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,640
Boy, stop.

1256
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,600
What's up, Ant?

1257
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,240
I ain't heard from you in a whiIe, boy.
Boy, where you been?

1258
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,920
No, no, I-- I'm cooI.

1259
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,480
I mean, I'm cooI.
It's just taking me a minute, that's aII.

1260
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,280
But I'm gonna straighten everything out
as soon as I get that money.

1261
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Cognac.

1262
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
Remember what I toId you, right?

1263
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,000
-Yeah.
-What'd I say?

1264
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,960
-It's grown-man business.
-It's grown-man business.

1265
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,680
Got your ass.

1266
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,160
Scared as heII, man.

1267
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,320
-Goddamn, CarI Lewis, where you going?
-Come on, man, pIease.

1268
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,040
PIease what?
What? What? PIease what?

1269
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
Boy, you're shaking Iike a stripper.
Tighten up.

1270
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,320
I'm so disappointed in you this evening.

1271
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,760
Look at me when I'm taIking to you, boy.

1272
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,000
I know that ain't who I think it is.

1273
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,960
-LittIe big brother.
-Get in the car, Ant.

1274
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
I toId you to Ieave my brother aIone.

1275
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,640
-Y'aII so funny.
-You got a probIem, you deaI with me.

1276
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,120
-Nigga, who the heII is you?
-He owe you some money?

1277
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,640
-Here you go.
-Oh, shit.

1278
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,080
-Yeah, I'm tired--
-That was so disrespectfuI.

1279
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,560
You done hit me in my mouth
with some goddamn money.

1280
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
Yeah.

1281
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,600
You don't get it, do you?

1282
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm his daddy now.

1283
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,120
Get out the way.

1284
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,480
Pleasure turns to the pain

1285
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,160
Of the lessons learned from the strain
Of the questions burned in my brain

1286
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,400
About whether love is humane
In its touch.

1287
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,320
These thoughts are like salmon

1288
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,720
Swimming upstream
In the tears of your deceit

1289
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
Fighting the current hurt
That kills more than is created

1290
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
By the chaos of our intertwined emotions

1291
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,480
Chaotic because the anchor
Of Eros' arrow

1292
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,000
Has been plucked from the vessel
Of my undying infatuation

1293
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,320
Separation not as simple
As the distance between us

1294
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,720
My mind no longer possessed
By the demons

1295
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,040
That had been the overseers
Of my enslavement to your lies

1296
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,280
The seeds of these lies
Rooted so deeply

1297
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,960
They have cracked the foundation
Of what we once shared

1298
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,240
Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside
To gush out like a river

1299
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,560
Ripping the image of our future together
From my thoughts

1300
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,600
As violently and as brutally
As if it were a child being taken

1301
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
From his mother's arms

1302
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm left surrounded in darkness

1303
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,280
But I refuse to be swallowed by it

1304
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,800
My loneliness like the night air.
Invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch

1305
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,080
In its cold uncomfortableness

1306
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
y et if I could do it all over again

1307
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,960
I'd do it in the same skin I'm in

1308
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
To lay down and let love die

1309
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,920
Just stay down and let love lie

1310
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,760
No, no, not I

1311
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,240
I'll stay 'round and let love fly

1312
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Even though I have seen
Its darkest form, deceit

1313
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,160
Nothing else could taste this warm
Or feel this sweet

1314
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,560
So you gonna stay mad at me forever?

1315
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
It ain't even about that, bro.

1316
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,280
I mean, Iike, when you was a baby,
I couIdn't waIk for you.

1317
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,160
And I can't waIk for you now.

1318
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm sorry.

1319
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,120
-Rashad, I'm not gonna be messing up.
-Hey, Ant.

1320
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,840
I Iove you, regardIess.

1321
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,760
I can teach you everything
under the sun...

1322
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,680
...but I can't be a man for you.

1323
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,720
You gotta figure out
the best way to do that yourseIf.

1324
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,320
We didn't win Skate Wars that night.

1325
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,280
But I got something better.

1326
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,800
I got my friends, I got my girl,
and I got my little brother back.

1327
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,000
Teddy finally graduated from high school.

1328
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,560
He even opened up his own spot.
He call it ''Gangsta Grills. ''

1329
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,760
But see, that's what I wanted, though.

1330
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,280
Okay, weII, hey, if that what you want,
I got my money, we straight.

1331
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,120
-That's right.
-There it is.

1332
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,000
Brooklyn finally found a job
he could keep.

1333
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
CongratuIations.

1334
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,080
Esquire got a mysterious
letter of recommendation...

1335
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,400
...for the Falcon Scholarship.

1336
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,480
Guess Garnett ain't so bad after all.

1337
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,920
My boy's in the Ivy League.

1338
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,040
Hey, get back up and try it again,
baby girIs.

1339
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,000
Skateman says get back up, try it again.

1340
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,560
-Get out of here.
-We know how to skate, okay?

1341
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,720
-We getting up.
-This is so embarrassing.

1342
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,920
Twins, well, they still at Cascade
every Sunday night.

1343
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,120
Ghetto fabulous.

1344
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,160
Uncle George quit dealing
with them dating services...

1345
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,920
...and went to church
and got him a real woman.

1346
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,440
She's nice.

1347
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,240
New New finally convinced her parents
that Spelman was right for her.

1348
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm glad she's close.

1349
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,080
My little brother let go of all his
dope-boy ambitions...

1350
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,160
...and finally got it together.

1351
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,240
I'm proud of him.

1352
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,600
As for me...

1353
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,600
...I never realized I was dreaming
all along...

1354
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,160
...because I was always drawing.

1355
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,680
My pop said I'd put these skates down
when I found something more important.

1356
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,000
I think he was right.

1357
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,120
This is the beginning.

1358
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,360
