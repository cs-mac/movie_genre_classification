1
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,499
I have dogs bigger than that.

2
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,587
I thought you said
there were panthers here.

3
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,593
I ain't seen a panther
in these mountains for 9 years.

4
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,053
Then what about the carcass
Snipes found up in Noland?

5
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,806
- Something mauled that.
- That weren't no panther.

6
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,851
The chest weren't tore open.

7
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,603
They eat the heart first.

8
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,192
You find me an honest-to-God panther
to hunt

9
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,485
and I'll give you a $20 gold piece.

10
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,865
If there's a panther still around,
it's likely touched by the devil.

11
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,326
May end up hunting you.

12
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,286
Well, I want one.

13
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,974
Vaughn. Would you have the girl
bring me my meal?

14
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,318
- Coming down!
- Stand clear!

15
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,196
Timber!

16
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,130
George!

17
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,257
All right, bring her around.

18
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,261
Albert! What are you doing out here?

19
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,430
Well, a letter came from the bank.

20
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,641
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

21
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,648
Look, you're going to have to
renegotiate the loan.

22
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,946
I'll go up to Boston next week
and settle it. Don't fret.

23
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,281
Get it up! Come on.

24
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,783
- My uncle's a partner. Don't forget.
- That's right but still.

25
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,078
See, if we go up the north ridge
and we carry it all the way down...

26
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,882
Get it off!

27
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,096
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

28
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:14,081
Rumour has it that Congress is creating
a national park in Carolina.

29
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,957
Well, the park may come.

30
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,378
By the time the government takes
the land,

31
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,879
there won't be a tree standing.

32
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,591
The trouble is, George,
with this recent market crash,

33
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,011
I'm afraid your stocks are no longer
sufficient collateral

34
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,097
for us to roll a loan over.

35
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,933
I mean, all my capital
is wrapped up in Carolina.

36
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,977
What about this land in Brazil?

37
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,065
I'd rather not touch that.

38
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,488
You should have married Peg Lowell
when you had the chance.

39
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,698
Then you wouldn't have to bow
and scrape for your bankers.

40
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,826
Well, you're up on the news, aren't you?

41
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,787
I am. That's why you should
talk to your sister more often.

42
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,790
- I came to visit you this week.
- Once.

43
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,958
In how long?

44
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,795
I don't know what you're doing
tearing down that mountain,

45
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,839
God knows where, and for what?

46
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,133
Why can't you ever do anything sensible?

47
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,552
I'm doing quite well, thank you.

48
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,221
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.

49
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,619
That woman you're slavering over
is practically an aborigine, you know.

50
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,788
Raised on a timber camp.

51
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,583
A timber camp?

52
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,710
Yes, I thought you'd like that.

53
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,172
Unfortunately, it burned down
and killed her whole family.

54
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,009
And 2 days after the fire,

55
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,344
a rescue party found Serena
wandering in the ruins,

56
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,263
calling for her dead brothers
and sisters.

57
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,350
She was so covered in ash,
they thought she was a ghost.

58
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,564
She is beautiful.

59
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,193
Wounded.

60
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,820
Mad for trees.

61
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,947
Hmm.

62
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,617
It's a pity you don't stand a chance
with her.

63
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,540
What are you doing?

64
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,419
- I just wanted to say hello.
- Well, hello.

65
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,422
George Pemberton.

66
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,967
Serena Shaw.

67
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,643
I think we should be married.

68
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,862
I can't wait to get there.

69
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,431
Oh! Welcome back!

70
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,724
- Splendid trip.
- Good!

71
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,392
- I can't wait to fill you in.
- Yeah.

72
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,060
I hope you didn't get all dolled up
on my account.

73
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,353
Oh, no, no.

74
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

75
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,076
What...

76
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,203
Well, what do you think of my wife?

77
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,582
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I, you know...

78
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,376
Jesus, George! Why didn't you tell me?

79
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,753
I would have, you know...

80
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,547
This is Buchanan.
He's my right-hand man.

81
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,382
- Serena Pemberton.
- Oh.

82
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,010
Don't you know how to shake hands
properly, Mr. Buchanan?

83
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,596
Well, of course I do.
I'm very happy to meet you.

84
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,264
And, uh, well, welcome!

85
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,974
So did Galloway find my panther yet?

86
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,268
Well, a worker found some tracks
up on Laurel Creek

87
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,187
but Galloway thinks that was a bobcat.

88
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,856
- Are panthers common here?
- No, no, nothing to worry about.

89
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,067
I mean, there's some question
as to whether there are any left at all.

90
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,912
I was hoping to see my new home
before it gets dark.

91
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,830
Yes, of course.

92
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,672
- That girl...
- It doesn't matter.

93
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,092
Our love began the day we met.

94
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,054
Nothing that happened before
even exists.

95
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,200
Keep your eyes closed.

96
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,037
Give me your hand.

97
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,039
Step down. Watch your head.

98
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,959
One more. One more. Okay. Okay. Wait.

99
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,712
On 3, you can open your eyes.

100
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,091
1, 2, 3.

101
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,595
That's beautiful, George.

102
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,310
And that's just the start.

103
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,438
I bought an amazing property in Brazil.

104
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,649
- Brazil?
- Yes.

105
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,612
Virgin forest for hundreds of miles.
Mahogany.

106
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,366
Raw and beautiful.

107
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,785
Completely untouched.

108
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,874
Can't find something like that
in America.

109
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,712
You want that, don't you?

110
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,338
More than anything.

111
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,634
I never thought I'd find you.

112
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,097
I never thought I'd find anyone.

113
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,309
Really. You have no idea.

114
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,368
Doc! Doc!

115
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,329
Come on.

116
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,584
Chaney!
Got ourselves another one.

117
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,962
Ah, you're too late. There's nothing
I can do. Put him in the chair.

118
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,549
Rattlesnake?

119
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,384
Yeah,
it's gotten worse since you left.

120
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,719
The crews get spooked and fall behind.

121
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,596
We've lost 6 men
in the last 2 months.

122
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,097
Shit.

123
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,602
In Colorado, we had a trained eagle
to keep the snakes under control.

124
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,358
Right. Well, I don't think you'll find
any eagles in Carolina, Mrs. Pemberton.

125
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,568
Well, we should import one.

126
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,781
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, we should import one. Why not?

127
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:02,043
So I understand you have some experience
in the lumber business, Mrs. Pemberton?

128
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,504
My father had 40,000 acres in Colorado.

129
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,880
Had?

130
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,925
I do hope he didn't lose them
in this awful crash.

131
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,260
He died.

132
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,430
Her father was
a first-rate timber man, Dr. Chaney.

133
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,392
He had her riding the slope
before she could walk.

134
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,561
Well, that gives you
the advantage over us, Mrs. Pemberton.

135
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,314
I sure would like to know what you think
of our little operation here.

136
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,442
Aside from our obvious lack
of an eagle, that is.

137
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,031
I think you've taken 9 months
to do about 6 months' work.

138
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,368
But a few changes should greatly
increase profitability.

139
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,912
What did you find, a wife or a partner?

140
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,415
Both.

141
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,085
I suppose Mrs. Buchanan
takes no interest in your work?

142
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,379
Oh, I'm a bachelor.

143
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,757
I can assure you, Mr. Buchanan,

144
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,260
I didn't come to Carolina
to do needlepoint.

145
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,936
Of course not.

146
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,521
She is a pistol.

147
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,116
Buchanan's a funny one, isn't he?

148
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,204
He seems a little bit, I don't know,

149
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,623
too fond of you.

150
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,961
What do you mean?

151
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,968
He'll loosen up.

152
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,637
Yeah.

153
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,554
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

154
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,020
Mrs. Pemberton's father owned
the Vulcan Lumber Company in Colorado.

155
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,774
And she's equal to any man here.

156
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,862
I expect you to follow her orders

157
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,616
the same way you follow mine
or Mr. Campbell or Mr. Buchanan's.

158
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,372
And she'll take no quarter
and she'll expect none.

159
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,252
You'll soon see the truth of that.

160
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,962
Good day.

161
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,048
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

162
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,134
Come on, now.
Let's get to it.

163
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,886
The trees ain't gonna
cut themselves, boys.

164
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,829
- Mrs. Pemberton.
- Campbell.

165
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,123
How's everything going?

166
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,084
Well, good as can be expected, ma'am.

167
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,671
Don't notch so high!

168
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,465
You're wasting a foot of timber.

169
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,012
Any lower won't fall clear, ma'am.
Yonder's in the way.

170
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,097
Give me your axe.

171
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,266
- Ma'am?
- You heard me.

172
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,660
- It'll clear.
- Ma'am.

173
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,164
What do you think?

174
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,212
She'll clear.

175
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,631
Get back to work.

176
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,800
Who's that man up there?

177
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,053
His name is Galloway, ma'am.

178
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,972
- He seems stand of fish.
- He is.

179
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,475
He's the best hunting guide
in over a hundred miles.

180
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,145
Track a grasshopper on a cap rock.
He say he has a gift of visioning.

181
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,856
Whatever that is, I don't know.

182
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,073
Mr. Galloway.

183
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,992
Serena Pemberton.

184
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,580
You were in prison.

185
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,836
Why?

186
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,589
Manslaughter.

187
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,091
He had it coming.

188
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,513
Stand back, now.

189
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,769
- Timber!
- Tree down!

190
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,905
Our Smoky Mountains contain
the last virgin forests

191
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,616
in the eastern United States.

192
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,287
But with every passing year,
we're losing 'em

193
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,624
to the cut-and-run philosophy
of the logging barons.

194
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:40,798
But we're fools if we think
that what God has created

195
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,551
can be sacrificed for a quick profit.

196
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,306
The simple question before us is this,
ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,728
Do we want our Smoky Mountains
to be made a national park?

198
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,106
Or do we want them to be made a desert?

199
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,989
Thank you, Mr. Kephart. And thank you
all for showing up this afternoon.

200
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,908
What about the jobs, Sheriff?

201
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,618
These men need to work, don't they?

202
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,914
And the logging camps bring
in railroads and electric lines

203
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,750
to places that never had them before.

204
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,585
We're bringing progress to Carolina.

205
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,588
Progress? Progress for whom,
Mr. Pemberton?

206
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,923
All the profits are going north.

207
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,426
Well, what is it
that your park's providing?

208
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,803
I'm sure your park
will be very nice for you

209
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,348
and your rich friends to go
on a Sunday afternoon hike

210
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,975
but for the working men,
the men in this room, Sheriff,

211
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:37,438
the men unlike you, Mr. Kephart,
it's a matter of survival.

212
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,148
He's right, Sheriff.

213
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,110
The logging barons always cry "jobs"
and "free enterprise"

214
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,281
but the truth is, you barely pay enough
to put food on the table.

215
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,785
Oh, we pay more than
any job these men can get.

216
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,537
And that's why there's a line 50-deep
every time there's an opening.

217
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,375
Openings. Yes, you always have openings,
don't you, Mr. Pemberton?

218
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,796
Because your camps have killed more men
than the War Between the States.

219
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,465
It's dangerous work.

220
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,634
And every logger will tell you
he's proud of what he does.

221
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,302
And I don't think he wants
the government

222
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,970
to build him a pretty park, Sheriff.

223
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,722
I think he wants the freedom.

224
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,144
The freedom to work hard
and to better himself.

225
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,147
That's what this country
is supposed to be about, Sheriff!

226
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,983
- Yeah! That's right!
- Yeah! Yeah!

227
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,989
- You did wonderfully.
- Just told the truth.

228
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,661
1, 2, 3, smile! And flash!

229
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,171
I love you so much.

230
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,769
I have your child inside me.

231
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,905
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

232
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,495
Vaughn!

233
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,248
Put my horse in the stable.
They need to get used to each other.

234
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,917
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,092
- I'll get you some food and blankets.
- Don't bother.

236
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,303
I won't eat or sleep until she does.

237
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,514
- Well, I'm staying here with you.
- No, you're not.

238
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,806
I need to do this alone.

239
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,602
They need to know that it was a woman
who tamed the eagle.

240
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,145
All right. Everybody out.

241
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,793
Hi.

242
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,521
The prey believes that
if it keeps still, it won't be noticed.

243
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,815
But eventually it flinches.

244
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,318
And when it does,

245
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,861
the eagle always sees.

246
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,533
This, uh, park business
seems to be picking up speed.

247
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,245
Now that Rockefeller's thrown in
with them, they're making real offers.

248
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,581
- They'll be coming to us next?
- Yeah.

249
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,375
Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.

250
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,085
We're not interested.

251
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,213
Well, I was asking your husband's
opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.

252
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,423
Easy.

253
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,063
Well, I don't want you
to worry about it.

254
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,731
Well, I do.

255
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,483
We'll need about a million
to pay off the loan

256
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,985
and have enough money
to get going in Brazil.

257
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,570
That's 2 more years here in Carolina,

258
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,073
assuming this park business
doesn't shut us down.

259
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,991
We're going to have to
pay off a senator.

260
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,620
Listen. What do you think of Serena?

261
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,750
Oh, well, she's a lovely girl.

262
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,461
I'm sorry. I should have
said something to you earlier.

263
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,962
But Serena is different, you know.

264
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,008
She'd rather come to a godforsaken place
like Carolina

265
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,095
than sip tea with society ladies.

266
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,516
Can you imagine a woman like that?

267
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,687
Well, I don't have to imagine her,
George. She's right here with us.

268
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,940
I just don't want you to think of her
as my wife.

269
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,983
I want you to think of her as a partner.

270
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,610
Because she is.

271
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,028
A partner.

272
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,990
- Every cent she has, she gave to us.
- Right.

273
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,119
Well, I will indeed. A partner.

274
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,479
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Ladies.

275
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,197
So, this is for you, Senator.

276
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,158
- You have a nice campaign, now.
- I will.

277
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,326
Good day, Mr. Buchanan.

278
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,873
Does Mr. Pemberton think bribes
can stop the park?

279
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,876
Oh, well, nothing wrong
with having friends in high places.

280
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,172
I'm surprised Mrs. Pemberton
isn't handling the bribery by now.

281
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,176
I hear she's taken charge
of everything else at the camp.

282
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,846
I understand why
you might think so, Sheriff.

283
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,222
But you don't really know.

284
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,184
We'd like to make you a proposition.

285
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,288
- Sheriff McDowell.
- Buchanan.

286
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,208
- Welcome. How are you today?
- Good. Thank you.

287
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,709
Good. Good to see you.

288
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,044
Mr. Kephart.

289
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,545
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

290
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,880
- How are you?
- All right.

291
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,381
They seem chummy.

292
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,718
Has Buchanan ever done business
for them before?

293
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,553
Not that I know of.

294
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,228
This is your offer, then?

295
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,563
$400,000.

296
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,399
That's a good deal more than you'd get
on the open market, Mr. Pemberton.

297
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,776
Well, maybe that's true, Mr. Kephart.

298
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,487
But we're asking
for a million dollars firm, so...

299
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,576
The land was appraised at 300.

300
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,079
Before the crash.

301
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,920
Well, I am very sorry to have wasted
your time today, gentlemen but, um,

302
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,756
we were all under the assumption

303
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,008
that you were coming to us
with a formidable offer.

304
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,427
If we have to take this land
by eminent domain,

305
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,304
you'll be lucky to get a half
of what we're offering.

306
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,974
- Is that a threat, Sheriff?
- No, no, it's a fact.

307
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,018
Gentlemen, gentlemen, uh,
why don't we all, um,

308
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,478
reconsider our positions

309
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,106
and convene whenever the Pembertons
and I have looked through...

310
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,191
The fact is, Sheriff,

311
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,862
you need our land to build your park.

312
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,281
And our price is a million dollars.

313
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,866
Well, think a second time.

314
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,786
Because one false step
and those bankers you're in hock to

315
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,663
will be picking on the bones
of your fortune.

316
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,292
And I personally would hate to see
your pretty wife humiliated in that way.

317
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,295
You don't ever get to talk about wife,
let alone look at her.

318
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,880
You can leave now.

319
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,677
Good day. Good day, ma'am.

320
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,655
- How are you, Mr. Galloway?
- Well, Mr. Pemberton.

321
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,336
I thought you were coming with us?
Galloway's got a line on a panther.

322
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,255
Oh. I'm afraid not.
I've got business in Asheville.

323
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,841
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

324
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,188
Bobcat.

325
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,359
But, um, that ain't what you want,
is it, Mr. Pemberton?

326
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,944
No, it's not.

327
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,780
Next time, we come at nightfall.

328
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,366
If there's a panther roundabout,
you'll hear it.

329
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,912
You know that, uh,

330
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,707
that park agitator, Kephart?

331
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,542
He has a cabin here.
Do you know where that is?

332
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,044
I reckon I do.

333
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,714
I'd like to take a look.

334
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,017
I went by Kephart's cabin.

335
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,523
I, uh... Yeah, I've been negotiating
with them.

336
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,484
- Behind my back.
- Yeah. Well, look. Listen.

337
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,486
Listen, they'll go as high as 450 now.

338
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,947
You said a million.
That's what you always said.

339
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,326
George, you're going to have to forget
about Brazil.

340
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,994
That's...

341
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,713
You're not the same any more.

342
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,383
The only thing that's changed is you.

343
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,223
Look. I just want out.

344
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,021
I'll buy you out
as soon as we move to Brazil.

345
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,898
Oh, I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

346
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,984
Well, I'm not going to sell, Albert,
so you can't do anything about it.

347
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,028
That's the agreement, till I sell.

348
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,240
You know what?
I'll tell them about the bribes.

349
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,536
- Go ahead. You're as guilty as I am.
- No.

350
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,873
You're going to take the fall, George.
I get a deal if I testify.

351
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,543
I've had that arranged.

352
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,381
You're going to go to prison.
That's what's going to happen.

353
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,596
You're a son of a bitch.

354
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,521
It's so obvious now. My friend?
He was never my friend.

355
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,400
He'd come here and threaten me
in my home?

356
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,944
What we've built?
What I promised you, Serena?

357
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,404
What I've promised you!

358
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,739
How did we lose Brazil, George?

359
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,075
I don't understand.

360
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,411
Well, I had to put the land up
as collateral,

361
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,746
otherwise the bank wouldn't
roll over the loan.

362
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,792
Because that's what he's doing.
He's going to make us sell

363
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,419
and we're going to lose it, Serena,
everything.

364
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,589
Our future.
Everything that we talked about.

365
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,757
Why didn't you tell me about the land?

366
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,593
Well, I didn't think
that it would matter.

367
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,054
How was I supposed to know that he was
doing back-door deals with Kephart?

368
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,600
We promised
to tell each other everything.

369
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,481
- I didn't want to frighten you.
- I'm not that kind of woman.

370
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,569
The only thing that frightens me
is the thought that you don't trust me.

371
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,281
I'm sorry.

372
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,576
I told you what he was
on the first night, George.

373
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,621
He's jealous of me.
He's trying to destroy what we have.

374
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,414
Well, we're running out of time.

375
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,249
He said he's already
making up the paperwork.

376
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,126
Then we have a real problem.

377
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,338
I go to prison, it'll be over for us.

378
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,925
Then solve it.

379
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,848
He betrayed you, George.
He was never your friend.

380
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,426
Keep the horses back,
Campbell.

381
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,345
You hear me, boys?

382
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,557
Let Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Buchanan
set up on the orchard.

383
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,392
Come on. Get! Come on, now.

384
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,235
The bear's hunkered down
in them trees, Mr. Pemberton.

385
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,196
- Dogs will flush him out in no time.
- Thanks, Mr. Galloway.

386
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:49,242
Get, get! Come on.
Go get him. Come on.

387
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,375
Did Serena
take the news well?

388
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,256
Yeah, well, she's handled worse
than this, hasn't she?

389
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,551
Keeps her pride.
No matter what other people say.

390
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,996
Well, did you see that?

391
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,833
What...

392
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,215
Help!

393
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,391
Come on! Help me get him!

394
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,227
We need help over here!
We got a man down!

395
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,116
- Chaney...
- One shot. Rifle.

396
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,921
Sheriff.

397
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,466
We were set up on the same line
and the bear had come in between us

398
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,302
and by the time it had crossed through,
he was in my crosshairs.

399
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,434
Anyone with you?

400
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,270
No.

401
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,783
You see anything, Campbell?

402
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,462
No, I didn't see nothing, Sheriff.

403
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,640
Well, looks like your shot hit
dead centre of his heart.

404
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,475
Pretty amazing accident.

405
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,020
You and Buchanan got on, did you?

406
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,023
He was my best friend.

407
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,818
Take the body downtown.

408
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm going to have an autopsy done.

409
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,827
You got anything to add?

410
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,872
It was an accident.

411
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,625
How do you know that?

412
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,463
He ain't a good enough shot
to do it on purpose.

413
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,552
Anything else, Sheriff?

414
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,680
Not today, Mr. Pemberton.

415
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,182
Not today.

416
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,358
I had decided not to...

417
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,867
But then he turned around.

418
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,829
I wish I could have been beside you.

419
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,711
He was never your friend.

420
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,881
He betrayed you, George.

421
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,094
You don't understand.

422
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,432
Everything you did, you did for us.

423
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,893
For our future.

424
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,256
Come in.

425
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,764
- Uh, Mr. Buchanan's things.
- Ah.

426
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,647
The coroner agreed it was an accident.

427
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,482
Wrote it in the report.

428
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,319
I love you so much.

429
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,551
Thank you, sir.

430
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,553
Oh! Come on.

431
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,228
4. So, 41.

432
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,760
Does my scar bother you?

433
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,930
Of course not.

434
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,561
Whatever happened in that fire?

435
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,113
I was 12.

436
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,662
I used to sleep downstairs
because I would wake up early

437
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,289
to take care of the horses.

438
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,833
And I didn't want
to wake the little ones.

439
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,299
That's how I got out in time.

440
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,973
I knew they were still inside.

441
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,311
But I just kept running.

442
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,446
And I kept going until
I couldn't hear them screaming any more.

443
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,495
I was the oldest.

444
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,835
They were screaming for me.

445
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,807
You were only a child.

446
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,564
After that day, I swore that I would
never love anyone ever again.

447
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,862
I can't lose you.

448
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,156
You won't.

449
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,869
Ever.

450
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,507
What is it?

451
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,886
Rachel Hermann has come.
She's looking for her old job back.

452
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,555
Well, where is she?

453
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,349
Over in the chapel.

454
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,727
But there ain't no work in this town,
not for a young lady of her kind.

455
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,106
Widow Jenkins is kind of looking after
that boy of hers.

456
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,274
If she don't get a job,
her and that boy will starve.

457
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,740
We both know it wasn't her fault that
she got pregnant out of wedlock, now.

458
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,772
So you want your old job back?

459
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,774
Yes, sir.

460
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,779
- Well, you can start Monday.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,992
The, uh, child. What's the child's name?

462
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,955
Jacob. That's from the Bible.

463
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,254
That's a beautiful name.

464
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,799
Thank you.

465
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,304
Monday.

466
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,478
She knows that she has no claim on us,
of course? Nor her child.

467
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,812
No, she knows that, of course.

468
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,189
Campbell just said that
there's no work in town

469
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,482
and I don't want to let them starve.

470
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,818
Does she intend to bring the child
to work with her?

471
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,362
No, there's an old widow
that's going to take care of him.

472
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,324
Him.

473
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,160
- So it's a boy.
- Apparently.

474
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,039
Look, it doesn't make
one difference to me.

475
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,666
It's just I don't want them to struggle,
that's all.

476
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,168
Nor do I.

477
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,187
All right, boys.
Break's over!

478
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,490
Give me that.

479
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,377
Sorry.

480
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,235
Get his chin up.
Smile for me, Jacob.

481
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,778
Big smile, now.

482
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,073
That's it. Look at the birdie.

483
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,244
And, uh, hold it there now.

484
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,080
Can you get... Just raise him up
just a little bit higher, please?

485
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,876
That's good. That's good.
Just hold him there, now.

486
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,085
Okay. Jacob!

487
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,881
- Come on, now.
- Come on, now.

488
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,966
Just look at me.

489
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,596
Look at me please, Jacob. There you go.

490
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,098
Smile for me, now! Smile!

491
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,935
And flash!

492
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,314
Hold him still, miss.

493
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,662
Look at the birdie! And flash!

494
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,426
- You okay?
- Yes.

495
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,388
Come feel.

496
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,890
He's moving.

497
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,565
Right here.

498
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,196
Oh. Yeah.

499
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,576
The first of our dozen.

500
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,123
- You want me to take that?
- No, no, no!

501
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,375
I got it, Mr. Vaughn. Thank you.

502
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,426
It's perfect, George. He'll love it.

503
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,054
- How do you know it's a boy?
- I just do.

504
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,431
Well, maybe I'd like a girl.

505
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,142
No. You're not getting one.

506
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,436
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.

507
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,774
Thank you.

508
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,735
Over here!

509
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,279
Pick it up, now.

510
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,284
This one here.

511
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,807
Somebody give me a belt!
Give me your belt!

512
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,275
It's okay. It's okay.

513
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,277
Get him on the car.

514
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,698
Campbell! Chaney!

515
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,159
Load him up in the truck!

516
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,663
Campbell, go with him.

517
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,040
Get him in the van.
Come on, get in the truck.

518
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,001
Turn him around. Come on. I got him!

519
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,339
I'll live.

520
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,133
It's done been prophesied.

521
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,014
Damn fine job,
whoever tied that tourniquet.

522
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,891
He would have bled out otherwise.

523
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,189
Did you do that?

524
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,191
Yes.

525
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,867
- Were you riding a horse?
- Uh-huh.

526
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,748
Most likely something hasn't
lain right on your stomach.

527
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,084
It really does not feel
like a stomach-ache.

528
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,420
Well, it certainly isn't labour.

529
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,172
Now, the hospital at Asheville

530
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,341
can give you a second opinion,
if the discomfort is too much for you.

531
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,676
Well, let's go there, then.

532
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,511
That's not necessary.

533
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,222
- Mmm-hmm. All right.
- Bye.

534
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,444
- I'll get the doctor.
- No, George. George.

535
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,079
I just want to try to go to sleep.

536
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,956
All right.

537
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,416
You sure you don't want to
go to the hospital?

538
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,542
Yeah.

539
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,045
I'll feel better in the morning.

540
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,466
I love you.

541
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,593
I love you, too.

542
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,899
Campbell!

543
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,570
Campbell!

544
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,409
Oh, God.

545
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,631
- She's going to need more blood.
- Use mine.

546
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,816
It's going to be okay.

547
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,989
You're going to be fine.

548
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,205
The child is dead?

549
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,208
Yes.

550
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,338
A boy?

551
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:44,765
What?

552
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,559
What?

553
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,190
We won't be able to have another.

554
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,478
Take a warm bath
and I'll get the rest of the things.

555
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,191
- Get rid of it!
- What? What?

556
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,486
- Get rid of it! Get rid of it now!
- Okay, I'll...

557
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,289
I need to see your missus.

558
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,792
Well, she's resting now.

559
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,003
I can wait.

560
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,132
What for?

561
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,094
The day I was born, my mama had a vision

562
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,972
that I would lose much
but be saved by a woman.

563
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,142
Your missus is
the one from that prophecy.

564
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,148
And I'm honour-bound to her.

565
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,254
Mr. Pemberton!

566
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,132
What is it?
We're about to leave.

567
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,342
Uh, payday.

568
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,136
Need you to come open the safe.

569
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,473
Here, you do it.

570
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,808
- Don't forget to bring the key back.
- Thank you.

571
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,899
Watch your head.

572
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,484
Okay.

573
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,873
You'll have to testify to what you saw.

574
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,667
And what you did.

575
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,377
I can't promise you won't do time.

576
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,962
Don't have to.

577
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,800
I fully understand the consequences
of my actions.

578
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:03,012
There's a judge in Raleigh
you can show these to.

579
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,140
One they don't own yet.

580
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,684
You sure you still want to
go through with this?

581
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,394
You want me to take 'em?

582
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,080
You look stunning.

583
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,917
Thank you.

584
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,176
Everything's going to be all right.

585
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,344
I know.

586
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,723
We're going to go downstairs
and we're going to eat and dance and...

587
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,060
We're going to forget about
everything but each other.

588
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,945
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

589
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,416
What level of investment
do you require?

590
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,001
What's this, George?

591
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,671
This is my lovely wife.
This is Mr. Lowenstein.

592
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,340
The woman who tames eagles.

593
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,342
Your reputation precedes you.

594
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,678
Now, this is Mr. Calhoun.
These two gentlemen are...

595
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,187
Serena.

596
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,480
I want to dance.

597
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,274
These gentlemen are interested
in investing in Brazil.

598
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,859
But I love this song
and I really want to dance.

599
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,861
I think you should sit down.

600
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,197
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Lowenstein?
- No, that's not a good idea.

601
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,824
- Don't...
- Well, uh...

602
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:29,993
Of course, I'd be delighted to,
Mrs. Pemberton.

603
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,869
But I...

604
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,874
It's fine. Fine.

605
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,835
Thank you.

606
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:42,046
My husband is apparently
too busy to dance with me.

607
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,015
Campbell's gone missing.

608
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,351
You might want to check the safe.

609
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,275
He took the ledgers.

610
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,952
He can destroy us, George.

611
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,246
Just like Buchanan.

612
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,293
Hmm? Hmm?

613
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:45,646
Your daddy is a loving working man...

614
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,241
I know where Campbell is.

615
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,076
Good.

616
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:27,855
Locking yourself in?

617
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,276
I saw some tracks by the falls.

618
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,695
Looks like a panther.

619
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,783
Let me know when you want to kill it.

620
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,195
Mr. Campbell?

621
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,989
Get out! Get out!

622
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,157
Vaughn?

623
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,414
Mr. Pemberton's going to be very hungry
when he gets home.

624
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,874
Have cook make up all of his favourites

625
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,918
and bring them to the cabin
when he gets back.

626
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:42,837
Yes, ma'am.

627
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:13,784
Here's your supper.

628
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,954
I have some business to go take care of.

629
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,418
I'm doing this for us, George.

630
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,628
For our new world.

631
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,089
What are you talking about?

632
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,425
Brazil, of course.

633
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,303
We're going to be so happy there.

634
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,185
Give me the Sheriff. Quick!

635
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,196
Rachel stays with
the widow Jenkins sometimes.

636
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,697
It ain't far.

637
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,203
Mrs. Jenkins?

638
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,247
It's Sheriff McDowell.

639
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:28,502
Mrs. Jenkins?

640
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,773
We gotta get you out of here.

641
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,697
Is she all right?

642
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:21,722
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Come on in. Come on.

643
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,996
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

644
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,249
There was a murder
up on Colt Ridge last night.

645
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,001
Widow named Jenkins.

646
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,338
Never hurt a soul.
Somebody slashed her throat.

647
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,507
And, uh...

648
01:24:58,009 --> 01:24:59,676
why are you telling me?

649
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,304
I'd like to speak to your wife,
if you don't mind.

650
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,599
My wife?

651
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,018
She's not in there.

652
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:11,522
She went out with the cutting crew
earlier this morning.

653
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,690
That's convenient.

654
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:18,862
You happen to know where she and
that mongrel of hers were last night?

655
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,324
I know she had nothing to do
with some old woman's murder.

656
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,372
Well, that woman was looking
after Rachel Hermann's boy.

657
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,713
Is the child all right?

658
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,633
Ask your wife.

659
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:46,890
I don't need to.

660
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,564
You make no mistake.

661
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,024
They were coming for your boy.

662
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,028
Galloway slit Campbell's throat
the other day.

663
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:02,739
Your boy was next.

664
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,702
Expect your wife can tell you why,
Mr. Pemberton.

665
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,762
Tell me you didn't do it.

666
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,730
Tell me you didn't send Galloway.

667
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,609
It's okay, George.

668
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,118
It's okay.

669
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,829
It had to be done.

670
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,165
For us.

671
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:46,760
What had to be done?

672
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:52,766
You hurt me.

673
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,853
You said that I was enough for you.

674
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,360
You are enough for me.

675
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,862
You're lying.

676
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:10,701
I found the picture of your baby.

677
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,498
Our love is more important
than that child, isn't it?

678
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,045
Isn't it, George?

679
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,511
You just tell me where Galloway is.

680
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:31,972
- Just tell me where he is.
- No, come on. No...

681
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:33,390
- It'll all be over.
- No.

682
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:34,891
- Just tell me. Just...
- No.

683
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,396
It'll never be over
as long as that child is alive.

684
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:42,566
No, please... No...

685
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:46,486
You'll never be free of him.
Can't you see? He looks just like you.

686
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:48,739
I had to.

687
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,241
Just let the child go!

688
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,077
George. Stop.

689
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:55,912
George!

690
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,415
If you love your bastard child
as much, then just kill me.

691
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,417
That's the only way you'll ever stop me.

692
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,399
Where did you send Rachel and the boy?

693
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,860
That's a matter for the law.

694
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,738
This is everything you need
to put me away forever.

695
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,365
And what's that supposed to mean?

696
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:39,868
It means that I'm turning myself in.

697
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,078
You just tell me where they are

698
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,164
and when I get back,
you'll have your arrest.

699
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:46,166
I don't need your help.

700
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:51,087
Do you know that Galloway never
came back to the camp last night?

701
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,089
I'll contact Rachel.
Tell her to move on.

702
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,091
He is going to find them, Sheriff.

703
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,801
You know that as well as I do.

704
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,596
And what do you propose
to do about that?

705
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,892
Tell me where they are.

706
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:07,938
That's my boy, Sheriff.

707
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:23,119
- So you'll be fine?
- Mmm.

708
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,454
I'll be back soon.

709
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:26,623
Bye-bye.

710
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,459
Bye.

711
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,812
Kingsport, Tennessee. Name of Sloan.

712
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:52,190
You got 24 hours,
then I'm calling the judge.

713
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,156
I need the next train to Washington.

714
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,951
There ain't one for another 2 hours.

715
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:04,828
- There anything sooner?
- No.

716
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:28,685
Shh, shh. Hush.

717
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,170
Shh.

718
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,158
Hush...

719
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:19,003
Please, no.

720
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,800
Mr. Galloway...

721
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:46,656
Stop.

722
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,526
It's okay.

723
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,706
- You say he'll be hunting?
- Yes, sir.

724
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:39,083
- Up in Noland.
- Hmm.

725
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:48,051
Let's go.

726
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,561
I told him if he's real quiet,

727
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:02,899
Joel'll give him some more cars
for his choo-choo when we get there.

728
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:05,568
Joel Vaughn?

729
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:08,696
Yeah. He's going to take care of us now.

730
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:10,740
Jacob's real sweet on him.

731
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:25,964
You best say goodbye to him now.

732
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:45,770
Spread out, boys.

733
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,772
There, there.

734
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:49,774
All right. All right, come on.

735
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:26,019
Son of a bitch.

736
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:23,534
Mrs. Pemberton!

737
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,661
Mrs. Pemberton?

738
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,414
You need to come and identify.

739
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,334
Mrs. Pemberton?

740
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,514
Mrs. Pemberton?

741
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,767
Mrs. Pemberton, you need to come out
and identify your next of kin.

742
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:56,526
All right. Let's take him away, then.

743
01:41:57,027 --> 01:41:59,237
Come on, boys,
let's get back in the car.
