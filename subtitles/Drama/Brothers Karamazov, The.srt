1
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:11,040
It was three years since Lewis Nixon
and I decided to join the paratroops.

2
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:14,311
And more than a year
since we went to war.

3
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:19,279
Not knowing what would happen to us.
How long we'd be fighting.

4
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,925
Where we'd end up.

5
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:26,233
I certainly didn't expect to find
myself in a place like this.

6
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:32,177
I thought it might be you.

7
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,046
Morning.

8
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,888
I heard reports about
a redheaded Eskimo.

9
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,482
Thought I'd check it out.

10
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,831
Come to join me for a morning swim?

11
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:53,244
- Yeah.
- You know me so well.

12
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,471
Here. It's from Zielinski.

13
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,029
Oh, great.

14
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:04,751
What is that?

15
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,865
Ran into the regimental photographer.

16
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:12,196
Said he had all these
photographs of the 506th..

17
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:15,050
going all the way back to Toccoa.

18
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,881
- I traded them for a couple of Lugers.
- That's a bargain.

19
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:34,945
- What will you do after this?
- Get some breakfast.

20
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,033
No. After, after.

21
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,262
Funny you should mention it.
I had a meeting with Col. Sink.

22
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,083
- Really?
- Yeah.

23
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:56,531
Yeah, discussed the possibility
of staying.

24
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,624
In the Army?

25
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,776
Yeah. Yeah, as a career.

26
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:06,711
What'd you say?

27
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,373
I said I'd think about it.

28
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,731
- What do you think about New Jersey?
- New Jersey?

29
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:27,502
There's a company in Nixon, New Jersey
called Nixon Nitration Works.

30
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,091
- Sounds picturesque.
- Yeah, well..

31
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,436
oddly enough, I know the owners.

32
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:37,952
Probably gonna expect me
to make something of myself.

33
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,128
I thought maybe I'd drag you with me.

34
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,453
Are you offering me a job?

35
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:55,522
We'll see how your interview goes,
but a man of your qualifications..

36
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,202
I think can scrape something up
commensurate with your current salary.

37
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,629
Yeah, I'll think about it.

38
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:13,494
I.. l really appreciate it.

39
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,869
Yeah, just think about it.

40
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:20,050
Yeah.

41
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,171
Job offers.

42
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,583
Hard to fathom.

43
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,498
And the war wasn't even over.

44
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:04,390
I was still getting used
to hot showers and morning swims.

45
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:19,883
We'd entered Bavaria in early May with
the hopes of capturing Berchtesgaden.

46
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:24,895
This famous town, high in the Alps,
was the Nazi Party's symbolic home.

47
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,228
The heads of the Third Reich
had houses there.

48
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:31,755
Though Hitler was dead,
he had ordered the SS..

49
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,699
to mount a guerilla resistance
against the Allied advance from it.

50
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:40,953
The first step was blocking the roads.

51
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,322
- When do the engineers arrive?
- Half an hour ago.

52
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:52,267
We're stuck here until they do, Nix.

53
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:56,541
If you're the SS, you won't
let us waltz into Hitler's house.

54
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,876
Probably throw rocks yourself.

55
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,175
Easy Company is willing
to find another way up.

56
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,397
Duly noted.
I recommended you to Col. Sink.

57
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,325
- Let's find out where Hitler lived.
- Ron.

58
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:13,076
We don't know what's there. The
colonel doesn't want us taking risks.

59
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:16,641
So the French will beat us
to the Eagle's Nest?

60
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:32,888
I just had a talk with Gen. LeClerc.

61
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:38,041
He said he was first into Paris and
wanted to be first into Berchtesgaden.

62
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,060
Told him I understood his point.

63
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,206
Now you outflank
that French son of a bitch.

64
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,919
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,197
Easy Company leads.
Assemble on the Autobahn.

66
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,127
Yes, sir.

67
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,210
Eerie.

68
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,263
Not even any natives.

69
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:45,525
That's because in this town
you can't deny being a true Nazi.

70
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,184
- What do you mean?
- You have to be to live here.

71
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,729
We need to find some place
we can put the colonel.

72
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,318
How about right there?

73
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,451
No, no.

74
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,951
Wow.

75
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,596
Kitty would love this.

76
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,377
How many brides get
a wedding present from Hitler?

77
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,450
You wanna take half?

78
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,695
I can't carry all this.

79
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:16,631
Whoever comes after us will take
what isn't nailed down.

80
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,350
Well. Wouldn't want that to happen.

81
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:28,666
- Nice.
- Don't even think about it.

82
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:41,424
- Maj. Winters. Sir.
- More.

83
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,250
- Permission to climb the mountain?
- What is this?

84
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,483
Wait one minute.

85
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:52,549
Have F Company guard the hotel.
Set up roadblocks west of town.

86
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,747
I want Battalion HQ, seal the north,
prepare for prisoners.

87
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,154
- Sgt. Grant.
- And Harry..

88
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,100
nobody gets hurt, not now.

89
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,149
And Easy?

90
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,628
Easy will head up through
the Obersalzburg..

91
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,206
and take the Eagle's Nest.

92
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,484
Hi-yo, Silver!

93
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,783
Yeah! Currahee!

94
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:31,020
The Eagle's Nest was Hitler's birthday
present, built with Nazi Party money.

95
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:34,368
A mountaintop stone retreat
8000 feet up..

96
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:37,265
accessible by
a gold-plated elevator.

97
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,578
It was one of the crown jewels
of his empire..

98
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,948
and he was afraid of heights.

99
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,042
Here's to him.

100
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,542
No, goddamn it, listen.

101
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,658
Hitler, Hitler.. No.

102
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:56,060
Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels
and the pope walk into a bar..

103
00:13:56,495 --> 00:14:00,010
- Because he drinks too much..
- That's how it starts.

104
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:04,169
Hey, Adolf! Love your Eagle's Nest.
I hope you don't mind.

105
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:09,372
We made ourselves at home. Love what
you did with the place. Have a drink.

106
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:13,273
Come on. Just so we can say
we saw you do it.

107
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:15,028
Listen up.

108
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,260
From Corps, just came in. "All troops
stand fast on present positions."

109
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,567
- Standing fast.
- What does that mean?

110
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,691
Wanna hear it?

111
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,068
Ready for it? Listen up.
German army's surrendered.

112
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:44,604
I got a present for you. Come on.

113
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,244
Is it? Yeah?

114
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:11,699
- What is this place?
- Goering's house.

115
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:15,263
We found it yesterday.
Had it on guard since.

116
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:18,486
- I'll vouch for that.
- Eager to get off duty?

117
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:22,017
No, there's just so much
to see and do, sir.

118
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:01,287
10,000 bottles of the finest
liquor, wine and champagne..

119
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,499
helped Easy Company mark
the day the war in Europe ended.

120
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,585
It's all yours.

121
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,214
Take what you want and have
each company take a truckload.

122
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,760
We're going to Austria.
You don't have to leave anything.

123
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:19,733
- Austria, sir?
- Happy V-E Day.

124
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,031
Yeah.

125
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,516
V-E Day?

126
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,614
Victory in Europe.

127
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,052
Happy V-E Day.

128
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:45,406
Instead of a combat unit,
we became an occupation force.

129
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:49,820
No one wanted to leave Berchtesgaden.
Until they saw Austria.

130
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,952
So you reckon they'll make us
run up those or ski down them?

131
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:52,883
Hey, how are you? Need a hand there?

132
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,079
Hi! Hi! He loves you.

133
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:59,883
Hey, lady, how are you?

134
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,778
I think the war is over!

135
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,878
We'll be comfortable here.

136
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,015
What will happen to us,
to people like you and me..

137
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:53,929
when there are finally
no more wars to occupy us?

138
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,707
Have your men collect weapons.

139
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:03,002
Leave them at the church,
school and airfield.

140
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,940
Very well.

141
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:15,951
Please accept this as my
formal surrender, major.

142
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:19,822
It is better than to lay it
on the desk of a clerk.

143
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,200
You may keep your sidearm, colonel.

144
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:48,324
Heroic Army and Marine force dead
mark the battlefield of Okinawa..

145
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,558
where a bloody engagement
is being fought.

146
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:56,488
Thousands of Yanks have been
wounded or sacrificed their lives..

147
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,813
to drive a fanatical foe
from this base.

148
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:06,567
The Yanks progress slowly, facing one
of the fiercest barrages of the war.

149
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,825
Each advance is gained by sheer grit
in the face of withering fire..

150
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:16,083
from a suicidal enemy being
hammered back into the hilIs.

151
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,453
The going is brutal
and casualties are high..

152
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:23,834
but Okinawa is the next
step towards victory over Japan.

153
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:29,006
A victory that can only be won by
work, war bonds and heroic sacrifice.

154
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,584
- So when are we going?
- We don't have a date yet.

155
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:42,173
Are we to tell the men right away?

156
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,673
Some have enough
points to go home.

157
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:48,574
Not many, if their only
medal's a Purple Heart.

158
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:52,024
I think most of us here
will have enough.

159
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:57,276
Each of us will decide what to do.
I don't know how long we'll wait..

160
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:02,660
but I want those who are staying,
and all replacements, ready to fight.

161
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:06,277
That means rifle ranges.
Daily close-order drills.

162
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:11,905
Troop reviews. Above all, physical
training. Get your NCOs on it.

163
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,191
They're gonna love you.

164
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,952
What are you crouching for, Perco?

165
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:25,702
- Think the deer's gonna shoot back?
- Leave me alone.

166
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:30,465
How about y'all just shut up.
Let Shifty kill us some dinner.

167
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:34,976
What's wrong? Tired of eating
dried-up spuds three times a day?

168
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:40,608
I got an idea. Why don't we just shoot
Bull and feed the company for a week?

169
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,009
Oh, goddamn it, Shifty.

170
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:15,320
You let him get away. Army ought
to be glad to be rid of you.

171
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,937
I wish. Seems they want me
to stay around a while.

172
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:21,523
- Serious?
- How many points you need?

173
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,271
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

174
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:26,972
Jesus Christ, I thought I had it bad.

175
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,686
No Purple Hearts, never was injured.

176
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,117
- Company!
- Platoon!

177
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,661
Attention!

178
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,106
Right shoulder..

179
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,005
arms!

180
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:46,127
Order..

181
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,087
arms!

182
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,918
At ease.

183
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:59,193
Gen. Taylor knows many veterans,
including Normandy veterans..

184
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:02,974
do not have the 85 points
needed to be discharged.

185
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:07,205
On this anniversary of D-Day,
he authorized a lottery..

186
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:11,664
to send one man home in each
company, effective immediately.

187
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,479
For Easy Company, the winner is..

188
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:23,554
Come on, come on, come on.

189
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:29,379
Serial number 13066266.

190
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:34,751
- Sgt. Darrell C. Powers.
- Shifty.

191
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:37,967
That's how it's done, Shifty.

192
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:42,201
Congratulations, Shifty.

193
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:46,369
Sgt. Grant will see 2nd Platoon
takes over the checkpoint..

194
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:48,982
beginning tonight at 2200.

195
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:51,768
- So much for our anniversary.
- No shit.

196
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,837
Gen. Taylor also announced
the 101st Airborne Division..

197
00:23:56,178 --> 00:24:00,376
will definitely be redeployed
to the Pacific.

198
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:07,000
So beginning tomorrow at 0600,
we will begin training to go to war.

199
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,676
Come in.

200
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:29,739
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

201
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,874
You know, you was..

202
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,919
You was..

203
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:42,380
Well, it's been a long time.

204
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:48,488
- You got everything you need?
- I gathered up my loot.

205
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,295
Pistols, mainly. Paperwork's all done.

206
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,407
I even got my back pay in my pocket.

207
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:03,200
Back home in Virginia..

208
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,602
Well..

209
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:14,943
I just don't rightly know
how I'm gonna explain all this.

210
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,888
You see, I..

211
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:25,359
I seen.. I seen..

212
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,091
You're a hell of a fine soldier,
Shifty.

213
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:33,195
There's nothing more to explain.

214
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,272
Thank you, sir.

215
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:51,168
Two days later, Shifty Powers was
on a truck headed for a boat home.

216
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:56,139
Unfortunately, the truck was hit
head-on by a drunken corporal.

217
00:25:56,507 --> 00:26:00,739
Shifty had a broken pelvis,
a broken arm and a bad concussion.

218
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:04,848
He survived, but spent months
in a series of hospitals.

219
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:08,731
I wish I could say he was
our only casualty in Austria.

220
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:12,974
I've decided. I got the points,
I'm going back to Kitty.

221
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:17,513
Do you really think Kitty hasn't
run off with some 4-F by now?

222
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:21,137
Son of a bitch. That's not even funny.

223
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,040
Harry, ignore him.

224
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:28,885
How do I tell her I could have come
home, but decided to jump on Tokyo?

225
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:32,167
All right, so don't tell her.

226
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:38,515
She waited for three years. We'll
be back in two years, three tops.

227
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:41,643
It'll be over before you get there.

228
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:47,081
You'll be here six months waiting, and
I'll be in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

229
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,272
- You didn't tell him?
- I couldn't shut him up.

230
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,250
What? Tell me what?

231
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:58,280
- Guts and Glory asked for a transfer.
- What?

232
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:03,017
13th Airborne are heading out
for the Pacific right away.

233
00:27:06,076 --> 00:27:09,113
If I'm going,
I wanna get it over with.

234
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:15,727
- Are you in on this?
- I can't let him go by himself.

235
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,236
You're leaving the men?

236
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:25,527
They don't need me anymore.

237
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:37,619
Wounded in Normandy?

238
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:41,817
Yes, sir. In the leg.
It was a minor flesh wound.

239
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:45,942
- Company E lost 24 men killed there.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:51,019
Seventeen were in my commander's
plane. It went down on D-Day.

241
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:54,936
You were given command
of the company on D-Day?

242
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,842
That's right.

243
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:08,942
Fall back to your original positions!

244
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:13,501
Everyone else maintain
your pace of fire!

245
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:27,238
In Holland, they bumped you
to Battalion XO.

246
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:29,887
Yes, sir.

247
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:37,153
Bastards took your company away.

248
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,372
I fired my last shots there.

249
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,890
For the whole damn war?

250
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,085
Yes, sir.

251
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:18,634
You got through Bastogne
without firing your weapon?

252
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,358
That is correct, sir.

253
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:24,625
- You were on the line the whole time?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,376
Can't imagine a tougher test
for a leader.

255
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,195
Having to sit through a siege
like that, under those conditions.

256
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,312
- We got through it.
- Find some cover!

257
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:42,597
Find some cover! Find a foxhole!
Come on, take cover!

258
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:45,906
Take cover!

259
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:53,176
Come on, find some cover!

260
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:59,962
- So why do you want a transfer?
- Sorry, sir?

261
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:03,015
Why do you want to leave your men?

262
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:08,813
It's not that. If the war was still on
and I could do some good..

263
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:12,210
Looking to have your own division
some day?

264
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,741
No, sir.

265
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:17,009
- Not gonna make a career of the Army?
- No.

266
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,460
Ye.. Well, I don't know, sir.

267
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:26,884
If you think you need more experience
to get stars on your helmet..

268
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:30,155
let me tell you something, son:

269
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:32,642
You've done enough.

270
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,708
Thank you, sir.
That's not my objective.

271
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:49,466
I took this meeting out of respect
for your achievements.

272
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,677
And for the 101st.

273
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:56,193
If they do go
to the Pacific eventually..

274
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:59,552
you should be running
one of the battalions.

275
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:02,650
Thank you, sir.

276
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:08,490
And frankly, your men earned
the right to keep you around.

277
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,466
Yes, sir.

278
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,049
Thank you, sir.

279
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:28,358
I would stay in Austria for the time
being, waiting for orders..

280
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:32,627
and trying to watch over soldiers
with no enemy to fight.

281
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:37,246
- Lieb, I fucking hate this.
- Oh, Jesus Christ. They fingered him.

282
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:42,194
One of the Polacks at the slave camps
said this is where he lives.

283
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,631
- Which camp?
- Whatever camp.

284
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,750
I'm under direct orders
and I'm happy to follow it.

285
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:11,514
- Is this a personal thing, Joe?
- What?

286
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:15,553
- Is this personal to you?
- No, it's a goddamn order.

287
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:19,083
- Does Maj. Winters know?
- Doesn't matter.

288
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:25,464
The fuck it doesn't. What if he's just
a soldier? What if he's innocent?

289
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:28,569
What if he's commandant
of a slave camp?

290
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:31,371
Which camp? You don't have any proof.

291
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:33,722
Were you at Landsberg?

292
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:35,466
You know I was.

293
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:41,613
Think he's a soldier like you and me?
A fucking innocent German officer?

294
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:45,234
Where the hell you been
for the past three years?

295
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:53,317
What?

296
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,115
Shut up.

297
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:16,595
Don't fucking lie to me.

298
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:20,804
See what you did to my fucking people!

299
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:22,801
That's it.

300
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,121
He's guilty.

301
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:57,321
- Liebgott says so.
- He probably is.

302
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:06,936
Damn son of a bitch.

303
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,677
Shoot him.

304
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:11,767
- Shoot him!
- No.

305
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,508
- Officers don't run.
- The war's over. Anybody would run.

306
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,416
Summer in this Alpine paradise
should've been a relief.

307
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:51,455
Especially now that we were at peace.
Everyone just wanted to go home.

308
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,985
- France. France was the best.
- Really?

309
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:56,808
Yeah.

310
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:02,917
Five years. I think I was in every
country, but France was the best.

311
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:11,835
Italy would be second for me.
Russia is not desirable.

312
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:14,826
Ukraine, it was okay.

313
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:18,250
So when do you get out?

314
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:22,998
The unit is discharged. We leave
when my captain gets transferred.

315
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:26,641
- It is the end of my second war.
- Jesus!

316
00:35:26,952 --> 00:35:30,422
- I'm going home, to Mannheim.
- I'll take this one.

317
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:36,985
Okay.

318
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,166
Hey, Webster. My relief.

319
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:48,819
- Don't salute the Germans.
- Come on. I get a kick out of it.

320
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:52,380
Anyway, I got me a new enemy.
The Japs.

321
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:56,918
Seventy-five points. How about you?
You're a Toccoa guy, right?

322
00:35:57,274 --> 00:36:00,232
- How many you got?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

323
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,532
Discharged, huh?

324
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:10,894
- Go ahead, take off. It's my turn.
- Okay. See you at the farm.

325
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,545
Eighty-one.

326
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,332
I have 81 points.

327
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,019
Well, that's just not good enough.

328
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,990
See about getting you a ride.

329
00:36:31,308 --> 00:36:34,664
Hey. Hey. Where are they going?

330
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,377
Munich.

331
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:39,984
Wanna go to Munich?

332
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,894
Get in.

333
00:36:54,665 --> 00:36:55,780
Too bad.

334
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:03,067
Turn the wheel!

335
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,121
Oh, Jesus.

336
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:23,266
It's Pvt. Janovec.

337
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,961
He was dead when they brought him in.

338
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:34,728
Seventy-five points.

339
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:37,958
- What?
- He was 10 points short.

340
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:44,439
The enemy had surrendered,
but somehow men were still dying.

341
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:47,187
Men who wanted to be home by now..

342
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:52,701
who 'd served since before Normandy,
were stuck because they lacked points.

343
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:59,128
They did have plenty of weapons,
alcohol and time on their hands.

344
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:04,538
Suddenly, from out of nowhere,
a guy jumps out of the hedgerow..

345
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:09,930
shoves a knife against his throat
and screams, "Whose side are you on?"

346
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,219
I don't get it.

347
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,682
It's D-Day.
It's 2nd Platoon's own Bill Guarnere.

348
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:20,228
Old Gonorrhea himself. Just landed
in Normandy and all wound up.

349
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:22,814
"Whose side?" What a character.

350
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,967
What happened to him?

351
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,759
Got his leg blown off in Bastogne.

352
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:31,000
Wait here.

353
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:39,611
You okay, Mac?
You need some help?

354
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,988
They wouldn't give me any gas.

355
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:50,962
Krauts.

356
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,284
I tried to explain.

357
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:03,548
This fucking limey wouldn't listen.

358
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:07,028
I think he was a major.

359
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:11,176
- Look, private, we got a problem here.
- Do you have any gas?

360
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:14,361
Why don't you give me your weapon?

361
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:20,292
Well, I guess I'll just use his jeep.
I don't think he's gonna need it.

362
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:22,722
Hold on a second, all right?

363
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:25,672
Jesus!

364
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,697
Sarge! Sgt. Grant!

365
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,126
Sarge!

366
00:39:40,622 --> 00:39:43,580
- Jesus.
- What?

367
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,832
He's not gonna make it.

368
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:49,158
- You can't operate?
- You'd need a brain surgeon.

369
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:53,174
And even if you had one,
I don't think there's any hope.

370
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,674
Find the shooter, alive. Help me.
We're gonna go find a brain surgeon.

371
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:09,637
He wants noncoms guarding roadblocks
and men watching roads out of town.

372
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:13,781
Bull, Malark, take a squad
and a witness to search houses.

373
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:18,107
- Can we shoot this bastard on sight?
- Try and take him alive.

374
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:19,805
Where's Grant now?

375
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:23,916
They took him to a Kraut hospital
to find a good doctor.

376
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,688
Open up.

377
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:40,663
Come with me.

378
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:43,041
- Why?
- Get in the jeep.

379
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:49,502
- Where are we going?
- To the hospital. Get in.

380
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:54,522
If you're going to shoot, shoot.
If not, put the gun away.

381
00:40:54,863 --> 00:40:56,535
Get in the jeep, now.

382
00:40:57,533 --> 00:41:00,605
- What happened to him?
- He was shot in the head.

383
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,497
Half-hour ago.

384
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:07,782
- Come on.
- If you want him to live, help me.

385
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:11,043
First, by putting that away.

386
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,206
- Let's go.
- Let me drive.

387
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:17,935
We'll get there faster.

388
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:28,894
All right, see what we got here.

389
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:33,508
Jesus. Again, what a hand.

390
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:40,762
- Who's being beaten worse, me or him?
- Wanna play a different game?

391
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,916
Same game, just shuffle
them up good, huh?

392
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:49,835
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

393
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:53,392
Wanna go in there and join in?

394
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:56,921
I should go in and stop this.

395
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:00,653
Floyd, let's just play cards,
all right?

396
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:08,236
- Where is he?
- How's Grant?

397
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:10,834
- He okay?
- Where is he?!

398
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:22,541
This him?

399
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,252
That's him.

400
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,350
Replacement. I Company.

401
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,910
Where's the weapon?

402
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:37,466
What weapon?

403
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:42,778
When you talk to an officer,
you say "sir."

404
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,700
Have the MPs take care
of this piece of shit.

405
00:43:38,193 --> 00:43:40,548
- Grant's dead?
- No.

406
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:44,995
Kraut surgeon says he's gonna make it.

407
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,927
Hey, tough guy, on your feet.
Come on, move.

408
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:53,807
Get up!

409
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:59,647
I guess they were Hitler's photo
albums. Had a lot of pictures of him.

410
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:02,767
- You didn't take them?
- That's right, sir.

411
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:05,007
I don't believe you!

412
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:13,782
I'll be watching you.
You're dismissed.

413
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:19,413
You better not be lying to me.

414
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,174
- What?
- Sir..

415
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:30,090
if it's not gonna put you
in a bind..

416
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,885
I'd like to resign as
company first sergeant.

417
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:38,546
If I had my choice,
I miss being back amongst the men.

418
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:43,031
I'd be happy to go to staff sergeant,
wherever you wanna put me.

419
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:51,188
I guess you've earned your right
to demote yourself.

420
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:53,075
Thank you, sir.

421
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:58,865
- Wanna take over Sgt. Grant's platoon?
- That would do fine, sir.

422
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:06,543
All right then, report to It. Peacock.

423
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:11,219
Let me know if he gives you
any trouble.

424
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:15,682
Oh, sir, you make your decision yet?

425
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,520
Yeah, I did.

426
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:28,190
So, what else is on your mind?

427
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:32,282
Easy Company will need
a commanding officer postwar.

428
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,909
Somebody to keep them
from killing each other.

429
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:39,106
That somebody better know
what they're doing.

430
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:40,831
I couldn't agree more.

431
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:44,854
It's irresponsible to leave them
in the wrong hands.

432
00:45:45,195 --> 00:45:48,744
They're too much of a valuable
resource to the military.

433
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:54,853
You've decided to stay in the Army?

434
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,480
Yes, I'm gonna stay with the men.

435
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,534
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

436
00:46:04,548 --> 00:46:07,108
So some of us would stay by choice.

437
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:11,263
Others were stuck, unless we could
find excuses to send them away.

438
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:16,591
It's an airborne exhibition. They have
each Allied plane used in the war.

439
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,251
Uh-huh.

440
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:19,832
I mean, yes, sir.

441
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:23,612
You'll be an adviser
to make sure they get it right.

442
00:46:23,942 --> 00:46:27,776
- I understand, sir.
- Sorry it's not a hospitable location.

443
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:33,028
No, Paris is just fine, if you need me
to go. Someone has to be there.

444
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,401
We do. We absolutely do.

445
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:39,780
Your driver will drop you off
at a hotel of your choice..

446
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:44,323
and I don't think we'll see you
back here anytime soon.

447
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,821
I won't let you down, sir.

448
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,129
Carwood, yes..

449
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:08,791
You probably know, when the Army gives
a man a battlefield commission..

450
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:13,269
they usually don't let him stay
with the same company.

451
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:16,131
Yes, sir. I figured this was coming.

452
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:21,125
They're afraid the men won't respect
him as they would another officer.

453
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,491
Yeah. It's a good theory, sir.

454
00:47:23,752 --> 00:47:26,505
It's idiotic. Especially in your case.

455
00:47:26,797 --> 00:47:30,915
Nevertheless, they've let me choose
where to reassign you.

456
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,809
I thought Battalion Headquarters
might be a good place.

457
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:37,607
I can think of few better, sir.

458
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:40,166
Good. Good.

459
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:45,338
Right now, down at the airfield
there is a German general..

460
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:49,843
angry about having to surrender
to Pvt. Heffron from Philly.

461
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:52,948
- It's beneath his stature.
- Understandable.

462
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,642
Yeah. I thought 2nd It. Carwood Lipton
from West Virginia..

463
00:47:57,995 --> 00:48:01,829
- could soothe his ruffled feathers.
- No problem, sir.

464
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:06,000
Major, is this the type of job
I can expect from now on?

465
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:12,370
Yeah. Yeah. When we're not
sunning ourselves by the lake.

466
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:24,540
Lieutenant.

467
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:37,019
With your permission,
I'd like to address my men.

468
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:39,760
That'll be fine, general.

469
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,746
- Capt. Sobel.
- Maj. Winters.

470
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:53,076
Capt. Sobel.

471
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:58,211
We salute the rank, not the man.

472
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:23,940
Liebgott?

473
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:29,216
Men, it's been a long war,
it's been a tough war.

474
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:37,591
You have fought bravely,
proudly, for your country.

475
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,415
You are a special group..

476
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:49,121
who found in one another
a bond..

477
00:49:54,653 --> 00:49:56,803
that exists only in combat..

478
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,537
among brothers..

479
00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:04,405
of shared foxholes.

480
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,178
Held each other in dire moments.

481
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:23,125
Have seen death
and suffered together.

482
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:34,686
I am proud to have served
with each and every one of you.

483
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:44,161
You deserve long and happy lives
in peace.

484
00:50:59,802 --> 00:51:01,360
Towel, towel, towel!

485
00:51:02,513 --> 00:51:03,992
Thanks.

486
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,501
Take a look at these two kids.

487
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,324
What the hell happened to them?

488
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,221
New Jersey, huh?

489
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,337
Yeah.

490
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:18,380
Think about it.

491
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:20,788
Yeah, I am.

492
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:24,663
You awake yet?

493
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:27,435
Awake?

494
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:30,708
Time to go to bed.

495
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,231
Come on, Jimmy.

496
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:51,543
- Nice play.
- We got one down.

497
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:56,363
- Come on, Pee Wee. Get Webster.
- Come on, Pee Wee, let's get him.

498
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,535
Buck Compton came back
to let us know he was all right.

499
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:04,378
He became a prosecutor in Los Angeles.

500
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:07,570
He convicted Sirhan Sirhan..

501
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:11,988
and was later appointed
to the California Court of AppeaIs.

502
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:16,906
David Webster wrote for The Saturday
Evening Post and Wall Street Journal..

503
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:19,643
and later wrote a book about sharks.

504
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:26,317
In 1961, he went out on the ocean
alone, and was never seen again.

505
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:31,438
Go, go, go! Yeah!

506
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:35,216
Johnny Martin would return
to his rail road job..

507
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:37,956
and then start
a construction company.

508
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:42,272
He splits his time between Arizona
and a place in Montana.

509
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:49,101
George Luz became a handyman
in Providence, RI.

510
00:52:49,453 --> 00:52:52,763
And as a testament to his character..

511
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:57,116
1600 people attended
his funeral in 1998.

512
00:52:58,128 --> 00:53:02,838
Doc Roe died in Louisiana in 1998.

513
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:06,227
He'd been a construction contractor.

514
00:53:08,514 --> 00:53:13,349
Frank Perconte returned to Chicago and
worked a postal route as a mailman.

515
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:24,788
Joe Liebgott returned to San Francisco
and drove his cab.

516
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:30,695
Bull Randleman was one
of the best soldiers I ever had.

517
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:36,394
He went into the earth-moving business
in Arkansas. He's still there.

518
00:53:43,465 --> 00:53:47,094
Alton More returned to Wyoming
with a unique souvenir:

519
00:53:47,428 --> 00:53:50,261
Hitler's personal photo albums.

520
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:54,390
He was killed in a car accident
in 1958.

521
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:58,803
Floyd Talbert we all
lost touch with..

522
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:03,941
until he showed up at a reunion
just before his death in 1981.

523
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:10,975
How we lived our lives after the war
was as varied as each man.

524
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:16,545
Carwood Lipton became an executive
directing factories across the world.

525
00:54:16,915 --> 00:54:19,793
He has a nice life in North Carolina.

526
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:22,603
Harry Welsh, he married Kitty Grogan.

527
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,476
Became an administrator for the
Wilkes-Barre, PA school system.

528
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:33,697
Ronald Speirs stayed in the Army,
served in Korea.

529
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:38,567
In 1958, returned to Germany
as governor of Spandau Prison.

530
00:54:38,937 --> 00:54:41,735
He retired a lieutenant colonel.

531
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,206
- Get them round.
- All right, Webster.

532
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,129
Easy Company. School circle!

533
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:02,336
For Easy Company,
it was D-Day plus 434.

534
00:55:02,669 --> 00:55:05,627
A fast man would've had it, Perco.

535
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:08,312
Listen up. Got some news.

536
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:15,326
Today, President Truman received
the surrender from the Japanese.

537
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:17,733
War's over.

538
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:22,318
Regardless of points, medals
or wounds..

539
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:26,163
each man in the 101st Airborne
would be going home.

540
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:31,639
Each of us would be forever connected
by our shared experience.

541
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:36,237
And each would have to rejoin
the world as best he could.

542
00:55:51,802 --> 00:55:54,521
Lewis Nixon had tough times
after the war.

543
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:56,955
He was divorced a few times.

544
00:55:57,224 --> 00:56:01,695
In 1956 he married a woman named
Grace and everything came together.

545
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:05,134
He spent his life with her,
traveling the world.

546
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:09,400
My friend Lew died in 1995.

547
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:14,591
I took his job offer and was a manager
at Nixon Nitration Works..

548
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,943
until I was called into service
in 1950 to train officers.

549
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:23,361
I chose not to go to Korea.
I'd had enough of war.

550
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:27,861
I stayed around Hershey, PA,
finally finding a little farm..

551
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:32,604
a little peaceful corner of the
world, where I still live today.

552
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:38,167
And not a day goes by that I do not
think of the men I served with..

553
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:42,152
who never got to enjoy the world
without war.

554
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:46,312
It's a very unusual feeling.

555
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:51,692
It's a very unusual happening
and a very unusual bonding.

556
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:53,985
We could depend on each other.

557
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,963
And so we were a close-knit group.

558
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:00,632
So brave, it was unbelievable.

559
00:57:02,122 --> 00:57:04,716
I don't know anybody I admire more..

560
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,754
than Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

561
00:57:09,755 --> 00:57:11,825
They were very special.

562
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:15,606
I'm just one part of the big war.
One little part.

563
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:22,165
And I'm proud to be a part of it.
Sometimes it makes me cry.

564
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:25,035
The real men, the real heroes..

565
00:57:26,522 --> 00:57:30,071
are those buried over there
and buried at home.

566
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:34,238
You thought you could do
just about anything.

567
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:36,084
After the war..

568
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:42,049
you lost a lot of that. At least I did.
I lost that confidence.

569
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:45,768
You was hoping to stay alive.
That's all.

570
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:51,680
Henry V was talking
to his men.

571
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:54,314
He said, "From this day.."

572
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:57,344
to the ending of the world..

573
00:57:57,636 --> 00:58:00,912
we in it shall be remembered.

574
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:05,182
We lucky few, we band of brothers.

575
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,353
For he who today
sheds his blood with me..

576
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,282
"shall be my brother."

577
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:14,812
Do you remember..

578
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:20,299
the letter that Mike Ranney wrote me?

579
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:21,686
You do?

580
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:24,708
Do you remember how he ended it?

581
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:29,403
"I cherish the memories.."

582
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,783
of a question my grandson
asked me the other day..

583
00:58:34,131 --> 00:58:39,330
when he said, 'Grandpa,
were you a hero in the war?'

584
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:44,778
Grandpa said, 'No..

585
00:58:48,854 --> 00:58:52,369
"but I served in a company
of heroes.'"

586
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:09,500
