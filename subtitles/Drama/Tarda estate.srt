00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,440
<i>Let me
assert my firm belief...</i>

2
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,610
<i>that the only thing
we have to fear...</i>

3
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,030
<i>is fear itself.</i>

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,780
<i>That's one
small step for man...</i>

5
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>This is Walter Cronkite
in our newsroom.</i>

6
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>President Kennedy
died at 1 p.m.,</i>

7
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,450
<i>some 38 minutes ago.</i>

8
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>Who are trying to make</i>

9
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,170
<i>a boogey out of us...</i>

10
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,260
<i>Go at throttle up.</i>

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,720
<i>This vehicle has exploded.</i>

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,380
<i>They are here in the thousands.</i>

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,050
<i>They are here
in the tens of thousands.</i>

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,050
<i>Diana,
Princess of Wales, has died.</i>

15
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,220
<i>This just in.</i>

16
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,700
<i>Television viewers across the country</i>

17
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,060
<i>watch in astonishment...</i>

18
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,560
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, God.</i>

19
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,350
<i>There was
a huge explosion sound.</i>

20
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,930
Der Spiegel
is begging for more time.

21
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,010
<i>The Times wants to go.</i>

22
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,720
Let me talk to Rosenbach.

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,770
Christ,
it's like herding cats.

24
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,990
No, I don't want
to have to scroll down

25
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,190
for the Task Force 373 story.

26
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,610
Holger, I've got Nick.

27
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,980
Ah, great. Five minutes?

28
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,370
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,440
Yes, Bill, I know. But Nick
just spoke to Rosenbach.

30
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,040
<i>They need at least
another few minutes.</i>

31
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,290
No more delays, Alan.
You said twelve o' clock.

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,410
<i>I know, but the point
is to publish together.</i>

33
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,540
<i>You know the Germans.</i>

34
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,830
They need to dot all the "I's"
and cross all the "T's."

35
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,870
Go. Now.

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
It's live.
The Times is live.

37
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,880
Well, there you go.
Patience, humility,

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,340
all American virtues.

39
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,380
Yes, Bill, thanks very much
for not giving a shit.

40
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,550
Go.

41
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,530
<i>Of course, our top
story this morning...</i>

42
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,200
<i>the White House

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,830
<i>of over 90,000

44
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,080
<i>It came from an organization</i>

45

<i>and Germany's</i> Der Spiegel...

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>coordinated in publishing...</i>

49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,480
<i>what some are comparing

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,630
<i>back in the Nixon years.</i>

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,550
<i>They include
civilian casualties</i>

52
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,130
<i>and special forces
killing squads.</i>

53
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,890
<i>The most serious allegation
is that some soldiers</i>

54

<i>committed war crimes.</i>

55
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,890
<i>I know

<i>as a result of the
substantial leak</i>

57

<i>of documents from Afghanistan.</i>

58

<i>What is this website,
"WikiLeaks"?</i>

59
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,150
<i>And who is Julian Assange?</i>

60
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,030
<i>Assange has made WikiLeaks

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,530
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

62
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,030
<i>exposed what he considers</i>

63
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,530
<i>some of the world's
darkest secrets.</i>

64
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,830
<i>The eyes of the world</i>

65

66
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,240
<i>Julian Assange is a man</i>

67
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,170
<i>without a home who lives

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,040

69

<i>and encrypted cell phones

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>The U.S. government argues</i>

71
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,380
<i>there's nothing noble
about Assange.</i>

72
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,210
<i>A U.S. official describes him
as very Anti-American.</i>

73
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,230
Come on!

74
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,060
It's Daniel.

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Shit.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Uh, good morning.

77
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,690
I assume most of you
have read, uh,

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,320
this morning's papers. Um...

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,080
This is...

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,620
<i>The Guardian.</i> Um...

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,170
Fourteen... Fourteen pages
about this topic.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,920
<i>Also, concurrently,
Der Spiegel...</i>

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,750
The New York Times...

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,840
<i>These are revelations which
pierce the veil of secrecy</i>

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,220
<i>surrounding this war...</i>

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
<i>painting a more complete
portrait of events</i>

87
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,760
<i>we thought we understood...</i>

88
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,470
<i>but we may not
have known at all.</i>

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,710
Mr. Berg.

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
Have you seen this?

91
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,960
They're pouring out of
every printer in the office.

92
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,670
I guess someone's pissed

93
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,800
you made New Year's Eve
a work day.

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
Well, as our resident
computer genius...

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,430
could you please find out
who that someone is?

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,310
Whoever it was disguised
his IP address.

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,820
According to this, the print
jobs are coming from...

98
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,020
your computer.

99
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,070
It's thousands of pages.

100
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,530
You'll have to manually reboot
it if you want it to stop.

101
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,770
Where are you going? I need
you to finish the Opel job.

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,160
I costed out GM, too.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,870
In case you need something
to do on New Year's Eve.

104
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,950
Charlie in maintenance said
you left this by the scanner.

105
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,930
Happy New Year.

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:50,400
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

107
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Daniel Berg. I volunteered
to sell shirts tomorrow.

108
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,300
We must be
on the schedule somewhere.

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,930
My associate Jay Lim sent in
our proposals months ago.

110
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,390
I'll be back in a minute.

111
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,350
We didn't get anything
from Wikileakers.

112
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,430
"WikiLeaks."

113
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
Wiki-whatever.

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,820
This is ridiculous.
Who's in charge here?

115
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,320
- Julian?
- Huh?

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,900
It's Daniel. Daniel Berg.

117
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,450
I contacted you over chat.

118
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,530
Daniel. Thank God.

119
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,670
I've got people waiting, here.

120
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,880
Can you help me
with this prick?

121
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,280
His organization is super cool.

122
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
They've been doing
crazy shit in Kenya.

123
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,330
The least you could do
is put us on your program.

124
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,500
The small conference rooms
are all booked.

125
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,620
What about the auditorium?

126
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,210
It's empty until the talk
about hacking video games.

127
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay, you can have
that for half an hour.

128
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,940
- Thank you.
- But nobody's gonna show up

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
unless you print some flyers.

130
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,470
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.

131
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,630
Daniel...

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,180
God forbid
we give out free toner

133
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,680
to human rights activists.

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,850
Sorry.

135
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,230
I totally spaced out
on that proposal.

136
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,110
Mind you,
I was a bit busy in Nairobi.

137
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,370
Oh, by the way,
that report we leaked...

138
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,780
shifted voting 10%
in the presidential election.

139
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,370
You might want to mention that
when you introduce me.

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Sure.

141
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,880
Shredded my power cord
in Mombasa.

142
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,710
I assume the club won't mind
making a small donation.

143
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,520
I'll pay for the cord if
you actually get it to work.

144
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,760
Well, when you're taking on
global corruption...

145
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,260
you need a few super powers.

146
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,810
<i>Et voila!</i>

147
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,270
<i>I'm a mathematician
by training.</i>

148
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,410
<i>When I was a grad student
in Melbourne...</i>

149
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,450
<i>I became interested in...</i>

150
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,070
Okay,
send us the camera now!

151
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,080
- How...
- Excuse me, a little bit more!

152
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,790
<i>I became
interested in information...</i>

153
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,040
Okay, switching!

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>And how it flows
through society.</i>

155
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,040
<i>And how...</i>

156
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,470
<i>when new information
comes to light,</i>

157
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,010
<i>it can bring about
great change.</i>

158
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,390
Excuse me.

159
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,770
Two people...

160
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,780
and a secret.

161
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,980
The beginning of any conspiracy

162
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,860
and of all corruption.

163
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Otto...

164
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,820
- Otto, what is he doing?
- And as it grows...

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,370
more lies, deceits.

166
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,540
More people...

167
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,290
and more secrets.

168
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,830
But...

169
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,130
if we can find one moral man...

170
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,050
one whistleblower...

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
Someone willing to expose
all these secrets.

172
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,100
That man could topple the most
repressive of regimes.

173
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,060
What the hell?

174
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,230
Otto, my talk is in 10 minutes!

175
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,610
<i>And there's the problem.</i>

176
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,080
He just ruined
my entire presentation!

177
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,530
<i>Retribution.</i>

178
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,740
<i>Whistleblowers are
afraid to come forward</i>

179
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,240
<i>because they fear retribution.</i>

180
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,820
<i>But what if we could
remove that fear?</i>

181
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,960
<i>Twenty years ago,
I bought my first modem</i>

182
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,750
<i>and joined a legion.</i>

183
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,170
<i>Cypherpunks, fighting
for freedom, for privacy...</i>

184
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,970
<i>for the right to remain
concealed in clouds of code.</i>

185
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,350
Today's hackers
take it for granted,

186
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,840
but they surf the Internet...

187
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,640
because of the programs
we created to hide data...

188
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,520
to... to hide our identities.

189
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,060
Even then,
I knew this technology...

190
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,280
could hold the key to a whole
new form of social justice.

191
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,240
Hundreds of volunteers work
on the documents we are sent.

192
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,910
But we've honed
our technology...

193
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,660
to a point that
even I don't know

194
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,790
the identity of our sources.

195
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,010
And if the whistleblower's
identity is secret...

196
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,090
then he has nothing to fear.

197
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,050
As Oscar Wilde said...

198
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,850
"Give a man a mask, and
he will tell you the truth."

199
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,450
Sorry, it's going to be
a few minutes.

200
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,480
We had some
technical difficulties.

201
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,900
Good talk, huh?

202
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,100
You think so?

203
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,780
People anonymously
sharing secrets...

204
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,230
I mean, isn't that why
we tore down the Wall?

205
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,530
Believe me, no one
is interested in your secrets.

206
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,450
Yours, on the other hand...

207
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,900
It was great. It's a shame
the turnout wasn't better.

208
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,910
One convert at a time.

209
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,490
By the way, I can soup up
the graphics if you want.

210
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,760
What's wrong with
the ones I've got?

211
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,790
Nothing.

212
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,030
I'm sure they would have
blown people away in the '80s.

213
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,630
Hey...

214
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,050
do you want to check out
the talk on micro-controllers?

215
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,210
The guy who invented TV-B-Gone
is speaking.

216
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,510
It's a remote. You walk
into a bar and turn off...

217
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,560
all the TVs.

218
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,980
Don't you get bored
spending your time

219
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,810
with all these wankers?

220
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,730
Building antennae
out of Pringles packets...

221
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,980
<i>reading Neuromancer
and playing Call of Cthulhu.</i>

222
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,030
What a waste!

223
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,360
Capable generous men,
men of purpose.

224
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,200
That's what the world needs.
All this?

225
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,330
It's not what we fought for.

226
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,080
Shit. Come on.

227
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,330
Hurry up, Daniel.

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,430
- Where are we going?
- To church.

229
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,350
A government
destroyed by tyranny...

230
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,520
rebuilt under a glass dome

231
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,730
so the whole world
could look in.

232
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,900
There's an ideal to aspire to.

233
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,740
Just look at it, Daniel.

234
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,780
Risen from the ashes.

235
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,990
A whole city,
once ruled by fascists,

236
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,660
now overrun by artists,
by anarchists...

237
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,250
and crows and snowstorms...

238
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,630
and transparency.

239
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,740
My father took me to the dome
when they first built it.

240
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,960
I was 13.

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,160
He wasn't quite so eloquent.

242
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,760
Yeah, well, when I was 13,

243
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,630
my mum started
dating this guy...

244
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,090
from a nasty Australian cult
called The Family.

245
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,020
They believed in blue auras
and cleansing souls...

246
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,220
and the strict discipline
of children.

247
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,270
<i>Severe beatings...</i>

248
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,980
starvation diets...

249
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,740
regular closings
of psychiatric drugs.

250
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,150
My mum knew
the guy was a wanker...

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,860
but by the time
she came to her senses

252
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,620
they had a kid together and...

253
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,450
We spent the next three
years on the run.

254
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
They chased us
all over the country.

255
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,760
That's terrifying.

256
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,180
Why do you think
my hair is white?

257
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,180
Come on.

258
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,980
I want to show you something.

259
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,320
It's called the Tacheles.

260
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,820
It's an artists' squat.

261
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,460
They were going to tear it
down in the '90s...

262
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,830
but some painters occupied it.

263
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,240
Cool.

264
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,500
Listen, I better get to work.

265
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,660
Now?

266
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,330
Life on the run,
Aussie jet lag.

267
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,410
You stop distinguishing
between night and day.

268
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,630
Sorry.

269
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,690
So what are you working on?

270
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,030
Look, today was cool,

271
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,280
but these are
sensitive documents.

272
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,200
People's lives are at stake.

273
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,950
You can trust me.

274
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,730
<i>Yes, and quiet.</i>

275
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,440
<i>There's a new leak
on the submission platform.</i>

276
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,660
<i>In my twenties, I created
a tool called Rubberhose.</i>

277
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,660
<i>It hid sensitive information</i>

278
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,750
<i>beneath layers and layers
of fake data.</i>

279
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,540
<i>WikiLeaks is based
on the same idea.</i>

280
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,080
<i>Take any message.</i>

281
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,380
<i>"Are you safe?"</i>

282
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,600
<i>"Are you safe?"</i>

283
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,930
<i>We constantly upload
fake data from fake sources...</i>

284
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,060
<i>to make it impossible
to monitor our real sources.</i>

285
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,240
<i>And their very presence
is infinitely deniable.</i>

286
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,280
<i>The system makes
leaks untraceable.</i>

287
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,510
<i>They simply turn up
on the submission platform.</i>

288
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,810
<i>Ever heard of Julius Baer?</i>

289
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,650
<i>It's a big
Swiss Bank, right?</i>

290
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,950
<i>Huge.
Manages 400 billion dollars</i>

291
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,370
<i>for the ultra-rich.</i>

292
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,830
<i>It uses offshore secrecy laws
to hide money for fat cats...</i>

293
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,590
<i>wealthy assholes in Germany,
Switzerland, U.K.</i>

294
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,470
<i>The leak is from
someone inside the bank?</i>

295
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,300
I don't know.

296
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,220
See the beauty of it?

297
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,230
Let me guess. Secret plans
for the revolution?

298
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,900
Jay Lim and the volunteers
in Switzerland

299
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,110
will analyze the docs...

300
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,030
but I need you to verify
that they're real.

301
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,740
The metadata should contain
a list of authors.

302
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,710
Extract it and confirm that
these people work at the bank.

303
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,970
What? Did you think
we just threw what we got up

304
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,540
on the website?

305
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,220
No, but...

306
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,340
you're just giving me the docs?

307
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,550
You said I could trust you.

308
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,430
You can.

309
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,390
I know.
I'm a good judge of character.

310
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,770
Stay offline when you're
working on the docs.

311
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,770
And buy yourself a cryptophone.

312
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,230
Julius Bar Bank,
Ralf Zilke's office.

313
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,710
I'm sorry, I must have
the wrong extension.

314
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,730
What division is this?

315
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,490
Personal Wealth Management.
Who were you looking for?

316
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,370
I was actually looking
for Ms. Leisal Grop.

317
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,410
Ms. Grop is down the hall
in Client Services.

318
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,750
Can I transfer you?

319
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,090
<i>Yes, please. Thank you.</i>

320
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,720
What are you doing in here?

321
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,810
Um...

322
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,980
Sensitive research.

323
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,940
You're playing
<i>World of Warcraft</i> aren't you?

324
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,610
We're investigating corruption
in a Swiss Bank.

325
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,660
Of course.

326
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,740
Well, then I guess
I can cover for you.

327
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,700
<i>I worked for these
assholes for years...</i>

328
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,780
before I understood the extent
of the deception.

329
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,690
It's a massive tax dodge.

330
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,440
Last year, those diagrams...

331
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,270
cheated your country alone

332
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,030
out of 30 billion
in tax revenues.

333
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,950
And you'll explain them to us?

334
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,030
You understand I won't
just be exposing the bank.

335
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,620
They have hundreds of clients
from New York to Moscow...

336
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,170
who will go to great lengths
to hold on to their money.

337
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,960
We understand the risks.

338
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,350
We've got incredible
infrastructure.

339
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,800
Hundreds of volunteers,

340
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,800
people who've dealt
with these threats.

341
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,380
Our process is totally secure.

342
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,050
We don't even know
your real name.

343
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,130
You're damn right.

344
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,970
I'll explain the documents,
but you never met me...

345
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,890
and when the shit comes down,
it's on your house.

346
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,730
Are we clear, Mr...

347
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,400
Schmitt. Daniel Schmitt.

348
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,990
The bank has a huge network.

349
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,160
<i>Right, I'm sure.</i>

350
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,350
They've got billions of
dollars buried in the Caymans.

351
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,080
<i>Well... Yeah,
but by this time tomorrow</i>

352
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,750
<i>the whole world's
gonna know about it.</i>

353
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,500
<i>And I can tell you,
the response to this...</i>

354
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,000
is gonna be
absolutely colossal.

355
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,750
We're gonna nail
those bastards.

356
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,590
<i>You know,
our friend was pretty jittery.</i>

357
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,760
Of course he was.

358
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,920
Hey, Julian, let's go.

359
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,880
How fast can you get
Bellman a summary?

360
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,600
I'll stay up until it's done.

361
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,760
All right, Daniel. Remember,
courage is contagious.

362
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,860
<i>They marched from</i>

363
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,030
<i>the townships, from the slums.</i>

364
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,700
<i>Opposition supporters
determined</i>

365
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,370
<i>that this would be the day...</i>

366
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,610
<i>they would expose
Kenya's elections as a sham.</i>

367
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,530
<i>Delivering an empathic
message...</i>

368
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,210
<i>to the president whose
reelection they reject...</i>

369
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,530
<i>and the outside world.</i>

370
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,040
<i>But this was what
they discovered.</i>

371
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
<i>Riot police with orders that</i>

372
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,880
<i>no mass demonstration
was to be allowed.</i>

373
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,630
<i>This was not a day for debate.</i>

374
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,590
<i>The argument,
settled decisively.</i>

375
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,810
Ralf Zilke's office.

376
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,400
- Mr. Zilke?
- Yeah.

377
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,740
I'm sorry,
I just got an odd call

378
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,990
from the tech department.

379
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,740
I sent you the link.

380
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,670
They say there's a report
on this website.

381
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,340
Get me Friedrich.

382
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,100
And wake up our lawyers
in California.

383
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,420
And in New York.

384
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,260
And London.

385
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,860
So, their lawyers
are threatening you?

386
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,190
Julian says you can spend
your life in cushy cubicles

387
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,530
or you can march.

388
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,450
You can breathe the tear gas
and brave the truncheons or...

389
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,160
Take a girl to dinner?

390
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,970
Hey.

391
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,730
Hey.

392
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,650
Sorry, I didn't want
to wake you up.

393
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,980
It's okay.

394
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,810
I've just never had a guy
try to sneak out

395
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,070
of his own apartment.

396
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,070
The bank got a judge
in California

397
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,070
- to shut down our site.
- What?

398
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,070
I thought the Americans
put free speech up there

399
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
with mom and apple pie.

400
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,580
So did we.

401
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,540
Julian wants to meet
right away.

402
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,260
You know, this isn't how
I imagined our first, um...

403
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,260
How did you imagine it?

404
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,030
Uh...

405
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,730
Do you have a cryptophone?

406
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,860
Uh... No.

407
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,200
But that might be
the best excuse

408
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
I've ever heard
for not calling.

409
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,730
<i>We've got to get</i>

410
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,950
the story out
on blogs, Twitter,

411
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,140
they're defrauding the world.

412
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,700
- We can't let them do this.
- Exactly.

413
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,450
It's impossible that
one judge in California

414
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,400
can make it all disappear.
It's out now.

415
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
<i>Well, remember what
Solzhenitsyn said.</i>

416
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,150
"No one can bar
the road to truth."

417
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,570
<i>And Solzhenitsyn
didn't even have Twitter.</i>

418
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,900
I mean, whoever thought that
we'd need extra servers...

419
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,490
to fight censorship attacks

420
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,410
from the bastion
of free speech.

421
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,460
I sent leaks to our
mirror sites. You should...

422
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,830
Having fun making history
instead of reading about it?

423
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,500
Yeah. And there's a new <i>WIRED</i>
blog you should post as well.

424
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,960
Let's have a look.

425
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,270
<i>Yeah, but if
Julius Bar really believes</i>

426
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,850
<i>that censoring one website...</i>

427
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,090
<i>will solve their problems...</i>

428
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,440
<i>they just don't understand
how information flows</i>

429
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,020
<i>in the 21st century.
I mean, look...</i>

430
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,270
<i>Our mirror sites
make it impossible...</i>

431
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,700
for the bank to put the genie
back in the bottle.

432
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,190
Of course,
we're happy that the EFF

433
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,120
and the ACLU are behind us.

434
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,070
But to be honest,
the court of public opinion...

435
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,870
has already ruled in our favor.

436
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,870
Some French hackers
donated domains.

437
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,950
Mmm.

438
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,780
Send the links to Bellman,
he'll blast the LISTSERV.

439
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,870
Yeah, no.

440
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,710
But, with an organization

441
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,540
the size and scale
of WikiLeaks...

442
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,010
grassroots support is vital.

443
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,310
Move the U.S. primaries
to page three

444
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,800
to make room
for the Diana inquest.

445
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,810
Yes, yes, yes.
Diana still sells newspapers.

446
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,060
Can't afford reporters?

447
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,550
Grab a story off the wire...

448
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,560
give it a little scrub,
drop it in the paper.

449
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,810
Twenty-first century
churnalism at its finest.

450
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,570
Is this how
you're chatting up the totty

451
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,230
in your golden years?

452
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,540
Well, I certainly
can't impress them...

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,530
with some of the stories
rattling around

454
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,030
the mainstream media
echo chamber.

455
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,710
The women I meet
are smart enough to know

456
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,530
what they're missing out on.

457
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I assume you're gonna tell us
what that is?

458
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,910
I'll leave that to Mr. Assange

459
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,540
and his merry band
of programmers.

460
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,210
We have to help them, Alan.

461
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>The Guardian,
The Times, CBS</i> are all linking

462
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,430
to our mirror sites.

463
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,930
Listen to this.

464
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,050
"The Bank's injunction
has brought an obscure group"

465
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,720
"of dreamers to prominence..."

466
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,190
"paradoxically generating
more attention..."

467
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,520
"for their apparently
uncensorable leaking machine."

468
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,190
"And the bank's clients
may now face prosecution"

469
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,870
"in Germany, the US..."

470
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,360
Can you believe it?

471
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,700
Actual justice
for those assholes.

472
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,120
That's great.

473
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,410
That's great.

474
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,290
Wow.

475
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,010
The judge must have lifted
the injunction.

476
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,170
Look, we're back online.

477
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,420
Holy shit.

478
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,260
- We won.
- Mmm-hmm.

479
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,220
We took down
a billion-dollar bank.

480
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,560
- This is crazy.
- I know.

481
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
We have to celebrate.

482
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,730
Yeah, we should, uh...
We should...

483
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,530
I don't know,
order some beers or something.

484
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,990
No, with everyone.

485
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,440
With Bellman, Jay Lim,
everybody else.

486
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,030
This was a team effort.

487
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,500
We should get on Skype
or something.

488
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,280
Oh, I don't know.
It's quite late, actually.

489
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,080
Come on. I just got
an email from Bellman.

490
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,870
And I was chatting with
Jay Lim 15 minutes ago.

491
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,840
Okay, it's probably time that
you met everyone face-to-face.

492
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,010
Maybe not in here.
Let's go inside.

493
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,870
<i>I don't get it.</i>

494
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,380
It says I called...

495
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,980
Are you Jay Lim?

496
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,990
- And Bellman?
- Yep.

497
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,990
How many volunteers do we have?

498
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,160
Hundreds.

499
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,250
<i>We have hundreds of volunteers.</i>

500
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,630
What?

501
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,050
We have hundreds
of email addresses.

502
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,180
That's not the same thing.

503
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,510
Look, every startup
exaggerates its size.

504
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,510
Otherwise,
why would people leak us

505
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,020
confidential information?

506
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,190
Two freaks
with a single server?

507
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,940
We only have one sewer?

508
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,400
Hmm, not as far as the outside
world is concerned, no.

509
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,030
Look, Castro started
a revolution with 82 men.

510
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,860
It does not matter
how small you are...

511
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,780
as long as you have faith
and a plan of action.

512
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,370
I lied to dozens of reporters.

513
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,870
- Pff.
- Our source at Julius Bar.

514
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,200
Necessary fictions.

515
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,000
If Julius Bar knew that
they were up against

516
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,120
an army of two...

517
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,290
What? They would rub us out?

518
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,770
They're a bank,
they're not the mob.

519
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,130
Why have you been
using an alias, then?

520
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,550
Come on, Daniel.

521
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,880
It's a hack,
an inelegant solution.

522
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,810
It could've been so simple.

523
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,130
I've got a hundred friends
I could have called.

524
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,640
This is bullshit!

525
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,390
Friends, you can call friends.

526
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,640
Okay, I've got to...

527
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,770
show you something.
Where is it?

528
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,150
Where the hell is it?

529
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
Open it.

530
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,170
Read it. Read what's inside.

531
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,680
There were three of us.

532
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,590
Mendax, Trax, Prime Suspect.

533
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,170
Three boys with cartoon names,

534
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,600
<i>off on a series
of harmless adventures.</i>

535
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,600
Subversives, one and all.

536
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,270
And when the federal police
finally caught up with us...

537
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,520
Trax pled guilty...

538
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,020
and Prime Suspect, he turned
Crown Witness against me.

539
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,160
I remember waiting for that
verdict in this little room...

540
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,860
and pacing backwards
and forwards

541
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,450
in a figure eight
like a demented bee.

542
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,790
And I knew what life would
be like in a tiny cell and...

543
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,710
Stressful.

544
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,710
For real, why my hair
turned white.

545
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,520
You don't get far in this
world by relying on others.

546
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,840
People...

547
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,390
People are loyal until
it seems opportune not to be.

548
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,810
The tyrants we're up against
have men, money and guns...

549
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,610
and I don't have an army
to fight them with.

550
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,060
All I've got is a website,

551
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,360
a couple of fake
email addresses and...

552
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,240
And you.

553
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,090
Do I have you?

554
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,090
<i>The firewall
of Chinese censorship</i>

555
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,260
<i>was punctured this week...</i>

556
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,430
<i>as WikiLeaks
published 35 videos</i>

557
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,600
<i>of the Tibetan protest...</i>

558
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,010
<i>which quickly went viral.</i>

559
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,180
<i>Following the fire</i>

560
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,350
<i>at the Monju reactor...</i>

561
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,430
<i>officials played down
the extent of the damage...</i>

562
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,680
<i>and denied the existence</i>

563
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,260
<i>of any footage
of the sodium spill.</i>

564
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,190
<i>The video, now streaming
on the WikiLeaks site.</i>

565
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,360
The documents,

566
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,360
<i>the so-called
Bibles of Scientology...</i>

567
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,690
<i>have been collected
and published on WikiLeaks...</i>

568
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,770
<i>and they do little to change
the minds of skeptics.</i>

569
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,780
<i>And they had elected a fellow
by the name of Xemu...</i>

570
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,280
<i>uh, could be
spelled X-E-M-U...</i>

571
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,280
<i>to the Supreme Rulah,</i>

572
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,540
<i>and they were about
to un-elect him.</i>

573
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,800
I mean, this guy founded
a goddamn religion.

574
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,290
It's gobsmacking, isn't it?

575
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
We're trying to expose

576
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,380
what the members
have to go through.

577
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,970
Um, there are memos on the
introspection rundowns, uh...

578
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,220
forced isolation, you know,
regulation of meals...

579
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,400
Six Apart would love to do

580
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,470
a piece on this, sir.

581
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,700
Do you have a French spokesman
I can follow up with in Paris?

582
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,980
The hallowed <i>Guardian,</i>

583
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,900
gracing us with their presence.

584
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,660
Look, a young Woodward
and Bernstein.

585
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,610
Excuse me.

586
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,990
Now look at this.

587
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,070
Hustling for a story,

588
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,590
trying to get the world
to pay attention.

589
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,740
I should be working for him.

590
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,380
At the rate
they're sacking journalists,

591
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,530
you might not have a choice.

592
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,590
It sounds like you're trying
to put us out of business.

593
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,420
I just want you to do
your job properly.

594
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,840
If you can't, someone needs
to pick up the slack.

595
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,630
Oh, is that what you're doing?

596
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,940
Look, anyone can take
a bundle of information...

597
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,840
and toss it up on a website
and call it news.

598
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,170
And people buy our papers

599
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,170
for something a little
more discerning.

600
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,100
People are still
buying your paper?

601
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,600
Look, look, look, gentlemen,
we're on the same page.

602
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,480
This is citizen journalism,
Ian.

603
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,980
It's like a new nervous system.

604
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,360
Looks like it's a bit twitchy.

605
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,780
Yeah, well,
getting 10,000 hits an hour

606
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,110
can do that to you.

607
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,440
By the way,
how is your website doing?

608
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,030
Yes, come on.

609
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,710
We're down again.
We need to add new servers.

610
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,040
Pff.!

611
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,540
Well, that's the price you pay

612
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,870
for giving the world
news for free.

613
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,290
There ain't no money in it.

614
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,630
I've got a few
thousand Euros saved up.

615
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,470
That's a half-dozen
machines on eBay.

616
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,340
What?

617
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,400
Are we not inspired,
men of purpose?

618
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,690
Capable, generous men?

619
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,350
Ah.

620
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,230
It doesn't exactly look
like a data center.

621
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,480
Hey.

622
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Hey.

623
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,400
Nice. You know
the way to my heart, huh?

624
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,740
Long trip-

625
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,320
Julian, meet Marcus,

626
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,910
the second greatest hacker
in the world.

627
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,110
How are you?

628
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,660
Fine.

629
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,920
Okay, uh,
just hook it up right there,

630
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,790
next to the other old IBMs.

631
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,420
And do me a favor,
take off all the tags...

632
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,230
because I don't want to know
which one it is.

633
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,690
You want to protect us
from yourself?

634
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,510
Well, plausible deniability
is never a bad thing, right?

635
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,180
Especially when there might
be jackboots at the door.

636
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,270
A man who understands security.

637
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm just basically
following the tradition

638
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,520
of some excellent hackers.

639
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,520
One in particular
who went by this curious name.

640
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,530
Something out of Horace...

641
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,690
<i>splendide mendax,</i> noble liar.

642
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,780
I'm sorry but it's just,
you know...

643
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,110
the way Daniel talks,

644
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,190
I suspected
an illustrious past.

645
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,200
So I did some digging.

646
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,540
Wow. Hacking NASA.

647
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,370
Impressive. MILNET.

648
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,540
You hacked
the U.S. Defense Network?

649
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,630
It, uh, was a long time ago.

650
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,960
Lots of backdoors,

651
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,540
it really wasn't
that difficult.

652
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,300
Delightfully deceiving.

653
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,880
Just like your name.

654
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,220
And your, uh,
robust infrastructure.

655
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,640
No offense,
but any leet hack could see

656
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,970
that your tech was junk.

657
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,150
So, good thing
you're adding servers.

658
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,900
Mmm.

659
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,900
Uh... Your cows seem
a little depressed.

660
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,520
Do you milk those yourself

661
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,820
or get other people
to do it for you?

662
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,030
Sometimes.

663
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah.

664
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,580
He can do some coding.

665
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,300
I don't want you to let him
on the primary server.

666
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,330
Marcus just wants
to be involved.

667
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,640
He's a bit of a legend
in the club.

668
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,090
- Hmm.
- He could be a big help.

669
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,850
Yeah, well, people with
that much experience

670
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,750
tend to have a mind
of their own.

671
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,680
Holy shit.

672
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,070
The new server
is already working.

673
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,510
We've got a ton of new traffic.

674
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,340
Look, there's at least
half a dozen new leaks.

675
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,610
This is a Jihadist
training manual.

676
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,110
- Gang wars in the U.S. Army.
- Wow.

677
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,060
A list of British National
Party members.

678
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,280
Shit.

679
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,580
It's thousands of Neo-Nazis,
right in the heart of London.

680
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,780
Three thousand kilometers?
Where were you?

681
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,900
It's none of our business.

682
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,290
Could you mind
your own business?

683
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,640
Mr. Berg.

684
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
- Hey.
- You're alive?

685
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,110
And starving.

686
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,050
The British press is going nuts

687
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,500
over the National Party
member list.

688
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,320
People are donating money.
Not a lot, but some.

689
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,530
And we're getting more leaks.

690
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,700
Toxic dumping
in the Ivory Coast,

691
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,660
corruption in Kosovo.

692
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,040
What? You don't like it?

693
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,040
Mmm! It's delicious.

694
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,130
It's just a bit cold, but...

695
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,710
Yes, it's been sitting there
for an hour.

696
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,880
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

697
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,310
It's just the addresses
I don't get.

698
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,390
What?

699
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,060
The National Party members.

700
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,980
I mean, those people
should be exposed...

701
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,030
but you published
their personal information.

702
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,650
Phone numbers, home addresses.

703
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,980
They were in the documents.

704
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,570
Yes, but why not cut them out?

705
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,070
They have families, children.
Someone could get hurt.

706
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,540
Editing reflects bias.

707
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,890
Our sources, the people
on the site, they trust us...

708
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,330
because we don't
screw with the documents.

709
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,590
As Julian says...

710
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,420
"Free people
must have knowledge."

711
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,890
Or, as Orwell says,
"Big Brother is watching."

712
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,600
Is this because
I stayed in on Friday?

713
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,850
I couldn't care less
about Friday.

714
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,680
I had a perfectly good time
with Nik and Claudia...

715
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,240
despite the fact
that Nik tried to get me

716
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,740
to go home with him again.

717
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,610
Oh.

718
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,450
Don't look so concerned.
He bores the shit out of me.

719
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,360
Maybe that's exactly
what you need.

720
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,040
Hey, I was the one
who told you to quit your job.

721
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,290
I'm glad you did.

722
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,930
I'm just saying that,
if you're gonna...

723
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,200
I don't know...

724
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,620
nail yourself to a cross...

725
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,590
then you should probably
know what it's made of.

726
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,810
Do you even remember
the last time we had sex?

727
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,940
I'm sure I'm gonna remember
the next time.

728
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,440
So goddamn clever.

729
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,330
Just a little clever.

730
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,340
Mmm.

731
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,190
What was that?

732
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,370
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

733
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,280
Well, Neo-Nazis
wouldn't knock, right?

734
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,880
Jesus.

735
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,020
I thought
you were in Australia.

736
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,050
Yeah. Well, I thought
it best not to, um...

737
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,390
to telegraph my movements.

738
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,690
By the way,
you should probably take

739
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,970
your name off the door.

740
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,900
Have you seen
the latest expose...

741
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,900
by the Kenyan National
Coalition on Human Rights?

742
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,480
They've revealed that police
are running death squads.

743
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,790
My friend Oscar
wrote the report.

744
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,980
Kibaki wants to bury it.

745
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,530
We need to get it up
on the homepage.

746
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,230
It details hundreds of murders,

747
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,910
massive human rights
violations.

748
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,870
It's like exposing Chile
under Pinochet.

749
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,170
Have you got any of
that disgusting energy drink?

750
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,250
It might be a long night.

751
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,500
Hey.

752
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,750
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

753
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,430
Hey.

754
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,390
Anke.

755
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,190
Anke, come on.

756
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,690
Come back inside, please.
It's late.

757
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,030
- Tell him to go.
- I can't.

758
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,110
Do you want me to come
back inside? Tell him to go!

759
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,280
Listen, we've been working
on this project for months.

760
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,840
Julian thinks it could be
the most important leak

761
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,870
we've ever had.

762
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,450
- He just got off the plane.
- Listen to yourself!

763
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,420
Why do you try so hard
to be him?

764
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,050
What?

765
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,970
You'll never be him.

766
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,260
He's got nowhere else to stay.

767
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,260
Well, I do.

768
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,620
Mmm.

769
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,500
- Is that my jacket?
- Mmm.

770
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,390
I'm about to write a press
release on death squads.

771
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,640
I wanted to wear
something that matched

772
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,840
the gravity of the occasion.

773
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,520
I have a son in Melbourne,
you know.

774
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,030
He turns 19 next week.

775
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,200
I haven't seen him in a year.

776
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,290
It takes two things
to change the world...

777
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,490
and you'd be surprised how
many people have good ideas.

778
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,210
But commitment...

779
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,030
true commitment,
that's the hard one.

780
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,120
It requires sacrifice.

781
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,050
- What's his name?
- Daniel.

782
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,730
His name is Daniel.

783
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,530

Kaupthing...</i>

801
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,360
<i>loaned billions
to its own shareholders...</i>

802
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,110
<i>a key contributor to the
country's economic collapse.</i>

803
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:06,490
<i>The bank obtained a court
order against network RUV...</i>

804
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,570
<i>but that did little good.</i>

805
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,200
We lead tonight with the
collapse of the Kaupthing Bank.

806
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,630
Due to a count injunction, we
can't bring you the whole stony.

807
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,630
But there is an organization that can.
You'll find them at Wikileaks.org.

808
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,210
<i>WikiLeaks is redefining</i>

809
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,640
the public's right
to information.

810
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,630
I'd like to add whatever
legitimacy I can,

811
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,060
right after I buy them a drink.

812
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,930
Iceland could become
a new utopia.

813
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,570
A refuge for whistleblowers
and investigative journalists.

814
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:40,980
She's a Member of Parliament?

815
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,980
Apparently,
our latest spokesperson.

816
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,740
For the legislative process

817
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,730
of bringing freedom
of information...

818
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,280
expression and speech,
into the 21 st century.

819
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,650
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

820
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,330
Thank you so much.

821
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

822
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,830
So, what do you want to drink?

823
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,260
He's like an octopus.

824
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,480
He's everywhere
at the same time.

825
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,630
Yeah.

826
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,590
Come on, Daniel!

827
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,180
You need space
to let your ego flow!

828

<i>The report posted on Wikileaks, which
details shocking police misconduct,</i>

832
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,200
Just leave it alone.
You know he's a clown.

833
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,130
The Students' Union

834
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,570
at the university next week.

835
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,330
It might take that long
to get there.

836
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,240
We've exposed
death squads in Kenya,

837
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,950
a nuclear accident in Iran.

838

In Iceland,
the government has taken over

839
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:04,790
the Kaupthing Bank.

840
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,280
And the 9/11 pager leak

841
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,000
will have huge
privacy implications.

842
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,490
Our enemies.

843
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,630
Um, <i>WIRED</i> wants a longer piece.

844
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,630

for a one-on-one session?

845
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,130

Look at you! Groupies.

851
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,060
She's a reporter.

852
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,610
She's certainly working
an angle.

853

<i>of the Kenyan Police

859
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,830
<i>The report gained notoriety</i>

860
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,670
<i>after it was published
on the WikiLeaks site.</i>

861
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,590
It can't be just some
mealy-mouthed press release.

862
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,090
Kibaki had them murdered.

863
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,930
The language needs
to be stronger.

864
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,010
- It's already quite strong.
- Give me the damn computer.

865
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,850
They left their names
in the report.

866
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,990
They wanted the world to know
they stood behind it.

867
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,320
Yes, they wanted
the world to know.

868
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,600
It was a damn fine story.

869
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,990
We put it on the front
of the website...

870
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,110
and we couldn't even
get a single paper

871
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,690
outside of Kenya to pick it up.

872
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,360
We're not breaking through.

873
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,290
Those were my friends.

874
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,040
If we had publicized
the report better...

875
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,800
then...

876
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,680
they would have been heroes.

877
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,140
And there would be too high
a political cost

878
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,050
to murdering them.

879
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,800
Kibaki wouldn't have dared.

880
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,060
He's a tyrant, Julian.

881
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,070
I don't think more publicity
would have...

882
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,310
Oh, what the hell do you know
about publicity?

883
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:04,400
I mean, outside of sucking up
to reporters. It's disgusting.

884
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,650
The woman from <i>WIRED?</i>

885
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,900
I was selling her a story.

886
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,410
Yeah, well, why don't you just
leave that to me?

00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,670
What?

893
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,220
Do you think our site
is vulnerable?

894
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,100
I think you're taking on
presidents, kings, kingpins.

895
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,760
People that can easily afford
the kind of black hats...

896
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,610
that get off on breaking into
a "secure" operating system.

897
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,440
And believe me,

898
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,770
if your OS is anything
less than secure...

899
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,080
it's not gonna take them long

900
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,610
to identify the rest
of the sources...

901
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,280

902

958
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,710
<i>The program code is a mess.</i>

959
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,340
There are ways
to trace your sources.

960
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,090
They aren't protected nearly
as well as you say they are.

961
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,310
You let him
on the primary server?

962
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,560
He could have hacked it
himself. That's the point.

963
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,850
We need help.

964
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,430
We need to be careful
who we trust.

965
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,900
I've known Marcus for years.

966
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,410
We knew Birgitta
all of five minutes

967
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,110
- when you asked her to...
- I asked her.

968
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,630
I have experience
with these things,

969
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,780
and I don't make mistakes.

970
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,270
Well, at least not usually.

971
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,090
We made a promise
to our sources...

972
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,740
You made a promise to me!

973
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,910
Hey. You might want
to get backstage.

974
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,260
There are two guys
sniffing around,

975
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,120
real Patriot Act types.

976
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,970
According to
The Guardian,

977
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,550
<i>we had more scoops
in three years...</i>

978
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,930
<i>than The Washington Post
has had in 30.</i>

979
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:10,970
<i>We have exposed corruption
in dozens of countries.</i>

980
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,230
<i>Have a look.</i>

981
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,870
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

982
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:24,880
<i>It's working.</i>

983
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,510
<i>Please.</i>

984
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,710
<i>I grew up in the East.</i>

985
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,890
<i>Even if you wrote a letter
about a broken sewer pipe...</i>

986
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,220
<i>we were watched.</i>

987
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,520
<i>Maybe interrogated,
thrown in jail.</i>

988
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,390
<i>I think, Mr. Assange...</i>

989
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,150
<i>if we had someone like you...</i>

990
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,060
<i>the Wall would have
come down years before.</i>

991
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,530
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

992
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,490
<i>Thank you.</i>

993
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,670
<i>This lady really
defines the essence</i>

994
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,580
<i>of what we're trying
to achieve.</i>

995
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,830
<i>Privacy for the individual,</i>

996
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,910
<i>transparency
for institutions...</i>

997
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,050
<i>with your personal safety
as a whistleblower...</i>

998
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,130
<i>guaranteed through anonymity.</i>

999
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,550
<i>Of course,
when you seek to protect,</i>

1000
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,600
<i>there are those
who seek to destroy.</i>

1001
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,020
<i>But we...</i>

1002
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,060
<i>We make a promise
to our sources.</i>

1003
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,900
<i>Which is why we are continually</i>

1004
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,020
<i>adding qualified partners...</i>

1005
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,980
<i>to strengthen our team.</i>

1006
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:34,070
<i>You can change the world
with a great idea...</i>

1007
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,910
<i>but you can't do it alone.</i>

1008
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,410
<i>You need people.</i>

1009
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,460
<i>People willing to put
themselves on the line.</i>

1010
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,100
If you just email Daniel.
Thank you so much.

1011
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,350
Look at the PayPal account.
It's thousands of euros.

1012
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,780
Oh, we should buy some
mistletoe to celebrate under.

1013
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:10,020
Or we can upgrade servers
and get new laptops.

1014
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,350
Or we could do that.
Yawn, yawn.

1015
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,280
See you guys at the party.

1016
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,700
- Mr. and Mrs. Berg.
- Hello.

1017
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,570
Daniel didn't tell me
you were coming.

1018
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,250
We kept reading
about you in the papers.

1019
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,410
Can you join us for dinner?

1020
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,380
- Julian is very busy...
- I'd love to.

1021
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,170
That's marvelous.

1022
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,680
That was taken in Belgium.

1023
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,100
I organized the competitions.

1024
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,690
We traveled to Dusseldorf,
Geneva...

1025
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,860
Remember
that boy he beat in Prague?

1026
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,780
He was so big.

1027
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,780
She means he was fat and slow.

1028
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,540
By the way,
have you seen these?

1029
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,620
Papa...

1030
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,700
Schmitt! Don't ruin my papers.

1031
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,300
Get off that!
Always sitting on my papers.

1032
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,670
He's been keeping
all the articles.

1033
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:19,000
There was this one piece
on Julius Bar in the F.A.Z.

1034
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:22,300
it was really wonderful.

1035
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,050
We don't really
bother with the local papers.

1036
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,550
It's a national paper.

1037
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:35,560
Some collection
you've got there.

1038
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,740
Yeah.

1039
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,810
Quite the anarchist, hmm?

1040
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,320
Oddest thing.

1041
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,160
I didn't meet
my biological father

1042
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,580
until I was in my twenties.

1043
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,040
I walked into his house,
and there on the shelves...

1044
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,830
Kafka, Kropotkin, Solzhenitsyn.

1045
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,380
All these books I'd spent years

1046
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:08,430
trying to discover on my own.

1047
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,900
Perhaps you'd like
to borrow one.

1048
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,860
Where's the bathroom?

1049
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,190
Over there.

1050
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,130
He takes his backpack
to the bathroom?

1051
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,210
Security.

1052
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:54,600
Let's eat.

1053
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,120
Hey.

1054
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,660
That wasn't cool.

1055
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,260
Sorry.

1056
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,180
- See you later.
- Later!

1057
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,300
Bye!

1058
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,970
Yeah.

1059
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,010
I clean lost my appetite.

1060
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,810
But you have to admit
they are a bit suffocating.

1061
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,480
What?

1062
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,610
Oh, you haven't
picked up on that?

1063
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,360
Well, I suppose we all have
our own unique way

1064
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,030
of viewing the world.

1065
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,860
For example,
here's an interesting one.

1066
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,490
Did you see it,
the new <i>WIRED</i> piece?

1067
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,040
"Cofounder Daniel Schmitt
got involved"

1068
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,700
"with WikiLeaks
prior to launch."

1069
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,630
I didn't say that. Julian,
the reporter screwed up.

1070
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,460
Maybe you're used to people
exaggerating your successes...

1071
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,540
but while you were
out winning judo trophies

1072
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,880
with Mutti and Vati...

1073
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,050
I was studying
information systems

1074
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:13,880
in a shitty squat
outside Melbourne...

1075
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,720
obsessing over code in
a hot little flat in Paris...

1076
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,840
and holding schizophrenic
meetings with myself...

1077
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:23,900
the chairman, the secretary,
sole volunteer, and founder...

1078
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:28,650
of an organization
no one had even heard of!

1079
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,560
Including you.

1080
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,820
Oh, no, wait, Daniel,
but there's more to this.

1081
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,150
It gets better.

1082
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,920
"Daniel Schmitt,
he won't give his real name."

1083
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,250
"No, instead, he adopted
the nom de plume 'Schmitt'"

1084
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,080
"after his cat."

1085
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,250
To think,
I spent weeks reading Horace

1086
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,560
to find the right
<i>nom de guerre...</i>

1087
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,760
when all I needed
was a fucking cat.

1088
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,930
Sorry. Uh, you're
the leaks guy, right?

1089
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,100
From the Congress?

1090
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,850
- You need volunteers?
- Hmm.

1091
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,060
Oh, we have hundreds
of volunteers.

1092
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,530
But we could always do
with more loyal followers.

1093
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,360
Oh, great. I'm Ziggy.

1094
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,030
- Good to meet you, Ziggy.
- Good to meet you.

1095
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,870
Hey, Daniel.

1096
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,850
Listen, I just need five
minutes. I'll be all right.

1097
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,600
- Don't worry about it.
- Just a cup of coffee.

1098
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,660
But Julian wants me to take
you guys to the airport!

1099
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,090
Julian can go fuck himself!

1100
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,300
This represents
the full stockpile?

1101
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,420
There's been some
effort to comply

1102
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,170
with the Chemical Weapons
Convention...

1103
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:21,170
but there is no way they will
be able to destroy it all

1104
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,840
before the deadline.

1105
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:28,310
Is this Gaddafi dragging
his heels, or his son?

1106
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:29,600
It's not clear.

1107
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,520
But Mutassim is ambitious.

1108
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:34,020
His brother is out of favor...

1109
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,580
and this could be an attempt
to cast himself

1110
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,350
as a possible successor
to his father.

1111
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,850
That's just what we need.

1112
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,860
Another madman
with mustard gas.

1113
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,290
Do you remember that
New Year's Eve party

1114
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,370
in Sharm El-Sheikh?

1115
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,290
I'd just started my Fulbright,
I'd had a bit to drink.

1116
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:03,300
A lot to drink.

1117
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,640
Your brother begged
you to leave

1118
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,060
the drunk American
at the party...

1119
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,380
but you stayed.

1120
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:11,390
Someone had to keep
an eye on her.

1121
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,230
D.C. is a nice place
to raise a child.

1122
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,360
You have a family now.

1123
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,690
I want you to do what's best
for your family.

1124
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,580
Tripoli is my home.

1125
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,330
I am doing what's best
for my family.

1126
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,160
Why don't we order something?

1127
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,670
<i>The spread
of information is forming</i>

1128
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,250
<i>a new nervous system
for our planet.</i>

1129
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,340
<i>We recognize that</i>

1130
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,670
<i>the world's information
infrastructure...</i>

1131
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,510
<i>will become what
we and others make of it.</i>

1132
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,940
So, you think
this is good Intel, huh?

1133
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,010
I've known Tarek
for over 20 years.

1134
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,070
Okay. Write up a cable.

1135
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,280
I want everybody on the
Middle East desk up to speed.

1136
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:26,750
Hey.

1137
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:36,060
I never thought
you'd become a rock star.

1138
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,640
I think rock stars
have cooler tattoos.

1139
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,440
You should have heard Julian.

1140
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,810
"Compensating for something?"

1141
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,230
I didn't care.

1142
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,070
It wasn't for him anyways.

1143
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,660
He's an asshole, Daniel.

1144
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,830
He's a manipulative asshole.

1145
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,790
He must be.

1146
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,800
Why else would I have given up
everything I cared about?

1147
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,010
What you've done...

1148
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,010
it's staggering.

1149
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,510
But you did it together.

1150
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,350
Sure, Julian
is the mad prophet,

1151
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,440
but he needs boundaries.

1152
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,440
He needs a line.

1153
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:29,940
You're that line.

1154
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:48,170
<i>We all want
information to be free.</i>

1155
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,380
But investigative journalism
is pricy.

1156
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,720
And when newspapers
get squeezed,

1157
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,550
it's the first thing to go...

1158
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,720
which is why providers of
first-rate source material...

1159
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,970
like WikiLeaks,
are so important.

1160
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,800
Nick, is Assange
ever gonna show?

1161
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,640
I had a message,
I think he's been delayed.

1162
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,350
Passport control
can be such a bore.

1163
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,320
Apparently,
they're not big fans

1164
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,070
of first-rate
source material, so...

1165
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,500
<i>What we witnessed</i>

1166
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,670
was the brutal breakdown
of the rule of law...

1167
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,750
and destruction
of public property

1168
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,590
as acted out by the police.

1169
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:37,260
I was so frightened, I thought
my hair might turn white.

1170
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,260
The only way we could actually
get back into the compound...

1171
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,930
was to ask the police,

1172
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,820
that we were trying to expose
as being corrupt,

1173
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,260
to let us in.

1174
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,850
The real reason
I was late today was, uh...

1175
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,910
we have it on good authority
that we're being tracked

1176
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,350
by CIA operatives...

1177
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,940
and there were
definitely two types.

1178
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:56,020
- Oh.
- Which we had to shake.

1179
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,280
An international man
of mystery, huh?

1180
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,200
I've used that line.

1181
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,280
Next he'll be telling you

1182
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,700
the spooks kidnapped
his partner.

1183
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,070
Partner?

1184
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
Daniel, the German chap.
The grounded one.

1185
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,950
The one who helps you
distinguish fact from fiction.

1186
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,040
WikiLeaks has hundreds
of volunteers.

1187
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,470
It's very difficult to keep
track of any single one.

1188
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,290
Well, do try to
keep track of me.

1189
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,590
Excuse me.

1190
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,940
So, what's this new leak
you're sitting on?

1191
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,730
It must be big if it's piqued
the interest of the CIA.

1192
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,740
So, you do believe me?

1193
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,940
No, no, no. I didn't.

1194
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,490
Until I noticed your friends.

1195
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,820
Let's not attract attention.

1196
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,490
The American spooks
are relatively civilized.

1197
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,500
It's the Russians you should
be keeping an eye on.

1198
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,670
Room 376.

1199
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,670
When Ms. Lang returns,
bring her up,

1200
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,680
they'll assume
you're in for the night.

1201
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,840
That will give us plenty
of time to find a way

1202
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,270
to slip you out of the hotel...

1203
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,690
and for you to show
me what it is

1204
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,520
that's got their knickers
in such a twist.

1205
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,860
Anyway. Good night.

1206
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,280
Good night.

1207
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,690
Good night.

1208
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,560
Yeah?

1209
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,490
I need you. Can you get on
the first plane to Reykjavik?

1210
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,570
Christ, I'm surprised they
don't have more men on you.

1211
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,030
I thought you were in Norway.

1212
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,840
It's not safe for me
to stay here anymore.

1213
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:16,860
<i>What's going on?</i>

1214
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,410
They'll have a taxi here in 20.

1215
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,720
It'll be by the back entrance.
The Americans are out front.

1216
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,630
Julian, Julian, you should
work with us on this.

1217
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:26,330
Why? So that The Guardian
can pick up some more awards?

1218
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,880
What are you doing?

1219
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,260
If I'm gonna get
out of this hotel,

1220
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,260
I'm gonna need a disguise.

1221
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,770
Oh.

1222
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,950
<i>That's a weapon.</i>

1223
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,290
<i>I see your element.</i>

1224
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,040
<i>You got about four Humvees
out along this...</i>

1225
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,210
<i>You're clear.</i>

1226
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,790
<i>All right, firing.</i>

1227
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,960
<i>Let me know when you get them.</i>

1228
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,050
<i>Light 'em all up.</i>

1229
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,640
<i>Come on. Fire.</i>

1230
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,720
<i>Roger.</i>

1231
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,060
<i>Keep shooting.</i>

1232
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,310
<i>Keep shooting.</i>

1233
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,150
<i>Target hit. It was a missile.</i>

1234
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,400
<i>Appears to be
wounded, trying to crawl away.</i>

1235
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,650
<i>He's getting up.</i>

1236
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,410
<i>Maybe he has
a weapon down in his hand?</i>

1237
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,830
<i>No, no,
I haven't seen one yet.</i>

1238
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,070
<i>I see you guys got that guy</i>

1239
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,500
<i>crawling right now on the curb?</i>

1240
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,330
<i>Yeah, I got
him, I put two rounds of...</i>

1241
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,250
<i>Individuals
going to the scene...</i>

1242
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,330
<i>Jesus.</i>

1243
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,050
<i>Possibly picking up bodies
and weapons.</i>

1244
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,080
<i>Coming around. Clear.</i>

1245
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,010
<i>Roger.
I lost them in the dust.</i>

1246
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,500
<i>I got 'em.</i>

1247
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,340
<i>Oh, yeah, look at that,</i>

1248
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,670
<i>right through the windshield.</i>

1249
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,930
<i>Look at those dead bastards.</i>

1250
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,600
Were they even armed?

1251
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,680
With cameras, mainly.

1252
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,680
Two of the victims
were Reuters employees.

1253
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,780
A cameraman and his driver.

1254
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,450
The military said
they died in a battle

1255
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,190
between U.S. forces
and insurgents...

1256
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,200
and the press just bought it.

1257
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,990
Didn't Reuters chase the story?

1258
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:24,200
The Pentagon stonewalled them.
It's a massive cover-up.

1259
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,870
This is huge.

1260
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,790
I think this is gonna
change everything.

1261
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:31,000
Traffic, donations.

1262
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,380
I want to call it
"Collateral Murder."

1263
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,630
- That's a bit loaded.
- Don't you think it should be?

1264
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,140
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

1265
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,890
We have to make sure
it's legitimate.

1266
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,970
Where did you get it?

1267
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,110
A guy showed up in the chat,
said he was U.S. military.

1268
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,810
But we should track down
the families of the victims.

1269
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,060
In Baghdad?

1270
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,060
Yes, in Baghdad.

1271
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,810
We are journalists.
We have to verify our sources.

1272
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,900
Maybe you should
look into flights.

1273
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:01,240
We'll have to preprocess,
improve resolution.

1274
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,530
We can use FFmpegs
and toss it into Final Cut.

1275
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,830
I know some guys who've done
this thing, at RUV.

1276
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,080
Good.

1277
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,880
<i>Target 15 coming at you.</i>

1278
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,130
<i>It's a guy with a weapon.</i>

1279
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,340
Good.
Now add some buzz over that.

1280
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,090
Twenty, again.

1281
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,380
Radio frequency
in the military comms.

1282
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:27,560
Okay.

1283
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,010
<i>All right, firing.</i>

1284
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,550
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

1285
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,810
<i>Last conversation, Hotel...</i>

1286
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,480
<i>Roger, Hotel Two-Six.</i>

1287
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,460
I've heard people say

1288
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:02,170
that I dangle on the autistic
spectrum.

1289
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,310
It's probably why I lean
so heavily on those around me.

1290
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,520
Yeah.

1291
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,810
We need to set up
a media launch.

1292
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:15,970
Yeah.

1293
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,730
Ziggy is planning something
at the Parliament building.

1294
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,480
- Ziggy?
- Mmm-hmm.

1295
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,280
You want to launch the
biggest leak we've ever had

1296
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,400
in Iceland?

1297
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,860
Let's take the fight to them.

1298
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,030
Courage is contagious.

1299
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,420
Right?

1300
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:53,350
<i>The video shows
the brutal slaughter</i>

1301
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,890
<i>of two Reuters reporters.</i>

1302
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,850
Here, we have
firsthand evidence

1303
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:01,570
<i>of the barbarity of war.</i>

1304
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:06,030
<i>A man, going to drop
his children at school...</i>

1305
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,020
<i>sees another man bleeding
to death on the pavement.</i>

1306
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,910
<i>He stops to aid this civilian
and in the process is killed.</i>

1307
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,370
<i>And his vehicle
turned 180 degrees...</i>

1308
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,790
<i>by the sheer force
of the Apache helicopter's</i>

1309
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,540
<i>30-millimeter bullets...</i>

1310
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,350
<i>ripping into the side
of the vehicle...</i>

1311
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:28,590
<i>miraculously not killing
the two children inside.</i>

1312
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,550
<i>The website is calling
this "Collateral Murder."</i>

1313
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,720
<i>Captain Nash,
is that a fair description</i>

1314
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,310
<i>of the job our troops
are doing?</i>

1315
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:40,010
<i>If you are embedding with
terrorists in a combat zone...</i>

1316
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,070
<i>and those terrorists get
engaged and you get killed,</i>

1317
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,570
<i>it is not murder.</i>

1318
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,660
If you don't want
ugly pictures,

1319
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,970
you should stay out
of ugly wars.

1320
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,400
I've got the Deputy NSA
for you.

1321
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,790
Twelve million people have
seen that video on YouTube.

1322
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:01,930
Do you still want to tell me

1323
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,260
you think it's just
a little website?

1324
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,250
General Thomason
is reviewing Intel.

1325
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,960
<i>I told him to pull you in.</i>

1326
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:09,590
I'm on in five,
do you have anything for me?

1327
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,020
The guy on Fox is pretty good.

1328
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,680
Maybe you should use
some of his material.

1329
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,630
Sam.

1330
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,760
<i>This is Jim.
Just tell them the truth.</i>

1331
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,760
The soldiers
were following protocol.

1332
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:22,270
This is computer geeks looking
at the war through a pinhole.

1333
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,740
Well, these computer geeks
are starting

1334
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,230
to become a real nuisance, Jim.

1335
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,930
Welcome to the revolution.

1336
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,230
"Assange,
disheveled like a bag lady"

1337
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,490
"walking in off the street..."

1338
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,230
"He smelled as if
he hadn't bathed..."

1339
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,940
"Changes cell phones daily."

1340
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,190
I mean...

1341
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,320
<i>A couple of days
of serious analysis...</i>

1342
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,070
<i>and then it's just all about
how weird I am.</i>

1343
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,780
You must have
enjoyed Keller's diatribe

1344
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,490
on your filthy white socks.

1345
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,160
<i>Yes, but I hadn't figured...</i>

1346
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,160
<i>that, you know,</i>

1347
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:31,670
<i>brutal slaughter
and the state of my socks...</i>

1348
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,840
<i>would get equal billing
in The New York Times.</i>

1349
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,750
Hello.

1350
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,850
Ziggy.

1351
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,390
Christ, they're gonna kill us.

1352
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,140
<i>Get off Skype.
Get off everything, now.</i>

1353
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,480
Turn the phones off!

1354
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,390
Guys, we're going
to have to shut down

1355
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,520
everything right now.

1356
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,910
You all have
five seconds to save.

1357
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,290
- Five seconds!
- What's going on, Marcus?

1358
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,740
We cannot let them trace us.

1359
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,360
I just spoke to Kim Zetter.

1360
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,200
She said the U.S. Military
arrested a private

1361
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,620
for leaking secrets to us.

1362
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:05,740
The video?

1363
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,710
This is the guy
who leaked the video?

1364
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,120
She said
it was more than that.

1365
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:12,210
Half a million classified
U.S. Army documents

1366
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,410
and hundreds of thousands...

1367
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:15,310
of internal communiqués from
the U.S. State Department.

1368
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,630
This is the biggest leak

1369
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,500
of classified information
in history.

1370
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,010
Oh, my God.

1371
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,100
You're telling me
that this private

1372
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,560
stuck a thumb drive
in a computer?

1373
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,640
It was a CD.

1374
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,480
- Excuse me?
- It was a blank CD.

1375
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,650
It was marked "Lady Gaga."

1376
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:44,780
- Where's the Secretary?
- Jim's calling her now.

1377
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,660
Do we know which documents
Manning leaked?

1378
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:48,870
He's refusing to talk.

1379
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,450
We think it's war logs
from Afghanistan and Iraq.

1380
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,780
And cables
from the NCD database.

1381
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,590
Which cables?

1382
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,170
Which cables?

1383
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,920
He may have leaked
the whole database.

1384
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,680
That's a quarter
of a million cables.

1385
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:12,310
They can read like
the diary of a 12-year-old.

1386
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,010
You know, personal,
frank, rude comments...

1387
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,870
about every president
and prime minister alive.

1388
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:18,360
This is a diplomatic nightmare.

1389
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,930
Excuse me, but who gives a shit

1390
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,270
about diplomacy right now?

1391
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,030
The military logs expose
hundreds of informants.

1392
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,230
There are lives at risk.

1393
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,280
Sam, he's right.

1394
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,580
A 22-year-old private

1395
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,710
with a history
of mental instability...

1396
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,960
and a Lady Gaga CD...

1397
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,170
and we're on the verge of
a major international crisis.

1398
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,930
He bragged about it
in a chat room.

1399
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,470
What the hell was he thinking?

1400
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:52,220
He's a kid. He's 22.

1401
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:54,180
Are you sure
they can't trace us?

1402
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,720
I'm adding another Tor circuit.

1403
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
Wipe my portion
from the hard drive.

1404
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,890
Well, if you have them,
then they know about it.

1405
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,230
I know. I got to go.

1406
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,650
- Are we back up yet?
- Just a few more proxies.

1407
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,860
The whole mission
is to protect sources.

1408
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:13,070
We can't protect them
from themselves.

1409
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,580
We're online.

1410
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,780
See if Julian's on chat.

1411
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,360
Shit! He's got them.

1412
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,540
How did he not tell us?

1413
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,760
That is three gigs of text.

1414
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,000
This is crazy.

1415
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,740
Tell him
we can't dump the data.

1416
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,770
It's too dangerous.
Tell him!

1417
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,480
We need time
to go through it all.

1418
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,340
Prick.

1419
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:58,800
Come on.

1420
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:19,740
Fuck you, you disloyal fuck!

1421
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,260
Shit!

1422
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,970
Guys, look at this.

1423
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,690
<i>Julian Assange
is engaged in terrorism.</i>

1424
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,110
<i>He should be treated
as an enemy combatant.</i>

1425
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,370
<i>WikiLeaks should be closed down</i>

1426
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:55,480
<i>permanently and decisively.</i>

1427
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,650
Nick, how can I help you?

1428
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,910
Can you put me
in touch with Julian?

1429
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:04,490
Julian's not available.

1430
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,820
Daniel, we both
know you're sitting

1431
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,700
on the biggest story
on the planet right now.

1432
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,220
And if you're thinking
of going to ground on this,

1433
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,800
it's too late.
The cat's out of the bag.

1434
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,330
<i>Bradley Manning's
future and yours</i>

1435
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,510
<i>depend on how this
material is handled.</i>

1436
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,830
Now, I want you to tell Julian

1437
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,340
I'm already working
on a story...

1438
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:22,890
to paint this as the next
Pentagon Papers.

1439
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,680
But you need our help.

1440
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,110
It's the biggest thing
you've ever done.

1441
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,270
<i>And if you think they spun you</i>

1442
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,680
<i>on the Collateral
Murder video...</i>

1443
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,180
<i>wait till you see
what they do here.</i>

1444
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:33,010
Tell Julian
this is all about survival.

1445
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,680
I'll get back to you.

1446
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,190
Where's Julian flying in to?

1447
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,370
Julian.

1448
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,080
Did anyone follow you?

1449
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,880
No, no, no, I don't think so.

1450
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,970
What's he doing here?

1451
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,300
- I told you to come alone.
- You need to hear him out.

1452
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,380
They're looking for us, and
they got people everywhere.

1453
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,900
Daniel Ellsberg
put out a statement.

1454
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,400
He said
they're coming after us.

1455
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,860
We need to publish now.

1456
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,940
It's hundreds of thousands of
pages of sensitive material.

1457
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:32,200
It's not like the video.

1458
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,640
The docs are full of jargon,
they're totally impenetrable.

1459
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,780
We wouldn't know what the hell
we were publishing.

1460
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,080
So, we let
the historians decide.

1461
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,500
I thought the whole point
of this organization

1462
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,550
was to publish in full.

1463
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:47,590
I thought the point
was protecting whistleblowers.

1464
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,280
Can I speak to Nick Davies,
please?

1465
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:18,950
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

1466
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,370
You should still
keep an eye out

1467
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:21,590
for men with poison umbrellas.

1468
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,620
But if the U.S.
has any foresight,

1469
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,930
they know they need
to do more...

1470
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,800
than kill you.
They need to delegitimize

1471
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,920
everything you stand for.

1472
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,050
You represent
a terrifying future.

1473
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,550
Right now, the most
powerful media machine

1474
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:33,970
on the entire planet...

1475
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,640
is planning a smear campaign
like nothing you've ever seen.

1476
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:42,810
Amazing how someone
could talk for 10 minutes

1477
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:45,060
without actually
saying anything.

1478
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:46,480
You said
you would hear him out.

1479
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,810
What are you proposing?

1480
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,810
An international
media coalition

1481
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,150
legitimizing you
as a news organization.

1482
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,990
Let the U.S. attack.
We print the news.

1483
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,200
And if we put you on
the moral high ground...

1484
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,330
with Mother Teresa,
with Nelson Mandela...

1485
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,830
No one will be able
to fuck with us.

1486
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,740
But they'd still get
their exclusives.

1487
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,750
Look, finding stories
in all these documents...

1488
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:07,140
that's a lot of work,
it's a lot of time.

1489
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,510
You can't expect us to do it
without an incentive.

1490
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,420
And then what? We set a date?

1491
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,470
You run your stories,
we post the raw data.

1492
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:16,670
Obviously, all these documents
have names,

1493
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,170
sources, U.S. informants.

1494
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,800
You'll need to redact them.

1495
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,020
But WikiLeaks doesn't edit.

1496
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,270
That's all very well,

1497
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:26,270
but <i>The Guardian</i>
can't be seen to condone...

1498
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,350
publishing something
that puts lives in danger.

1499
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:33,110
And morals aside, it's about
how you're perceived.

1500
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,780
You're starting
an information war

1501
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:38,860
with the United States
Government.

1502
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:41,160
You mustn't hand
them ammunition.

1503
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:52,210
I suppose
it is just a name search.

1504
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,890
Well, look, that's my editor.
What should I say?

1505
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,560
How secure are your phones?

1506
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,140
Alan.

1507
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:08,640
<i>So, do we have a deal?</i>

1508
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,570
No, no, no,
it's a complete cock-up.

1509
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,640
He won't talk to me.

1510
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:12,730
<i>Let me talk to him, then.</i>

1511
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,570
I can't.
Listen, I'll get back to you.

1512
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:16,070
Julian...

1513
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,320
this kind of coverage
gets people's attention.

1514
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:22,410
It could be the culmination
of everything we've done.

1515
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,090
This is a code
to a temporary site.

1516
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:40,590
I'll send you the link
in 24 hours.

1517
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,760
You'll find the war logs there.

1518
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:47,930
So, it's a deal?

1519
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,770
We publish, you publish.

1520
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:52,270
We redact, you redact.

1521
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,100
We'll put out the war logs
in six weeks.

1522
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,480
If you behave,
we'll move on to the cables.

1523
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,120
Great.

1524
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,930
Well, a coalition government

1525
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:12,390
will have a certain
honeymoon period.

1526
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,330
But, selling off the
post office? I mean that...

1527
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:16,540
Good morning, everyone.
The meeting is over.

1528
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,970
Alan, I'm sorry. I told Nick.

1529
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,630
Get me Bill Keller
at <i>The Times,</i>

1530
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,550
and what's-his-fuck
at Der Spiegel.

1531
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,470
Alan?

1532
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,050
I'm sorry, folks, we're gonna
have to break this up.

1533
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,310
Door? Yeah.

1534
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,160
He's pretty slow
for a tech wizard.

1535
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:55,080
He said it's 91,000 logs
from Afghanistan alone.

1536
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,000
I imagine
that might take a second.

1537
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,300
All right, here we go.
Look at that.

1538
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,010
<i>Keren, get me Bill Keller
at The New York Times.</i>

1539
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,760
And let's be discreet.

1540
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,100
The spreadsheet is enormous.

1541
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,530
I'm sure it contains
the scoop of the century...

1542
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,520
but we simply cannot access it.

1543
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,860
Are you working in Excel?

1544
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,530
Every time I open the damn
thing the system crashes.

1545
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,340
You have to parse the data
in a text editor...

1546
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,610
and then script it into
a searchable database.

1547
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,210
<i>- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, that helps.</i>

1548
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,790
I blew off a profile
with McChrystal in Kabul.

1549
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:39,960
This better be good.

1550
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,040
Do you know what
"E.O.F." stands for?

1551
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,380
It's "Escalation of Force."

1552
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,710
Can you see that?

1553
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,170
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

1554
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:59,900
E.O.F. is
"Escalation of Force."

1555
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,060
Which I believe
means more dead civilians.

1556
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,240
The Espionage Act?
You can't be serious.

1557
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,900
If the Attorney General
can show...

1558
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,230
he tried to convince a source

1559
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,600
to leak
classified information...

1560
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,850
You mean like every journalist

1561
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,650
who's ever covered
the Pentagon?

1562
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,830
They could indict us
under that rubric.

1563
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,580
I wouldn't be surprised
if they do.

1564
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,330
Nothing draws people to a cause

1565
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,660
like a celebrity martyr, Alan.

1566
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,500
That's good, Daniel.
Uh, look...

1567
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:27,170
can you email a list
of whistleblower prizes

1568
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,450
you're putting Manning up for?

1569
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,000
<i>No emailing.
But I can fax you.</i>

1570
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,230
Right, of course.
But we need it by Friday

1571
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,670
so we can run it in his bio.

1572
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,350
Will do. Thanks, Ian.

1573
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,920
And this
Task Force 373 has a hit list

1574
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,430
with more than 2,000 names.

1575
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:40,430
Yes, they refer to it
as "stopping birthdays."

1576
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,240
These civilian casualty
numbers are devastating.

1577
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,440
It's a shit show.

1578
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,880
I've got the U.K.
ambassador saying

1579
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,190
the campaign isn't under
proper supervision.

1580
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,530
Do you want to talk
to Marcel? Hold on.

1581
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:26,410
Well, you can sleep
here if you want.

1582
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,940
No, no.

1583
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:30,730
T-minus four.
Are you getting excited?

1584
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:32,110
Sure.

1585
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,490
He must be exhausted.

1586
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,150
I mean, the redactions alone...

1587
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:38,490
it shouldn't take that long.
It's just a name search.

1588
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,990
That's what
we initially thought.

1589
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:45,490
But a lot of it is context.

1590
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,000
Nick told Julian...

1591
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,840
a tip from the "goat herder
in the red house,"

1592
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,090
in small villages...

1593
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:54,920
that's as damning as a name.

1594
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,090
We're only posting
a few hundred of the logs

1595
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,640
and we're swimming.

1596
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:03,970
You'd need an army
to go through all 91,000.

1597
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,850
Thank God you have one.

1598
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:22,500
The story on the generals
would typically be the lead...

1599
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:23,800
but everything's
going out at once

1600
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,840
in case there's a gag order.

1601
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,860
We're struggling to keep it
to 14 pages.

1602
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,930
It's talking points
for the morning interviews.

1603
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,290
- Julian.
- What the hell?

1604
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,960
I've been trying
to reach you for hours.

1605
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,040
I was just sending you a list.

1606
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,870
The URLs need
to be standardized,

1607
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,190
torrents need seeding.
We need to...

1608
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,680
The redactions.

1609
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:45,300
That was on my list.

1610
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,730
It's 91,000 documents,

1611
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,220
and our site is publishing
in four days.

1612
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,240
Let's go.

1613
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:07,800
What the hell
were you thinking?

1614
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,910
Editing reflects bias.

1615
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:11,670
We make a promise to our
sources to publish in full.

1616
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,080
You lied to everyone we're
working with. You lied to me.

1617
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,140
It's funny, you know, I don't
remember you objecting...

1618
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,830
to us publishing the names
and addresses

1619
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:20,090
- of every BNP member.
- This is different.

1620
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,890
These sources are fighting
for the very thing

1621
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,420
we're supposed to stand for.

1622
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,920
And remind me what that is,
exactly. Hmm?

1623
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:28,510
Transparency for
powerful organizations...

1624
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:32,190
exposing corruption and
conspiracy wherever it exists.

1625
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,020
We're going to have
to push back publication.

1626
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,020
There's no way we can release
in four days.

1627
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,350
<i>Fourteen pages in The Guardian,</i>

1628
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,110
<i>twelve in The New York Times.</i>

1629
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,280
This is more coverage
than all the leaks

1630
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,120
we have had, combined.

1631
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,610
We are winning
an information war...

1632
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:50,610
which goes beyond
any short-term alliance

1633
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,090
we have with
the mainstream media...

1634
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,010
and you want to throw it
all away because you fear...

1635
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:57,290
that some U.S. Government
informant might come to harm?

1636
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,960
These are human beings, Julian,

1637
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,270
and their lives are at stake.

1638
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,710
What about the lives
of the soldiers...

1639
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:06,390
and the civilians
involved in these conflicts?

1640
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,260
Death squads, unreported
civilian casualties,

1641
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,550
countless incidents
of friendly fire.

1642
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:14,890
This is information
the world needs to know.

1643
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,310
So, the next time you find
yourself lecturing me

1644
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:18,900
about this organization...

1645
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:22,820
please try to remember
why I created it.

1646
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:27,150
And why I hired you to help me.

1647
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,660
Well, that's funny.

1648
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,320
I don't remember you hiring me.

1649
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:35,110
I don't recall
a contract or a salary.

1650
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,830
But I guess I should have
known when I met Jay Lim.

1651
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:39,580
There is no organization.

1652
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,250
There's just you
and your ego...

1653
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:45,250
and the lies you tell to get
whatever the fuck you want.

1654
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,680
You know, it's incredible...

1655
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:55,850
how much time you can spend
with a person...

1656
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:59,640
and still have no idea
who they are.

1657
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,860
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.

1658
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,590
<i>Those are
the most revealing docs.</i>

1659
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,470
<i>Do whatever you can
to keep them off the site.</i>

1660
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:35,720
Okay, thank you, Marcel. Bye.

1661
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,440
Rosenbach said the bulk
of the identifiable sources...

1662
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:39,810
are in the threat assessments.

1663
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,510
It's 14,000 documents.

1664
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:42,940
But, if you hold those,

1665
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,570
there are a lot
fewer names in the rest.

1666
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,100
Yeah, I got it.

1667
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,350
<i>And remember,</i>

1668
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,230
don't tell Julian
that we were talking.

1669
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,150
Are you seeing
the ridiculous crap

1670
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,580
<i>he's spouting on the chat?</i>

1671
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:02,830
<i>Danny, he's completely
out of his mind.</i>

1672
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:05,500
And if he keeps doing this,
we're going to have to quit.

1673
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:06,740
All of us.

1674
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:08,790
Just take care
of the documents, okay?

1675
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,930
Daniel, have you seen this?

1676
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,300
He's on Twitter.

1677
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:25,350
He says that you are FBI,
and that I'm CIA.

1678
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:27,400
Look.

1679
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:39,830
This is crazy.

1680
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:51,040
<i>Der Spiegel is begging
for more time.</i>

1681
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,290
<i>The Times wants to go.</i>

1682
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,550
Holger, I've got Nick.

1683
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:55,840
Ah, great. Five minutes?

1684
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,400
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.

1685

Okay, good. Keep it up.

I just talked to Libya,

they have real concerns
about the ambassador.

1717

All right,
everybody, listen up!

1719
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:27,800
I need at least 10 names...

01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,390
of high priority sources
who could be harmed...

1721

if and when these cables
are put out.

1722

If we can claim that Assange
has blood on his hands...

1723
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,280
we can turn this thing around.

1724
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:46,150
Hi.

1725
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,920
Do you think the President
of Turkmenistan...

1726
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:48,990
will be more upset that

1727
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:50,310
I called him
a practiced liar...

1728
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,490
or that I called him vain?

1729
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,320
- I'm sure he's heard worse.
- Hmm.

1730
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:56,830
"President Berdymukhammedov
does not like people"

1731
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:58,000
"smarter than him."

1732
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,630
"Since he's not very bright,"

1733
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,670
"he's suspicious
of a lot of people."

1734
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,230
Well, he's been around
for a long time.

1735
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,560
I don't think he's worried
about the opinions

1736
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:08,050
of a mid-level foreign attaché.

1737
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:10,600
That's why I signed
Hillary's name to it.

1738
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:14,030
I'll see if <i>The Times</i>
will hold it.

1739
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:15,390
No, I've got bigger issues.

1740
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:17,940
No, Sarah,
I am collecting cables

1741
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,280
from the head
of every foreign desk.

1742
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,700
Okay, you tell me...
You tell me, then,

1743
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,070
what do I ignore?

1744
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:23,400
This?

1745
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,570
This destroys
the Sudanese peace talks,

1746
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:27,520
this screws a source
in Amman...

1747
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:29,150
<i>The Times</i> will redact
the names.

1748
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,200
Yeah, but,
what about him, will he?

1749
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,570
And don't you tell me

1750
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:35,400
that your friend Keller's
got him under control.

1751
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:37,290
He's bigger than The Times.

1752
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,200
He can do whatever
the hell he wants.

1753
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,080
Just like he did
with the war logs.

1754
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,290
God.

1755
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,220
Any word from Tarek?

1756
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,170
He's named in at least
a half a dozen of these.

1757
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:56,840
Let's bring him in.

1758
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:03,980
So have you decided
about St. Harts?

1759
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:06,190
It's a lung flight for a baby.

1760
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:08,480
That's what a nanny's for.

1761
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:11,030
You don't have to convince me.

1762
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:26,290
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Haliseh?</i>

1763
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:32,680
Remember the trip
we once spoke of?

1764
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,550
Gentlemen.

1765
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,520
Welcome.

1766
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:48,070
Please...

1767
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,190
Tarek?

1768
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:55,870
I left the estimates in the ear.

1769
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,360
You need to go home.

1770
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,610
She's cooking dinner.

1771
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:38,570
Now! She needs to go now!

1772
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,790
We need to pack.

1773
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:47,580
Everything.

1774
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:50,540
<i>There are names, operations.</i>

1775
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,420
<i>This leak puts
Americans' lives,</i>

1776
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:57,420
<i>and our allies' lives at risk.</i>

1777
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:00,260
<i>There is blood on their hands.</i>

1778
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:02,170
<i>Pentagon officials
are saying today</i>

1779
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:04,260
<i>that this has been
their fear all along.</i>

1780
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,010
<i>That, if those names
were revealed,</i>

1781
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:07,720
<i>those people would
become targets.</i>

1782
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:10,100
<i>Mr. Assange
can say whatever he likes...</i>

1783
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,100
<i>about the greater good
he thinks</i>

1784
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,680
<i>he and his source are doing...</i>

1785
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:16,270
<i>but they might already
have on their hands</i>

1786
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:18,200
<i>the blood of some
young soldier...</i>

1787
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:20,690
<i>or that of an Afghan family.</i>

1788
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,370
For more, we're joined here

1789
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,360
<i>in our New York studio
by Daniel Ellsberg.</i>

1790
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,290
<i>In terms
of "blood on their hands"...</i>

1791
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,400
<i>I'm sorry to say</i>

1792
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:29,120
<i>a lot of actual blood
has been spilled...</i>

1793
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,540
<i>as opposed to this
hypothetical blood.</i>

1794
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:34,210
<i>This is
all speculative harm...</i>

1795
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:38,300
<i>and what's not being talked
about is the actual harm...</i>

1796
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,300
<i>and that's what has been
exposed through this leak.</i>

1797
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,550
<i>So, I think that's important
for us to think about.</i>

1798
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,070
At least he kept part
of the bargain.

1799
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,720
250,000 diplomatic cables,
right here.

1800
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,100
Amazing.

1801
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,470
So, the bugger came through.

1802
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,740
Nick was right. It's huge.

1803
01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:00,480
It's a window into every
government on the planet.

1804
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,480
Already I've got
a dozen page ones.

1805
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,990
Gaddafi lying to his people,

1806
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:05,990
Putin arming
Georgian separatists.

1807
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:10,320
Damning assessments of leaders
in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia.

1808
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:13,170
Are you still focused
on yesterday's news?

1809
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,590
On the high priest
of truth bragging

1810
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:18,760
about a redaction process
that didn't exist?

1811
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:20,830
I wouldn't call that
yesterday's news.

1812
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,430
Sorry, wasn't he your messiah?

1813
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,090
Yes. Yes.

1814
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,430
Just like the rest of them.
Feet of clay.

1815
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,260
So he's a liar,
a callous little zealot,

1816
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:30,180
just like every
other oddball source.

1817
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:31,430
Mmm.

1818
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:33,600
Seventeen little keystrokes,

1819
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:36,020
and anyone in the world
can read what he publishes.

1820
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:39,190
And now we've given him
a bloody megaphone, they will.

1821
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,270
He's not a source.

1822
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:43,520
He's the head
of a huge media empire

1823
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,700
that's accountable to no one.

1824
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,860
And we put him there.

1825
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,700
What is the purpose
of your trip?

1826
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,670
He ¡s a guest lecturer
at University of Cairo.

1827
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:55,090
What are you lecturing about?

1828
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,090
Petroleum geology.

1829
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,570
<i>We've crossed the border.</i>

1830
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:24,040
Can you put them on?

1831
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,120
Sarah?

1832
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,300
You're safe.

1833
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:39,470
What do we do now?

1834
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:43,140
Where do we go?

1835
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,810
<i>We have tried hard
to make sure...</i>

1836
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:51,400
that this
material does not bring

1837
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,900
innocents to harm.

1838
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:56,480
We're familiar with groups
whose abuses we exposed...

1839
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,830
- Did you reach him?
- No.

1840
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,070
If we both plug in,

1841
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:02,410
we should be able to do it
while he's speaking.

1842
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,080
<i>We have a harm
minimization process.</i>

1843
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,250
<i>We don't do things
in an ad hoc way.</i>

1844
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:11,580
<i>All the material is over
seven months old...</i>

1845
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:14,960
Daniel, we both know he's
never going to step aside.

1846
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,920
He can't be trusted.
We need to shut him down.

1847
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:20,850
If you want to do this,
we have to do it now.

1848
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:29,570
<i>Whose
abuses we exposed...</i>

1849
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:33,130
<i>is attempting to criticize
the messenger, to detract...</i>

1850
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,560
<i>It takes two things
to change the world...</i>

1851
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:52,140
<i>and you'd be surprised how
many people have good ideas.</i>

1852
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:53,350
<i>But...</i>

1853
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:57,060
<i>commitment, true commitment...</i>

1854
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:59,190
<i>it requires sacrifice.</i>

1855
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:02,860
Good journalism
exposes powerful abusers...

1856
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:05,780
so that often leads
to backlashes, but...

1857
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,800
revolution is...

1858
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,580
the struggle
between the past...

1859
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,800
and the future.

1860
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:30,470
And the future has just begun.

1861
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,950
I guess that
Turkmenistan comment

1862
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,920
didn't go over too well
with the Secretary, did it?

1863
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:52,790
Actually,
Berdymukhammedov himself

1864
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,540
called for my early retirement.

1865
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,010
I'm sure he called for
a lot more than that.

1866
01:52:57,030 --> 01:52:58,230
But there's diplomacy for you.

1867
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,670
Well, let's drink to diplomacy.

1868
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:06,260
At least while we still can.

1869
01:53:06,330 --> 01:53:07,630
Okay.

1870
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:22,560
You know, I was...
I was watching him

1871
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,060
give an interview
while I was packing up.

1872
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,740
He was talking
about all the leaks

1873
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,530
he'd put out in the last
six months alone...

1874
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,740
and I started thinking.

1875
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:38,160
Two advanced degrees,
a Fulbright.

1876
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:42,540
Five diplomatic posts,
14 years abroad.

1877
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,300
All those nights,
I stayed up worrying...

1878
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:48,220
if the slightest turn of phrase

1879
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:50,590
would send the whole world
to hell in a hand basket.

1880
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:53,430
And right now,
at this very moment...

1881
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:54,800
I don't know which one of us

1882
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,050
history is gonna judge
more harshly.

1883
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:13,780
Julian!

1884
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:14,900
Contact us online,

1885
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:16,670
I'll have my press person
get back to you.

1886
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:18,110
Thank you.

1887
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,920
That was amazing. Genius.

1888
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,290
Have you seen <i>Time?
Forbes?</i>

1889
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,430
We've got interview requests

1890
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:29,600
- from Larry King, BSkyB...
- Julian.

1891
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:30,620
Julian!

1892
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,590
What is it?

1893
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:42,600
There's something wrong
with the submission platform.

1894
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,800
It's disabled.

1895
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:23,550
Completely.

1896
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,060
No one will be able to submit.

1897
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:24,360
<i>You know, he dyes his hair.</i>

1898
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:29,330
<i>I saw it once.</i>

1899
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:30,410
<i>We were at a conference,</i>

1900
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:32,580
<i>and he went up
to the hotel room.</i>

1901
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:37,710
<i>The cult he was in,
The Family...</i>

1902
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:43,550
<i>they made the kids
dye their hair white.</i>

1903
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:58,060
<i>I guess everyone has secrets.</i>

1904
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:00,570
<i>Scars.</i>

1905
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:05,110
<i>Moments in time
that shape them.</i>

1906
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:09,490
<i>Some we can get past.</i>

1907
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:15,580
Some we can't.

1908
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:20,090
There was a moment
when everything was possible.

1909
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,930
We changed the world.

1910
01:57:25,630 --> 01:57:27,090
He changed the world.

1911
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:31,090
But then he made it
all about him.

1912
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:35,770
It always was.

1913
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:40,520
<i>Only someone so obsessed
with his own secrets...</i>

1914
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:43,100
could have come up with a way
to reveal everyone else's.

1915
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:50,360
You know, there was a time
when British papers...

1916
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,950
couldn't report
on parliamentary debate.

1917
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:57,420
But then a few
very brave men...

1918
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:01,800
started printing pamphlets
and leaking these debates.

1919
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:06,260
And, uh, well,
I believe the men were hanged.

1920
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:10,130
But the public
saw these pamphlets,

1921
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:11,680
and demanded access...

1922
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,430
and the modern
fourth estate was born...

1923
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:17,600
from the passion
and the vision...

1924
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:21,390
of these few brave souls.

1925
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,770
Who were hanged.

1926
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:25,600
Who were hanged.

1927
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:32,410
And now, we find ourselves
in the same position.

1928
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,740
A new information revolution...

1929
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:38,200
infinitely more powerful
than the last.

1930
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:40,120
A fifth estate...

1931
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:43,580
seemingly hell-bent on
destroying its predecessors.

1932
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:45,840
All the old models,
dying faster

1933
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,510
than the new can replace them.

1934
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:50,800
Which is why we need
more brave souls.

1935
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:55,260
You and Julian
have charted a course

1936
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:57,090
through all this chaos...

1937
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:58,640
pointed at the truth.

1938
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:00,140
And yes...

1939
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:03,100
the tyrants of this world
should beware.

1940
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:10,980
<i>Knowing that now,
we have the power</i>

1941
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:14,530
<i>to demand the information
that one day soon...</i>

1942
01:59:14,610 --> 01:59:17,160
will wash them all away.

1943
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:22,490
How's that?

1944
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:27,910
So, where should we start?

1945
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:33,960
Well, most good stories
start at the beginning.

1946
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:25,720
Free Julian Assange!

1947
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,980
Free Julian Assange!

1948
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,350
<i>There is no proof...</i>

1949
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,690
that anyone came to any harm

1950
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:35,610
as a result
of the full disclosure...

1951
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:37,150
of the unredacted documents

1952
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:38,940
published on
the WikiLeaks website.

1953
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:41,650
Not one shred of evidence.

1954
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:46,290
We're taking on large,
powerful groups...

1955
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48,740
with vast and powerful lobbies
to protect them.

1956
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:50,300
So, of course,
we're going to be attacked

1957
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:51,670
in all sorts of manners.

1958
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,800
My goodness.

1959
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:05,850
Well, I know the mainstream
media is biased...

1960
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:07,970
but this is absurd.

1961
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:11,680
These allegations
are without basis...

1962
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:14,890
and their issue
is deeply disturbing.

1963
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,580
As an organization, of course

1964
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:28,000
of course we, uh,
have made mistakes.

1965
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,410
Um...

1966
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:33,080
Uh... There are perhaps
a number of individuals...

1967
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,500
An individual, perhaps,

1968
02:01:35,910 --> 02:01:38,410
that we should not
have employed.

1969
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,590
Um...

1970
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:44,920
That is possibly
the greatest mistake.

1971
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,180
A WikiLeaks movie?

1972
02:01:56,350 --> 02:01:57,730
Which one?

1973
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:00,940
Oh, that one. Mmm.

1974
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:04,990
Well, that one is based on
the two worst books...

1975
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:08,530
full of lies and distortion,
like all bad propaganda.

1976
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:10,950
Look, urn...
A WikiLeaks movie...

1977
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:13,620
It's more like
the "anti-WikiLeaks" movie.

1978
02:02:15,030 --> 02:02:17,960
If you want to know
the truth...

1979
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,620
no one is going
to tell you the truth.

1980
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:23,130
They're only going
to tell you their version.

1981
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:25,760
So, if you want the truth...

1982
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:28,510
you have to seek it out
for yourself.

1983
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:32,390
In fact, that's where
the real power lies...

1984
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:37,220
in your willingness
to look beyond this story...

1985
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:38,900
any story.

1986
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,270
And as long
as you keep searching,

1987
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:43,610
you are dangerous to them.

1988
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:47,610
That's what
they're afraid of. You.

1989
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:50,450
It's all about you.

1990
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:57,790
And a little bit about me, too.
