1
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:06,012
BLACK BREAD

2
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:22,928
Culet.

3
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,328
Culet.

4
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,014
Pitorliua...

5
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,773
Pauleta.

6
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:08,892
Pauleta.

7
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,014
What?

8
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,734
Dionis' wagon fell down
into the woods.

9
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,298
What are you talking about?

10
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:16,808
And Culet?

11
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,174
They're on the ground.
They look dead.

12
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,698
- Where are they?
- Just around the Pallera.

13
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:35,367
As you sow, so shall you reap.

14
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,529
- How are you?
- OK.

15
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:43,930
We're going straight home.
Your mother's very worried.

16
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,607
Farriol, wait!

17
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,328
Here!
Stop by the garrison tomorrow.

18
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,377
The Mayor and Judge will take
the boy's statement.

19
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,457
He's been very good.

20
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,498
Paperwork, you know?

21
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,215
Today there's no end to paperwork.

22
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,695
- You shouldn't have stopped!
- But dad...

23
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:15,056
Don't dad me, you'll see
the headaches we have now.

24
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,807
Go on in!

25
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,093
So? What happened?

26
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:26,249
They say a landslide accident.

27
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,933
My God! What a sad death!

28
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,728
And poor Culet didn't have time
to even start his life.

29
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,015
The woods are cursed since the war.

30
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,248
Florència!

31
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,136
Don't scare the boy even more!

32
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,212
Dad, should I put the clothespin on?

33
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,932
- Dad?
- What?

34
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,897
The clothespin. They always
knock the food over.

35
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:08,778
You notice everything, don't you?
Put it on.

36
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:14,728
And Culet and his dad's birds?
Who'll take care of them now?

37
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,211
Pauleta, I guess.
Problem's who'll take care of her.

38
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,693
Andreu!

39
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,377
Andreu!
Come on, you'll be late for school.

40
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,098
We have to go see
the Mayor and Capt. Clotet.

41
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,137
I can't wait.
I should be at the factory already.

42
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,048
- Who signs, him or me?
- Both.

43
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:35,856
Andreu.

44
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,894
This is everything you told us.

45
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:51,930
You can write your own name,
can't you?

46
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,737
If you're such a good student...

47
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:54,815
Sign it.

48
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,767
Poor woman.

49
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,648
Andreu,

50
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:22,218
here it says the boy wasn't dead
when you found him.

51
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,369
- He didn't have time to say anything?
- No.

52
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,337
A name, anything...
It could be important to us.

53
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:32,132
Well... he said something weird.
I think it was Pitorliua.

54
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,409
Does that mean anything to you?

55
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,332
There's a bird named that.
A little, tame one.

56
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,338
Yes, yes, but besides the bird?

57
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:47,770
They say in the Baumes cave
there's like a ghost called Pitorliua.

58
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,488
Take the boy to the other room,
give him a coffee, he's been good.

59
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,048
And you wait, we're not done yet.

60
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,410
Though it looks like an accident,
it's hard to believe.

61
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,056
We think someone
pushed Dionis Segui off.

62
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,255
Children's fantasies apart,

63
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:08,172
all that makes us think about
this Pitorliua story.

64
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,609
Don't worry about a thing, kid.

65
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,292
What did you say?

66
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,770
Don't worry about a thing.

67
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,575
We'll bring you some breakfast.

68
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,418
The white bread's not for you.
Take the other one.

69
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,729
You and Dionis were inseparable.

70
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,730
Too much business together:

71
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,696
Birds, trade unions,

72
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,930
dirty work
that's better not to discuss...

73
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,091
I'd be careful if I was you.

74
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,250
Too many people have it in for you.

75
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:04,897
Done lecturing me?

76
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:09,453
I just want to warn you. There are
still a lot of reds to purge.

77
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,814
You wouldn't want
to wind up like Dionis.

78
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,136
Not for you,

79
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,972
for the kids and widows
who never meddled.

80
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:20,888
Andreu.

81
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,892
Andreu, come on,
leave it, we're going.

82
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:27,655
You're different from your dad.
I hope you pick a better path.

83
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,458
He'll do what we want.
You have no damn say in it!

84
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:32,371
Florència didn't choose so well.

85
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,736
- So she should've chosen you!
- She'd be much better off.

86
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:42,692
Those clowns, a bunch of losers!

87
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,334
What are you doing?

88
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,812
Packing, can't you see?

89
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,298
Where are you going?

90
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,653
To France.

91
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:14,053
The Captain suspects
Dionis Segui was killed.

92
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,652
What? Who was it?

93
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,650
I don't know.
Could've been anyone.

94
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:21,209
Even one of those Town Hall traitors.
I'm afraid they'll go after me.

95
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,493
But why?

96
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,934
Because Dionis and I
represented too much.

97
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,215
You shouldn't have gotten
into politics.

98
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,937
I was defending my ideas.

99
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,691
And look where you ideas got us.

100
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,372
Me, I work like crazy.

101
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,053
Look what you got with
your bird mania and ideals.

102
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:38,689
All I've ever done was so
you'd never lack anything at home.

103
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,372
And now too.

104
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,009
I'll talk to the owners
of mother's farm

105
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,657
to see if they can help you.

106
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:48,653
Those Manubens'! They ruin
everything they touch in town.

107
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,256
Are you forgetting Pitorliua's mishap?

108
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:52,568
Goddamn it!

109
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,574
With you always reminding me?
You can't get it out of your head.

110
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:59,173
I'm sick of hearing it.
I'm leaving and that's it!

111
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,654
If you walk out that door

112
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,457
I'll kill all your birds.

113
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,133
Because I won't go up
to give them anything.

114
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:11,289
No water, no millet,
no seeds, nothing!

115
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,690
Just one dead bird,
and pay close attention, Florència,

116
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:17,691
just one and you'll remember it
the rest of your life.

117
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:18,928
Get out!

118
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,895
I'm sorry. Don't take it like that.

119
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,048
I said get out!

120
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,213
Can't you see I love you
more than anything?

121
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,494
Come on,

122
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,049
don't make it harder for me.

123
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:13,613
There's a bundle in the wagon
with everything you might need.

124
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,375
I've got lots of work
and can't be there for you.

125
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,850
You'll have fun at grandma's.

126
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,817
Playing with Quirze and Nuria.
She's here visiting.

127
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:23,934
Nuria who?

128
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,169
Uncle Fonso's girl. He went to France.

129
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,136
Careful on the stairs, Andreu.

130
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:00,648
Go sit down.

131
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,653
Wait for me here.

132
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:07,454
I'll be right back.

133
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:43,295
Here, that's for grandma
to make herself a suit.

134
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,331
Be good at your new school
and study a lot.

135
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,649
So you don't end up
in some shitty factory.

136
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,536
It's enough for me to be in one.

137
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,850
I'll go see you every Sunday.

138
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,453
I can't more often,
it's many hours away.

139
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,336
Your father must leave,

140
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,737
but he loves us.

141
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:06,538
Don't forget that.

142
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:10,098
You have to be a man now and bear it.

143
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,376
What will you do in France?

144
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,210
I don't know.
Go see uncle Fonso and then we'll see.

145
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,088
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

146
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,416
Then you'll come with me.

147
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,810
Father, does Pitorliua
from the cave really exist?

148
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:28,458
That's just silly!

149
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,577
Couldn't that be who killed
Culet and his father?

150
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,378
How can you be so grown up
and believe in ghosts?

151
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,497
And the screams factory workers hear
from the Baumes cave?

152
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,934
Nonsense! Don't try to learn so much

153
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,931
or you'll go blind like
that king in grandma's tale.

154
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:45,493
Take the reins.

155
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,128
Look, Andreu,
Pitorliua was a guy

156
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,177
who hid in the Baumes
for political reasons.

157
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,216
No ghosts, no stories. OK?

158
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,778
Yes, father.

159
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,374
- Can I have your glasses?
- No, glasses aren't to play with.

160
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:06,693
OK, here.

161
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,778
You just be well.

162
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:16,010
That's the only obligation
kids should have.

163
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,888
The kids are coming down for school.
They shouldn't see you.

164
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,732
Here, take this too.
Come, let's go, mother.

165
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,613
Oh, Cio! First Bernat's death,

166
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:37,328
then your husband;
Fonso lost up in France

167
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,808
and now Farriol,
the only son I had left...

168
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,571
Farriol, what a scatterbrain!

169
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,094
We need men, not more
children and headaches.

170
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:45,737
Leave your brother alone.

171
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,937
Andreu is ours now and
he'll stay here as long as he needs.

172
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,455
Florència has to work all day
and hold the fort.

173
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,257
No, it's like this!

174
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,296
Quirze, say hi to your cousin.

175
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,291
- Hey. How are you?
- OK.

176
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,734
And don't you remember Nuria?

177
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,697
How could he if Fonso
spent half his life in Manlleu?

178
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,975
Nuria came to live here recently.

179
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,776
Andreu's going to stay with us
a while.

180
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,771
And a hello for aunt Enriqueta?

181
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,929
Come here, handsome!

182
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,175
- You're so grown-up!
- You coming with us?

183
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:32,012
Not yet.
We'll go talk to the teacher tomorrow.

184
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,090
Come on, off to school.

185
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,573
- What's wrong with her hand?
- None of your business.

186
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:40,694
Cio.

187
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:45,097
A bomb exploded when she was playing
by the river and she lost her fingers.

188
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:49,491
But don't mention it to her.
She doesn't like to talk about it.

189
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:50,894
I'll be late today.

190
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:54,608
All of Vic teamed up
to come have their clothes made.

191
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,290
Now go say goodbye to your father.

192
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,331
Look, Andreu,

193
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,609
I won't be around now
and people are evil.

194
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,975
Always hold your head high.

195
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,176
And if they say ugly things about
me or our family,

196
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,738
pay them no mind.

197
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,256
Everything I'm doing is for you.

198
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,853
What's all the nodding mean?

199
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,931
It means me too, father.

200
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,330
PORTRAIT OF A BIRD KILLER

201
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:55,808
"Victory is never neutral

202
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,298
or undeserved.

203
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,415
Victory

204
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,129
is never neutral

205
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,213
or undeserved.

206
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,810
You must avoid the defeated...

207
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,769
You must avoid

208
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,168
the defeated..."

209
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,488
Shit!

210
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:19,493
"...like you would the plague".

211
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,258
You dropped this.

212
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,971
"...like you would

213
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:27,892
the plague".

214
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,972
"Vae Victis", which means
"Woe betide the defeated!"

215
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:36,648
The defeated have no right
to even a small footnote

216
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:38,730
in the great book of history,

217
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:42,854
because history is always
written by winners.

218
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:49,814
But I am always in favor
of victors because

219
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,969
they're more worthy.
Anyone know why?

220
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,250
Me.

221
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,247
They're braver.

222
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:58,456
No.
Because they've known how to win.

223
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:04,489
And only those who know
how to win can win.

224
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:08,857
Like the rich are more worthy
than the poor. Anyone know why?

225
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:10,812
Their money.

226
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,291
Almost, you're close.

227
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,776
What a shitty teacher,
on and on about the same thing.

228
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:20,136
Mr. Madern is a drunk,
but he's right about what he says.

229
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,609
About what, smarty-pants?
That you're dumber than a fly?

230
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:27,249
That you should avoid
louses like you like the plague.

231
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:31,093
Then go! Or are you scared to be
in the woods alone, you little rat?

232
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:35,252
You're the rats!
You reds will end up like Pitorliua,

233
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,694
hiding in a cave like "monsters".

234
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,895
He isn't a monster.
My father told me.

235
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:41,651
He doesn't know anything.

236
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,731
He became a monster
from being in the cave so long.

237
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:47,208
You can still see him
run naked in the woods.

238
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,414
That's nonsense!

239
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,411
- What kind of monster is he?
- A weird bird.

240
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,695
Well, half human, half bird,

241
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:56,657
but one of those birds
you can't tell what it is

242
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:57,569
until they mate.

243
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,933
You're dumber than dumb.

244
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,897
Sure, I'm not as well trained as you.

245
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:03,414
What do you mean?

246
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,296
Teacher pays more attention to you.

247
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,211
You're worse than the flu!

248
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,928
The teacher who teaches me
tra-la-la-la- la-la-lee,

249
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,738
The teacher who teaches me
is in love with me.

250
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,532
You're a filthy pig and a liar!

251
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:25,014
You're all useless! Like dogs!
With no mother or father.

252
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:28,933
Nuria, you'll wind up running around
the woods naked like a whore!

253
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,488
Like your aunt Enriqueta
and her bicycle,

254
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:36,129
who said to hell with mourning
to do it in the bushes with Guards.

255
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,336
Whores, you're all just a bunch
of shameless whores!

256
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,048
Good morning!

257
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:28,335
Hurry up, the sun's up already

258
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,251
and if you're late, I get scolded.

259
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:32,978
What the hell? So early?

260
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:34,458
You never let me sleep.

261
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,178
And you? I can't sleep
with you snoring all day.

262
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:38,374
What?

263
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:48,568
What are you doing, you filthy girl?
Get inside!

264
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,217
You're going to be late!

265
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:55,577
- What were you doing on the balcony?
- Nothing.

266
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,456
You were half naked.

267
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:01,248
- You spying on me or what?
- No, but I've seen you other times.

268
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,294
What are you doing?

269
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:04,687
My chilblains hurt.

270
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,248
- That's disgusting!
- Shut up, half-wit!

271
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,336
Get out of here!

272
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,932
Hey, aren't you afraid they'll tell
your dad when he gets back?

273
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:18,809
- They can't tell him anything.
- Oh, no? Why not?

274
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:22,016
Because they can't. My father's dead.

275
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,216
Dead, dead?

276
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,451
Dead and gone.

277
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,257
Isn't he in France?

278
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,057
It's what they want us to believe

279
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,687
and I pretend I don't know, but I do.

280
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:41,536
- Swear you won't tell anyone this.
- I swear.

281
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,128
Father hung himself from a rafter.

282
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:55,494
He destroyed the town's bridges
so the Fascists couldn't arrive

283
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:59,256
and when he was done,
he went home and hung himself.

284
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,970
I found him in the morning, alone,

285
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,736
and I was so sad
I didn't know what to do.

286
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,373
I took off my clothes,
went out on the balcony

287
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,417
and later I felt...
my head was cleared.

288
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:21,331
That's why now,
when I miss him, I do the same.

289
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,572
- And your mother?
- She hid it from me.

290
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:28,651
Then she left the village
with a married man

291
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:31,811
and left me behind with a relative
who was never there,

292
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,574
until grandma said enough
and took me with her to the farm.

293
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,136
Now you know,

294
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,252
open your mouth and
I'll cut off your balls. Got it?

295
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,177
I trust you.

296
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:49,017
You're different.

297
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,254
- What do you mean you love me?
- I've fallen in love with you.

298
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,250
What am I supposed to say?

299
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,813
Come and live with me.

300
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,647
Gudiol, I can't live with you.
I'm needed here.

301
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:39,857
Don't you see? I have to feed the
animals, go to Vic every day to sew.

302
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,532
Find someone who loves you.

303
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,807
I have money.

304
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,854
Stuff your money up your ass.

305
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,690
- Enriqueta!
- What?

306
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,293
Don't treat Gudiol that way.
He's a good man.

307
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:04,578
- Then you keep him.
- I don't need him.

308
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:05,569
Me neither.

309
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:07,889
I go blind sewing to make a day's pay.

310
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:08,934
That's no problem.

311
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,089
The whole town talking about you is.

312
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,215
They love to badmouth dressmakers.

313
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,893
Whatever!
It will stop once you get married.

314
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,414
- To that hunchbacked old man?
- He's right for you.

315
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,491
You need a man and
he needs a nanny for his kids.

316
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:31,978
What are you staring at?

317
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,495
Grab that basket
and come with me.

318
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:43,129
Don't touch those blankets!
Don't. They're infected!

319
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,767
You want to get sick
like the consumptives?

320
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,452
Get out of here.

321
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,376
You have to wash, boil
and scrub them well,

322
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,450
even then they still smell of death.

323
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,768
Ave Maria!

324
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,373
These damn monks!

325
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:00,770
The sick will die, but they put
the blankets to good use.

326
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:05,768
Good morning!

327
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:22,017
Leave the blankets here
and wait in the kitchen.

328
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:52,932
Hey, you!

329
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,532
Give me a couple cookies.

330
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:56,655
- These?
- Yes, of course.

331
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:02,770
Don't come too close,
I'm sick and it's contagious.

332
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,811
Leave them here.

333
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:09,693
Thank you.

334
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:13,537
You live at the farm near here?

335
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:18,968
Bring me some food one day, OK?
When I'm in the meadow.

336
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,689
Not here.
These monks starve us to death.

337
00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:24,849
Why did you do that the other day?

338
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:25,769
That what?

339
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,167
This...

340
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,772
Ah, this...

341
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,532
I was moving my wings.

342
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,251
Don't you feel sometimes,

343
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,047
when you're bored and tired,

344
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:40,175
like throwing it all into the fire?

345
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,698
No...

346
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,897
Well, maybe.

347
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:45,970
Well it happens to me

348
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:50,132
and when it does, I grow wings
here from my back,

349
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,334
they start flapping
and I begin to fly.

350
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:56,934
Up and up,
as if I had a growing fever,

351
00:29:57,247 --> 00:29:59,773
like I could erase everything...

352
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,777
And you know what I think?

353
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,332
What? What do you think?

354
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,694
That right then if I wanted to,

355
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,531
if I said yes,

356
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,657
with a good flap of my wings
I'd go on to another world.

357
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,494
Andreu!

358
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,532
She's looking for you.

359
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,695
Andreu! Come, let's go!

360
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:42,453
...when that deformed creature
was well inside the castle,

361
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,292
where it was dark, dark, dark,

362
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:49,418
suddenly a white owl flew past him.

363
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:53,288
And he also heard people coming
with bells and rattles

364
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:55,575
and carbide lamps.

365
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:59,409
And he was scared 'cause he knew
they were coming to kill him.

366
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,774
- Are you listening to me or not?
- Yes.

367
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,692
- So why did they want to kill him?
- He was a monster.

368
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:09,010
- Because he was different.
- And he'd gobbled up a girl, grandma.

369
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,171
That too, but especially
because he was different.

370
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,455
Now listen closely,

371
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:19,093
we're all going to go to bed now

372
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:22,137
because the ghosts will be out soon.

373
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,053
You see?

374
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,131
This house is full of them.

375
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:32,493
Those are just stories.

376
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,615
Right, stories... They're everywhere.

377
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,734
And they see and hear everything.

378
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:40,811
Especially at night,
when they move around the most.

379
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,055
Nothing, a copper pot fell.

380
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,452
...and I saw him come out, all black,

381
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:20,338
going upstairs, to the loft.

382
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,613
Did grandma see him?

383
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,895
No. She said what's he look like
and laughed.

384
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,095
Sure, silly.
Can't you see it was a dream?

385
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,978
- Quirze, go get water from the well.
- No it wasn't!

386
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:30,936
Merce! Merce, come on out!

387
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:32,976
Mother, they're calling for you.

388
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,452
Come on, come on.

389
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:49,856
It's to the loft.
Go up one night and you'll see.

390
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,930
Andreu, Andreu!

391
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:54,854
Jan will come get you on Sunday.

392
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:57,328
- Why?
- To go to town to see your mom.

393
00:33:57,487 --> 00:34:00,377
Won't know where you're from
if you never see your home.

394
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:02,894
Hurry, you'll be late to school.

395
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,613
- And that?
- For a snack.

396
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,138
- Let's go?
- No, you wait for Quirze.

397
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:56,097
Why do you give them food?

398
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,691
Can't you see they're rotting?

399
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:01,328
- What do you mean?
- Rotting means...

400
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,089
rotting, like apples or pears,

401
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,496
that look good outside
but are full of shit inside.

402
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:11,730
Their lungs are dirty.
From eating little and working lots.

403
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:15,096
You think any of them ever lifted
a sack of potatoes?

404
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:18,057
- Then how'd they get sick?
- They're infected by vice.

405
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:21,575
They look like angels, but I bet
they go bed hopping at night.

406
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:22,694
What for?

407
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:26,169
Are you daft or just pretending?
Because they're horny...

408
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,814
Some die from stroking
their things so much.

409
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,173
But they're all men!

410
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:34,173
So? There are men who turn around
and play the part of women.

411
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:37,137
Like Pitorliua.
Or you've never heard of fags?

412
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:40,457
I heard they choke
coughing up blood.

413
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:43,053
And 'cause they dry out
from coming so much.

414
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,608
They have enough problems
with their disease!

415
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:47,849
You might end up like
those puny guys

416
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,374
with so much studying and nonsense.

417
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:04,167
So? Is that hot chocolate good?

418
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:05,249
Yes.

419
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:09,018
You write like a notary.

420
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,376
You like coming up here
to see all this splendor.

421
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,609
You're not like Quirze and Nuria.

422
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,690
We don't have these things at home.

423
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:20,614
The owners used to spend
summers here, but now...

424
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:23,213
now nothing, they have so many houses.

425
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:27,813
And if you could see their bathrooms,
you'd love that.

426
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:30,857
They even have this porcelain thing

427
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:32,532
they call a bidet

428
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:35,213
they use just to wash their ass.

429
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:37,848
What are you doing?

430
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:41,375
I told you not to do homework here,
you draw on the table!

431
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:44,770
And careful with those plates.
The Manubens might ask for them.

432
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:48,818
They hardly even come for
some of the crops and livestock.

433
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,288
Time for dinner, the kids are waiting.

434
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:07,213
- Andreu, come down here.
- Coming!

435
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,369
Come on, Andreu, hurry up.

436
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,689
Jan will be here soon
with the wagon.

437
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:15,896
Don't hold him up,
it'll be dark when you get back.

438
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:19,608
I have to go to the Town Hall.
To take some of your dad's papers.

439
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,771
That insignificant Mayor
has feathers for brains

440
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:25,897
- and one idea: To never lose.
- Weren't you marrying him?

441
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:30,934
I had many suitors.
I was quite pretty back then.

442
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:34,897
After the first time I saw your dad,
there were no more.

443
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:38,130
I would have followed him
to the end of the world.

444
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:39,652
Here, for you,

445
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,617
- to keep you company.
- Why'd he have to run away?

446
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:47,089
Pure envy! Too good, too handsome,

447
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:48,453
too much politics.

448
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:50,850
- And this angel?
- Hey! Don't touch that!

449
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,575
They're mine and not your business.

450
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:54,933
What did dad do?

451
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:58,057
Nothing,
he didn't want to be a farmer...

452
00:37:58,207 --> 00:38:01,848
He wanted to learn at night school,
like you want to be a doctor.

453
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:04,487
His teacher was
the most revolutionary of all.

454
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:08,129
He joined a left-wing party and
the other shopkeepers boycotted him.

455
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,573
What's boycott?

456
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:10,853
Mess things up for us.

457
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:13,738
So much so we had to close
the butcher's shop.

458
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:17,016
To make money
he teamed up with Dionis,

459
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,647
then his bird mania,
the chirping contests

460
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:22,287
all that nonsense.
I'm going to lie down.

461
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:26,768
The night shift starts today
and I'm exhausted before starting.

462
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:42,168
Andreu?

463
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:45,173
Andreu! What are you doing up here?

464
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:47,409
I thought you were a ghost.

465
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,935
- How did you get in?
- The key was in the lock.

466
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,217
Come here. Up you go.

467
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,768
Wow, how you've grown!

468
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,055
- Are you OK?
- I am, father.

469
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,976
What are you doing here?

470
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:02,857
I had to come back.

471
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:07,173
I got sick when I was in the mountains
and... anyway.

472
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:09,098
Can't you see a doctor?

473
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,968
Doctors and medicines
can't cure my illness.

474
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:13,654
What is it?

475
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:15,893
Bring me that cage.

476
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:20,334
The red one.

477
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,693
Look.

478
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,378
See this chaffinch?

479
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,498
They're the jumpiest birds of all,
they always want to escape.

480
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:46,011
He'd destroy his beak and wings
in a cage not made of small sticks.

481
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,452
It's the same with me.

482
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,813
You understand?

483
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:55,096
Birds are made
to be free and fly, Andreu.

484
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,568
Like angels, they have no borders.

485
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:00,816
We can cage them,
but can't change the way they are.

486
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:02,890
People's ideals,

487
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:04,856
the things one loves,

488
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:06,816
the places we want to reach,

489
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,851
that's how we are too.

490
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:12,694
But if they don't come true,
people can become very evil.

491
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:16,294
That's why we must fight for ideals.
Each for his own.

492
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:20,051
Listen, the owl...

493
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,492
Enough! Grab that sack and help me.

494
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:29,688
How's the new school?
I hear you're doing well.

495
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,976
- I don't like that school.
- No? Why not?

496
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:35,971
They're always talking about
who won and who lost,

497
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,573
and they point at us
like we're the plague.

498
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:42,368
Feel no shame! Hold your head high,
we never hurt anyone.

499
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,292
They're the agitators
but they'll change... right?

500
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:48,414
- Didn't you want to be a doctor?
- Yes, father.

501
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:52,453
For a family of farmers like ours,
studying is a luxury,

502
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,929
but we'll do what we must for you.
Time heals everything.

503
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:59,978
That's what grandma says. But I think
the more it goes on, the worse.

504
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:04,293
You might be right,
maybe time should go in reverse.

505
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:07,849
You see?

506
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,451
The owl announced it.

507
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:14,089
They're giving the last rites
to someone dying at the convent.

508
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:16,215
Some animals sniff out death.

509
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:18,608
Others' or their own...

510
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,252
Let's go or it'll get light out.

511
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:22,169
Can I come back?

512
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,933
When you want.
Don't tell your cousins or anyone.

513
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,937
- What's the 1st condition of a secret?
- No one can know it.

514
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,693
Did you go up to see the ghost?

515
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,655
No need to keep it quiet.
I know your dad's hiding there.

516
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:51,288
It'll be the same as with mine.
Adults hide everything with lies.

517
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:52,778
Hey, hey, come here.

518
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,090
See? I told you so.

519
00:43:58,487 --> 00:44:00,854
Bet she's with a Civil Guard.

520
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:10,617
- Let's see what auntie's doing.
- Leave her alone!

521
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,976
- I wanna see what they're up to.
- What do you think? Fucking!

522
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:16,453
Fucking?

523
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:21,016
You know what fucking is?

524
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,817
Of course I know what it is!

525
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,812
You don't know anything.

526
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,212
Lie down.

527
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:23,212
Dead hand, dead hand,

528
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,732
knock on this door.

529
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:30,053
Teacher says it's the nightingale's
nest or the cuckoo's lair.

530
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,096
Mr. Madern?

531
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,856
So it's true what Roviretes says?

532
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:38,737
Mr. Madern is a pig.

533
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:41,333
He's the only person
who's treated me well.

534
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:43,296
That's what you say!

535
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:44,733
How long's it been?

536
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,057
Since Corpus Christi.

537
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,854
The boys at school,
since I got naked on balconies,

538
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:53,817
gave me stickers to show
them my privates.

539
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:55,898
He found out,

540
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,732
but instead of scolding me,
he gave me money.

541
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:00,888
Doesn't it bother you?

542
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:03,937
Me? I couldn't care less.

543
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:08,411
He says I'm like a tree or a stone
because I don't ask for anything...

544
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:09,978
Then why do you do it?

545
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:11,811
Because I like it.

546
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:15,296
But... it's different with you,

547
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:18,694
I do it with you because I love you.

548
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,172
- You're such a slut.
- And you're a coward like your dad!

549
00:46:24,327 --> 00:46:26,933
Leave me alone! Cripple! Rotten hand!

550
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:31,329
Here. Kiss it.

551
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:03,016
Pitorliua.

552
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,132
- What are you doing here so late?
- Shut it, Cio!

553
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:32,654
- Good thing I got here before them.
- Before who?

554
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,775
- The Guards want to search the house.
- So?

555
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:37,407
To look for Farriol.
They know he's not in France.

556
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,410
They'll blame him for Segui's death.

557
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,808
- Are the keys here?
- Yes, up on the shelf.

558
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:44,891
He should leave the farm,
and the sooner the better.

559
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:48,254
What are you doing?

560
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,978
Come on,
go wake up your aunt Enriqueta.

561
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:54,578
Go! And don't go outside.

562
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,376
- What's wrong?
- Where's auntie?

563
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,688
I don't know.

564
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:06,138
Farriol, hurry.
The Guards will be here any second.

565
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:07,937
- Go now while it's dark.
- Where?

566
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:11,330
Try to make it to Gudiol's farm,
and after that we'll see.

567
00:48:24,207 --> 00:48:26,653
They're coming for you.
A Guard just told me.

568
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:28,491
- Where are they?
- At the fence.

569
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:30,729
Don't go out.
Stay up in the loft.

570
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:32,537
It's the safest place, son.

571
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:33,688
They're here.

572
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,449
And you get back in your damn room!

573
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,047
- What's all this?
- Statutory search.

574
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:48,177
Our house and stables are open to all.
Come when you like.

575
00:48:48,327 --> 00:48:49,772
You heard her. Carry on!

576
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,576
Now?

577
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,173
The sooner the better.
To put an end to the reports.

578
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:54,055
What reports?

579
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:57,131
With this family's record,
we're sure to find hidden things.

580
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:59,858
- We don't have anything.
- We'll find something.

581
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:03,090
- What are they looking for?
- Hell if I know! Inexistent things.

582
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:06,488
They must think we sell
black market flour

583
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:10,493
or smuggle tobacco from Andorra.
Rumors from people who hate us.

584
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:13,055
The loft is locked.

585
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:15,727
- Where are the keys?
- The owners have them.

586
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,292
Break the door down.

587
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,888
Harder, dammit, harder!
Come on!

588
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,688
Can I kiss my son goodbye?

589
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:48,809
Tell your mom not to be so stubborn
and talk to the Manubens.

590
00:51:14,165 --> 00:51:16,040
Here, drink this.

591
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,858
We can't stop this.
We can't save him.

592
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:21,294
Yes, Florència.
We can lodge appeals,

593
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:23,256
talk to lawyers, the Town Hall,

594
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:26,217
the Union, the "Movimiento".
Move heaven and Earth.

595
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:29,177
They made all this up,
he was too important to pardon.

596
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:29,930
Florència.

597
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:33,775
What did your father whisper to you?

598
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,897
For you not to be stubborn
and talk to the Manubens.

599
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:39,891
- We won't get anywhere with them.
- Don't be like that.

600
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,414
I prefer not to.
There's something about them.

601
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,932
These are men's affairs...

602
00:51:44,087 --> 00:51:46,567
You want me to go running
to kiss their ass?

603
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:51,177
If they can help your husband,
it's more than worth it.

604
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:09,094
We'll be OK, Andreu.
Not everything can turn out so wrong.

605
00:52:09,247 --> 00:52:13,138
I'm cast from a different mold. Your
dad will get ill in that hellhole.

606
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:16,814
- Here, put these socks on.
- I don't want to. They have holes.

607
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,811
They want our heads bowed? Fine.
Now they'll see we're poor.

608
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,731
There's no need to dress the part.

609
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,255
It's not enough to be poor,
we have to prove it. Come on.

610
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:27,496
Father wouldn't like this.

611
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:30,537
He already had his way.
Look what it got him.

612
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:35,369
Mrs. Manubens is very rich

613
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:38,696
and she likes children because
she doesn't have any.

614
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:42,090
So be nice and make
a good impression, OK?

615
00:52:42,247 --> 00:52:44,932
Now make that pitiful face
I showed you.

616
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,728
Come on!

617
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:53,973
Get up, get up!

618
00:52:58,087 --> 00:52:59,452
You can go.

619
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:01,937
How are you, Florència?

620
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:04,215
You can't even imagine, ma'am.

621
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,290
I feel so bad for you.

622
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,569
This must be Andreu...

623
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,693
He looks so much like Farriol!

624
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:17,253
The same eyes... identical.

625
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,370
- This boy needs a good steak.
- You're right, ma'am!

626
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,131
Poor thing, it's not his fault.

627
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,574
I don't know if I can be
both mother and father.

628
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,298
A child needs a father nearby
to grow up honest.

629
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:32,257
You're influential,
the authorities listen to you.

630
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:36,298
Look, Florència, let's get this
straight. What did your husband do?

631
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,893
Nothing, ma'am!
He wouldn't hurt a fly!

632
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:42,768
He had to do something bad if the
prosecutor wants the death penalty.

633
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:47,572
They say he killed Dionis Segui, but
that's the shopkeepers who hate him,

634
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:50,890
they can't forgive him for
being the competition or his politics.

635
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:53,015
What's wrong with this boy?

636
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,248
I have to pee.

637
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,534
Come. Come with me.

638
00:53:59,687 --> 00:54:03,578
When you're done go to the kitchen.
The maid will fix you a snack.

639
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,207
Girl! Take him to the bathroom.

640
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:08,893
Then fix him some
hot chocolate, OK, son?

641
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:12,847
You come with me. We shouldn't
talk about this in front of him.

642
00:54:24,207 --> 00:54:27,177
Sit down. It's a snack for you.

643
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:37,577
Florència, here.

644
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,617
Take this to the Mayor
and he'll know what to do.

645
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:42,496
Thank you, ma'am.

646
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:47,371
I don't know how to repay you.
Farriol is a good man.

647
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:48,688
Don't start again.

648
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:52,488
I'll do what's necessary,
but you know what I think.

649
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:54,934
Dionis Segui was bad company.

650
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:57,211
And forgive me for saying so, but

651
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,211
you loving your man
doesn't mean he's innocent.

652
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:14,849
I have a letter from Mrs. Manubens.

653
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:16,418
Come on in.

654
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:18,488
Come on, get up.

655
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:19,889
Leave the boy.

656
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:22,770
It's better if we talk alone.

657
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:24,812
Wait for me here.

658
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:13,734
You should have chosen better,
Florència.

659
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,849
Now I have better livestock.

660
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:23,930
I'm sick of my mom dragging me around
to make people feel sorry.

661
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,135
Is it true your dad killed that guy?

662
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:28,858
Lies! Pitorliua killed him. I know it.

663
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,169
- That can't be.
- Why can't it?

664
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:34,217
Mr. Madern says Pitorliua
has been dead for years.

665
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,449
And the screams from Baumes cave?

666
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:40,407
Yarns! Pitorliua is dead and buried
in your village cemetery.

667
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,538
Aren't the festivities
in your village on Sunday?

668
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,654
Yes.

669
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:47,731
So I'll come with you
when you go see your mother.

670
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:16,014
Who's that?

671
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:19,535
Dionis Segui's wife.
Poor thing's not all here.

672
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:21,576
Look, it's that one!

673
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,251
How do you know it is?

674
00:59:26,407 --> 00:59:29,650
Mr. Madern told me it's
the only one with an archangel.

675
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,332
A silver one at that.

676
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:34,934
My mother has a photo
of a boy with that name.

677
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:36,771
And the flowers are fresh.

678
00:59:36,927 --> 00:59:38,531
Your mother puts them there.

679
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:40,177
My mother? Why?

680
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:43,573
Must be to help him purge his sins.

681
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,694
What sins?

682
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:49,853
Impure sins against nature.

683
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,973
Poor thing...

684
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:55,414
If they hadn't damaged him...

685
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,367
What happened to him?

686
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:01,130
You know what a castrate is?

687
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:04,655
- A fag that doesn't have any balls.
- Exactly!

688
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:08,653
They have no use for them so they
rip them off. Like they did to him.

689
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:10,412
But why?

690
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:14,094
He played the dyke for
Manubens' brother

691
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:16,056
and stayed with him in Baumes...

692
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:18,096
until they taught him
a lesson one day.

693
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,090
They just wanted to haze him,

694
01:00:20,247 --> 01:00:23,456
but it seems someone brought
pig castration cord

695
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:25,974
and they tied it to his privates.

696
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:29,210
To frighten him, for laughs...

697
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,616
but things started to warm up

698
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,451
and with a strong tug...

699
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:36,012
they tore them right off.

700
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:37,849
Who was it?

701
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:41,693
A bunch of village men.
But the real work was done by two.

702
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,327
- Who were they?
- Two rats.

703
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:47,857
One is buried here back over there

704
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:49,372
and the other...

705
01:00:52,367 --> 01:00:54,688
He'll also be here soon.

706
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:57,252
That's a lie.

707
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:00,172
My father says Pitorliua's alive,
hiding in a cave.

708
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:02,011
There you have it.

709
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,532
Don't believe
what your father tells you.

710
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,373
You'll open your eyes some day.

711
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:16,212
All that's left in the cave
is Pitorliua's blood

712
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:18,096
and his cursed shadow.

713
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:22,608
To hell with the story of
the bird from the cave.

714
01:01:29,767 --> 01:01:30,814
Where's Nuria?

715
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:33,652
In church.
She wanted to see the festivities.

716
01:01:33,807 --> 01:01:37,129
Come on in and eat something.
I brought some figs.

717
01:01:39,527 --> 01:01:42,292
Why do you have a photo of Pitorliua?

718
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:47,088
They show you that at school?
To pry into other's things?

719
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:48,698
You never tell me anything!

720
01:01:48,847 --> 01:01:51,578
You want to know my things
but I can't know yours!

721
01:01:54,727 --> 01:01:56,297
Look, Andreu...

722
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,178
I have photos of Marcel Sauri because

723
01:01:59,327 --> 01:02:01,170
he gave them to me when he left town.

724
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:04,729
- Why? Was he your boyfriend?
- No, please...

725
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:08,888
Marcel was...
the nicest person I ever met...

726
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,818
and cheerful!

727
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,968
We loved each other like brother
and sister, but he was too delicate.

728
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:18,017
He wasn't cut out for this
and they made his life hell.

729
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,054
By doing what?

730
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:21,653
They kicked him out of town...
that's it!

731
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:24,573
All those things
are over and behind us.

732
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:28,856
But you know something?

733
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,529
Now I'm proud I kept his portraits.

734
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:38,056
It's not wrong to have photos of
a friend who gave you flowers,

735
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:42,052
who treated you like a princess.

736
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,775
It's comforting to me

737
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,533
when I think about how
the others treated him.

738
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:51,849
You think nobody else ever entered it?

739
01:02:52,007 --> 01:02:53,088
Yeah, right!

740
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:56,094
I bet there are still
blood-stained rocks.

741
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:57,169
And knives.

742
01:02:57,327 --> 01:02:59,455
Don't be stupid.
They did it with a cord.

743
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:01,371
And if they killed him later?

744
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,451
He didn't die here.
He ran away from town.

745
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:10,209
This is where they castrated him.

746
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:14,053
It's incredible
he could live without...

747
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,813
Or that you've lived
in the country all your life!

748
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,731
What about pigs and horses?

749
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:20,651
Sure, but a person...

750
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:22,332
Come on, light it.

751
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:58,055
Look.

752
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:00,258
It was here.

753
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:04,532
Pitorliua...

754
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:08,614
Look,

755
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,691
Dionis, Pauleta's husband.

756
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,293
Look, the other starts with an F...

757
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:17,815
Francesc or Ferran or...

758
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,092
Or Farriol.

759
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:30,771
It's dark out.
We should go...

760
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:33,568
Nuria?

761
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:36,093
Nuria.

762
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,056
Look at the faggot!

763
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:28,094
Faggot!

764
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:13,054
Andreu!

765
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:14,934
Andreu.

766
01:07:16,647 --> 01:07:19,776
Where are you going like that?
You'll catch cold.

767
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:24,014
Now what's wrong? What's wrong?

768
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:27,771
Go get dressed.
We have a permit to see your father.

769
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:30,294
- I won't go to the prison.
- What's wrong with you?

770
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:33,178
- I know what he did to Pitorliua.
- What do you know?

771
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:35,534
Don't pretend.
He castrated him like a pig.

772
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:37,894
- Says who?
- Pauleta was at the cemetery...

773
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:41,449
You think you should listen to her?
Don't you see she's nuts?

774
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,770
- And only wants to hurt people?
- Don't lie to me, dammit!

775
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:46,733
Come here.

776
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:54,252
Look, Andreu. These years
were hard for your father.

777
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:57,974
We were living on my pay only
and almost lost the house.

778
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:00,812
- Dionis offered him a job.
- And that has to do with?

779
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:02,890
It was to scare him into leaving.

780
01:08:03,047 --> 01:08:05,812
- Mrs. Manubens would pay them.
- To castrate him?

781
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:09,176
No, just for the hazing with grease.

782
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:12,173
Thing is, Dionis was a brute and,

783
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:14,614
God forgive me
for badmouthing the dead,

784
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:16,576
he was heartless too.

785
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,411
But I swear your father
had nothing to do

786
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:22,649
with how it all ended.

787
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:28,057
Don't judge him.

788
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:31,572
He's suffered so much
seeing me work like a slave,

789
01:08:31,727 --> 01:08:33,377
hearing you want to be a doctor

790
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:36,417
and not being able
to give us anything.

791
01:08:38,607 --> 01:08:41,008
Maybe your father made mistakes,

792
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:43,932
but he did it for us,
especially for you.

793
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:47,212
If you fail him now,
he'll go to pieces.

794
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:18,975
Look, they're coming out!

795
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:33,889
Andreu, up you go!

796
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:41,574
- Is that him? You see him?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

797
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:43,727
Come!

798
01:10:14,727 --> 01:10:15,694
How are you?

799
01:10:15,847 --> 01:10:16,894
OK.

800
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:21,010
- Has your wound healed?
- What?

801
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:23,216
Your wound. Is it healed?

802
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,290
Yes, yes, it's healed.

803
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:29,814
I brought you clothes and food.
I gave it to a guard.

804
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:34,491
Everyone sends their love. They're
fattening a pig for when you get out.

805
01:10:37,088 --> 01:10:39,853
No, Florència.
It's all over.

806
01:10:41,047 --> 01:10:42,378
You hold on.

807
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:45,174
It will be OK, you'll see.

808
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,498
How's the boy doing?

809
01:10:49,648 --> 01:10:52,970
Fine, he doesn't miss a day of school
and he's doing well.

810
01:10:57,488 --> 01:10:58,694
Give your father a kiss.

811
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:07,376
Give this to your mother.
Tell her to get it to the Manubens.

812
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:12,810
Lady!

813
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:14,651
I'll kick that kid back in place!

814
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:15,774
Andreu, come!

815
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,171
What did your father give you?

816
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:21,658
Hide it, hide it.

817
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:45,018
Mrs. Manubens is very bossy,
right, grandma?

818
01:12:45,488 --> 01:12:48,014
With all that money she can be.

819
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:50,295
But she looks sad, doesn't she?

820
01:12:50,448 --> 01:12:52,416
I don't think so.

821
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:56,049
Poor people. They lost a son
not even 1 and never had more.

822
01:12:56,887 --> 01:12:59,936
And this is Pere, her brother.

823
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:03,057
They made him marry
a woman he didn't love

824
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:05,335
and sent him to France.

825
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:07,098
May he be in Heaven.

826
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:09,934
He could have had everything,
you see.

827
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:12,613
Whereas we, who have nothing...

828
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:15,294
well, we're still alive.

829
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,893
- Can I go?
- Wait, we haven't finished.

830
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:34,733
When you're finished,
come to my room.

831
01:13:34,887 --> 01:13:36,696
- OK.
- I'll be waiting.

832
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,453
Hey, Andreu!

833
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:49,494
I'd like to know
why all the portraits!

834
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:53,090
They're only good
to use in obituaries.

835
01:13:54,887 --> 01:13:55,649
Come in.

836
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:01,449
Sit, sit.

837
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:09,494
I didn't know your father was in jail.
The Manubens told me.

838
01:14:10,048 --> 01:14:12,619
They asked about you, your ability,

839
01:14:12,768 --> 01:14:15,738
your knowledge, your behavior.

840
01:14:15,888 --> 01:14:19,734
And to ask you if you want them
to take care of your studies,

841
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:22,095
if you'd like to get a degree.

842
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:25,057
It seems your father's case
isn't going too well.

843
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:27,494
My mother said the lawyer will fix it.

844
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:30,737
Sure, you never know
until the last minute, right?

845
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:33,538
But they say
that if it doesn't go well,

846
01:14:34,048 --> 01:14:36,972
your mother could get along better.

847
01:14:37,488 --> 01:14:40,856
I mean... without you...
What do you think?

848
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,255
I don't know.

849
01:14:43,408 --> 01:14:45,809
Look, the Manubens
don't have children,

850
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:47,857
and want to adopt someone.

851
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,210
I already have parents.

852
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:54,849
Andreu, you have to be sure
about this.

853
01:14:55,008 --> 01:14:56,658
You can continue studying,

854
01:14:56,807 --> 01:15:00,653
or stay here working in the fields
or a factory. That's all there is.

855
01:15:02,407 --> 01:15:03,329
Wait.

856
01:15:05,607 --> 01:15:08,008
- What?
- They've come for Andreu.

857
01:15:15,568 --> 01:15:17,935
That's a very important decision.

858
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:21,658
Think it over,
it's a good opportunity.

859
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:26,412
Know that I'm telling you this
because I love you and your cousins.

860
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,376
Well don't love us so much.

861
01:15:30,368 --> 01:15:33,053
Go on, they're waiting for you.

862
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:36,210
Andreu.

863
01:15:37,728 --> 01:15:40,618
Look, I lost my parents
when I was very young,

864
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:44,495
so I had to do what I'm doing
and not what I wanted.

865
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,571
If I'd had an opportunity like you,
I'd have taken it.

866
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,734
You're you and I'm me.

867
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:05,093
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

868
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:06,972
Andreu, let's go.

869
01:16:07,527 --> 01:16:09,768
- Your mom's waiting for you.
- What's wrong?

870
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:11,736
She got a permit to go to the jail.

871
01:16:11,888 --> 01:16:13,697
But we went last week.

872
01:16:13,847 --> 01:16:15,611
They're taking him to Barcelona.

873
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:19,453
Oh, bad sign. It's what they do
with those who don't return.

874
01:16:24,768 --> 01:16:26,338
Are you stupid or what?

875
01:17:44,128 --> 01:17:45,175
Come here.

876
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,817
Come, sit, I'm tired
of sitting all day.

877
01:17:49,968 --> 01:17:52,096
They asked me if you want a priest.

878
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:56,047
No priests.
They're all leeches and traitors.

879
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:58,017
- Hey, Andreu?
- Yes.

880
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:05,733
Know what?

881
01:18:06,727 --> 01:18:09,492
I heard that owl singing
last night,

882
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:12,815
and knew he was singing for me.

883
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,291
But I'm not sad,

884
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:25,973
so you shouldn't be either.

885
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:32,415
We won't see each other again,
will we?

886
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:40,014
No.

887
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:47,175
Now, Andreu, listen closely.

888
01:18:47,328 --> 01:18:48,978
We don't have much time.

889
01:18:50,848 --> 01:18:53,374
The war has hurt us all badly.

890
01:18:54,087 --> 01:18:57,375
But the worst part of war
isn't that people go hungry

891
01:18:57,527 --> 01:19:00,974
or have to escape,
or even that they kill us.

892
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:05,456
The worst part of war is
they make us forget our ideals,

893
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,417
because without ideals
a person is nothing.

894
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:13,179
So to me the most important thing
is what's here

895
01:19:17,408 --> 01:19:18,694
and in here.

896
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:23,409
You must protect that like a treasure.

897
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:25,415
Will you do that?

898
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:35,736
And now go,

899
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:39,773
your mom and I have a lot to talk
about before our time runs out.

900
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:44,972
I brought you something.

901
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:00,937
To keep you company.

902
01:20:02,727 --> 01:20:04,809
Not much time left for company.

903
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:08,210
You'd better take him home with you.

904
01:20:10,448 --> 01:20:11,734
Look after him, OK?

905
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:18,570
And your mother too,

906
01:20:20,327 --> 01:20:22,250
take good care of her.

907
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:41,174
You have to mourn for a year.

908
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:43,689
Your mother, the rest of her life.

909
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,419
Poor thing...

910
01:22:10,528 --> 01:22:12,656
Executed like a criminal.

911
01:22:19,527 --> 01:22:22,770
They didn't let me see him
even in his last moment.

912
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:25,016
Quirze, sit over there.

913
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:50,011
Don't shed a single tear.

914
01:22:52,487 --> 01:22:54,012
No need to make them feel sorry.

915
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,578
I'm in charge of the funeral.

916
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:57,537
We had no time to make cards.

917
01:22:57,687 --> 01:23:01,533
Next Sunday we'll hand them out
if they let us do the burial.

918
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,098
Say hello to Macia.

919
01:23:03,248 --> 01:23:06,138
He's letting us bury
your father in his niche.

920
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:08,495
Or we'd bury him
in the ground like a dog.

921
01:23:08,647 --> 01:23:10,456
You come with me.

922
01:23:17,447 --> 01:23:19,449
What do I tell that poor woman?

923
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:22,292
Tell her what I told you before.

924
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,776
Damn priest!

925
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:38,177
- Why isn't he starting?
- I don't know.

926
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:41,777
What's wrong? We're all here.

927
01:23:41,927 --> 01:23:45,773
The priest says there's no sense
to a funeral for a man

928
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:49,010
who cursed priests to the end.

929
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:53,293
- We can pray together if we want.
- To hell with praying!

930
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:55,415
Andreu, we're leaving.

931
01:23:58,608 --> 01:24:00,929
120 kilos of fat and nothing more!

932
01:24:01,088 --> 01:24:04,092
No room for what you call
Christian charity.

933
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,375
Don't listen to her.
She's crazy.

934
01:24:09,488 --> 01:24:11,217
- Come back!
- I want them to hear me!

935
01:24:11,367 --> 01:24:12,448
Florència. Not now!

936
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,498
- Leave it be!
- I can't. Don't you see I can't?

937
01:24:27,968 --> 01:24:31,529
So he's dead! You're happy now.

938
01:24:32,487 --> 01:24:34,728
Is his death good for anything?

939
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:38,216
Is not burying him properly
good for anything?

940
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,136
I'll tell you what it's good for.

941
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:42,859
To trample those who
won't bow down to you.

942
01:24:43,008 --> 01:24:44,089
Don't make me talk.

943
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:47,012
You should kill me too, next to him.

944
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:48,732
Aren't I red enough?

945
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,855
Don't mind her.
She's lost her head.

946
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:53,614
I'm aware of her condition.
We'll talk later.

947
01:24:53,767 --> 01:24:55,929
You ruined my life.
You hear me?

948
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:58,977
We've done too much for you.
All of you.

949
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,778
Sure! Black bread and red sugar,

950
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:04,931
with the ration book
and waiting hours in line!

951
01:25:05,088 --> 01:25:06,897
That's all you've given us.

952
01:25:07,047 --> 01:25:09,812
Bread with no soul or virtue; dead,

953
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:13,575
like all of you, because of
this goddamn war that's killed us all.

954
01:25:13,728 --> 01:25:17,130
All who deserved it.

955
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:29,774
Mother, let's go.

956
01:25:32,448 --> 01:25:35,213
When you were in
your mother's womb,

957
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:39,693
they should have thrown her
in the pigs' trough to be eaten alive.

958
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:42,932
Let's go, we have
no more business here.

959
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:46,450
Let's go.

960
01:26:19,168 --> 01:26:20,693
Pauleta, why are you here?

961
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:22,657
To offer my condolences.

962
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:25,287
Andreu, go put the cages on the porch.

963
01:26:25,728 --> 01:26:27,014
Let him stay.

964
01:26:27,168 --> 01:26:31,218
Young people need to get
used to hearing serious words.

965
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:39,652
14 times the judge called me
to ask if I distrusted someone,

966
01:26:39,808 --> 01:26:42,891
if Dionis' death had to do
with Pitorliua...

967
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:44,970
You have to bring all that up again?

968
01:26:45,127 --> 01:26:47,778
See how they're all dead?
Pitorliua, our husbands. All!

969
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:51,613
All except Pere Manubens' wife,
who's very much alive.

970
01:26:51,927 --> 01:26:53,850
What are you getting at, Pauleta?

971
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:55,850
After Pitorliua's misfortune,

972
01:26:56,327 --> 01:26:59,376
Pere went to France,
but they made him marry before.

973
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:02,976
When he died last year,
his sister, Mrs. Manubens,

974
01:27:03,127 --> 01:27:06,176
told Dionis to steal her brother's
marriage certificate

975
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,807
to nullify the marriage
and keep the entire fortune.

976
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:11,573
Why don't you tell the judge
and not me?

977
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:15,210
You can be on the Manubens'
side, but never against them.

978
01:27:16,487 --> 01:27:18,455
I told Dionis that often,

979
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,497
but him,
being so stubborn,

980
01:27:20,647 --> 01:27:23,457
he blackmailed Mrs. Manubens
once he had the papers.

981
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:26,292
And the damn bitch got rid of him.

982
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:28,817
Like she did with your man.

983
01:27:30,967 --> 01:27:33,049
Farriol was executed for being red.

984
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:37,053
Farriol was garroted because
he had no red left in him.

985
01:27:37,527 --> 01:27:39,256
He was like my man:

986
01:27:39,408 --> 01:27:42,139
A lout, a traitor
and a hired killer...

987
01:27:42,288 --> 01:27:43,733
but worse,

988
01:27:44,087 --> 01:27:46,977
because Dionis, despite what he was,

989
01:27:47,127 --> 01:27:49,368
could never have killed a boy.

990
01:27:49,968 --> 01:27:51,015
What do you mean?

991
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:52,579
Shall I spell it out for you?

992
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:55,697
Tell you who they paid
this time to finish it all off?

993
01:27:55,847 --> 01:27:57,053
That I won't tolerate!

994
01:27:57,207 --> 01:27:59,858
Yes you will tolerate it!
I owe it to my son!

995
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:08,173
Get out!

996
01:28:11,047 --> 01:28:14,733
Your father,
always talking about ideals.

997
01:28:14,887 --> 01:28:16,810
Look what shitty ideals he had.

998
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:17,968
I said get out!

999
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:28,771
What I don't understand
is Farriol's silence.

1000
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,818
With nothing to lose,
it's like he let himself be killed.

1001
01:28:32,448 --> 01:28:36,294
Pauleta, you gave us your condolences.
You can leave.

1002
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,499
And don't ever come back.

1003
01:28:40,647 --> 01:28:43,537
Good night!
Now go to sleep if you can.

1004
01:28:57,728 --> 01:29:00,254
How could father kill Culet?

1005
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:02,057
Forgive us, Andreu.

1006
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,528
You have to forgive
your father and I.

1007
01:29:06,848 --> 01:29:08,850
We didn't know how to do a better job.

1008
01:29:09,088 --> 01:29:10,374
Don't touch me!

1009
01:30:53,937 --> 01:30:56,229
No more ghosts, huh?

1010
01:31:03,687 --> 01:31:05,815
Why'd you take off
the mourning bracelet?

1011
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:10,609
I won't have anything to do
with my father. Or my mother.

1012
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,929
Aunt Cio wants me to work
at the factory.

1013
01:31:18,087 --> 01:31:20,010
The Manubens want
to take me to Igualada.

1014
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:21,894
They want to hook you.

1015
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:27,656
Listen, Andreu, why don't we
run away together?

1016
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:30,216
Us two? Where?

1017
01:31:30,368 --> 01:31:32,052
To Vic, on the train.

1018
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,893
Nobody knows us there.
What do you think?

1019
01:31:36,768 --> 01:31:38,418
I've thought about it a lot.

1020
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,968
We'll set fires in town
at siesta time.

1021
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:44,609
When they're all running
to put them out, we'll escape.

1022
01:31:47,687 --> 01:31:49,177
Let's make a pact?

1023
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:53,450
Deal.

1024
01:31:54,727 --> 01:31:57,571
But before, we'll cast a spell.

1025
01:31:58,368 --> 01:32:01,258
And here's the rabbit.
Made with onions as you like it.

1026
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,775
- Now that is a sin!
- You deserve the best.

1027
01:32:03,927 --> 01:32:05,531
You're so understanding with us.

1028
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:06,574
Forget it...

1029
01:32:06,727 --> 01:32:09,776
Come in. The Manubens
were just talking about you.

1030
01:32:09,927 --> 01:32:13,409
How you and your mother
suffered with your father's death.

1031
01:32:13,568 --> 01:32:16,048
But that's all over, right son?

1032
01:32:18,368 --> 01:32:20,735
Here, this is for you.

1033
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:22,375
Chocolate.

1034
01:32:23,648 --> 01:32:24,649
Thank you.

1035
01:32:25,088 --> 01:32:27,853
We think you could
help out your mother.

1036
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,337
Another mouth at home
is always a burden,

1037
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,055
especially with no wages.

1038
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:38,008
Would you like to start high
school next year in Igualada?

1039
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,851
Later you could get a degree.

1040
01:32:40,007 --> 01:32:42,931
Your mother would have
no expenses or headaches.

1041
01:32:43,088 --> 01:32:46,774
And you'd have space to study
and everything at home.

1042
01:32:47,447 --> 01:32:48,972
For God's sake,
say something.

1043
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:54,094
Leave him, Cio, it's logical
he has to think about it.

1044
01:32:54,688 --> 01:32:57,089
It's good he hasn't had
his wings clipped.

1045
01:32:57,248 --> 01:33:00,013
It will be like now,
Andreu, but different.

1046
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,329
You and your mother think about it.

1047
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:04,489
We've already discussed it.

1048
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,375
Come here.

1049
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:11,294
She'll do what you say,
whatever's best for you.

1050
01:33:23,127 --> 01:33:25,528
We'll sign him up
so he won't lose his place

1051
01:33:26,128 --> 01:33:27,937
and later he'll say yes.

1052
01:33:29,648 --> 01:33:30,854
What are you doing?

1053
01:33:31,328 --> 01:33:32,978
I buried two serins.

1054
01:33:33,127 --> 01:33:35,175
- You buried them alive?
- So what?

1055
01:33:35,328 --> 01:33:38,138
You kill them too.
You think we didn't know?

1056
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:42,809
Look.

1057
01:33:43,968 --> 01:33:46,175
And what did you bring of yours?

1058
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:53,208
What's so funny?

1059
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:57,133
- This shitty globe.
- What should they have put there?

1060
01:33:57,728 --> 01:34:01,369
Don't you like birds?
Then lots of birds.

1061
01:34:01,607 --> 01:34:03,848
Dead, stuffed.

1062
01:34:04,007 --> 01:34:07,728
That would be your portrait:
portrait of a bird killer.

1063
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:13,610
When the bomb blew off my hand,

1064
01:34:13,767 --> 01:34:17,567
the gang gathered all the
little pieces in a shoe box

1065
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:19,972
and one day I went to get it.

1066
01:34:21,527 --> 01:34:24,053
Dead hand, dead hand,

1067
01:34:24,327 --> 01:34:25,772
knock on this door.

1068
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:27,338
Leave me alone.

1069
01:34:27,687 --> 01:34:29,610
There's just no kidding with you.

1070
01:34:29,927 --> 01:34:31,452
You know what?

1071
01:34:32,128 --> 01:34:35,018
I'd like to set a bird on fire
one day.

1072
01:34:35,248 --> 01:34:37,933
A ball of fire flying in the air,

1073
01:34:38,247 --> 01:34:41,171
squawking,
until it falls to the ground.

1074
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:44,418
A shower of ashes is all
that would be left of it.

1075
01:34:48,567 --> 01:34:50,217
Did you ever want to die?

1076
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:54,177
Well I'll never die completely;

1077
01:34:54,448 --> 01:34:56,610
I'll die little by little,

1078
01:34:56,807 --> 01:34:59,094
first one hand, then the other...

1079
01:34:59,248 --> 01:35:01,569
Remember I'm already a little buried.

1080
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:04,971
And when I'm really dead,
to hell with the living!

1081
01:35:05,888 --> 01:35:08,255
Dead hand, dead hand,

1082
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:11,697
Now I can't ever die.

1083
01:35:11,968 --> 01:35:13,208
You're crazy!

1084
01:35:29,207 --> 01:35:30,208
What's that?

1085
01:35:30,368 --> 01:35:33,372
Chocolate. For you.
The owners gave it to me.

1086
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:34,414
What do they want?

1087
01:35:35,568 --> 01:35:38,174
To go with them to
continue my education.

1088
01:35:38,688 --> 01:35:41,737
- That's what you wanted.
- I want to get my own life together.

1089
01:35:41,888 --> 01:35:43,299
What are you going to do?

1090
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:47,532
Run away! With my cousin. But first
we're going to burn everything.

1091
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:49,652
You be careful, Andreu!

1092
01:35:49,808 --> 01:35:52,971
That girl's mad at the world.
And she's evil-minded.

1093
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:57,257
What should I do? Go to the factory?
With the owners?

1094
01:35:57,607 --> 01:35:59,291
You fly too low, Andreu.

1095
01:35:59,447 --> 01:36:01,973
So low it seems
like you're just walking.

1096
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:05,053
Fly high and don't let
anyone catch you.

1097
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:07,210
And how can I do that?

1098
01:36:07,367 --> 01:36:10,689
Thinking. With your head.
And choosing what you like most.

1099
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:14,586
Then come with me.

1100
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,254
I can't.

1101
01:36:17,568 --> 01:36:18,979
Why can't you?

1102
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:23,610
Because one of these days
I'll spread my wings,

1103
01:36:23,767 --> 01:36:26,247
spread them wide, completely.

1104
01:36:31,607 --> 01:36:33,018
Don't come any closer.

1105
01:36:54,487 --> 01:36:56,296
- Where were you?
- Around.

1106
01:36:56,688 --> 01:36:58,497
Your mother's waiting for you.

1107
01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:01,014
She came for the thing
with the Manubens.

1108
01:37:13,008 --> 01:37:14,658
Andreu, come in!

1109
01:37:14,807 --> 01:37:15,854
It all went well.

1110
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:19,018
The owners and your mother agree.
Right, Florència?

1111
01:37:19,168 --> 01:37:22,092
Of course, poor thing can barely
stand up straight.

1112
01:37:22,247 --> 01:37:24,614
We've discussed it.
What's so bad about it?

1113
01:37:25,408 --> 01:37:28,298
All your life moaning about
the owners' conditions,

1114
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:29,813
now you agree to everything.

1115
01:37:29,968 --> 01:37:32,050
With him it's different.
An education.

1116
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:34,575
They'll take him away
like he was livestock!

1117
01:37:34,928 --> 01:37:36,089
What should we do?

1118
01:37:36,247 --> 01:37:38,454
Get out of this land that's not ours.

1119
01:37:38,608 --> 01:37:41,817
- So now we have to leave?
- Shut up or you'll get slapped.

1120
01:37:42,768 --> 01:37:44,179
Look, Enriqueta,

1121
01:37:44,327 --> 01:37:47,854
in what stuffy apt. In what
lousy town would we all fit,

1122
01:37:48,007 --> 01:37:50,533
animals, old folks,
aunts, uncles, etc?

1123
01:37:50,688 --> 01:37:53,294
Here even those who
had nothing have eaten.

1124
01:37:53,447 --> 01:37:55,097
I've worked like mad to help.

1125
01:37:55,248 --> 01:37:58,570
When it suited you, with
the schedule and life you wanted.

1126
01:37:58,727 --> 01:38:00,491
We should have bridled you before!

1127
01:38:00,647 --> 01:38:02,331
Do what you will with the boy,

1128
01:38:02,487 --> 01:38:05,809
I won't be at your orders waiting
for a groom on a plate.

1129
01:38:05,968 --> 01:38:08,892
I'll pick him and if he knows
how to raise my skirt, better.

1130
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:12,017
Stop it!
We're here to talk about Andreu.

1131
01:38:13,808 --> 01:38:15,378
What do you say, mother?

1132
01:38:16,007 --> 01:38:20,296
I can't understand anyone leaving
his village and family,

1133
01:38:20,528 --> 01:38:22,132
but if it's for his own good...

1134
01:38:22,288 --> 01:38:23,699
What about me?

1135
01:38:24,487 --> 01:38:26,888
No one's going to ask me?

1136
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,729
Wasn't I supposed to choose?

1137
01:38:32,688 --> 01:38:34,099
Andreu's right.

1138
01:38:35,248 --> 01:38:36,898
Say what you think, son.

1139
01:38:37,047 --> 01:38:40,847
I don't want to live like this
or be pointed at or more lies.

1140
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,289
I don't want to be like you.

1141
01:38:44,327 --> 01:38:45,613
Come with me.

1142
01:38:51,168 --> 01:38:54,570
We'll do what you want, son,
but I want to be sure

1143
01:38:54,727 --> 01:38:58,129
you realize the people
who want to be your parents are...

1144
01:38:58,288 --> 01:38:59,858
- Do you realize?
- Yes.

1145
01:39:00,007 --> 01:39:02,897
I know it's their fault father's dead.

1146
01:39:11,008 --> 01:39:12,658
Andreu is leaving.

1147
01:39:13,008 --> 01:39:14,851
His father would have wanted it.

1148
01:39:15,008 --> 01:39:17,773
No, mother.
It's what I want.

1149
01:39:23,168 --> 01:39:25,489
You traitor! You promised me.

1150
01:39:26,247 --> 01:39:27,976
How can you leave me alone?

1151
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,813
If I can leave my mother,
why wouldn't I leave you?

1152
01:39:47,168 --> 01:39:48,579
Put that in here.

1153
01:39:50,808 --> 01:39:52,173
So, ready to go?

1154
01:39:53,688 --> 01:39:57,056
If you forgot something,
we'll stop back to get it.

1155
01:39:57,888 --> 01:40:00,494
Now go say goodbye to your family.

1156
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:16,336
...Polyphemus in "The Odyssey"
represents what is monstrous

1157
01:40:16,487 --> 01:40:19,855
because it only has
one eye and is a giant.

1158
01:40:20,007 --> 01:40:22,214
Also, and this is important,

1159
01:40:22,727 --> 01:40:26,254
because its human nature
was corrupted

1160
01:40:26,407 --> 01:40:28,535
until becoming a being

1161
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:31,611
of a nature different
from the one it had

1162
01:40:31,768 --> 01:40:33,338
or that was hidden within...

1163
01:40:34,087 --> 01:40:34,690
Yes?

1164
01:40:34,848 --> 01:40:36,418
Visit for Andres Manubens.

1165
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,210
You, face the wall!

1166
01:41:21,607 --> 01:41:24,053
How are you? So, studying a lot?

1167
01:41:24,207 --> 01:41:26,175
- Do they treat you OK?
- Yes, very well.

1168
01:41:26,328 --> 01:41:28,137
I want no complaints about you.

1169
01:41:28,288 --> 01:41:31,371
Show them we taught you well,
you have good manners.

1170
01:41:32,327 --> 01:41:33,897
You can sit, mother.

1171
01:41:35,887 --> 01:41:39,733
I brought you sausage
and everything you like.

1172
01:41:39,887 --> 01:41:42,015
I had to change shifts at the factory,

1173
01:41:42,168 --> 01:41:44,535
change trains, take 2 buses.
You have no idea.

1174
01:41:44,687 --> 01:41:47,054
If it's so hard, don't come anymore.

1175
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:50,937
That's not why I said it, silly.

1176
01:41:54,168 --> 01:41:56,170
You feel that's the way to treat me?

1177
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:01,697
You know, Andreu?

1178
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:04,939
I wish things
had gone differently too.

1179
01:42:05,088 --> 01:42:08,809
I swear I've worked myself
to the bone.

1180
01:42:09,807 --> 01:42:13,254
I've done nothing but
work and work for you

1181
01:42:13,408 --> 01:42:15,456
for your father... for everyone.

1182
01:42:18,328 --> 01:42:20,410
And I will till the day I die...

1183
01:42:21,447 --> 01:42:23,734
I'll cover my own face
with the sheet

1184
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:26,413
just so I won't have
to trouble anyone.

1185
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:33,210
Your dad would be so happy
to see you here, so many books.

1186
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:34,858
Forget about father.

1187
01:42:44,487 --> 01:42:46,410
I have to get back to class.

1188
01:43:05,607 --> 01:43:06,813
You like being here?

1189
01:43:08,608 --> 01:43:10,770
Yes. I like it a lot.

1190
01:43:11,808 --> 01:43:14,937
I want you to know
you're here thanks to him.

1191
01:43:15,488 --> 01:43:18,970
Remember the letter he gave you
in prison for the Manubens?

1192
01:43:19,727 --> 01:43:23,652
It said he wouldn't report them if
they gave you everything you need.

1193
01:43:24,568 --> 01:43:25,933
You understand?

1194
01:43:27,288 --> 01:43:30,371
He let himself be killed
so you could be here.

1195
01:43:33,447 --> 01:43:36,053
I've forgiven your father.

1196
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:39,734
Maybe you should
forgive him too.

1197
01:44:26,168 --> 01:44:27,772
- Hey, Andreu!
- What?

1198
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,339
Who was that weird woman?

1199
01:44:29,487 --> 01:44:32,377
Someone from my town
with a package for me.
