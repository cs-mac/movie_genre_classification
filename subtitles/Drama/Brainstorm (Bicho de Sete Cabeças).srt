1
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,419
Planning a vacation, Mr. Sullivan?

2
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:40,956
No.

3
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,957
No, just.. just some
reading to pass the time.

4
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,471
Step ahead, Mr. Sullivan.

5
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:57,226
You're expected in Room 102.
Down the hall and to the right.

6
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,144
Thank you.

7
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:18,372
- What is your name?
- Um.. Morgan Sullivan.

8
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:25,129
- Where were you born?
- Madison, Wisconsin.

9
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:30,092
- Are you a spy?
- No.

10
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,094
Are you an undercover operative
for Sunways Systems?

11
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,262
No.

12
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,055
Were you paid by Sunways Systems

13
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,100
to steal data from Digicorp Technologies?

14
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:40,310
No.

15
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,356
Have you ever worked at any capacity
at Sunways Systems?

16
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:46,525
No.

17
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,944
This is a technology firm, Mr. Sullivan.

18
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:52,864
If we choose to employ you
as an agent of Digicorp,

19
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,950
you will spy on other corporations,

20
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,118
inform us of their business plans,

21
00:02:57,119 --> 00:03:00,497
research programs,
and counter-intelligence operations.

22
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,710
Thus far, your determination
has been very impressive.

23
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,840
Well, if there is anything more
I can tell you about myself,

24
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:13,635
anything that has not already
been checked by Digicorp.

25
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,014
Your personal records are fine.
You've passed our neuro-graph five times.

26
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:19,475
I'll take the test again
if you'd like me to.

27
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,185
You've been married four years.

28
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,395
You live in a respectable neighbourhood.

29
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,506
You've always had stable jobs.

30
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,775
You have an excellent credit history.

31
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,903
No drug habits. No drinking problems.

32
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,030
- You don't smoke?
- No.

33
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:35,908
No other vices to speak of?

34
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:39,870
Is there anything else
we should know about you?

35
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,001
Well, it..

36
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,249
It might have taken me

37
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,001
quite a while to get to
this point, Mr. Finster,

38
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:52,633
but now that I'm here,
I'm going to make the most of it.

39
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,098
This is who I am

40
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:04,353
and this is what I want to do.

41
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:14,279
The stakes in this line of work
are very high.

42
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,280
Yes, I understand.

43
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,783
It will be like nothing
you've ever done before.

44
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,410
Oh, I'm prepared for that.

45
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:22,161
You will be sent to conventions
across the country.

46
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,247
You will record the speeches.

47
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:25,832
That's been made very clear.

48
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,835
You'll have to deceive other people
about what you do for a living.

49
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,839
- Yes.
- Even your own wife.

50
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:33,841
Yes.

51
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,093
You don't mind lying to your wife?

52
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:40,389
No.

53
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,144
No, I don't mind.

54
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:52,151
That was a good one.
Move on ahead to the next station.

55
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,826
- Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hello.

56
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:04,412
Keep it out of view until the
convention speeches actually start.

57
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,622
Press the back notch.

58
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,082
You see the flash?
It's now on.

59
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,085
Press again.
It's now off.

60
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,836
Easy, isn't it?

61
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:14,088
And the transmissions are really clear?

62
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,174
Within fifty yards.

63
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,341
Just keep it up front for good reception.

64
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,969
Where do the signals go?

65
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,514
Up to our satellite systems,
then back down to our data banks.

66
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,934
I guess the speeches
must be pretty important.

67
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,605
The speeches are not your concern,
Mr. Sullivan.

68
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,064
Just do your job.

69
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,359
Follow our instructions, nothing else.
Do you understand?

70
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,695
Yes, Mr. Finster.

71
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,489
Ready!

72
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,170
- Jack Thursby?
- That's what you'll be called from now on.

73
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,131
As far as Digicorp is concerned,
Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist.

74
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,510
We've never met him. We never will.

75
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:03,972
- What's he like?
- Pardon?

76
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,477
What's his personality?

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,107
He's whoever you want him to be.

78
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:33,228
Buffalo? Why do they need you
to go all the way to Buffalo?

79
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,697
They want me to tutor them

80
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:38,983
on that spreadsheet software
I was using at my last job.

81
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,527
And you'll be paid freelance for this?

82
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:44,073
Sure. Independent contract.

83
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:50,913
You know, if things work out,
there could be more trips down the road.

84
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,291
I thought we agreed
you weren't going back to work yet.

85
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,877
Not until that position
at my father's firm opened up.

86
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,671
I can do this in the meantime, can't I?

87
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,382
I really need you at
home right now, Morgan,

88
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,176
with me being so busy
with the Williams case.

89
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:09,723
It's only temporary, honey.
I won't be gone for long.

90
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,165
Hello.

91
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:39,293
<i>After the convention, you will confirm the
transmission on your returning flight.</i>

92
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,379
Yes.

93
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,922
<i>Do you remember
the location of the briefcase?</i>

94
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,048
Uh, yes.

95
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,884
<i>Good luck, Mr. Thursby.
We're counting on you.</i>

96
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,344
Thank you.

97
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,469
I left it in the stall.

98
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,464
Something to drink, sir?

99
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,637
I'll have a ginger ale.

100
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:20,547
Actually, I'll have a scotch.

101
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,248
- Scotch?
- Mhm.

102
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,025
Single malt.

103
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,822
- On the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,501
Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. Thursby.

105
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:39,551
- And it's vitamin enriched.
- Really? Mr..

106
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:46,732
- Fred Garfield.
- Hi. Hi. Jack Thursby.

107
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:50,027
Fairway Fragrances.
Where are they located exactly?

108
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:53,447
Uh, Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma.

109
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,575
You don't say?
I've got family from Tulsa.

110
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:57,979
You don't have much of an accent.

111
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:02,373
- I didn't grow up there.
- Oh, where did you grow up?

112
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,088
- I said, where'd you grow up?
- South Pacific.

113
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:12,925
- I'm sorry, where?
- The South Pacific Islands.

114
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:17,846
The Tuamotu Archipelago.
French Polynesia. Tahiti. Papeete.

115
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,391
Wow. That's pretty unusual.

116
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:24,478
Yeah, I plan to go back there someday,
when I retire.

117
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:26,021
Water, sir?

118
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:32,945
- Thanks.
- Well, see you around, Jack.

119
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,282
Sure thing, Fred.

120
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,579
<i>The conference room will
be open in five minutes.</i>

121
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,631
Good morning, everyone.

122
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:56,218
My name is Robert Tuttle.
I'll be your first speaker.

123
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,554
I will first discuss shaving
cream distribution outlets

124
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,139
in North American markets.

125
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,767
Let me begin by acknowledging
what has become axiomatic

126
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,146
in the field of shaving
cream distribution.

127
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,272
Mainly that shaving cream,

128
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:12,984
indeed almost all
personal hygiene products for men,

129
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:16,447
are what we call fashion resistant.

130
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:19,449
The overwhelming majority
of shaving cream users

131
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,410
will adopt a brand and remain loyal to it.

132
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:23,078
What is especially interesting to note,

133
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,164
is the difference in methods
used to penetrate that market.

134
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,667
Because these two methods employed
by the respective companies

135
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,422
really illustrates the essential
strategic choice that faces..

136
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,368
- The Mediterranean.
- Yes.

137
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,661
The Mediterranean is beautiful,
but if it's real sailing you want,

138
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,584
I recommend the Sunda Islands
in the Banda Sea.

139
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,560
I was there on a trip last spring.

140
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,523
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thank you very much.

141
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:58,724
Hmm, Cohibas, my favourite brand.

142
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,905
Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,723
Thank you.

144
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,922
Would you excuse me?

145
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,629
Good evening, sir. What'll it be?

146
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,798
Give me a scotch.
Single malt, on the rocks.

147
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,925
You got it.

148
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,516
Haven't we seen each other before?

149
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:12,730
You'll have to come up with something
more original than that.

150
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,203
I'm here for the convention.

151
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,790
That's fascinating.

152
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:35,878
- You're in marketing, right?
- Uh-uh. Sales.

153
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:40,340
- Is there a difference?
- What about you?

154
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:43,719
I do health inspections
of hotel restaurants.

155
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,597
- That sounds interesting.
- No, it doesn't.

156
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:51,935
- Do you have an answer for everything?
- Yes.

157
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:02,654
Rita Foster.

158
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,036
Jack Thursby.

159
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,358
So what do you do
besides travel to dull cities

160
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,361
and talk to women in hotel bars?

161
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:48,033
- I.. uh-play golf.
- Are you any good?

162
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:55,082
- No.
- Honesty. I like that.

163
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,462
What else do you like?

164
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
No commitments.

165
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,550
No bullshit.

166
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:12,140
- And no rings.
- No rings?

167
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,143
You might want to take yours off?

168
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:19,857
Oh, I'm sorry.

169
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:27,531
I'll leave you alone now.

170
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:35,997
<i>Your transmission came through,
Mr. Thursby.</i>

171
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,749
<i>The signal was clear.</i>

172
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,835
Perhaps I can do something else
on my next trip.

173
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,455
I think I'm ready
to handle a bigger assignment.

174
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,166
<i>We'll be sending you
to Omaha next Wednesday.</i>

175
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,884
Omaha?

176
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:49,887
<i>You'll perform the same job
that you did in Buffalo.</i>

177
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:31,595
Omaha?
Why can't they find someone in Omaha?

178
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:38,519
Why do they need to fly you all the
way out there? It doesn't make sense.

179
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,354
Morgan.

180
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:44,108
Morgan, are you listening to me?

181
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:52,199
Since when did you ever care about golf?

182
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:57,830
You're not going on this trip, Morgan.
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,708
What do you mean, I'm not going?

184
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,766
My father wants you to come
to his office tomorrow.

185
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,442
Getting a position with his company

186
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:08,339
is more important than
a silly freelance job.

187
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,299
I said I'd go.

188
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,011
You're not going, Morgan.
End of discussion.

189
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:19,059
You're staying here.
I'll call my father tonight and we'll..

190
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,563
Tell your father to go fuck himself.

191
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:31,071
What did you just say?
Say you're sorry, Morgan!

192
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,407
Morgan!

193
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,494
If you don't apologize,
I want you out of this house.

194
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:42,207
Morgan! Are you listening to me?

195
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,543
What in God's name has gotten into you.

196
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:49,006
Since when did you start smoking? Morgan!

197
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:53,469
What's going on?
I think I deserve an explanation.

198
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:03,187
Your scotch, Mr. Thursby.

199
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,493
Turn around slowly, please.

200
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,419
What is your transmission device?

201
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,006
I thought you were a health inspector.

202
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,051
I'll ask you again:

203
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,679
What is your transmission device?

204
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,600
The pen, in my jacket pocket.

205
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,575
Do not turn the pen on.

206
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:23,827
What?

207
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:27,081
When you're inside the convention room,
keep the pen turned off.

208
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,458
Do not send the transmission to Digicorp.

209
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:33,295
If you tell Digicorp you met me,
they'll kill you.

210
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,547
Take two every six hours,

211
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:38,717
it will get rid of the nightmares
you've been having.

212
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:43,972
Your headaches will go away, too,
and the pain in the back of your neck.

213
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,408
How do you know
that I'm having nightmares?

214
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:47,660
We'll be in touch in Boise.

215
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,856
What will they do if I
don't turn on my pen?

216
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,867
Just remember who you are.

217
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:59,154
You are Morgan Sullivan.
You are not Jack Thursby.

218
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:12,042
Wait!

219
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:29,977
<i>Good morning, everyone. I'm Alex Chen.
I'll be your first speaker.</i>

220
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:33,397
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here to address the controversy</i>

221
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,181
<i>that's been raging around new techniques</i>

222
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,776
<i>in the preparation of processed cheese.</i>

223
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,403
Now at the risk of oversimplifying

224
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:45,033
the question facing the average
manufacturer of processed cheese is this:

225
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,994
Given increased consumer prejudice

226
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:48,578
against chemical additives,

227
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,163
how do we stem the tide away

228
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:53,150
from natural or organic based products
and instill in the cheese buyer..

229
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:57,296
<i>I'm glad to hear that there were no
problems at the convention, Mr. Thursby.</i>

230
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:01,425
<i>I'll call down to the lab
to make sure the transmission went through.</i>

231
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:07,306
<i>Excellent work, Mr. Thursby.</i>

232
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:09,974
Thank you.

233
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:11,852
<i>Your transmission came through perfectly,</i>

234
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,729
<i>just as clear as the last time.</i>

235
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:17,524
<i>I want you to take another trip.
Boise, Idaho.</i>

236
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:19,735
Boise?

237
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,154
<i>We scheduled a connecting flight
for you to board once you've landed.</i>

238
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:26,492
<i>You won't have time to go home.
That's not a problem, is it?</i>

239
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,870
No. No problem.

240
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:34,268
Room 1493, Mr. Thursby.

241
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,562
The convention room
will be open in an hour.

242
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:38,230
Thank you.

243
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:41,900
Mr. Thursby! One last thing:

244
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:46,613
The first letter from each word
is the phone number to call her.

245
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,979
<i>Hello, Mr. Sullivan.</i>

246
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,249
<i>You've dialled a special number
that can't be traced or monitored.</i>

247
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,660
<i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

248
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,805
<i>Take the service elevator at the end
of the hall down to the basement level.</i>

249
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:29,907
<i>You'll be clear for the next five minutes.</i>

250
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:31,992
Wait a minute, wait!

251
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,595
Keep moving.

252
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:14,493
Roll up your sleeve, please.
We don't have much time.

253
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:25,921
Are you insane?
You're not sticking that into me!

254
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,256
He has medical training, Mr. Sullivan.

255
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:30,967
I don't care
if he's a fucking brain surgeon!

256
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:32,177
You're not gonna drug me.

257
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:33,303
We're undrugging you.

258
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:35,638
The shot will block out
the Digicorp narcotic.

259
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:36,723
What?

260
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,685
The chemical they're putting in
your bloodstream at every convention.

261
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,021
Do you normally drink something
inside the convention room?

262
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,231
Mineral water.

263
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:48,735
The drug is tasteless and odourless.
You wouldn't have known.

264
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,320
Did you take the pills I gave you?

265
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:53,740
Have the noises in your head
started to go away?

266
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:57,453
- And the recurring dreams?
- Jesus, what is this?

267
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:01,248
W-w-why didn't Digicorp
check my transmission in Omaha?

268
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,333
There was no transmission in Omaha.

269
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:05,919
Or in Buffalo. Or anywhere else.

270
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:08,297
Why are they sending me
to these conventions?

271
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:11,716
- The conventions are charades.
- Charades?

272
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:15,511
You and the other convention guests
all work for Digicorp.

273
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,947
You're all spies.

274
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:19,683
You're given phoney assignments,
phoney identities.

275
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,227
You think your pen
is a transmitting device,

276
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:25,272
another guest thinks
it's his tie clip or her watch.

277
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:27,983
The whole thing is just a ploy
to keep you all distracted,

278
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:30,652
to not realize what's really going on.

279
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,614
What is really going on?

280
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:39,411
If you want answers, take the shot.

281
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,716
When you're inside the room,
act as you always act.

282
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,134
Order the mineral water. Drink it.

283
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,720
Don't make them suspicious.

284
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,806
The shot we gave you should protect you.

285
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:02,643
It should protect?
What'd you mean? What if it doesn't?

286
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,978
Listen to me carefully.

287
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,231
Whatever happens in that room,

288
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,818
show no reaction, no emotion, no surprise.

289
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:16,824
No matter what you see, do not move.

290
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:19,665
What will I see?

291
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,712
- Who sent you?
- A friend.

292
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,048
I don't have any friends.

293
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:38,053
- When will I see you again?
- Soon.

294
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,615
I promise.

295
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:50,309
There are several points of interest here.
First of all, the fact

296
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:54,278
that by an impressive margin,
new home purchases

297
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,197
took most of the brunt of that decline.

298
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:02,618
By this I mean that sales of older homes
are done on an individual basis

299
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:05,413
where there's considerably
more room for negotiation.

300
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:09,626
Therefore, in those sales
we're more likely to find

301
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,642
that the official rise in mortgage rates
has been offset somewhat by the..

302
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,960
respective rates of return
on high tech investments,

303
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:21,221
which led to a surge in
business capital spending

304
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:25,975
and significantly increased the
underlying growth rate of productivity.

305
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:30,188
The capitalization of these
higher than expected returns

306
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:32,023
boosted equity prices

307
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:37,821
generally beyond even that expected
by the enhanced rise in real incomes.

308
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,657
The elevated level of
light vehicle sales, for example,

309
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:45,286
has put more vehicles on the road
than the industry could sustain.

310
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:48,248
And even though demand for
a number of high tech products

311
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:50,501
was doubling or tripling annually,

312
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:54,253
in many cases new supply
was coming on even faster.

313
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:57,173
Overall capacity in high
tech manufacturing industries

314
00:30:57,174 --> 00:31:00,426
rose nearly 50 percent last year,

315
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:03,347
well in excess of its
rapid rate of increase.

316
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:04,354
Accordingly,

317
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,032
the slowdown in the economy that began
in the middle of last year intensified,

318
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:13,107
perhaps even to the point of growth
stalling out around the turn of the year.

319
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:17,403
As the economy slowed,
equity prices fell,

320
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:20,322
especially in the high tech sector,

321
00:31:20,406 --> 00:31:24,325
where previous high evaluations
were being re-evaluated,

322
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:28,163
resulting in significant
losses in some investors.

323
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:31,583
Clearly some slowing in the
pace of spending was necessary,

324
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:36,505
if the economy was to progress along
balanced and sustainable growth.

325
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:45,097
<i>With the process likely to intensify
with the rise in the cost of energy</i>

326
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,309
<i>that has strained business
and household purchasing power,</i>

327
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:52,146
<i>purchases of durable
goods and investment</i>

328
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:55,315
<i>in capital equipment
declined in the fourth quarter.</i>

329
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:59,695
<i>Because the slowdown
was not anticipated by business,</i>

330
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:07,244
<i>it induced some backup in inventories,
despite more advanced technologies..</i>

331
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:15,711
<i>Inventory sales ratios
rose only moderately,</i>

332
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:20,006
and even after the policy
actions taken in January,

333
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:23,927
<i>the risk continue skewed toward
the economies remaining on a path</i>

334
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:28,140
<i>inconsistent with satisfactory
economic performance.</i>

335
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:30,997
<i>Crucial to the assessment
of the outlook and the understanding</i>

336
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:32,811
<i>of recent policy options,</i>

337
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:36,315
<i>is the role of the technological
change in productivity</i>

338
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:38,817
<i>in shaping near-term transcyclical forces</i>

339
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:41,236
<i>as well as long term sustainable growth,</i>

340
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:45,491
<i>perceptible for sustaining
slow advances in quality..</i>

341
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,471
Just a reflex.

342
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,385
You are not Morgan Sullivan.

343
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:16,597
You are Jack Thursby.
You are not married to Amy Sullivan.

344
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:20,377
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

345
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:54,119
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

346
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:58,624
You live in Redmond, Washington.

347
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:24,400
<i>Accordingly to foster
financial conditions,</i>

348
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:29,947
<i>the federal reserve has quickened
the pace of adjustment for its policy,</i>

349
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:35,577
and in conclusion, a cautious
approach is always the best strategy.

350
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:40,708
Thank you for your attention.

351
00:35:56,932 --> 00:36:01,061
Excuse me, do you have the time?

352
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:08,068
- The time? Your watch?
- Yeah, it's 3:30.

353
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:11,404
Already?
Gosh, that last speech just flew by.

354
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,572
Yeah.

355
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,735
Did you enjoy it?

356
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,821
Oh, yeah. Very much.

357
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,018
Hello?

358
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,734
It's for you.

359
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:09,630
Digicorp will approach you at the airport.
Tell them you are Jack Thursby.

360
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,923
Tell them you've never
heard of Morgan Sullivan.

361
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,634
Make them think you're brainwashed.

362
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:16,345
If you're exposed, they'll kill you.

363
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,097
What happened back there?

364
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:21,266
You're feeling the side effects
of the neutralizing agent in your system.

365
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,987
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

366
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:08,939
Mr. Sullivan. There's been
a change of plans, Mr. Sullivan.

367
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:12,151
You need to come to Digicorp's
local office right away.

368
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:14,445
Mr. Sullivan?

369
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:17,072
Mr. Sullivan?

370
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:25,581
Are you all right?

371
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:31,170
I think you're mistaken.
My name isn't Sullivan.

372
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:35,632
You're not Morgan Sullivan?

373
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:40,763
- You don't work for Digicorp?
- No. My name is Thursby. Jack Thursby.

374
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:45,267
I think you're looking for somebody else.

375
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:51,023
I'm sorry, Mr. Thursby. My mistake.

376
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:53,339
That's okay.

377
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:17,966
Hello, sir. How are you?

378
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,887
I just need to see your
boarding pass, please.

379
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,365
Thank you.

380
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:50,708
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

382
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:20,047
Your turn. There's not
much hot water left. Sorry.

383
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:49,743
Could you make dinner
a half hour earlier tonight?

384
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:51,994
Sure.

385
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:54,707
I wrote down a list of errands
I need you to do today.

386
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,417
Okay.

387
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:58,995
Your car keys are in the foyer
next to your briefcase,

388
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,754
right where you left them.

389
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,492
Planning a trip?

390
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,145
Just some reading to pass the time.

391
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:00,230
You're expected in reception, Mr. Thursby.

392
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:02,524
Down the hall and to the left.

393
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:16,747
- What's your name?
- Jack Thursby.

394
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:36,227
My name's Frank Callaway.

395
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:38,752
I'm head of security for Sunways Systems.

396
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,567
According to your neuro-graph,
you're lying.

397
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:48,821
You're lying when you say
that your name is Jack Thursby.

398
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,658
You're lying when you say
that you are not an undercover agent.

399
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:57,663
You are lying when you say
that you do not work for Digicorp.

400
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:06,380
And I cannot tell you
how happy that makes us.

401
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:11,009
No way.
I am not going back to that house.

402
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,262
You are in a unique position here, Morgan.

403
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,932
Digicorp thinks
that you're brainwashed as Jack Thursby.

404
00:44:17,141 --> 00:44:19,184
They think that you've
passed our neuro-graph

405
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:21,562
and they want us to hire you
as one of our agents.

406
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,891
I don't care what they want.

407
00:44:22,896 --> 00:44:26,524
Your counter intelligence work
for Sunways will be very simple.

408
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:29,653
Digicorp will never suspect
that you're working for us.

409
00:44:29,778 --> 00:44:32,864
So they won't watch you
too closely while you're in the house.

410
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:36,909
All you have to do
is place one bug in each room.

411
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,840
You don't fucking understand.
I'm going home.

412
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,700
I'm going to my real home.

413
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:43,291
Your real home is gone, Morgan.

414
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,835
What are you talking about?

415
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,337
Your wife put your house up for sale.

416
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:51,467
Her lawyer has been trying
to contact you for the last few days.

417
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:54,303
She filed for divorce three days ago.

418
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,222
I'm sorry, Morgan.

419
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:02,685
- Look, Morgan, I know this is hard.
- I want to see Rita.

420
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:05,396
- Who?
- Rita Foster.

421
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:09,068
- She pulled me out of the brainwashing.
- No, Morgan. You cannot see her.

422
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:12,738
- Why not? She works for you.
- She does not work for us.

423
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,240
But you sent her to find me
at the hotels, right?

424
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:16,700
No.

425
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,946
But you know who she works for?

426
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:24,884
Who does she work for?

427
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,914
- She works for Sebastian Rooks.
- Who's Sebastian Rooks?

428
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,985
Sebastian Rooks
is a freelance operative who we hired

429
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:36,929
to find out how Digicorp was getting
their agents past our neuro-graph.

430
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:40,599
Then we asked him to send us
an agent who wasn't brainwashed.

431
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:42,267
He delivered you.

432
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:47,481
He's the best in the business, but he's
also very dangerous and very ruthless.

433
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,276
I advise you to stay away from him.

434
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:54,602
Stay away from him and her.

435
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,290
Look,

436
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:09,920
we are offering you a very good deal here.

437
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:12,190
When your work for us is finished,

438
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:17,258
we will give you a new identity
and a new home,

439
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:22,100
somewhere very far away
and safe from Digicorp.

440
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,601
I'm sorry, Mr. Callaway,

441
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,230
but you'll have to find
someone else for your job.

442
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,696
You won't last long out there.

443
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:40,159
Anywhere you go outside this complex,
Digicorp will have agents watching you.

444
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:43,954
If you try to run,

445
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:48,542
if you behave like Morgan Sullivan
instead of Jack Thursby,

446
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:50,961
they will eliminate you.

447
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:56,842
Quick. Efficient. Ruthless.

448
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:09,521
You're fortunate, Morgan. If we hadn't
interrupted the brainwashing process

449
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,566
you'd be like the other convention guests:

450
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,270
Programmed with a new identity and
sent to companies across the globe,

451
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:21,075
disposed of when
you'd outlived your usefulness to Digicorp.

452
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:24,020
You have a chance to fight back.

453
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,920
So, are you ready to be a spy, Morgan?

454
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:50,877
I'm gonna get some more broccoli.

455
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:04,339
<i>Phone lines are tapped.</i>

456
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,617
We've got visual in all the rooms.

457
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:17,443
There they are, in the dining room.

458
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:23,113
That salt shaker
gives us a nice angle, doesn't it?

459
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:25,240
<i>He believes he's Jack Thursby.</i>

460
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:27,910
<i>He believes I'm his wife.
He's adjusted to this house.</i>

461
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:31,914
- Who's she talking to?
- Digicorp agents.

462
00:49:32,122 --> 00:49:34,833
She's giving them a report on you.

463
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,877
<i>He spends much of his time indoors.</i>

464
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:41,255
<i>Of course he has no friends and he has
little contact with the outside world.</i>

465
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:43,653
We've got the internet lines tapped too.

466
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:48,204
Excellent work, Morgan. Excellent.

467
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:50,174
My God.

468
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:55,716
My life is the same as it ever was.

469
00:49:56,605 --> 00:50:00,317
That's because Digicorp monitored
your old life and then duplicated it.

470
00:50:00,526 --> 00:50:03,070
It helps ease the transition
of becoming another person.

471
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:05,993
That's not who I am anymore.

472
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:14,415
I smoke cigarettes.

473
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,917
I like to drink scotch.

474
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:18,918
I play golf.

475
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:21,424
I'm not supposed to live in the suburbs.

476
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,814
I'm not supposed to be like that.

477
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:29,470
I'm sorry if you're disappointed, Morgan.

478
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:32,307
But that is your vision of Jack Thursby.

479
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,267
It is not Digicorp's.

480
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:42,943
Can you guys clean up the
camera reception in that hallway?

481
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:32,201
<i>Yes, Jamison?</i>

482
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:37,456
This isn't Jamison.
It's Morgan Sullivan.

483
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:46,757
<i>- What do you want, Mr. Sullivan?</i>
- I need your help.

484
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:50,135
I want to hire Sebastian Rooks.

485
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:55,224
- Are you still there?
<i>- Goodbye, Mr. Sullivan.</i>

486
00:51:55,432 --> 00:51:57,768
- I'll pay for his services.
<i>- He doesn't work for individuals.</i>

487
00:51:57,976 --> 00:51:59,603
Tell him to make an exception.

488
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:02,606
- I'll do whatever it takes.
<i>- You're on your own, I'm sorry.</i>

489
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:04,352
No. No!

490
00:52:05,734 --> 00:52:09,153
- Listen, you gotta help me.
<i>- There's nothing I can..</i>

491
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:10,406
You gotta help me, please.

492
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,495
You said I could trust you.
I believed you when you said that.

493
00:52:16,704 --> 00:52:21,583
<i>Meet me at the carwash
at 4th and Jefferson in three hours.</i>

494
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,387
Morgan! We'll be sending you on
your first assignment next week.

495
00:52:33,595 --> 00:52:36,514
Our surveillance
of your house has already paid off.

496
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:39,768
We know exactly what sort of data
Digicorp is trying to steal from us.

497
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:45,065
So tonight you will say that you're
going out of town on a business trip.

498
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:48,360
Now, you know how to tell her that, right?

499
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:53,198
- Morgan?
- Yes.

500
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,414
You will stick to the script, Morgan.

501
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:04,418
You won't try anything risky,
do you understand me?

502
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:10,674
Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you.

503
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:15,763
- When does he want to meet me?
- Not yet. He's in the car behind us.

504
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,188
- How much money does Rooks want?
- He's not interested in your money.

505
00:53:25,189 --> 00:53:28,108
It's your situation.
He thinks he can use it to his advantage.

506
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:31,819
- How?
- I'll be in touch with you in Wichita.

507
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,822
Wichita?

508
00:53:33,864 --> 00:53:36,633
That's where Sunways will be sending you
on your last assignment.

509
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:40,136
How do you know that?
They haven't even told me.

510
00:53:40,145 --> 00:53:42,583
Rooks knows. He knows everything.

511
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:47,002
- Can I trust Rooks?
- I can't give you guarantees.

512
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:52,174
But he has the resources to provide
you with a new life, a new identity.

513
00:53:52,383 --> 00:53:54,635
It's your choice, Mr. Sullivan.

514
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,263
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

515
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:01,600
<i>Sunways will send you on
a series of assignments.</i>

516
00:54:03,435 --> 00:54:06,271
<i>You'll receive a courier disk on each trip.</i>

517
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:10,359
<i>Digicorp agents will be following you
wherever you go.</i>

518
00:54:10,693 --> 00:54:13,654
<i>Let them, that's what Sunways wants.</i>

519
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:24,790
<i>At each destination
you'll be met by a Sunways contact.</i>

520
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:28,210
<i>They'll download data onto your disk.</i>

521
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:35,759
<i>Digicorp's agents will assume
you're receiving valuable information.</i>

522
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,472
<i>As you travel to more cities,</i>

523
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,559
<i>collect more data,
and complete more assignments,</i>

524
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,103
<i>your agent status will rise.</i>

525
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:49,940
<i>Digicorp will then assume you have
become one of Sunways top company men.</i>

526
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:02,742
Jack?

527
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:08,375
<i>Each disk you bring home
will seem more important than the last.</i>

528
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:15,549
<i>As they copy the Sunways files,
Digicorp will think they have won</i>

529
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:18,302
<i>a major victory against
their greatest rival.</i>

530
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,431
<i>In reality, Digicorp is the loser.</i>

531
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:26,852
<i>Sunways is feeding them corrupt data
that will sabotage their operations.</i>

532
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:30,605
<i>But make no mistake, Mr. Sullivan.</i>

533
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:33,650
<i>Sunways is just as ruthless as Digicorp.</i>

534
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:38,697
<i>Once this operation is complete,
they will eliminate you.</i>

535
00:55:41,283 --> 00:55:43,369
<i>Rooks will protect you.</i>

536
00:55:46,538 --> 00:55:49,124
<i>Please. You can trust me.</i>

537
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:55,893
We're sending you to Kansas. Wichita.

538
00:55:57,508 --> 00:55:59,817
It's almost over, Morgan.

539
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:04,640
After this trip to the vault,
your work for us will be finished.

540
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:07,768
- The vault?
- It's our data warehouse.

541
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:10,439
It's completely insulated
from the outside world,

542
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,577
but we send in agent couriers
if we need to retrieve or add a file.

543
00:56:15,494 --> 00:56:18,872
You will be our next courier.

544
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:26,412
And Digicorp will think
they have hit the mother lode.

545
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,327
We need to keep our voices down.

546
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:05,950
Switch this disk
with the one in your briefcase.

547
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:10,795
Before you go to the vault,
take off your ring.

548
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:16,003
- What?
- Your ring.

549
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,578
This is a tracking device.

550
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:27,635
It'll give us
your precise location at all times.

551
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,103
Does this mean we can see each other again?

552
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:36,906
I'll pick you up after you leave the vault,
deliver you to Rooks.

553
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:41,343
- I meant after that?
- We can never see each other again.

554
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,492
It would compromise your new identity.

555
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:57,795
I'm never getting out of this, am I?

556
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,963
500 Horse Creek Road, please.

557
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,856
I know where to go.

558
00:59:30,092 --> 00:59:35,171
Settle down, Mr. Sullivan.
We have a long ride ahead of us.

559
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:58,590
You don't have to pretend to be Thursby.

560
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,811
I know you're not brainwashed.

561
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:07,742
I know that Sunways has been using you
as a double agent against Digicorp.

562
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,758
Are you going to kill me?

563
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:16,349
Not if you return your loyalties to me

564
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,705
instead of Sebastian Rooks.

565
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:23,464
Oh yeah.
I know that you work for him.

566
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:30,614
As a matter of fact, we both do.
I'm Rooks' inside source at Digicorp.

567
01:00:32,116 --> 01:00:36,161
- His what?
- He paid me to hire you

568
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:41,959
so you could be his pawn
once you were sent off to Sunways.

569
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:46,422
You didn't think I hired you because
I was impressed by you, did you?

570
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,616
It's a good plan, really.

571
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,932
Rooks knew that you'd end up here in Kansas
on the way to the Sunways vault.

572
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,477
He knew he could convince you
to switch their disk with his.

573
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:05,357
- That was his scheme from the very start.
- It's not possible.

574
01:01:05,566 --> 01:01:09,653
Rooks' disk contains a search program.

575
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:12,823
It'll penetrate the vault's secure network

576
01:01:12,948 --> 01:01:16,660
and quietly steal a data file
without triggering any alarms.

577
01:01:17,327 --> 01:01:18,995
What data file?

578
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,876
Who knows? But if Rooks has gone
through all this trouble to get it,

579
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,787
it must be extremely valuable.

580
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:29,727
The plan was foolproof.

581
01:01:30,883 --> 01:01:33,905
Except for one factor
he failed to consider:

582
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:36,202
Me.

583
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:39,057
What do you want?

584
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:42,727
When you come out of the vault,
deliver the disk to me, not Rooks.

585
01:01:42,728 --> 01:01:44,772
I've been loyal to Digicorp all along.

586
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:48,233
Why should I trust you or Digicorp?

587
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:51,695
Because we'll let you live and Rooks won't.
It's as simple as that.

588
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:54,959
No one sees his face
and lives to tell about it.

589
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:57,700
No one sees his face?

590
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:00,829
He's a deep cover operative.
A Yuri in cyberspace.

591
01:02:00,913 --> 01:02:02,462
He's a phantom.

592
01:02:03,184 --> 01:02:06,077
Companies hire him
without actually knowing who he is.

593
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,122
If they did, they'd kill him.

594
01:02:09,046 --> 01:02:15,260
The moment you give that disk to Rooks
is the moment he eliminates you.

595
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:21,767
There's only one person
Rooks trusts with his identity:

596
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:26,002
Rita Foster, his lover.

597
01:02:28,524 --> 01:02:32,736
She's completely loyal to him.
No one else.

598
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:36,811
I'm the only person you can trust now.

599
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,939
I'll be nearby when you come out.

600
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:50,133
Just in case we get separated.

601
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:58,345
No charge for the ride.

602
01:04:32,398 --> 01:04:34,124
Good evening, Mr. Thursby.

603
01:04:45,744 --> 01:04:47,600
My name's Virgil Dunn.

604
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:51,801
Welcome to the vault.

605
01:05:12,229 --> 01:05:13,647
Your first time?

606
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:18,654
Hope you didn't have a big dinner.

607
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,805
Step ahead, please.

608
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:18,128
Now that we know you are bug free,

609
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:22,091
I can call you by your real name, Morgan.

610
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,369
<i>Dunn, Virgil C.</i>

611
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:44,199
I need your disk now, please.

612
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,058
Good, good.

613
01:08:33,305 --> 01:08:36,454
Digicorp will cream in their pants

614
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,435
when they copy the bogus data
that I just cooked up for them.

615
01:08:40,854 --> 01:08:42,523
You wouldn't believe
the number of times

616
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:45,234
they've tried to jack
into the systems down here.

617
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:48,570
- Have they ever succeeded?
- Hell, no.

618
01:08:49,863 --> 01:08:54,088
This place
is tighter than a nun's asshole.

619
01:09:05,295 --> 01:09:07,882
Uh, snort while we wait?

620
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,227
Sure.

621
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:12,722
I distill it myself down here.

622
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:16,446
It's one of my little hobbies
to pass the time.

623
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:30,534
- Thanks.
- Here's to the information agent.

624
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:43,667
I used to be an agent like you once.

625
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:47,046
I was the best mole
spotter in the business.

626
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:49,631
You put me in a room
with a possible double agent,

627
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:51,925
let me ask him a couple of questions,

628
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:55,387
and I could tell you right there
whether he was a spy or not.

629
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:57,872
That was before
Sunways sent me down here.

630
01:09:58,331 --> 01:10:00,044
That was three years ago.

631
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,481
- What happened?
- Those fucking machines is what happened.

632
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:10,611
They said the neuro-graphs
were 100% accurate, but I wasn't.

633
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:14,239
That a really good spy,
a really good liar,

634
01:10:14,258 --> 01:10:16,258
could trick me every time.

635
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,037
It's bullshit, I told them.

636
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:21,795
They didn't listen.

637
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:26,824
You see, there are things
that only a person

638
01:10:26,837 --> 01:10:30,798
can know about another
person, Mr. Sullivan,

639
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:34,343
things that a machine
could never pick up.

640
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:37,846
For example, let me ask you
a couple of questions.

641
01:10:38,055 --> 01:10:39,223
Excuse me?

642
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:41,336
What is your favourite drink?

643
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:44,450
Go ahead, answer.
I just want to prove my point.

644
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:48,272
What is your favourite drink?

645
01:10:51,402 --> 01:10:55,155
Er, scotch, single malt, on the rocks.

646
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:57,795
You're telling the truth.

647
01:10:59,576 --> 01:11:03,080
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.

648
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:05,439
Truth again.

649
01:11:06,878 --> 01:11:10,162
See, you're very, very easy to read.

650
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:16,051
Now, are you in love with your wife?

651
01:11:22,349 --> 01:11:28,647
- Yes.
- There, you just lied. Am I right?

652
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:34,769
Yes, I lied.

653
01:11:43,662 --> 01:11:46,623
It's more than just questions, however.

654
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,344
For instance,

655
01:11:51,086 --> 01:11:56,192
I'm sensing a kind of tension in you.

656
01:11:58,594 --> 01:12:03,807
It's been evident ever since
I put your disk in my computer.

657
01:12:04,016 --> 01:12:05,516
Now why would that be?

658
01:12:06,973 --> 01:12:09,288
We both know the disk is from Sunways.

659
01:12:09,938 --> 01:12:13,776
There's nothing on it
that should make you uneasy.

660
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:24,203
- One last question, all right?
- Sure.

661
01:12:25,913 --> 01:12:28,058
Are you a double agent?

662
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:13,921
<i>Where's Mr. Dunn?</i>

663
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,508
He decided to stay in his office.

664
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:26,056
<i>- Right. You can go ahead, Mr. Sullivan.</i>
- Thank you.

665
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,950
Open the door!

666
01:14:21,987 --> 01:14:24,615
<i>Emergency crews are on their way.</i>

667
01:14:24,823 --> 01:14:28,911
<i>For your safety,
please remain inside the elevator.</i>

668
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:38,879
<i>please remain inside the elevator.</i>

669
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:43,175
<i>Emergency crews are on their way.</i>

670
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:48,472
<i>For your safety,
please remain inside the elevator.</i>

671
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,397
Jump!

672
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:05,218
Now!

673
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:30,074
I told you I'd know where you'd be.

674
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:33,243
- I can take the disk now.
- Is this Rooks?

675
01:16:33,452 --> 01:16:38,665
Jamison, one of our operatives.
Rooks is back at the hotel.

676
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:42,336
He's looking forward to seeing you.

677
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:31,260
The car's waiting downstairs.
Call me when you get to the lab.

678
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:39,143
- This is where Rooks lives?
- For now. He moves around a lot.

679
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:45,149
- But you know where he is at all times?
- We have a special relationship.

680
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:52,781
Your assignment is nearly finished,
Mr. Sullivan.

681
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,981
I'll be back in a moment.

682
01:18:50,798 --> 01:18:51,742
<i>Finster.</i>

683
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,429
- It's Morgan Sullivan.
<i>- Sullivan! What happened to you?</i>

684
01:18:57,638 --> 01:18:59,336
I'm in the penthouse suite
of an old building.

685
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:01,058
I don't know where it is.

686
01:19:01,266 --> 01:19:04,228
<i>We're tracing the call.
We'll be there shortly. Where's Rooks?</i>

687
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:07,981
- I'm just about to meet him.
<i>- Get off the phone before he sees you.</i>

688
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:13,821
<i>He will kill you, understand?
Hold on to the disk. We're on our way.</i>

689
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,614
Don't come any closer.

690
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:26,135
Put the gun down, Mr. Sullivan.

691
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:31,005
I'll break it.
You come any further, I'll break it.

692
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:36,969
I gave you the Sunways disk.
This one is yours. The one Rooks wants.

693
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:43,425
Stop!

694
01:19:44,435 --> 01:19:50,232
- You really don't want to do that.
- You used me. You and Rooks.

695
01:19:51,316 --> 01:19:54,903
- You used me from the very start.
- Wait, let me explain.

696
01:19:55,112 --> 01:19:57,781
No. Finster already explained everything.

697
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:01,660
- When did you talk to Finster?
- He's on his way. I just called him.

698
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:04,454
If Rooks wants this disk
before Finster arrives,

699
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,498
you better unlock that door and let me go.

700
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:12,921
Listen to me. Sebastian Rooks
is not the person you think he is.

701
01:20:13,674 --> 01:20:16,384
Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy

702
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,450
- and so are you.
- No, you're wrong. He's..

703
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,916
I know about you.

704
01:20:21,221 --> 01:20:26,060
I know about the two of you.
I know about your special relationship.

705
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:27,394
Please, just hear me out. I..

706
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:31,065
I don't want to hear any more lies!
I don't want to hear any more lies!

707
01:20:34,902 --> 01:20:41,116
God! I can't believe I thought
you actually cared about me.

708
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:48,457
- I can't believe I was such a fool.
- I do care about you.

709
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:59,468
No, no.

710
01:21:00,678 --> 01:21:02,577
Just go see Rooks.

711
01:21:03,428 --> 01:21:04,841
It'll be okay.

712
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:17,888
Hurry. Find him.

713
01:23:31,995 --> 01:23:37,543
I tried stopping you, but you insisted.

714
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:42,589
You said it was the only way
to steal the data from the vault.

715
01:23:42,798 --> 01:23:46,760
Welcome home, Mr. Rooks.

716
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:58,676
Come on.
Finster will be here any minute.

717
01:23:58,695 --> 01:23:59,970
No.

718
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:05,654
No. No more lies.
You can't trick me anymore.

719
01:24:05,863 --> 01:24:09,616
Listen to me.
You are not Morgan Sullivan.

720
01:24:09,825 --> 01:24:13,328
You created him
out of your own imagination.

721
01:24:14,163 --> 01:24:17,171
Your life in the suburbs,
your miserable marriage, your wife, Amy,

722
01:24:17,172 --> 01:24:21,172
was one of your own operatives
playing a part you assigned her.

723
01:24:21,962 --> 01:24:25,632
The more you fight the truth,
the more it'll hurt.

724
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,302
It's not possible.

725
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:32,139
You used the same brainwashing technique
Digicorp uses.

726
01:24:32,348 --> 01:24:35,100
You were the one who sold them
the technology to begin with.

727
01:24:35,309 --> 01:24:37,728
- This makes no sense!
- It makes perfect sense!

728
01:24:38,427 --> 01:24:40,427
Turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan

729
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,110
was the only way you could pass
Digicorp's neuro-graph.

730
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:47,112
It was the only way you could get hired
to be their spy and get sent to Sunways.

731
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:50,532
- Why would anyone do this?
- For this.

732
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:54,620
- What's on it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

733
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:56,672
You don't know?

734
01:24:56,881 --> 01:25:00,217
I've put a lot of faith
into this assignment.

735
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:04,514
Clear!

736
01:25:09,498 --> 01:25:11,672
Freeze! Don't move!

737
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:25,367
- Sunways Security! Identify yourself!
- Digicorp Security!

738
01:25:38,923 --> 01:25:42,176
- Are you following me, Callaway?
- I'm here for Rooks, not you.

739
01:25:42,384 --> 01:25:43,805
That's who I am here for.

740
01:25:53,971 --> 01:25:58,600
- You've flown this before?
- No, never.

741
01:25:58,809 --> 01:26:00,972
You know how to fly it.

742
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,254
You designed it.

743
01:26:12,823 --> 01:26:15,409
- I don't know what to do.
- Sebastian Rooks knows.

744
01:26:15,617 --> 01:26:20,497
- I can't remember Sebastian Rooks!
- You remembered that you loved me.

745
01:26:27,463 --> 01:26:28,795
Just think.

746
01:27:26,105 --> 01:27:27,067
They're out.

747
01:27:37,783 --> 01:27:42,037
Did you get a look at him?
Did you see Rooks's face?

748
01:27:42,246 --> 01:27:44,415
Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.

749
01:27:57,553 --> 01:27:59,568
Jesus! He's Rooks.

750
01:29:48,372 --> 01:29:51,291
Is it what you wanted?

751
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,253
Yes.

752
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:02,553
It's you.

753
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:16,358
The file in the vault was erased.
And this is the only copy.

754
01:30:26,827 --> 01:30:29,913
Now there's no copy at all.

755
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:13,000
