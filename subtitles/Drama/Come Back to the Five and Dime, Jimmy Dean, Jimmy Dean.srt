16
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,409
Don't blame yourself Sonia. It could
have happened to anyone

17
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,300
It's not your fault. It's the fault of
this whole rotten animal hating society!

18
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,219
You are right. I'm sorry about your loss,

time to burry them.

19
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,657

22
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,523

23
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,613

24
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Aahhhh...

25
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,530

<l>with first degree burns,
and severe head injuries

<l>This is not the first time that militant animal rights activist
have undertaken operations of this kind

28
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,350

33
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,695
<l>From this day no one responsilbe for the
torture of animals should feel safe.

34
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,456
<l>And l mean no one!
They are enemies of the animal kingdom.

35
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,580
<l>And all enemies of animal kindom are enemies of us.
Even every day meat eater should be aware

36
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,058

132
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,170

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,940
- Yeah, We'll set the big top on fire...

147
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,510
Count on it.

148
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,230
- We'll blow those bastards sky high!
- We've gotta stop to that cruelty!

149
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,539
And this is just the first battle in a crusade
that will finally lead us to a totally circus free world.

150
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,331
"Operation Circusicion"...
starts now!

151
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,378
No, no, no.
It's not the Hot-dog, doughnut, and coke thats on offer...

152
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,900
It is the Hot-dog and Coke "or"
the doughnuts and Coke.

153
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,650
- Thats what it says on the poster.
- No, thats not what it says on the poster. Says...

154
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,818
It says "Special Offer" pal.
"Free coke and doughnut with every hot-dog!"

155
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,413
Cannot cause any trouble, Hudmaspecs!

156
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,819
- Special offer: Free coke or...
- O' c'mon Hudmaspecs. Don't include tha hot-dogs.

157
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,015
Oh, God... Don't!

158
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,377
Oh... yo.. yo.. you'll have to pay for that

159
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,250
- Hold my specs.
- No don't!

160
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,819
We don't want to spend our weekends in jail.

161
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,830
- Please Hudmaspecs! be nice.
- ...going moose hunting would be fun, relaxing...

162
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,530
Yeah well!
I'm gonna be that pissed off...

163
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,770
I don't take myself off mooses yet.
Thats gonna be all for me

164
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,710
I can tell you that!

165
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,170
Yeah! but it ain't that simple mate.
We won't get a moose just coz we want one.

166
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,376
We've got to work for it, old buddy!

167
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,870
I've got my grand-daddy's hunting rifle...
See this here...

168
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,610
Right from short-put game

169
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,738
I'm gonna shoot me a moose.

170
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,898

171
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,379

174
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,333
we ain't getting any mooses.. coz of all them
amaterus up there in there mountains.

175
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,059
This is the cruelest rule in the game.

176
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,200
I never got used me to that!

177
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,900
It is better are ready!

178

180
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,128
- Lapps on bikes!
- Lapps, Hudmaspecs. Laaps on motorbikes.

181
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,930
Oh, yeah.

The worst bloody porn film l've ever seen.

185
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,252
Varicose veins, Big Butts, Wrinkles...

186
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,209
It seemed a fuckin elderly orgy!

187
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,902
This is my home.

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,100
Let's take a look at the stables...
That'll be your main job.

189
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,258
<l>You're goin to be meetin Circus Stromowski's greatest attraction.
He's been with us more than 15 years.

194
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,371
Is he alright?
He looks kinda sick, kinda... wasted.

195
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,880
- Yeah yeah, that is one fiction.
- Way cool! yeah.. yeah..

196
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
You see we have to drug the animals...

197
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,160
...we have to! otherwise they can get out of control.
Thats not something you want.

198
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,350
- Elephant?
- Imagine an elephant go bananas in the ring...

199
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,830
People getting tremble, kids getting squished to death...

200
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,600
Crushing little bones...
You know it's not cool.

201
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Curshing your arms is not definitely cool mate na!

202
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,200
- So he has had his drugs yeah...

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
- Whoa? He's really hooked?
- O' Yes, thats the reason dummy!

205
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,900
He's mad for this stuff.
Uses four plastic bags like this every week...

206
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,317
A whole fuckin bag full of junk?
Unbelieveable!

207
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,455
Luckily l've got a whole pool of this shit in the Russia.

208
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,372
- Won't be so good if you really ran ha?

209
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,811
Yeah! but you know whats really weard?
He can't stand cops.

210
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,990
Yeah it's weard, and he knows they're pigs you see!
it's all paranoiac.

211
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,250
Should l be thinking about it...

212
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,880
I really do think he's gotta deal with him being a junkie..
You just naturally get paranoiac, You know what l'm saying?

213
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,510
hmm...

214
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,050
What you gotta do here, is basically...
shovel out the shit and feed the animals.

215
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,131
I ain't shoveling shit!

216
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,800
- Okee dok, pal you gonna have to do that.
- Hey, why should l do it?

217
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,700
Somebody's gotta do it.
You ain't getting paid for your looks.

218
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,530
- Then l want as much as Odd!
- Jesus! I'm startling with bringing you little butt holes in on it...

219
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,800
Thats not fair...
I've got the dirtiest job and l'm getting the worst money.

220
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,850
I get the worst money.

221
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,040
What the ever lovin fuck!
Alright, Flea! and Odd! you take care of the feed.

222
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,150
Thats more like it...
That only fuckin fair aye???

223
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,696
- So! whose gonna shovel the shit?
- Guess it'll have to be you!

224
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,692
Oh, brilliant!
I get fucking marbles in it.

225
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,900
It is me! the one who gets the shit money...
and l've gotta shovel the shit? No way!

226
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,360
- Hey Now Gaz! I've got a extra special job for you!
- Oh yeah!

227
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,850
I need you to take a really good care of Jimmy
That'll be your special responsibility.

228
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,250
- How come Gaz gets to do that?
- Yeah! why is Gaz gettin the coolest job?

229
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,891
Why is that so fucking cool?

230
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,300
The most important thing you gonna have to do is
make sure Jimmy gets the right medication at the right time.

231
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,617
Now what you gotta remember is that
the smack is in the Come'n'Shop bag...

232
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,215
...and the speed is in the Shop'n'Come bag.

233
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,652
He only gets that when he's goin in the ring.

234
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,490
- I got ya.
- I can't over emphasize this coz, if he gets the uppers when he   wants the downers, he goes... deep shit...

235
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,054
Memory lock this Gaz! the smack is in the Come'n'Shop bag,

236
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,700

238
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,770
He gets it regular times early in the morning
and late at night.

239
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,900
Downs in the Come'n'Shop bag.
Ups in the Shop'n'Come bag.

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,550
Downs in the Come'n'Shop bag.
Ups in the Shop'n'Come bag.

244
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,417
- Where did the dope go?
- Jimmy Wants it back...

245
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,900
I tease him a little bit you know but aa...

246
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,900
You don't wanna go too far
coz that'll get him wild. Don't it, Jimmy?

247
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,700
Thats when you get a smack on the head with his trunk
and its not something you gonna forget in a hurry, l can tell you...

248
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,200
- Don't shit mate!
- Yeah don't shit mate!

249
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,809
Okay, so thats the stable.
This area would be your main responsibility.

250
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,950
<l>Gaz, you'll be taking care of Jimmy... and then...<l>
...shovel out the shit.

251
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,136
<l>- We bet ya!
- Now strap in on big cow.

252
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,333
<l>Oh.. wait a minute, Mother Fuck!
I ain't cleaning out this shit!

253
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,128
<l>Fear not ele-friend!
They'll pay for this.

254
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,537
Jesus Christ!, l can honestly say...
I've never seen anything like it!

255
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,772
The stables are completely disgusting!

256
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,174
Th.. The state of the animals...
Th.. They.. They are appalling...

257
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,617
- And the elephant is a..drug dependent!
- Thats Horrible!

258
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,732
Let's blow these whole freaks out back to Russia.

259
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,050
Animals liberators!
Straight... edgers!!!

260
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,693
He's a drugged Elee!

261
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,400
This...This is big! Our war... has become greater...
and more significant than ever...

262
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,850
- ...but if it's not crowned with a symbol...
- A symbol???

263
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,408
An elephant... Drugged up, kept down
and exploited in the ring.

264
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,890
Living in degradation...
wallowing in his own muk.

265
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,858
And addicted to drugs!

266
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,171
Jimmy! The junkie... Elephant!

267
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,090
He's addicted!!! Ow...

268
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,854
O' Marius! if there is a re-hab for elephants...
can we take him?

269
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,900
Yes! We are going to free him
from the brutality of the circus!

270
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,900
We are going to rescue him
from the hell of substance abuse.

271
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,496
And with Jimmy in front, we! the 
True Warriors Against Animal Torture and Subjugation...

272
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,575
shall crush the circus men once and for all...
not just here...

273
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,374
but throughout the world!

274

...must've really hurt.

325
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,898
As Baloustrado demonstrate, just how deeply good
these tricks... really are!

326
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,350
So, ladies and gentlemen!!!

- Was he suppose to be entertaining?
- It's just bloody sadism, if you ask me.

334
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,133
It's just playing nasty...

335
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,310

What the hell do you know about it anyway... huh?

340
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,456
When it was a nip, the circus was my favorite place in the world.

341
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,175
There is a lot of fooling
if you ask me!

342
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh, by the way... there was a guy asking a lot of questions
<l>when l was selling the tickets.</l>

343
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,253
- <l>What kind of questions?</l>
- Complicated ones...

344
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,652
...you know! If they have work permits... I mean...

345
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,852
- Undercover cops?
- Yeah, that's exactly what he looked like.. a fucking cop!

346

men, so everything is caucious, You can count on him.

397
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,770
And after a while you get it.
No one is coming.

398
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,137
Not No one is gonna come around and stroke your trunk,

00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,968
I don't suppose you guys could help me out for my...
for Jimmy's sake

402
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,458
- Is it really as bad as all that?
- He'll be taking good care of him, May be he'll mate!

404
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,550
- Might be right mate!
- Sick as a dog!

405
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,952

- Hey stop it! I'm growing very attached to him for Christ's sake.

411
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,900
Hey, this reminds me of a guy Arnold,
crazy about animals.

412
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:41,900
Just like Roy Arnie!

413
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,211
Yeah, he used to buy dogs abroad
and then, brings them back over.

414
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,900
Thing is.. he wasn't animal lover at all.
He was a dog smuggler.

415
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,515
He'd all knit them up and stick backs a gear inside, so it...

416

Why don't you just start from the beginning, Roy Arnie?

419
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,830
Aa.. right right, the thing is that Jimmy is like..

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,818
Jimmy is about to be become the ultimate symbol of
the animal liberation movement

427
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,480
Jimmy The Elephant! is going to be bigger than...

429
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,212
- The World Wildlife Fund Panda.
- Thats not difficult is it? The Pandas aren't that fucking big.

430
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,290
- I'm talking figuratively Erik. And do you mind not swearing so much.
- Oh, l'm so sorry. Is swearing not considered Straight Edge either?

431
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,400
<l>No, it's not...
It's got to do with a...</l>

432
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,928
<l>Go ahead, tell me.
What am l allowed to do?</l>

433
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,852
Davias Fucker just can't open Jimmy and sold 7 K's
of heroin, it was backside.

434
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,135
Seven bloody K's of heroine which he...
ripped of the Russian mafia.

435
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,830
- I didn't rip it off man! I found it.
- Found it, yeah right!

436
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,610
In the boot of a wrecked car on smuggler's trail.

437
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,430
You must've known it was mafia property, you toilet!

438
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,450
- Ofcourse they'll want it back.
- <l>A.. a.. Roy Arnie!</l>

439
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,950
- <l>what about that is...</l>
- l don't think they'd trace it back to the circus man!

440
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,258
- There's something l wanna know about it okay?
- Good thing l got it well stashed.

441
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,800
Yeah and lucky, you've managed to
shack off them Russian gangsters.

442
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Plumb in the depths of my honesty man,
thats not entirely true.

443
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,630
What do you mean?

444
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,890
You see when we got to border with Jimmy.. we got searched
by Russian customs, dogs and everythings...

445
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,735
...seeing as how the dogs didn't find nothing, l assumed
the Russiana thought we were, you know.. clean!

446
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,494
But you know!
Who comes after us then?

447
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,738
- Aa.. No?
- The Lapps. The fuckin Lapps mafia. Get in on the act now...

448
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,219
Lapplanders are mafia?

449
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,850
Real hard bastards. Got close connections
with the Russians, and the drugs, prostitution...

450
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,810
We've got the Lapps mafia on us?

451
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,820
For they, you was a...
Iittle mouse.

452
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,850
- I'm a mouse!
- I'm a mouse?

453
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
A little mouse has found
a well deserved piece of cheese...

454
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,800
...but before you know whats going on.. a cat
comes after you.. then.. a dog comes after you.

455
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,858
I am that mouse and Jimmy
is that bit of cheese.

456
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,616
And he is the key to my dream...
The Roy.. Arnie.. Circus!

457
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,100
Okay.. but how we're gonna
get the dope.. out of Jimmy?

458
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,200
Aa.. well.. unfortunately Gaz!
There is only.. one way.

459
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,200
Huh? You're not!
Are you gonna...

460
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,800
...kill Jimmy?

461
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:50,000
Look! before you get weepy... there is
a million worth of heroine in that elephant's ass!

462
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,858
I never thought, l'd hear somebody say that!

463
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,928
Hey! where the fuck is Flea, anyway?

464
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,700
Relax, Arnie. We've got to get ourselves
a car big enough to hold an elephant.

465
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,350
- Well l hope he turns up, the clock is tickin...
- Cheerly! there is one thing Flea is good at...

466
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
...is nicking cars!

467
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,400
Ten seconds, mate!

468
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,330
Jimmy?

469
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,772
There you are Jimmy, Cool!

470
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,975
Hey! I found him!

471
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,569
Hey Jimmy!
I'm your friend.

472
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,920
I'm on your side Jimmy...
Come to help...

473
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,914
Ha ha ha... Ya.. Good boy! Good boy!
We're gonna be friends, you and me Jimmy!

474
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,378
Huh.. yeah.. how're you there? okay..
You wanna be friends too?

475
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,170
But aa...
What the...?

476
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,130
He's getting away!
Well Go after him, Erik!

477
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,899
Me? why Me?
Where the fuck's Marius?

478
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,138
Fuckin easy once l found it.. It was just there..
you know.. parks! or finding it in the fields...

479
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,856
You've got the Come'n'Shop and the Shop'n'Come bag?

480
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,970
So.. how did that bloke get the stuff
out of them.. dogs again?

481
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,013
- Kill them.
- That's what Roy Arnie is gonna do with Jimmy.

482
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,769
- Fuck off. Is he?
- Yeah mate! He said so.

483
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,772
- How the hell are you gonna kill something that big?
- You can't just whack over him with a pipe.

484
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,090
Coz, it's not what you're killing
something small, like a cat!

485
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,850
This is unreal man!

486
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,520
Me and mate, used to put an ad in the papers..
just before the summer holidays...

487
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,130
Going on holiday... Need any unwanted pets!
Taking care of...

488
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,900
Couldn't be simpler...
Stick'em in the sack and then.. whack him with an iron bar.

489
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,979
Yeah man! how are you gonna do it, aaye..?
Puch Jimmy off the cliff or somthing..?

490
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,015
- That's not a bad idea.
- No kidding as it were easy.... Just whack the bag up the exhaust pipe.

491
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,290
- I can't believe you're carrying on, lot you gave a shit, Arnie!
- Talk about fucking crocodile tears mate!.

492
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,650
- Yeah, how low can you go?
- Pretty.. fuckin.. Iow!

493
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,950
Did you hear him?
That you guys ever done a good deed?

494
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:13,600
Yeah! if someone murder an elephant
thats really a good deed, a really good deed for ya..

495
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,374
Luckily, if thats a good deed..
I'm glad, uncle found out the scouts mate!

496
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,400
Shut up!
You're all in as much as l am.

497
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,137
- It's cold.
- Ya l'm freezing my ass off.

498
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,133
Everything's working men!
Look! Look, the heater is doin blast.

499
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,770
- My lips are paining!
- I'll stop howning this awful blast.

500
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,533
Ya, well it don't seem to be helping.
Not even a little bit.

501
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,135
You stole a truck without a windsheild? You stupid bastard!
What sort of a thief are you?

502
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,250
There's no window!

503
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,738
Jesus Christ! I don't fucking believe it!
Are you saying you didn't notice that?

504
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,410
What will you say? You say l shouldn't have
taken it because lt didn't have a wind-screen?

505
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,460
- This hardly gonna be pleasent, is it?
- Are we suggesting, we drive over the mounts...

506
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,773
...in a truck that don't have a windshield?
Have you lost what little mind you had?

507
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,736
- How could you not see it?
- I just didn't okay! I just.. didn't!

508
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,168
It's not your technique.. as if you know
what could've taken either of it!

509
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,400
What the hell...?

510
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,612
- What the hell are you doing now?
- It's a red light, for Christ's sake

511
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,058
- Jimmy?
- It's definitely an elephant.

512
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,736
How did he get here?

513
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,970
Stop!

514
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,049
Well we better get him on the truck quick.
I mean he sticks out a bit. Doesn't he?

515
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,810
No, shit Gaz!
You think he sticks out?

516
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,459
Jimmy, Jimmy...

517
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,183
He he he he... Ya ya ya...
Come here, Jimmy!

518
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,740
Ya look! I've got your goodies.
Thought you could come, and get it!

519
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,250
<l>Come and get it Jimmy!</l>

520
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,274
It's medication time!

521
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,729
C'mon, c'mon now.. thats.. thats it!
Ya, thats a good boy!

522
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,049
- He's eating them.
- O' yeah! He'll be fine now, he had them.

523
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,939
It's gonna be okay now.
Everything is gonna be finel.

524
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,897
Get your asses out here. We've got to get
him loaded onto the truck and right now!

525
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,550
I don't believe it.
The elephant!

526
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,255
They've hidden the loot inside the elephant.

527
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,900
Inside the elephant?
What do you mean inside the elephant?

528
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,180
We must call the Russians!
Tell them that we have found it!

529
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,373
Not Ante!
Are you stupid?

530
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,216
The Russians are not to know a thing.
We'll keep it all for ourselves.

531
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,696
Hello!, hello!...

532
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,011
- Elephants don't disappear in the thin air just lilke that.
- Maybe it just wanted to go back to the circus.

533
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,696
Do you think he'd willingly go
back to the animal abusers?

534
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,492
Are you completely stupid?

535
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,254
It's those Lapps again!
The ones from the circus!

536
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,298
- What are they up to?
- Maybe they're after the elephant too...

537
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,658
Ooo, Whaaoo!
Thats just genius Erik!

538
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,455
Actually, l think that is exactly
what they are doing.

539
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,419
You know what Lapps are like?
Animal abusers!...

540
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,649
...the lot of them.
Lets follow them.

541
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,333
- What if it starts to rain?
- Or snow.

542
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,898
It's below zero man!
My nuts are frozen to the seat!

543
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,694
Jesus Christ, man!
Shouldn't he had calm down by now?

544
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,777
Yeah, He should be nicely toasted.

545
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,212
Totally my ass!

546
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
I am losing the control!

547
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,042
Give him some more stuff for christ's sake.
Give him some more dope!

548
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,935
Hey cool it Jimmy!

549
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,619
- Get'em of him!
- <l>No! no, don't hurt Flea! Don't do it.</l>

550
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,775
- For Jesus Flea! Do you mind not driving in this way?
- He's not letting me driving.

551
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,532
Well then, Brake!

552
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,630
No, Jimmy!
Jimmy Jimmy.. now it's me!

553
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,490
It's Roy Arnie. Now.. You know..
I've got...

554
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,650
I've got drugs!

555
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,014
It's okay.. it's aa.. I got it..
Jimm...

556
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,368
Jesus! elephant puke!
Odd? Odd?

557
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,572
O' shit, Odd!
You almost drowned man!...

558
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,614
...just like Jimi Hendrix.
Like, that was a real close one man!

559
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,693
- Jimi Hendrix?
- Yeah he drowned in... he drowned in vomit, right?

560
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,430
Yeah, in his own vomit?

561
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,030
- Oi! oi! over here!
- Pull over!

562
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,430
- <l>Let me out!</l>
- Oi! Boys! Are you gonna thank me or what?

563
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
- <l>Shit! I can't open the door!</l>
- <l>Yeah! Now you're glad l picked...</l>

564
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
...the truck without a windscreen aye..?

565
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,929
- What the bloody hell are you doing Gaz?
- I can't open the door!

566
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,935
- Of course it won't open. It hitting a fucking rock, stupid!
- Oi! I just think we're all a great bunch of bastards.

567
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,750
- What happened to Jimmy?
- He ran off.

568
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Up there!
That way...

569
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,021
Why the hell didn't Jimmy calm down?

570
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,660
- Please, let me out.
- Whats the matter with you?

571
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,230
- Whats the matter with him?
- </l>The door won't open.</l>

572
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,980
- I think he swallowed one of Jimmy's pills.
- Oh, no! we gave him the wrong shit man!

573
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,230
- We gave him from the Shop'n'Come bag.
- Aye?

574
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,654
What we gave Jimmy is the wrong stuff. He got the
Shop'n'Come bag when he should've got the Come'n'Shop bag!

575
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,122
Jimmy has got the speed instead of the dope.
Thats...

576
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,412
- <l>...bad news!</l>
- Oh!, that explains why Gaz is so mounted!

577
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,778
For heaven's sake, get me out guys!
The door won't open... will ya.. the door won't open.

578
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,809
- Roll out of the front window there you fucking moron!
- Roll out of the front window you idiot!

579
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,970
Aye?
What?

580
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,897
- We got to find Jimmy!
- He went that way.

581
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,240
Jimmy, split man! Where has he gone?
We've got to find him, for fuck's sake...

582
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,750
...we can't just stand with the thumbs up our asses.
<l>We've gotta...</l>

583
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,300
- Say! wha?
- <l>...find Jimmy. He can't just dissapear</l>

584
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,550
He's off his head.
Give us one of them.

585
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,455
Hey, wait up now!

586
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,777
I... I guess to get the Shope'n'C..
I mean the Come'n'Shop bag.

587
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:21,395
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

588
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,138
Get your grey ass down here for fuck's sake.

589
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,690
- I can't take this out much longer. I'm naked!
- Jimmy!... Jimmy!

590
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:29,750
I can't go on.

591
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,480
- Stop whining man!
- Can we find him some place?

592
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,900
- O' Please! I wanna go home!
- Help us! Please...

593
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,539
...please help us find Jimmy, please...
for love of God man!

594
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,610
- Please!!!
- He's got to be a serious cold turkey by now...

595
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,370
- <l>Shit! I ain't feeling any good.</l>
- <l>O'...</l>

596
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,408
- <l>He can't be far.</l>
- Let's just give it up. This is fucking hopeless.

597
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,590
We can't give up. I'll lose everything.
We! Iose everything.

598
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,090
My whole fucking circus'll go to hell.
We ain't giving up.

599
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,889
- A place there'll be rest up, l'll take it.
- You can't take so more, c'mon!

600
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,613
Drugs!

601
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,690
- <l>No!</l>
- Check it out!

602
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,338
We'll blow all those bastards sky high!

603
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,736
- <l>Aahh...</l>
- We've had that Sonia! don't cry again.

604
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,430
- I'll screw this. I'm nacking.

605
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,770

607
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,239
- Oh.. we've been looking for ages man!
- So cold!

608
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,297
- This is so fucked.
- rrreally cold.

609
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,254
- Totally pointless.
- I can see my mommy.

610
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,932
<l>Ah.., that beauty of the mountains is so great..
to get away from the city, honey!

611
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,779
From the noise, the cars, the pollution!

612
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,132
Away from the frantic pace..
the crime! and all.. those.. people.

613
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,809
Everything is so clean and untouched.
Somehow lnnocent, you know...

614
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,215
These self-service cabins are really terrific.
A place to meet peace for gentle nature lovers.

615
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,850
- Like us!
- Yup! It's quiet satisfactory.

616
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,700
- This is gonna be the best holiday we've ever had.
- hmmm...

617
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,690
- <l>This is bloody</l> brilliant!
- Thank Christ, we're saved!

618
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,330
- About fucking time.
- <l>Tell me it's real. Tell me l'm not triping.</l>

619
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,493
Fucking Coffee!

620
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,012
Oh, Shit!

621
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,731
- Jesus! I'm hungry!
- Hey mister! I could eat the hay out of my home pit.

622
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,576
- hmm.. ya.. well.. you gotta be quick then, ain't ya!
- Don't worry boys, there's tons of food.

623
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,615
I won't forget ever! in my life.. ever tasted food this good.

624
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,213
We should open another can.

625
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,817
They've even got beer down here.
That is fucking unbelievable!

626
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,971
Hey! you know what we need now?
Some decent sounds.

627
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,492
- Alright slut! a gift from God.
- I can smell puke man! Who's blowing chunk?

628
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,450
It's Jimmy puke in it.

629
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
- Thats what stinks
- We'd started to fall...

630
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,019
Shit, you know if we stayed out there much longer
we'd have froze to death man!

631
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,059
Oye! Chaps! It's beds in here..
Fuck me! they look good.

632
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,610
- And there're sleeping bags too.
- You know what? I think I'll just turn in for a night.

633
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,939
<I>Oye! how come you and Odd get the sleeping bags?</I>

634
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,539
<I>Coz our clothes're completely</I>
drenched in elephant puke. Thats why...

635
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,454
...Am I asking too much? huh...
<I>Am I being unreasonable?</I>

636
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,750
Ah Yeah! I'm starting to get warm now.

637
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
- I can honestly...
- Thats so fucking good...

638
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,889
Put in my head... on a pillow...
has never felt this good...

639
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,130
Never...

640
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:30,150
- That was the fucked day without even a glimps of moose!
- Aye, and Hudmaspecs has been a nightmare!

641
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,400
Do you think he'll ever get over about what
happened last year with that Pakistani fellow?

642
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,400
Are you crazy?
Never!

643
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:41,100
Aye, I suppose for him it was a pure sack of rage..
An... asian shooting his moose!

644
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,815
O' he did take it very hard.
Had the moose in his sight...

645
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,850
Finger on the trigger... when that Pakistani
fellow came along and.. you know... "Bang!"

646
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,600
Aye.. good thing we got'em back to the camp..
you know what I'm saying...

647
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,100
<I>Well Hud expect you both what had happened.</I>

648
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,331
Aa Yeah! lucky for the Pakistani fellow..
maybe also lucky for us!

649
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,170
You're telling me? Up your showers and
we could gave me at a day.

650
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,174
Yeah me too. There was something in his eyes...
Something dangerous!
- <I>Aye!</I>

651
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,090
But as long as he's bolt with all that anger
over last year.. it ain't safe...

652
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,790
...for man or beast up here.

653
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,632
We have to just go again on the moose tomorrow.
If not! then the shake thats well and truely gonna have to fan!

654
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,932
Reports're coming in that an elephant has been released
on to the road by a unidentified party!


655
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,932
<I>Be warned! not to approach or attempt to capture
the elephant.. as it is considered... very dangerous.</I>

656
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,400
<I>The public are advised that they can recoginze
the elephant by it's trunk and face!</I>

657
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:55,700
<I>President Bao flies to Asia...</I>

658
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,570
You know honey! I am sure that if we aa...
treat these gentlemen with respect...

659
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,891
<I>They'll understand that the sleeping bags.. are infact...</I>

660
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,059
- <I>...ours!</I>
- They are non-Americans, Harv! Speak to them!

661
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,536
You are good with the ethnically challanged!

662
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,240

Hey! they are here...
The little shits.

664
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,258
You know! I think that mm...
maybe we just got the wrong impression here.

665
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,970
We'll smoke the ass holes out of there.

666
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,550
- <I>He... he he he he...</I>

667
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,130
Fucking wankers!

668
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,497
If we just.. maybe talk to them..
you know.. very politely!

669
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,970
It's burning...

670
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,819
- Harvey, the cabin is on fire!
- Haa....

671
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,298
Shit man!

Who filthy fuckin smoking in bed?

674
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,800
Open the window, will ya?

675
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,535
- See its hot in here?
- Open it yourself.

676
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,772
Oh.. hey.. just getting up..

677
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,380
Take it easy..
I'm sleeping here!

678
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,172
Oh, shit!

679
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,849
Where... is... the elephant?

680
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,410
Hey, Hudmaspecs!
I bet there's a whole lot of gross is in those bushes over there!

681
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,610
- <I>No</I>
- Lets find it together.. shall we?

682
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,860
I'm after something big!

683
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,600
O' Jesus!
I feel sick.

684
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,856
Oh fuck! I have never been this hung before.

685
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,982
You're goona feel a whole lot worse if Hudmaspecs
doesn't manage to bag himself a moose!

686
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,690
What if we spread out. Maybe we'll have
a bare chance of finding one!

687
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,470
We shouldn't have got so far.
Coz not much moose are in here.

688
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Aae! But also not many peoply either!

689
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,457
Wow!
This is such an exciting operation!

690
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,779
You're just in this for a ride. You don't care that there
is an elephant out there hooked on drugs!

691
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:43,003
I can't be asked for this!
When I was an eco terrorist.. atlleast we all owned cars!

692
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:44,570
A car is eco friendly!

693
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,733
Come on! we can't give up now.
This is the mission of our lives!

694
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,210
Liberating an exploited circus elephant
from the pits of drug addiction.

695
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,230
- <I>We!</I>
- Hey! listen!

696
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,900
- We!
- He is a drug addict right?

697
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,000
Let's get some drugs and use them as bait.

698
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,860
That way.. when he comes to get them..
we can just... grab him.

699
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,174
- O' that is just genius Lise!
- Yeah! come on genius! got any better ideas?

700
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,610
<I>Here we are!</I>
fighting... Putting our lives on the line.

701
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,110
for...

702
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,860
<I>The animals!</I>

703
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,614
<I>And the only thing you two can do is...</I>
argue and complain about everything.

704
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,918
- It's Erik!
- Yeah you really need to examine your attitude Erik!

705
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,800
<I>You girls always stick together..</I>
don't you? Well I'm so fucking sick!

706
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:26,650
- A a a.. Remember what we agreed about your swearing.
- And you! Marius! you're always on their side. You...

707
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,390
You fucking creep! Cock sucking...
Camel fucking.. Pee See.. Nasty...

708
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,040
One! I am not siding with the girls.

709
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,700
Two! l am... by no means a camel.. fucker!

710
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:43,810
- What do you mean you're not siding with the girls?
- Oh, fuck this.

711
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,230
- I am out of here.
- Where are you going?

712
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,836
Erik please! whats your problem?
Perhaps you should re-consider you behaviour.

713
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,490
- O' Fuck off!
- You can't just walkout of our relashionship that is...

714
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,458
- Not even you're doing?
- I'm coming with you.

715
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,961
Just forget about Lise and Erik.
They havn't been truely with us for a long time.

716
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,218
Anyway, there are more important things on the agenda.

717
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,574
Check it out!
There thay are!

718
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,930
Come on!

719
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,980
You'll be free.
For God's sake stay on your feet.

720
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,780
Odd! Oodd!
Hey! Aaoo!

721
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:25,860
Oy! Roy Arnie!

722
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,530
Listen! Odd!

723
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,710
Listen up, please!

724
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,130
- Odd! listen!
- Shut your face Flea! Give it a rest, will ya?

725
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,638
Ya but look! look over there...
It's Jimmy!

726
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,248
The elephant!

727
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,240
Hey, Hudmaspecs! I'm gonna run up
to the ridge there... and have a look...

728
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,655
Is that a good idea?

729
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,058
Aahh...
O' well...

730
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,830
O' God No!

731
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,968
- Whats happening?
- I'm seeing things... I'm having visions.

732
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,950
I knew it! The doctor said to go easy
on the booze.. and now it's happened!

733
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,610
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.

734
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,660
That does not sound too good,
what're you seeing, spiders or what?

735
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,495
Elephants!
I'm seeing Elephants in the middle of the day.

736
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,499
It's too late.

737
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,937
I've always been shaky scared to get that this would happen.

738
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,372
What are you talking about,
pink elephants! like in the cartoons?

739
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,895
Eddie has been overdosing in bloody cartoons!

740
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,353
- I didn't say it was pink!

741
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,855
- Don't do it Eddie!
- We can see him too.

742
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,904
What the hell is an elephant doin up here?

743
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,810
And where the devil did he come from?

744
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,291
There was a circus in town when we left.
Maybe he ran away.

745
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,379
- Yeah! but how did he get that far?
- What do you think we should do?

746
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,916
The elephant!
is mine!

747
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,290
This isn't the same as shooting a moose.

748
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,673
- He belongs to someone.
- And they're probably right behind that hell over there.

749
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,630
- <I>They're gonna...</I>
- <I>What are you saying?</I>

750
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,880
<I>That...
They're gonna...</I>

751
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,331
- Whats goin on?
- They're gonna shoot Jimmy!

752
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,350
- But Hudmaspecs.
- He shot.. my moose...

753
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,520
so I'm gonna shoot his elephant.

754
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,335
An Eye for an eye!
Its really fair.

755
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,931
Oh, shit! It saw that, expensive?
They exploded his head.

756
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,010
What happened?

757
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,929
Oye Look! Look!
I've losen my ropes.

758
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,818
O' That was an accident.

759
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,730
No doubt about it.
A prime example of an accidental discharge.

760
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,410
Absolutely no doubt it could have happened to anyone.

761
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,414
There was the moose! Did you see it?
It was the moose that pushed Hudmaspecs!

762
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,130
Aye, the moose, yeah.. it was.. it was just almost the..
The moose came to help the elephant!

763
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,870
- <I>You saw, that the elephant...</I>
- The elephant!

764
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,620
The elaphant!
The elephant must not escape.

765
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,137
Holy Jesus! let's get out of here.

766
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,213
- Where's Jimmy, man?
- Jimmy, gone!

767
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,598
- Where to.
- He just.. disappeared.

768
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,770
To Warriors Against Animal Torture and Subjugation!

769
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,850
Put down your weapons!

770
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,979
Hold my specs!

771
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,852
- Where the fuck did he come from?
- Let's get going.

772
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,489
Thats all we need that animal live!

773
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,770
- Go home for God's sake.
- I don't care. I'll blow us all to hell.

774
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,690
- I am going to fuckin flaten his ass.
- Throw your weapons, or it'll go off

775
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,297
I think you should know...
I am prepared to kill myself.

776
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,737
Die in peace, Marius!

777
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,772
You may die Marius! but you'll take some
damn the animal abusers along with you.

778
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,652
We will save Jimmy!

779
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,928
- Is he a little slow in the end or what?
- Definitely!

780
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,210
Jimmy!

781
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,975
Jimmy?

782
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,051
Ye ha!

783
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,272
- Motorbikes!
- Wait.. No!

784
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,616
Stay away from the elephant!
He is mine!

785
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,968
- I mean it! or its all up!
- Get away from him you eel shaped!

786
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:18,172
- Give up... or we die!
- I'll miss your elephant. Now you better be ready!

787
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:05,011
- Hudmaspecs, you are alive!
- Fucking foreigners!

788
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,537
The elephant...
should've been mine!

789
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,901
- You hear me?
- We hear you buddy.

790
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,911
O' atleast we didn't get blown into pieces.

791
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,218
- Come on!
- Are you out of your mind?

792
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,654
This is stupid!

793
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,169
Aye, that elephant is not right
at the edge, mate!.

794
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,497
Come on in, Jimmy!
It's medication time!

795
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,419
Thats it, C'mon...
Every little thing going to be alright, Jimmy!

796
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,695
Don't you recognize me baby?
Don't you recognize me?

797
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,170
Check'em now, He's taking those...

798
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,979
- <l>I'm shaking like a leaf.</I>
- Nearly shot myself there...

799
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,412
Oh, shit!

800
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,738
No, don't do it Jimmy!

801
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:16,013
No, no, no! Karma!
<I>Karma!!!</I>

802
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,730
Once upon a time, there was a little mouse...

803
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,220
And this little mouse found
himself a well.. deserved...

804
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,470
...piece of cheese.

805
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,378
Now its our turn man!

806
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:20,135
- Come on! He can't be far off.
- Oh, just leave it, will you Arnie!

807
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,974
- Jimmy!
- I mean what we're gonna do if we find him anyway?

808
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,290
Come on! We'll split it up equal...
Four ways.

809
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,015
What the fuck?

810
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,738
Stop.. that.. beast!

811
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:45,750
Stop!

812
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,100
Stop!

813
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,657
No!

814
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,328
I thought we'd dead our chips then.

815
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:36,255
I want to go home.

816
01:12:36,505 --> 01:12:39,505
- Where is Jimmy man?
- Jimmy!

817
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,954
We are goin home...
Now!

818
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,400
<l>up till now the police have
no theory regarding the six people</I>

819
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:27,900
<l>found dead on the mountains.</I>

820
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,569
<l>According to a spokes person it seems probable..
two tourists shot dead...</I>

821
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:34,800
Did you hear what I said?
We're setting all this circus crap!

822
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,059
- You owe us, man!
- You just fucking try it!

823
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,865
Odd! C'mon man! we'll split it fair.
Just help me find Jimmy.

824
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,650
You know what? I don't give a
shit about your stupid.. fucking... 

825
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,050
- circus!
- No!

826
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,773
No! I will find Jimmy.
I don't care if he's dead or alive.

827
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,612
He's out there somewhere, and
I just gonna find him.

828
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:01,656
I'll start over again from scratch. Maybe slow!
but my dream... my dream will come true..

829
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,607
The Roy! Arnie! Circus!

830
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:09,395
Roy Arnie! For Christ's sake, do me a favor.
Stop slamming that fucking whip round...

831
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:13,905
- ...makes me nervous.
- Ya, and will you please get out of that circus club...

832
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:15,615
...or it is getting on my tits.

833
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,657
You are obsessed, mate!

834
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,654
Hey Flea! why the fuck are you
wearing that clown costume?

835
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,336
Well I was just a..
It was.. just thinking you know.. maybe

836
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,350
Maybe I could become backup...
curcus clown!

837
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,853
- Oye?
- Don't you think I'll make a good clown? Fellows!

838
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,249
Yeah! certainly man!
You'd make a great clown.

839
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,810
Yeah Certainly!

840
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,330
Flea ain't a fucking artist.
He'd never make a clown!

841
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,277
Just look at him!

842
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,371
What the hell you're doing, you silly bastard!

843
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,210
My eyes! oh my eyes!

844
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,370
Flea?

845
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,061
You blinded Flea!
You knocked his eye out!

846
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,928
Come on now!
I didn't hit you that hard!

847
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,430
Aahhh!
That... really... hurt!

848
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,420
- What do you know about a circus anyway Aey?
- Yeah go on Flea! Give'em chilling...

849
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,670
- He has messed things up once too often...

850
01:15:05,285 --> 01:15:07,285
- O' Flea! beat it there!
- You shit.. fat.. fucking.. fl..

851
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,049
Bust his nuts, Flea!

852
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,854
- Actually... I'll do it... Myself!
- <I>...fucking.. I'll rip your bone off...</I>

853
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,360
- ..I'm gonna hit you fucking hard.
- This is for your stupid circus!

854
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,420
- And this is for Jimmy you bastard
- You fucking bastards!

855
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,130
- He was cool man!
- Ya! he was really cool...

856
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,610
- ...even if he was an elephant.
- Especially consider it, it was...

857
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,550
