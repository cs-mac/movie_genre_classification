1
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:48,634
<i>Today, the glory of ancient Egypt...
is ruins and dust.</i>

2
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:52,709
<i>And this greatest of the earth's
earliest civilizations...</i>

3
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,512
<i>...a thing of darkness 
and mystery.</i>

4
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:00,243
<i>These mighty monuments
tell us of a people...</i>

5
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:02,378
<i>...who were rulers of the world.</i>

6
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:06,629
<i>Who created a civilization never surpassed
for beauty and splendor.</i>

7
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,853
<i>But the Egyptians were not only
builders of monuments.</i>

8
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,389
<i>They were human beings,
no different from ourselves.</i>

9
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,492
<i>This is the story of a man...</i>

10
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,828
<i>...who dwelled in the ancient
land of the Nile...</i>

11
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,397
<i>...thirty-three centuries ago.</i>

12
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,032
<i>I, Sinuhe the Egyptian...</i>

13
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,401
<i>...write this...</i>

14
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,967
<i>...in my place of exile,
on the shores of the Red Sea.</i>

15
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:13,049
<i>There is no more
desolate spot on earth.</i>

16
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,219
<i>Soon the jackals
and the vultures...</i>

17
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,155
<i>...will make a poor meal
of what is left of me.</i>

18
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:23,126
<i>No monument
will mark my resting place.</i>

19
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,929
<i>I will leave only this.</i>

20
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,939
<i>The story of my life.</i>

21
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,769
<i>I have lived fully and deeply.</i>

22
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,838
<i>I have tasted passion, crime...</i>

23
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,283
<i>...and even murder.</i>

24
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,077
<i>It is for you to judge me.</i>

25
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,414
<i>You must weigh the good
against the evil.</i>

26
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,916
<i>The passion
against the tenderness.</i>

27
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,399
<i>The crime against the charity.</i>

28
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:52,234
<i>The pleasure against the pain.</i>

29
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>I began life
as I am ending it, alone.</i>

30
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,462
<i>I rode alone
on the bosom of the Nile...</i>

31
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:03,211
<i>...in a boat of reeds daubed with pitch
and tied with fowler's knots.</i>

32
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:07,236
<i>Thus the city of Thebes was accustomed
to dispose of its unwanted children.</i>

33
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,550
<i>I grew up on the waterfront
of the city...</i>

34
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:40,456
<i>...in the house
of my foster parents...</i>

35
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,265
<i>...who had saved me
from the river.</i>

36
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:45,201
<i>My foster father
lived there by choice...</i>

37
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:49,882
<i>...because he was, also by choice,
physician to the poor of the city.</i>

38
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,387
<i>From the rich he could have
commanded princely fees...</i>

39
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,789
<i>...for he alone in Thebes,
was master...</i>

40
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,482
<i>...of the ancient art
of opening skulls.</i>

41
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,193
Have more of the good wine ready.

42
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,796
Afraid, Sinuhe?

43
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,048
Good.

44
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:28,761
You must never fear death.

45
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:33,053
In our craft death
is a familiar companion.

46
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:51,016
This time we cheat him.

47
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,032
Look...

48
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:58,181
...this tiny splinter of bone
pressing on the brain.

49
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:00,583
When I remove it...

50
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,901
...he will speak again.

51
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,807
Will walk, and live.

52
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,893
Why father? Why?

53
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:12,862
No one knows.

54
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,774
<i>From the beginning
I kept to myself.</i>

55
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,610
<i>I used to wander alone
on the banks of the Nile...</i>

56
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:31,181
<i>...until the day came when I was ready
to enter the School of Life.</i>

57
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,922
<i>In the School of Life...</i>

58
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,558
<i>...were trained the chosen
young men of Egypt.</i>

59
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,027
<i>The future scientists
and philosophers...</i>

60
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,495
<i>...statesmen and generals.</i>

61
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,578
<i>All the learning of Egypt...</i>

62
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,467
<i>...lay in the keeping
of the Gods.</i>

63
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:56,472
<i>For ten years,
I served them in the school...</i>

64
00:06:56,739 --> 00:07:00,042
<i>...that I might earn the right
to call myself a "physician."</i>

65
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,056
<i>I learned
to bend my body to them...</i>

66
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,556
<i>...but that was all.</i>

67
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,951
<i>My mind still asked the question:</i>

68
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,036
Why?

69
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,660
Sinuhe...

70
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,997
...be careful, the priests!

71
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,339
Free wine!

72
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:45,021
To the health
of our classmate, Horemheb!

73
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,724
The best swordsman,
the finest horseman...

74
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:51,275
...the fastest runner,
and the strongest wrestler.

75
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:53,496
And the first one to tell about it!

76
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,699
Well, if you don't speak
well of yourself...

77
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,134
...no one will do it for you.

78
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,733
This I learned from the gods.

79
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,940
You drunk to what I am...

80
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:07,076
...now drink to what I will be.

81
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:10,268
For the day will come,
when I will carry the Golden Whip...

82
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,338
...and lead you all into battle.

83
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:18,928
Hey, you're not drinking, my friend.

84
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:21,858
- Wine!
- He's had enough.

85
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:23,226
Never enough for a friend.

86
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,528
Finish the night in some gutter
with his throat cut.

87
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,198
He's under my protection.

88
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,468
To your future.

89
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,922
- Look at our brilliant physician!
- The honor student!

90
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:46,215
He's got the reeling sickness!

91
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:01,914
Can I help you?

92
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,339
Just a second.
Don't throw things at my friend.

93
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:21,317
He's alive!

94
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,352
Who is he?

95
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,658
He's a stubborn arrogant fool,
but he is my best friend.

96
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:26,702
Then take him home.

97
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,025
A tavern wench can't give orders
to the son of a Falcon.

98
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,994
The son of a cheese-maker!
Take him home!

99
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,920
Good night physician.

100
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:39,090
Your friend is the fool, not you.

101
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:43,127
Why does no one ever answer me 
when I ask "why"?

102
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,774
Come on, let's go.

103
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:55,138
How did she know your father
was a cheese-maker?

104
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:07,096
<i>The Queen of Cities.</i>

105
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,370
<i>Thebes, of the hundred gates.</i>

106
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:12,001
<i>Capital of the world.</i>

107
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:15,972
<i>After my graduation
from the School of Life...</i>

108
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,708
<i>...I set myself up as physician
on the waterfront.</i>

109
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,671
<i>Far from my father's house...</i>

110
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,779
<i>...lest I steal
his patients from him.</i>

111
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:31,187
<i>But I found that not even
the poorest of patients...</i>

112
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,762
<i>...would come to the door
of so young a physician.</i>

113
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:36,807
<i>I had to go out into the streets
in search of them.</i>

114
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,737
Too late for that one.

115
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,825
Come over here, into the shade.

116
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,532
Here, sit down.

117
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,086
I can help you.

118
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,656
Under certain conditions,
blindness can be cured with a needle.

119
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,158
Alas, no physician
can restore my eye.

120
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:45,428
My first master put it out
when I drank a jar of beer...

121
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,264
...and refilled it in a manner
which displeased him.

122
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,333
- Then what is the matter with you?
- Nothing...

123
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,769
...I'm as healthy
as the 40 sacred baboons.

124
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,470
My name is Kaptah...

125
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:56,639
...and I've decided
to be your servant.

126
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,742
Even if I needed one,
I couldn't afford it.

127
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,979
And if I could afford it,
I wouldn't employ a ragged beggar.

128
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,747
I may be ragged,
but I'm intelligent...

129
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,750
...I am handsome
and I can read.

130
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,900
Well, you're quite right, master,
I am a poor servant.

131
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:13,416
But then you're a poor physician
and deserve no better.

132
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:14,624
I shall obey your orders...

133
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,193
...you may beat me, 
within reason...

134
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,162
...and in return,
I shall steal from you...

135
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:20,964
...also within reason.

136
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:22,400
Ohm then you admit 
you're a thief?

137
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,790
We are all thieves.
Only the dishonest ones deny it.

138
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:27,868
I will improve your reputation.
People will say:

139
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,228
"He must be a good physician
if he can afford a servant".

140
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,543
With one eye? They will say:

141
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:36,217
"He must be a poor physician
not to have cured his own servant".

142
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:39,415
Well, I shall say that when
you first bought me I was totally blind...

143
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:41,634
...and that you restored
half my sight.

144
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,949
Master! Master!

145
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:11,507
Heave! Heave! Heave!

146
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:51,544
Heave! Heave! Heave!

147
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,505
Master! Master!

148
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,602
Master, come quickly!

149
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,235
Come quickly!

150
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,817
Look. This is your chance.

151
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:11,040
I told you I'd make
your reputation.

152
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:27,256
Come here everyone!
Come here and watch!

153
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,722
You shall see such wonders
as your eyes have never beheld.

154
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:35,213
The gods themselves have instructed
my master in his arts.

155
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:40,131
Known to him are the ancient spells
and potions of our ancestors.

156
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:41,135
Come here and watch!

157
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,106
- Someone bring water.
- Here's water.

158
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,241
Moisten the cloth,
and squeeze it between his lips.

159
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,310
I'll need fire to purify
my instruments.

160
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:50,146
Fire. Bring fire,
for the worker of wonders.

161
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,360
The fire won't be needed,
he's dead.

162
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:02,792
Observe! Observe the wisdom
and mercy of my master!

163
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,871
Lest this poor soul
be forced to hobble...

164
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,259
...for the rest
of his life on one foot...

165
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:11,641
...my master has granted him
the boon of death.

166
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:15,392
No one could have saved him.

167
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:17,335
Saved him?

168
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,555
For what?

169
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:23,670
So the young physician
is still asking "why"?

170
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:33,423
Master...

171
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,592
...that's a dangerous woman.

172
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,267
Dangerous?

173
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:47,370
The look in her eye,
the look of a calfless calf, for a ewe...

174
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,705
...for it's lamb.

175
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,741
Beware of such looks, master,
her mind is on breaking...

176
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,254
...a jar with you...

177
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:55,438
...on marriage.

178
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,282
I don't even know her name.

179
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,829
<i>Her name was Merit.
She was a tavern maid.</i>

180
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:14,898
<i>And she could neither read,
nor write.</i>

181
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,766
<i>She loved me all her life.</i>

182
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,896
<i>But this I didn't learn</i>
<i>until it was too late.</i>

183
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,775
People of Thebes!

184
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,977
Ask pity of the gods!

185
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:02,745
Pharaoh is dead!

186
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,563
They have been caterwauling all night!

187
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:24,500
The fools think they can bring
pharaoh back to life?

188
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,905
Why don't you take him home?
It's early morning.

189
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,073
What's wrong with him?

190
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,209
He was refused an appointment
in the palace guards...

191
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:34,781
...because of his birth.

192
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,574
You don't have to lower your voice.
I know what you're saying!

193
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,619
Yeah, I was refused!

194
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:44,484
Refused because of my birth!

195
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,022
Look at the ones they accepted!

196
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,857
Mincing perfumed idiots...

197
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,326
...who carry sunshades,
and twitter like birds!

198
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,064
How long till dawn?

199
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,282
An hour, perhaps.

200
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:00,937
Did you ever hunt lions?

201
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:02,924
No?

202
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:06,776
I saw a black mane male...

203
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,545
...drinking from a pool at sunset.

204
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,879
But if he never hunted lions...

205
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:11,948
He is under my protection,
I told you once before.

206
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,183
I need no protection.

207
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,019
I'll bring you back
the skin of a lion myself.

208
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,598
Suppose the lion brings back your skin,
what happens to me?

209
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:22,091
Find another master to rob,
richer than I am.

210
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:24,060
Sinuhe, please be careful.

211
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,599
To pay our score.

212
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,571
May it benefit, my lord.

213
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,573
Let's go before
she changes your mind!

214
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,311
You know 
that's how I lost my eye.

215
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,046
Lion hunting.

216
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,584
Son of a cheese-maker.

217
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:41,303
Why didn't you run, you fool?
You were nearly killed!

218
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,127
Be quiet.

219
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:44,895
The god is coming.

220
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:48,365
What's he talking about?

221
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,334
He said "The god is coming".

222
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:52,836
Which god?

223
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,107
He is coming. Aton.

224
00:21:58,409 --> 00:21:59,579
Aton?

225
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:03,004
Look!

226
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,915
He worships the face of the sun.

227
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,790
Thy dawning is beautiful...

228
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,658
...in the horizon of heaven.

229
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,062
Oh, living Aton,
beginning of life...

230
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,836
- What's the matter with him?
- He has the holy sickness.

231
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,178
At least I can prevent him
from biting his tongue.

232
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:38,983
Well, we can't leave him here.

233
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,469
Let's take him in the city.

234
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,266
Seize them!

235
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:02,940
What's wrong?
What have we done?

236
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,943
You'll find out in good time.
Put them in chains.

237
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,656
<i>For two days, we were held
without knowledge...</i>

238
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,387
<i>...of the reason for our arrest.</i>

239
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:20,057
<i>Then we were taken under guard
to the Royal Palace.</i>

240
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:27,193
Silence!

241
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:29,633
On your faces!

242
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,303
Our new pharaoh comes!

243
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,249
On your faces
before the Living God.

244
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:13,830
The one we called fool,
is pharaoh.

245
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:17,298
We'll lose our heads for this.

246
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,966
Princess, come back!

247
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:39,270
Mighty pharaoh! King of Upper
and Lower Egypt...

248
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,337
Princess!

249
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,108
Look, father!

250
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,610
Hush! Your father is busy.

251
00:24:46,677 --> 00:24:49,113
But I want him
to see my new monkey.

252
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,648
Not now, child.

253
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:52,416
Sit down, princess.

254
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,556
Mighty pharaoh!
King of Upper and Lower Egypt!

255
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,425
- Son of the Sun...
- You have feet.

256
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,494
Stand on them.

257
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:12,529
You will please me much better
if you will all rise.

258
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,809
My heart is heavy because
of my father's death.

259
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,014
Let us finish our affairs
as quickly as possible.

260
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,155
The embassies
of Hati and Kush...

261
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:30,854
...come to pay respect
to the new pharaoh.

262
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:33,224
- There are gifts from...
- Later.

263
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:40,631
I wish to see the two prisoners
you spoke of.

264
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:42,566
Are they here?

265
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,435
Yes, Sire.

266
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,104
Come forward!

267
00:25:57,314 --> 00:25:58,315
On your knees!

268
00:25:58,716 --> 00:25:59,984
On your feet!

269
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:09,226
Why have these men
been held without trial?

270
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,995
Their crime is sacrilege, Sire.

271
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:14,331
They laid hands on the sacred
person of pharaoh.

272
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,800
Sinuhe, a physician,
the son of Senmut.

273
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,720
Horemheb,
the son of a cheese-maker.

274
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:21,882
Come forward.

275
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,341
For a cheese-maker
he has bold eyes.

276
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,745
The other one, the physician...

277
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:31,144
- Notice his features.
- You are the son of Senmut?

278
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:33,217
I've heard of his work
among the poor.

279
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,230
Come closer.

280
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:38,923
Sire, he must die!
He laid hands on you!

281
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:41,597
I know that.
It was to help me.

282
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:44,428
The law makes
no such distinction, Sire!

283
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:48,399
Have I the power
to change the law?

284
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,637
There is no limit
to pharaoh's power!

285
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:56,707
The law is changed.

286
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:04,348
I appoint you physician
to my household.

287
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:08,973
I am deeply grateful, Sire,
but I cannot accept this honor.

288
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,121
Why not?

289
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:13,893
I've sworn an oath
to serve the poor.

290
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,326
Because of your father?

291
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:17,686
For that, 
and other reasons.

292
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:19,563
Senmut is not my real father.

293
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,700
My parents must have been
of the poor themselves...

294
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:26,116
...for as a baby I was cast adrift
on the Nile, in a reed boat.

295
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,106
And you never learned
who your parents were?

296
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,307
Perhaps they were fowlers.

297
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:32,610
The boat was tied
with fowler's knots.

298
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,348
"Fowler's knots"?
Did you say "fowler's knots"?

299
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:38,415
Yes!

300
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:39,984
Why do you ask, mother?

301
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,506
Curiosity, my son.

302
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,193
You may honor your vows Sinuhe,
and serve the poor.

303
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,162
But on condition you bind
yourself to come to the palace...

304
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:54,561
...whenever I or my family,
have need of you.

305
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,800
Thank you, Sire!

306
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,571
This other one is no healer,
this cheese-maker's son.

307
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:03,708
Yet, he too, profane pharaoh
with his touch.

308
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,309
Sire, may I speak?

309
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,111
Speak!

310
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:10,874
Horemheb saved your life
by slaying the lion.

311
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,330
What is Horemhed's desire?

312
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:31,535
To let my sword drink the blood
of pharaoh's enemies...

313
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,833
...as my arrow drank
the lion's blood.

314
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:38,676
This has been foretold
is my... destiny.

315
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,113
And is the destiny of Egypt...

316
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,031
...to be written in blood?

317
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,772
It has always been, Sire.

318
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,785
As long as there's war,
blood must flow.

319
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:58,128
What is your request?

320
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,166
An appointment, Sire.

321
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,034
As an officer in your guards.

322
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:06,770
You request is granted!

323
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:11,041
I wish he asked to be
our cheese-maker.

324
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:13,710
- Princess!
- I wish he would!

325
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:19,850
The sun is setting.

326
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:21,752
Forgive me all.

327
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,945
I will return to my meditations.

328
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:26,784
Come, my children.

329
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:20,748
My Lord, the princess Baketamon
commands your presence.

330
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:22,813
Follow me.

331
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,058
Not you.

332
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,141
This way, my lord.

333
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,742
Come in physician.
My mother wishes a word with you.

334
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,650
He won't hurt you.

335
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,912
Some more beer.

336
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:10,799
Come closer.

337
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,130
So, you never learned
who your parents were?

338
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:23,428
Surely you tried to find out?

339
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,892
Speak up!

340
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,444
I'm content with the parents
I have, your Majesty.

341
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,897
In what year 
were you cast adrift?

342
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,555
In the same year
that pharaoh was born.

343
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:38,359
Or so I've been told.

344
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:44,484
Why does your Majesty...

345
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:46,353
You're not here to ask questions.

346
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:48,380
My mother wishes you
to examine her.

347
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,490
I know that I'm dying.

348
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,778
I want to know
how long it will take.

349
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,131
Don't be shy.

350
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:18,204
Once, I enjoyed the touch
of a man's hand.

351
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,200
How long ago!

352
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,415
Why do you stop, physician?

353
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:35,163
To admire the way a queen
can weave a mat of reeds?

354
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,655
Those are fowler's knots!

355
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:42,937
Didn't you know that my family
were bird catchers in the Lower Kingdom?

356
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,896
And I caught 
an eagle in my net.

357
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,332
Pharaoh himself.

358
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,572
He loved me, Sinuhe,
because I was strong and lusty.

359
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,961
Because I was vulgar and unlearned
and told him the truth.

360
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,212
His other wives,
the high born delicate ones...

361
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:05,660
...with their narrow heads,
how they hated me.

362
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,951
So I swore that I would give him a son
to wear the Double Crown.

363
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,257
And I did.

364
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:20,376
But the gods 
were perverse.

365
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,434
They gave me a son
as soft as a woman...

366
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,059
...and a daughter as hard as a man.

367
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:31,179
Baketamon here,
should be pharaoh.

368
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:34,011
Not her brother.

369
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,731
Well, what do you find?

370
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:44,257
- If your Majesty will forgive me...
- Tell her the truth.

371
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,423
If you want
to live much longer...

372
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:50,357
- ...you must give up the strong brew.
- What impenitence.

373
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:53,408
I was drinking beer
before you were born.

374
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,900
Your Majesty asked me
for the truth.

375
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,636
Now I give you
some advice, young man.

376
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:01,512
Never tell the truth
to an old woman.

377
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,375
Especially if she asks for it.

378
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,346
Go now, you weary me.

379
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:25,096
What did she want?

380
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,331
I'm not sure.

381
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,667
- Did she speak of me?
- No.

382
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,670
Some day, when I command
the armies, I...

383
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,246
You know, when I think of her,
my blood boils.

384
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,343
Tell me, my friend...

385
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,296
...do you have a potion
or something to cool my fever?

386
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:46,677
The wise men say that: "One evil spirit
can only be driven out by another."

387
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,899
You mean, another woman?

388
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,889
- Of course.
- A noble medicine.

389
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:54,158
I know just the place.

390
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,061
A woman from Babylon.
She gives a banquet every night.

391
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,829
She won't mind
two additional guests.

392
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,297
- No, I...
- Look...

393
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,785
...we've got to celebrate
our good fortune.

394
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,321
Don't worry, my friend.

395
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,651
You're always 
under my protection.

396
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,762
Let's go outside.
We'll show you the garden.

397
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,338
Sinuhe, my friend...

398
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,840
...let's go out in the garden,
and pick a few flowers.

399
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:53,393
- No, I'll wait for you here.
- Alright, I'll pick a few for you.

400
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,707
Have you never looked
at a woman before?

401
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:12,670
Hundreds. And in the state
the gods created them.

402
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,725
I'm a physician.

403
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,129
Your name?

404
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,026
I'm called Sinuhe.

405
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,394
"He who is alone."

406
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,969
Is this is your house?

407
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,905
This is my house.

408
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,849
And I have guest every evening.

409
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,686
I dislike being alone.

410
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,287
Baraka!

411
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,378
The inscription
of the new pharaoh!

412
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,830
His gift.

413
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,431
- I must leave now.
- Why?

414
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,814
Because men bring you rich presents
for as little as a smile.

415
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,442
This is all I have.

416
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,444
I have never asked a man
for anything.

417
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,069
But I ask you to stay!

418
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,118
I can't.

419
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,488
Is it because 
we women of Babylon...

420
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,322
...have such a bad reputation?

421
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,162
Or do you find me so ugly?

422
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,832
Do you?

423
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:36,440
You're beautiful.
Beyond all dreams.

424
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,936
Such flattery must come easily
to a man who's known...

425
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:47,266
..."hundreds of women."

426
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,018
No one before has ever seemed
to me so beautiful.

427
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,234
So strange.

428
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,818
When I look in your eyes, I...

429
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,735
I feel...

430
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,028
What do you feel, Sinuhe?

431
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,331
I feel the fever of Thebes
in my blood.

432
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,012
And I know that I was born to live
in the sunset of the world.

433
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,508
And that nothing matters... 
nothing...

434
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,943
...but what I see in your eyes.

435
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:31,796
It's late, I...

436
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,857
I must be leaving.

437
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,775
If you go fulfilled with wine...

438
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,190
...and wild thoughts...

439
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,841
...you will surely get into trouble
with some designing woman.

440
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,079
Would you care?

441
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:06,816
No, I brought you here
only to show you the gate...

442
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,679
...in my garden wall.

443
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,106
Later...

444
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,208
...when all my guests 
have gone...

445
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,443
...I will be here by my lotus pool.

446
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,077
Why do you tell me this?

447
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,045
Perhaps because I'm fond of gifts.

448
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,707
And the greatest gift
any man can bring to a woman is...

449
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:36,341
...his innocence...

450
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,498
...which he can give only once.

451
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,803
Wait.

452
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,373
Before you touch me,
I must give you a warning.

453
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,679
Warning?

454
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,770
There is a reason why the Goddess
of Love takes the form of a cat.

455
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,608
When I look at you,
I care nothing for cats or gods.

456
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,364
Look, Sinuhe...

457
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,407
...a cat's paws are soft...

458
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,662
...but they hide claws.

459
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,736
The cat takes pleasure
in tormenting its victim.

460
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,397
Not until the creature
is nearly dead...

461
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,360
...will it show pity,
and put an end to it.

462
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,302
What does this to do
with you and me?

463
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,476
You hadn't any experience...

464
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,819
...and I must be what I am.

465
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,022
Leave now...

466
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:36,195
...and do not return
to the gate in my wall...

467
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,825
...or you may regret it
all your life.

468
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,231
I don't even know your name.

469
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,332
In their foolishness...

470
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:56,414
...men give me the name
which means "beautiful."

471
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,211
Nefer!

472
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:11,583
Nefer! Nefer!

473
00:43:14,747 --> 00:43:17,139
It's no business of mine
where he spends his time.

474
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:18,521
Well, if you don't
consider it your business...

475
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:20,333
...why are you
so angry with me?

476
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:22,097
Get out.

477
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:23,531
For a full week now
he's telling me...

478
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,730
...to send his patients
to other physician.

479
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:28,163
I've even had to return
the coppers I've excepted...

480
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,960
...for appointments with him.

481
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:32,965
This woman stole his mind.

482
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:34,843
He's as mad as a jackal
that prowls...

483
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:38,113
...around the graves
in time of drought.

484
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:42,650
And I'm as mad as he is.
It was you I warn him against!

485
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,044
Then why come to me now?

486
00:43:47,231 --> 00:43:49,316
There are worse things
than marriage.

487
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:52,551
How could I be such a fool
even to dream of it?

488
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:56,098
He is physician
to pharaoh, and I'm...

489
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:00,488
Kaptah, what can I do?

490
00:44:01,062 --> 00:44:03,523
Offer him more then she can.

491
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:07,336
Get out, you one-eyed
son of baboon!

492
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:09,744
Out! Get out!

493
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:03,200
Why do you wait, Sinuhe?

494
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:06,089
I've told you that tonight
I'm engaged.

495
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:10,253
I'm entertaining
a merchant from Syria.

496
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,671
If he touches you, I'll kill him.

497
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:17,641
Only foolish boys
speak in such terms.

498
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:27,565
I must confess, Sinuhe.

499
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:29,725
I find you appealing.

500
00:45:29,984 --> 00:45:32,115
Very appealing.

501
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:34,673
You're not like the others.

502
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:37,113
You're young, and strong...

503
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:40,585
...and innocent.

504
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:49,826
But unfortunately,
I must protect myself.

505
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:53,342
Women like me who live alone...

506
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:56,761
...cannot afford to give in
to their weaknesses.

507
00:45:57,378 --> 00:46:00,407
Or they end their days
begging in the streets.

508
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:03,239
I offer you my protection
for as long as you live.

509
00:46:04,118 --> 00:46:06,754
Men have said that to me
so many times...

510
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:10,871
...in so many tongues.

511
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:15,240
Listen, Sinuhe...

512
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:17,657
...I live in Egypt...

513
00:46:17,698 --> 00:46:20,417
...because I can never
return to Babylon.

514
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:25,160
When I was 12 years old,
I was sold as a slave...

515
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:28,356
...and passed from
one master to another.

516
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,720
Is there any difference
in your life now?

517
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:35,052
A very great difference.

518
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:38,225
For now,
no man is my master.

519
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:43,848
The Syrian merchant
who dines with me tonight...

520
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:47,399
...brings me a ruby
that once belonged to a queen.

521
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:50,520
But to give away a present
from pharaoh is sacrilege.

522
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:53,367
I ask for nothing.

523
00:46:54,368 --> 00:46:57,245
I only want you to understand.

524
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:45,586
You must go now.

525
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:50,377
- My guest will be here at any moment.
- Send him away.

526
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:55,304
- I told you why I can't.
- Send him away!

527
00:47:57,331 --> 00:47:59,222
You're hurting me!

528
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:06,481
I've given you the only thing
of value that I have.

529
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:08,143
Isn't that what you wanted?

530
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:14,120
What deceivers men are.

531
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,031
And you're the same
as all the rest.

532
00:48:18,853 --> 00:48:21,826
You're not so poor
as you pretend, Sinuhe.

533
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:24,610
You have a house...

534
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:28,240
...and many fine
instruments of copper.

535
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,908
If I give them to you,
will you promise me...

536
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:35,844
I promise nothing.

537
00:48:37,038 --> 00:48:39,584
If you wish
to give me a present...

538
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,473
...do so.

539
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:45,079
But ask nothing from me...

540
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:48,354
...as I ask nothing from you.

541
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:55,151
I'm an evil woman, Sinuhe.

542
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:58,233
From the very beginning
I warned you.

543
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,545
Keep your house
and your instruments...

544
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,701
...and go!

545
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,572
Your Highness shoots well,
for a woman.

546
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:23,778
A child's game.

547
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:26,918
- I see you won promotion.
- Why not?

548
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,619
A real soldier here
is like a falcon among sparrows.

549
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:34,496
I wish a word with you, 
over here!

550
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:38,137
May I say, I long dreamed
of a word with you?

551
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:40,493
We won't discuss your dreams.

552
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:44,131
I wish to speak of your friend,
the physician.

553
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,759
Why are you so interested in him?

554
00:50:47,134 --> 00:50:49,260
My brother has been asking for him.

555
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:51,776
He hasn't yet presented
himself at court.

556
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:55,054
Sinuhe has... left the city.

557
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:57,112
He's gone to... Memphis I think.

558
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,101
If you hope for further promotions,
don't lie to me.

559
00:51:00,675 --> 00:51:03,245
I love my friend enough
to lie for him.

560
00:51:03,544 --> 00:51:05,826
Even to a royal princess.

561
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:07,415
What do you want?

562
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:10,460
I want him saved from this creature
who has stolen his wits.

563
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:13,521
That's easy.
She's a Babylonian.

564
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:16,157
- Have her banished, or killed.
- He'll follow her into exile...

565
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,834
...or moan over a grave
the rest of his life.

566
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,047
No. He must be made to see
that she is worthless.

567
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:25,893
And how do you expect
to accomplish that?

568
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:28,436
By letting him find out
that she has betrayed him...

569
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:30,258
...with his best friend.

570
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:34,742
You shouldn't find that too difficult.

571
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,697
Such women like to be assaulted
as if they were fortresses.

572
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:40,281
Your Highness flatters me.

573
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:43,647
I value you in the same way
that you value yourself.

574
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,841
Give me that bracelet.

575
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:49,424
You want a reward...

576
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,302
...for helping a friend
you love so much?

577
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,870
I want it for the Babylonian.

578
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,227
Then you're afraid that
your manly charms won't be enough?

579
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:02,637
Not for her!

580
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:06,707
My friends are watching us.

581
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,014
They think
you're awarding me an honor.

582
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,183
Let them think what they will.

583
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,310
Some day you'll strip
your arms of honors for me.

584
00:52:17,852 --> 00:52:19,879
Your ankles, and your neck.

585
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:22,326
Save your passions
to the Babylonian.

586
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:24,963
She'll appreciate them
more than I do.

587
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:52,120
Open up, let me in.

588
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:55,592
The hour is late.
I have orders to admit no one.

589
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,659
Your mistress is expecting me.

590
00:52:57,725 --> 00:53:00,822
- I have a message from her.
- Those are my orders.

591
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:09,546
Horemheb.

592
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:13,988
Horemhed!

593
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:17,178
Nefer, let me in!

594
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:18,646
Horemhed!

595
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:20,882
Nefer, let me in!

596
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:22,749
Horemhed!

597
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:28,299
You must go.

598
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:30,351
He knows you're here.

599
00:53:30,992 --> 00:53:33,092
I don't care, do you?

600
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:37,003
I sent him no message
to come tonight.

601
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:39,968
I took the liberty of sending one
 in your name, do you mind?

602
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,150
So, that's it.

603
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,153
Go now!

604
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:10,598
Stupid fool!

605
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,233
I'll kill you!

606
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,601
You're crazy!

607
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:19,774
Listen, you fool!

608
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:22,067
It was our friendship
that brought me here.

609
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,482
Can't you see what she is?

610
00:54:23,645 --> 00:54:26,243
The only reason I came here
it was to prove it to you.

611
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:29,770
Never call me friend again!

612
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:33,388
- Get out!
- Very well.

613
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,557
You'll deserve everything
you'll get from her.

614
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:45,087
You may go too.

615
00:54:45,164 --> 00:54:47,333
This is my house,
and it is not a tavern.

616
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,851
Nefer, wait.

617
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:51,759
Look, here...

618
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,265
...I brought you what you asked.

619
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:57,143
The deed to my house...

620
00:54:57,443 --> 00:54:58,745
...my instruments.

621
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:01,652
I never asked you for this trash!

622
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,970
It's all I have...

623
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:27,584
...and not entirely trash.

624
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:31,718
The house is small,
but it's fitted up for a physician's use.

625
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,602
The instruments are the finest.

626
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:37,893
They're worth as much
as precious jewels.

627
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:48,064
There...

628
00:55:49,028 --> 00:55:51,307
...now you own 
everything that was mine.

629
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,067
Sinuhe, please! I'm tired.

630
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,668
You always have some excuse.

631
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,071
- Nefer, I...
- Wait.

632
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:02,308
Since you won't listen
to my warnings...

633
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,845
...you force me to treat you
like my other friends.

634
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,619
What more 
do you want from me?

635
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:09,615
For you I've disobeyed pharaoh...

636
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:12,563
...disgraced my family,
beggared myself.

637
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:15,293
And still you lie to me.

638
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:16,789
Lie?

639
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:19,010
How?

640
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,503
Why have you chosen
not to tell me...

641
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:26,853
...that your father
has a fine house on the waterfront?

642
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,599
I can't give you
what isn't my own.

643
00:56:31,003 --> 00:56:34,485
Or that he has built and furnished
for his wife and himself...

644
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:38,029
...a splendid tomb
in the City of the Dead?

645
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:44,121
You're asking me to rob
my parents of immortality.

646
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,905
To let their bodies,
rot into nothingness...

647
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:49,782
...like the carcasses
of slaves and animals?

648
00:56:50,456 --> 00:56:52,388
I ask for nothing.

649
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,707
But if you do
this one thing for me...

650
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,846
...I will show you
the finer perfection of love.

651
00:57:55,888 --> 00:57:57,723
What are you doing here?

652
00:57:57,857 --> 00:58:00,489
You haven't been to the tavern
for many days.

653
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,629
- I had to see you.
- The man you know, is dead!

654
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:05,738
Forget him!

655
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:08,246
I could never forget you.

656
00:58:10,169 --> 00:58:13,004
Sinuhe, please listen to me,
I want to help you.

657
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:15,885
I am not without experience.

658
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:18,870
You learn a great deal
about life in a tavern.

659
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:22,766
Every night, I see the hunger
in men's eyes.

660
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:25,885
With a tavern maid
they don't trouble to hide it.

661
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:29,689
There are some who approach you
arrogantly, demanding...

662
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,316
...like your friend Horemheb.

663
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:35,649
That kind can never
be hurt by a woman.

664
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:39,699
Then there are those 
too shy to ask...

665
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,819
...but the hunger
is in their eyes too.

666
00:58:43,669 --> 00:58:46,324
They are the ones 
who are unarmed.

667
00:58:46,973 --> 00:58:50,579
Because they are afraid to approach
a woman who might make them happy...

668
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,571
...they fall an easy victim
to the other kind.

669
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:57,350
They think they are in love...

670
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,126
...because they have no way
of knowing what love is.

671
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,684
What are you trying to say?

672
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,391
What I shouldn't have to say...

673
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:08,313
...when you come home at this hour,
and find me waiting for you.

674
00:59:09,529 --> 00:59:11,856
If you wish to help me, you can.

675
00:59:16,702 --> 00:59:18,740
Here are the deeds
to my parents' house...

676
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:21,956
...to the tomb which they thought
would give them immortality.

677
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,999
Here it is her name, 
the new owner.

678
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:29,615
Read it, Merit. 
Nefer! Nefer! Nefer!

679
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:31,288
Sinuhe, you can't!

680
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,424
The deeds have to be witnessed.
Be the first to sign!

681
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:37,299
Go on! Sign!

682
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,125
If you can't write,
make your mark!

683
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:44,697
Gods have pity on you!

684
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:36,438
The house and tomb are yours.

685
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:41,120
From this hour
I am accused and disgraced...

686
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,151
...before gods and men.

687
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,934
It's a high price to pay.

688
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:49,619
Now prove to me
that it's not too high.

689
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,792
How should I prove it, Sinuhe?

690
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:54,801
By keeping your promise.

691
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,535
Promise?

692
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,375
What did I promise?

693
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:05,380
The perfection of love.

694
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,296
I did?

695
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:11,717
Sinuhe, as I have already told you...

696
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,889
...I find you very appealing.

697
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:19,821
Are you quite sure that 
"perfection" is what you want?

698
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:23,024
Yes.

699
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:27,471
Then you shall have it.

700
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,029
I will end your misery.

701
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,330
Secum!

702
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,252
Show this man to the door.

703
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:39,341
Never admit him 
to my house again.

704
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,356
Every philosopher knows...

705
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:54,129
...that we spend our lives
seeking perfection...

706
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,784
...and find it 
only in an ending.

707
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,737
Ending?

708
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:06,404
Sooner or later,
even a cat tires of it's game.

709
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:25,614
Sinuhe!

710
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:28,694
Sinuhe!

711
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:30,527
No!

712
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:37,694
Baraka! Secum!

713
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:46,768
Sinuhe! Sinuhe!

714
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:07,527
<i>Once again I came alone, and in darkness
to the house of my parents.</i>

715
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:10,719
<i>The house that
was no longer theirs.</i>

716
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:44,696
How did they die?

717
01:04:45,231 --> 01:04:46,975
As you should know, master...

718
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:50,188
...a physician can turn
his skill to taking life...

719
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:52,319
...as well as to saving it.

720
01:04:59,612 --> 01:05:01,902
Your father left this for you.

721
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,284
Read it.

722
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:06,546
I can't.

723
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:09,703
Then listen.

724
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:15,746
"To Sinuhe, our son.

725
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:20,633
We are grieved for your sake,
because you have met with ill fortune.

726
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,080
Do not regret that you were required
to sell our tomb.

727
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,907
For all existence is vanity...

728
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:32,345
...we desire no life 
in the hereafter.

729
01:05:32,745 --> 01:05:37,029
Remember always that
we blessed you before we left.

730
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,286
For you who came to us
from the river...

731
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,488
...when we were already old...

732
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:45,758
...were the greatest joy 
of our lives.

733
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:49,183
May your heart
be shielded from sorrow.

734
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:53,800
Such is the desire of your father...

735
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,720
...and your mother."

736
01:06:17,256 --> 01:06:19,759
What do you want here
in the House of Death?

737
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:22,828
I've brought you the bodies
of a man and a woman...

738
01:06:23,129 --> 01:06:25,298
...to be preserved by your art...

739
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:27,911
...so that they may enjoy
eternal life.

740
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:30,670
As you say,
we are artists here.

741
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,580
What can you pay for our services?

742
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,453
I have nothing.

743
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:40,211
Nothing? Throw this carrion
in the river.

744
01:06:41,714 --> 01:06:44,817
Wait! I am willing to work here...

745
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:47,035
...to pay for the embalming...

746
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,556
- ...for as long as you say I must.
- Work here?

747
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:52,959
Only condemned criminals...

748
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:57,193
...and the accursed of the gods
seek work in the House of Death.

749
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,488
There is no man here
who is not better than I am.

750
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,578
Put him to work!

751
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:11,723
<i>For 90 days I labored among
the accursed in the House of Death.</i>

752
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:14,598
<i>It was as if I had died myself.</i>

753
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:16,515
<i>And only my servant, Kaptah...</i>

754
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:19,885
<i>...knew what I had done,
or where I was.</i>

755
01:08:40,636 --> 01:08:42,127
What are you doing here?

756
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:43,906
Speak, or I'll bash your head in!

757
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:46,075
- Are you a god?
- God?

758
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:48,669
No god would dare
show his face here after dark.

759
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:50,379
You're a grave robber!

760
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:52,614
I didn't come here to steal.

761
01:08:52,681 --> 01:08:53,949
What do you want then?

762
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:58,263
I brought my parents
here to bury them.

763
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:02,153
In the Valley of the Kings?

764
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,594
I hoped that
if I buried them here...

765
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:06,596
...they might share
the wealth of the pharaohs...

766
01:09:06,663 --> 01:09:08,116
...in the other world.

767
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:10,367
Other world!

768
01:09:13,036 --> 01:09:15,005
It's true that many pharaohs
planted here...

769
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:17,705
...but I have yet to see one of them
putting out any shoots.

770
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:20,209
And it's certainly
they don't see the gifts...

771
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:21,959
...because we get them first.

772
01:09:23,047 --> 01:09:25,595
You don't believe in another life.

773
01:09:29,487 --> 01:09:31,469
They did.

774
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:35,560
You're a strange one.

775
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,056
I'll help you dig.

776
01:09:57,424 --> 01:09:59,881
I wish somehow
I could mark their graves.

777
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:03,918
Mark or unmarked,
it's all the same.

778
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:06,946
20 years 
to build a pyramid...

779
01:10:07,114 --> 01:10:10,307
...or 10 minutes to scrap
a hole in the sand.

780
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:13,854
Dead are dead,
no matter where we put them.

781
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:19,026
In the end,
the sand conquers all.

782
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,810
Every grain of sand...

783
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:25,414
...will outlive every man alive,
and every man that ever will be born.

784
01:10:26,182 --> 01:10:27,717
Immortality?

785
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:30,186
I hold it in my hand.

786
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:34,664
Only the little grains of sand
will never die.

787
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,367
Listen!

788
01:10:39,884 --> 01:10:40,955
A jackal.

789
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,039
A jackal with two legs.

790
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,875
One of my friends warning us
there is a stranger coming.

791
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:48,677
Here, in the shadow.

792
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,062
Sinuhe?

793
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,597
- That you?
- Yes.

794
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:11,577
This is as good a place
as any to meet a woman.

795
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:20,911
Sinuhe?

796
01:11:28,072 --> 01:11:29,581
How did you find me?

797
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:31,843
Kaptah told me.

798
01:11:32,577 --> 01:11:34,145
He told me what you've done.

799
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:38,221
How you labored 90 days
in the House of Death.

800
01:11:38,983 --> 01:11:40,185
Keep away!

801
01:11:41,935 --> 01:11:44,353
The smell of death is still on me.

802
01:11:46,966 --> 01:11:48,968
How long since you've eaten?

803
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:51,038
I don't know.

804
01:11:57,578 --> 01:11:59,583
I brought you some bread and wine.

805
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,913
Go back, Merit. Go back.

806
01:12:07,137 --> 01:12:08,689
Leave me alone.

807
01:12:08,956 --> 01:12:10,665
Not until you've eaten.

808
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,177
Sit here, Sinuhe.

809
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:15,596
To please me if nothing else.

810
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,682
Bread?

811
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:35,649
Some wine?

812
01:12:51,752 --> 01:12:54,888
Thebes, city of lust and evil.

813
01:12:55,155 --> 01:12:56,957
Men deserve injustice.

814
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:01,739
They deserve their cruel priests,
and evil gods...

815
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:03,676
...for we are vile!

816
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:08,368
No more than a crawling disease
on the face of the earth.

817
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:14,015
The grave is the only cure
for our vileness.

818
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,694
That is what I've learned.

819
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,541
I'll take you back to the city.

820
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:28,795
You can't go back.

821
01:13:29,374 --> 01:13:32,594
Pharaoh's daughter died because
you couldn't be found to save her.

822
01:13:37,749 --> 01:13:39,669
He's frantic with grief.

823
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:41,676
Sinuhe, he's...

824
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,014
He's sentenced you to death.

825
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,931
It means nothing.

826
01:13:53,532 --> 01:13:55,734
Death never comes to him
who asks for it.

827
01:13:57,202 --> 01:13:59,638
I know this too 
in my new wisdom.

828
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:01,815
Do you call that wisdom?

829
01:14:01,857 --> 01:14:05,116
To despise yourself
because of what one woman did to you?

830
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:11,017
Do you really think
all women are like that?

831
01:14:12,385 --> 01:14:15,354
Can't you believe in a love
that asks for nothing?

832
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:22,518
My love!

833
01:14:50,325 --> 01:14:51,660
Everything is arranged, master.

834
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:53,996
- I was able to buy passage for us!
- Buy it?

835
01:14:54,062 --> 01:14:56,465
Took everything I had,
everything I'd stolen from you.

836
01:14:56,932 --> 01:15:00,224
Come, we must hide below decks
before the other passengers arrive.

837
01:15:04,506 --> 01:15:05,638
Merit...

838
01:15:06,942 --> 01:15:08,510
...I don't know how to say this...

839
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:13,148
Take this with you.
It isn't real gold, but...

840
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:14,748
...I want you to have it.

841
01:15:14,783 --> 01:15:17,097
It's the symbol
of the Sun God, Aton.

842
01:15:17,486 --> 01:15:18,948
- Perhaps someday...
- No.

843
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:22,024
We'd only fool ourselves
to think so.

844
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:24,226
This is goodbye forever.

845
01:15:25,294 --> 01:15:26,795
Forever?

846
01:15:28,364 --> 01:15:31,267
You're young, Merit.
Your whole life is before you.

847
01:15:32,535 --> 01:15:36,258
Mine will end somewhere
in the darkness of a foreign land.

848
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:40,043
I love you, Sinuhe.

849
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:54,091
Always remember that.

850
01:15:57,896 --> 01:15:59,515
Hurry, master!

851
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,309
<i>And so I left behind me
the land of my fathers.</i>

852
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,790
<i>And with it, I left my youth
which had promised so much...</i>

853
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:20,203
<i>...and whose only fruit
had been despair.</i>

854
01:16:27,008 --> 01:16:28,076
<i>As the years passed...</i>

855
01:16:28,276 --> 01:16:31,008
<i>...Kaptah and I traveled
to the ends of the earth.</i>

856
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:39,003
<i>In the beginning,
we lived as we could.</i>

857
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,271
<i>Friendless wanders that we were...</i>

858
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:44,341
<i>...we cheated and stole,
in order to live.</i>

859
01:16:54,386 --> 01:16:56,654
<i>We knew heat, hunger, and cold...</i>

860
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,676
<i>...and slept under the stars.</i>

861
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,100
<i>Then, as time softened
my sorrow...</i>

862
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:12,337
<i>...I began to put to use the skills
I have learned in the School of Life...</i>

863
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:14,106
<i>...and in my father's house.</i>

864
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:21,447
<i>As we moved on,
my fame went before me...</i>

865
01:17:21,489 --> 01:17:24,644
<i>...to distant lands, which had
never seen an Egyptian before...</i>

866
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:26,401
<i>...nor a trained physician.</i>

867
01:17:27,053 --> 01:17:29,952
<i>The simplest cures
were thought to be miracles...</i>

868
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:33,027
<i>...and I became known
as a worker of magic.</i>

869
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:38,078
<i>As we traveled on to new lands</i>
<i>our wealth increased.</i>

870
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:49,468
<i>Everywhere we saw
injustice and misery.</i>

871
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,589
<i>But I hardened my heart.</i>

872
01:17:52,054 --> 01:17:55,062
<i>I reserved my skills
for the rich and the powerful...</i>

873
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:57,053
<i>...who could pay.</i>

874
01:17:58,994 --> 01:18:01,822
<i>For the children of poverty,
there was no cure.</i>

875
01:18:07,025 --> 01:18:08,627
Cry out when the pain is greatest.

876
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:11,527
No Hittite warrior
cries out in pain.

877
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:14,900
- There?
- Yes.

878
01:18:18,103 --> 01:18:19,538
It's as I feared, 
Lord Commander...

879
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:20,884
...your skull must be opened...

880
01:18:21,549 --> 01:18:23,588
...and the evil
removed with a knife.

881
01:18:23,593 --> 01:18:25,052
Is this an Egyptian plot?

882
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:26,407
To murder our commander 
at the time...

883
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:29,006
At the time when you're planning 
war on Egypt?

884
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:36,183
It was you that brought me here
from Babylon, my Lords.

885
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,419
I take no interest in your plans.

886
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,318
I have no country.
Egypt, least of all.

887
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:45,250
Shall I undertake your cure?

888
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:48,170
What chance 
have I to survive?

889
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:50,573
One chance in five.

890
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,377
- If I die, my officers will kill you.
- I know that.

891
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:57,246
If I live...

892
01:18:57,313 --> 01:18:58,914
...what will you demand?

893
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,933
Your sword of black metal.
Nothing more.

894
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,602
- Then you are a spy!
- Doesn't matter.

895
01:19:11,436 --> 01:19:15,206
After the first skirmish our secret
will no longer be secret.

896
01:19:15,824 --> 01:19:19,211
After the second Egypt
will no longer be Egypt.

897
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:21,822
Proceed, Egyptian.

898
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:24,308
Shave his head and wash it.

899
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:30,974
Tie him to this chair securely.

900
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:33,343
I'll prepare a drug
to dull his pain.

901
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,056
Master. Master.

902
01:19:46,057 --> 01:19:47,543
It's you and not
the Hittite commander...

903
01:19:47,568 --> 01:19:49,491
...who should have a hole
bored in your head.

904
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:51,059
Why do you even 
ask for a sword?

905
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,342
You could have demanded 
a fortune.

906
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:57,076
Because I think this new metal
of the Hittites...

907
01:19:57,534 --> 01:20:00,008
...may change 
the history of the world!

908
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:03,740
And because Horemheb
now commands the army in Egypt.

909
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,767
So you lied.

910
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,978
There is a key
to your heart after all.

911
01:20:08,045 --> 01:20:10,481
Still love your native land.

912
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:12,995
Master, you will never
go back there.

913
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,044
No pharaoh ever forgives 
his enemies.

914
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,190
Leave my instruments 
in the flame.

915
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,448
Kaptah, we're going home.

916
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,357
<i>Home.</i>

917
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:32,128
<i>But Egypt... 
Egypt was a stricken land.</i>

918
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,998
<i>Torn by hatred and civil strife.</i>

919
01:20:56,922 --> 01:20:59,863
I fear the Hittites, master,
but I fear this more.

920
01:20:59,905 --> 01:21:01,806
Better if we had never come!

921
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:04,195
Your name, Syrian?

922
01:21:04,262 --> 01:21:07,085
I am Egyptian.
My name is Sinuhe.

923
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,333
Once physician to the pharaoh.

924
01:21:10,135 --> 01:21:12,918
You must have been bitten
by a rabid ape when you were small.

925
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,690
You know, that if your name is
on that list of prescribed criminals...

926
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:17,202
Well, you know the Egyptians.

927
01:21:17,309 --> 01:21:20,267
Seize them!
Take them to headquarters!

928
01:21:20,713 --> 01:21:23,938
There must be some mistake!
Could you go over the list again?

929
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:36,329
What do you expect me to do?

930
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:38,816
Bring soldiers here from the Delta?
From the Cataracts?

931
01:21:39,465 --> 01:21:41,267
Your duty is
to keep order in the city.

932
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:43,790
You should be able to do it
with the men you have!

933
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:04,974
You were told
to never return to Egypt.

934
01:22:05,682 --> 01:22:06,984
Why did you come back?

935
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:09,973
It's said that "He who has drunk
of Nile water...

936
01:22:10,518 --> 01:22:13,116
...can never quench his thirst
in other lands."

937
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,858
I know why you're here.

938
01:22:15,367 --> 01:22:18,323
The priests of the old gods
hope to rid themselves of pharaoh.

939
01:22:18,737 --> 01:22:21,273
They whisper that he is mad
and his skull should be opened.

940
01:22:22,574 --> 01:22:25,110
It would be a simple matter
to let the knife slip.

941
01:22:25,994 --> 01:22:27,837
So they brought back to Egypt 
the one man...

942
01:22:27,863 --> 01:22:30,077
...who is master
of the operation.

943
01:22:30,423 --> 01:22:31,959
You.

944
01:22:33,494 --> 01:22:35,999
Give me the sword
you took from my servant.

945
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:38,346
Give it to him.

946
01:22:44,305 --> 01:22:46,654
This is why 
I came back to Egypt!

947
01:22:46,707 --> 01:22:49,177
- Draw your sword.
- Stand back.

948
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:55,695
And now?

949
01:22:57,035 --> 01:22:58,790
Strike at me, hard.

950
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,089
Do you know
what you're asking my friend?

951
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:02,332
Strike!

952
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:07,745
Again, harder!

953
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,242
Where did you get this?

954
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:15,424
In the land of the Hittites.

955
01:23:15,646 --> 01:23:17,840
Hundreds of forgers
are at work there night and day...

956
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:22,010
...making weapons of this new metal.
It is called "iron".

957
01:23:29,419 --> 01:23:30,767
Come with me.

958
01:23:43,537 --> 01:23:52,530
<i>How beautiful our God</i>

959
01:23:52,572 --> 01:24:01,741
<i>How beautiful our God</i>

960
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,222
The new temple where
the pharaoh worships his One God.

961
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:06,524
Look!

962
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:23,735
I've seen the sorrow this One God
has brought upon Egypt.

963
01:24:23,737 --> 01:24:26,659
It was the priests, not pharaoh,
who brought this sorrow on us.

964
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:30,515
It was they who blamed
the misfortunes of Egypt on pharaoh...

965
01:24:30,574 --> 01:24:33,995
...and made the people believe that
thus the old gods show their anger.

966
01:24:34,753 --> 01:24:38,209
If I had my way,
I'd hang every priest by his heels.

967
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:43,846
But our pharaoh believes in repaying
treachery with kindness.

968
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,834
Come.

969
01:25:07,454 --> 01:25:09,118
Stay on your feet.

970
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:14,365
I apologize, Sire,
for interrupting your prayers.

971
01:25:14,562 --> 01:25:15,863
I have urgent news.

972
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,798
Lord Commander
owes me no explanation.

973
01:25:17,865 --> 01:25:19,874
I bring you someone
that you will remember.

974
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,600
Sinuhe, the physician.

975
01:25:22,937 --> 01:25:26,052
Sinuhe? Yes.

976
01:25:26,474 --> 01:25:28,853
He asks of you 
grant him pardon, Sire.

977
01:25:29,152 --> 01:25:32,413
And I, as commander of the army,
also urge you to be merciful.

978
01:25:33,582 --> 01:25:36,061
It is I who should ask 
your pardon, Sinuhe.

979
01:25:36,752 --> 01:25:40,389
Once I raised my hand against you.
I would have killed you.

980
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:42,865
It delights me to see you.

981
01:25:43,567 --> 01:25:46,025
Sinuhe just returned
from the land of the Hittites.

982
01:25:46,654 --> 01:25:48,716
They're preparing
war against us.

983
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:51,362
They've succeeded
in making a new metal.

984
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:53,997
He brought this sword as proof.

985
01:25:54,303 --> 01:25:57,839
It cuts through our Egyptian copper
like a knife through straw.

986
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,842
How could all this be true?

987
01:26:00,209 --> 01:26:02,475
I've sent the Cross of Life
to the Hittite princes.

988
01:26:02,587 --> 01:26:04,247
I promised them my friendship.

989
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,993
Akhenaten, my mad friend
do you think...

990
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:08,384
...they care
for your "Cross of Life"?

991
01:26:08,387 --> 01:26:10,522
They want loot, slaves, power!

992
01:26:10,654 --> 01:26:11,921
And with this...

993
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,063
...they'll get them.

994
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:17,060
Unless you let me strike first.

995
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:19,857
Destroy their cities,
their mines, and their forgers.

996
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:22,771
Are you asking me
to condone slaughter?

997
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,184
I am asking you to show our enemies,
the same mercy they'd show us.

998
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:27,832
No more, no less.

999
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:36,413
There's mercy in every man's heart.
If we can only reach it.

1000
01:26:37,348 --> 01:26:39,284
A man who's lived
in darkness all his life...

1001
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:42,403
...doesn't understand the light 
he calls evil, because it hurts his eyes.

1002
01:26:42,967 --> 01:26:46,289
Should we then, extinguish our lights
and crawl into the darkness, with him?

1003
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,894
Such wisdom is already filled
the Nile with corpses.

1004
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:52,433
Sire, again this morning rioting
broke out on the waterfront.

1005
01:26:52,436 --> 01:26:54,504
I had to send soldiers in
to stop it.

1006
01:26:55,438 --> 01:26:56,537
Don't you see, Sire...

1007
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,708
...a war now
will unite our country.

1008
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:00,607
Once again the Egyptians 
will stand together...

1009
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:02,639
...brothers
against a common foe.

1010
01:27:03,428 --> 01:27:05,347
He is right, my husband.

1011
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,101
Even you?

1012
01:27:10,369 --> 01:27:12,702
So near to me then
is the darkness?

1013
01:27:12,738 --> 01:27:14,784
You should listen to Horemheb.

1014
01:27:15,608 --> 01:27:17,507
I can listen only to Aton.

1015
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:20,623
I will write
to the Hittite princes...

1016
01:27:20,665 --> 01:27:23,005
...asking them to make
their intentions clear.

1017
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,876
Thank you for coming.

1018
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,311
Now, do you see
what I have to contend with?

1019
01:27:45,806 --> 01:27:48,375
Could he prevent you from doing
what you want with the army?

1020
01:27:48,606 --> 01:27:51,278
No. The men follow me, not him.

1021
01:27:51,586 --> 01:27:54,874
But he is pharaoh,
and I have sworn him oath of loyalty.

1022
01:27:55,182 --> 01:27:57,384
He'll write to the Hittites!

1023
01:27:58,452 --> 01:28:00,988
He might as well invite them
come take his throne.

1024
01:28:01,163 --> 01:28:02,523
Would it matter?

1025
01:28:02,614 --> 01:28:04,983
I've seen rulers,
great and small...

1026
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:08,020
...old and young,
warlike and effeminate.

1027
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:11,257
The people suffer and die
whatever the ruler calls himself.

1028
01:28:11,423 --> 01:28:13,659
Hittite, Egyptian, Cretan.

1029
01:28:13,926 --> 01:28:16,231
It's bad to believe
in too much, like pharaoh.

1030
01:28:16,273 --> 01:28:19,054
But it's worse to believe
in too little, my friend.

1031
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:21,310
I believe in nothing.

1032
01:28:34,781 --> 01:28:37,283
<i>While Egypt tore herself
in civil strife...</i>

1033
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:41,002
<i>...I doubled my fortune,
as physician to the wealthy.</i>

1034
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:46,234
Send away the other patients.
I'm tired.

1035
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:47,760
I will see no more today.

1036
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:51,123
I think you will see this one, master.
You might find it rewarding.

1037
01:28:51,137 --> 01:28:54,385
- Oh, is the fee so high?
- Not high, but interesting.

1038
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,938
Send her in.

1039
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:20,488
He'll see you.

1040
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:24,077
Come again tomorrow.

1041
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:26,619
I'm very sorry, 
there is nothing I can do.

1042
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,172
Can you help me?

1043
01:29:40,747 --> 01:29:42,723
Tell me what ails you.

1044
01:30:08,074 --> 01:30:09,676
Give me your hand.

1045
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,271
Open your robe.

1046
01:30:43,901 --> 01:30:46,901
I can save your life
but I can't restore your beauty.

1047
01:30:46,937 --> 01:30:48,906
The trouble has eaten
too far for that.

1048
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:54,121
- Do you want to live, Nefer?
- Yes.

1049
01:30:54,912 --> 01:30:56,793
Yes, I want to live.

1050
01:30:58,182 --> 01:31:01,260
Come back tomorrow morning,
I will undertake your cure.

1051
01:31:04,955 --> 01:31:06,638
I cannot pay you.

1052
01:31:07,424 --> 01:31:09,763
Your collar was all I had left.

1053
01:31:10,235 --> 01:31:12,525
There will be
no fee for my services.

1054
01:31:21,972 --> 01:31:23,110
Here.

1055
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:10,335
For 10 years I dreamed of this,
of meeting her again.

1056
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:12,542
When I would be the master.

1057
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:18,729
Of taking my revenge,
slowly... savoring it.

1058
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:23,933
What do you feel now
that you have your chance?

1059
01:32:25,569 --> 01:32:27,074
Only pity.

1060
01:32:29,173 --> 01:32:30,429
Sorrow.

1061
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:33,347
Because once,
she was so beautiful.

1062
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:37,682
Well, a cat can't help
being what it is.

1063
01:32:40,367 --> 01:32:42,653
It's strange, Kaptah.

1064
01:32:43,637 --> 01:32:47,777
Revenge leaves you as empty
as fame and fortune.

1065
01:32:49,693 --> 01:32:51,261
Eat your fill of all of them...

1066
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:54,786
...and you're still just as hungry.

1067
01:32:56,099 --> 01:32:59,736
- Master, what is it you want?
- I don't know.

1068
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:07,011
But whatever it is, I've been searching 
for it in the wrong places.

1069
01:33:35,489 --> 01:33:38,710
Master, it's dangerous to walk
in this quarter unescorted.

1070
01:33:39,618 --> 01:33:43,672
Sights, and sounds, and smells,
can make the past live again.

1071
01:33:44,431 --> 01:33:47,174
This is where I used to draw water
for my father.

1072
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:52,769
It was a long time ago.
Look, Kaptah!

1073
01:33:54,767 --> 01:33:57,561
This is the tree that I learned to climb
when I could barely walk.

1074
01:33:57,564 --> 01:34:00,033
- Leave me alone!
- Come back here!

1075
01:34:00,097 --> 01:34:02,165
- Leave me alone!
- Don't let him get away!

1076
01:34:02,232 --> 01:34:04,468
- Get his cross!
- It's my cross!

1077
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,784
- I got him!
- What are you doing?

1078
01:34:05,786 --> 01:34:06,522
- Give me that cross!
- No!

1079
01:34:06,603 --> 01:34:09,621
Let him alone! Stop that!
Go on! Go on!

1080
01:34:11,608 --> 01:34:13,544
- Are you hurt?
- No.

1081
01:34:13,944 --> 01:34:16,280
- Where do you live?
- Over there.

1082
01:34:17,648 --> 01:34:20,250
- Thoth, my poor darling!
- I'm alright.

1083
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:22,319
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

1084
01:34:22,386 --> 01:34:24,821
Some of those other boys
didn't like my cross.

1085
01:34:24,888 --> 01:34:26,989
- I'll take you to a physician.
- May I help?

1086
01:34:29,326 --> 01:34:30,584
Sinuhe!

1087
01:34:34,865 --> 01:34:36,805
Yes, my Lord, you can.

1088
01:34:37,668 --> 01:34:39,850
This is the Lord Sinuhe, Thoth.

1089
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,705
A very famous physician.

1090
01:34:44,074 --> 01:34:46,700
- I must get linen for a bandage.
- I'll get it.

1091
01:34:50,414 --> 01:34:53,817
Merit.
After all these years...

1092
01:34:54,585 --> 01:34:56,701
You've been 
in my prayers, Sinuhe.

1093
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:00,157
I'm grateful to your god...

1094
01:35:00,224 --> 01:35:02,498
...if it was he
who brought us together.

1095
01:35:04,661 --> 01:35:06,172
Won't you come in?

1096
01:35:11,435 --> 01:35:13,633
You knew this was
my father's house?

1097
01:35:14,805 --> 01:35:17,341
The house was cheap.
I needed a place of my own.

1098
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:19,182
You, and your husband?

1099
01:35:20,043 --> 01:35:21,652
I am not married.

1100
01:35:22,087 --> 01:35:25,315
- I found the bandages, mother.
- Mother?

1101
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:28,752
He's the child
of a friend, an orphan...

1102
01:35:28,754 --> 01:35:30,956
...but he doesn't know that.
He thinks I'm his mother.

1103
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:33,287
- Sinuhe, please...
- I understand.

1104
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:36,339
Your secret is safe
with this orphan.

1105
01:35:37,194 --> 01:35:38,519
Please come in.

1106
01:35:49,206 --> 01:35:50,715
Here are the bandages...

1107
01:35:51,108 --> 01:35:53,633
...and instruments,
if you have to use them.

1108
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,643
When I grow up,
I'm going to be a physician too.

1109
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:13,628
I hope you use these
with more credit than I did.

1110
01:36:19,036 --> 01:36:21,497
I bought them the same time
as I bought the house.

1111
01:36:23,207 --> 01:36:24,699
I see.

1112
01:36:33,417 --> 01:36:34,939
Sit down over there.

1113
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:42,584
Now hold the bandage.

1114
01:36:45,754 --> 01:36:48,565
- This is going to hurt.
- I'm not afraid.

1115
01:36:58,208 --> 01:37:00,077
Have I been
in your prayers too?

1116
01:37:00,143 --> 01:37:04,255
Yes. I prayed that Aton
would teach you humility, and manners.

1117
01:37:04,414 --> 01:37:06,014
Now I know we've come home.

1118
01:37:06,049 --> 01:37:07,751
Only in Egypt,
does a woman's tongue...

1119
01:37:07,818 --> 01:37:10,048
...takes so sharp an edge.

1120
01:37:12,889 --> 01:37:15,586
Now, in two days
you can take off the bandage.

1121
01:37:15,993 --> 01:37:19,930
- But not before, do you understand?
- Why?

1122
01:37:20,931 --> 01:37:23,680
Oh, I mean, 
what will happen, if I do?

1123
01:37:23,867 --> 01:37:26,361
Probably nothing.
I spoke sternly to you...

1124
01:37:26,403 --> 01:37:29,273
...because physicians should always
be firm with their patients.

1125
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:31,950
You'll find out.
It increases their respect for you...

1126
01:37:31,952 --> 01:37:33,738
...and also 
the size of your fees.

1127
01:37:33,777 --> 01:37:36,078
But I will be physician
to the poor.

1128
01:37:45,589 --> 01:37:47,457
But the rich have
more interesting ailments...

1129
01:37:47,524 --> 01:37:49,142
...and can better afford them.

1130
01:37:49,459 --> 01:37:52,009
No. I would work for the poor.

1131
01:37:58,235 --> 01:38:00,343
I'm hungry. Are you?

1132
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:03,358
I could eat a hippopotamus.

1133
01:38:04,641 --> 01:38:06,725
Well, we're having fish.

1134
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:10,581
- Hurry up, Mother!
- Yes, hurry!

1135
01:38:11,348 --> 01:38:14,218
- Be quiet, both of you.
- Come here.

1136
01:38:14,685 --> 01:38:16,863
Clean your instruments,
and put them away.

1137
01:38:22,559 --> 01:38:24,611
You think you see so much
with your one eye?

1138
01:38:24,613 --> 01:38:26,221
More than my master 
does with two.

1139
01:38:26,263 --> 01:38:27,887
- Did you dare to tell him...
- Why should I tell him?

1140
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,954
I like my life as it is,
without a woman...

1141
01:38:29,957 --> 01:38:32,595
...to pour hot water on my feet,
because I displeased her.

1142
01:38:32,748 --> 01:38:35,058
Questioning my accounts,
rationing my beer...

1143
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:36,164
Hush!

1144
01:38:44,047 --> 01:38:45,139
Merit...

1145
01:38:47,084 --> 01:38:50,601
I didn't ask you to come here,
to pry into my life.

1146
01:38:50,621 --> 01:38:52,350
I didn't expect to...

1147
01:38:54,066 --> 01:38:55,380
Smoke!

1148
01:38:55,645 --> 01:38:58,234
Perhaps you think the smoke
has blinded me too.

1149
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:02,445
What does the lord Sinuhe,
the great, rich, and cynical...

1150
01:39:02,448 --> 01:39:04,823
...lord Sinuhe,
want with a tavern maid?

1151
01:39:06,136 --> 01:39:09,542
You call me great and rich
but I have nothing.

1152
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,792
I am the poorest of men
because I've wasted my life.

1153
01:39:14,311 --> 01:39:17,088
Everything I ever touched,
I destroyed.

1154
01:39:17,681 --> 01:39:20,184
My birthright, my parents...

1155
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,907
Your life too, Merit.

1156
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:29,259
But you've given me something.

1157
01:39:30,427 --> 01:39:31,969
Perhaps an answer
to the question...

1158
01:39:31,973 --> 01:39:34,603
...I've asked myself
ever since I was a boy.

1159
01:39:37,459 --> 01:39:40,610
Not your god,
because I don't believe in gods...

1160
01:39:42,072 --> 01:39:44,908
...but one thing I created,
which wasn't a waste.

1161
01:39:48,111 --> 01:39:50,418
If it's too late
to live for ourselves...

1162
01:39:51,281 --> 01:39:54,121
...perhaps we can begin
to live for our son.

1163
01:40:03,502 --> 01:40:05,471
Thoth, my boy.

1164
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:08,694
Let me offer you
a priceless jewel of wisdom.

1165
01:40:09,094 --> 01:40:12,896
Never peer through windows
on matters which don't concern you.

1166
01:40:13,332 --> 01:40:16,973
That's how I happen
to have only one eye.

1167
01:40:41,284 --> 01:40:44,015
Did you intend to pass
without speaking to me?

1168
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:50,293
I beg Your Highness pardon,
but pharaoh has sent for me.

1169
01:40:50,393 --> 01:40:51,433
I know.

1170
01:40:51,475 --> 01:40:54,225
It's been many years,
physician.

1171
01:40:54,228 --> 01:40:55,996
The look of innocence is gone.

1172
01:40:57,267 --> 01:41:00,503
If Your Highness will excuse me...
- You've heard the news?

1173
01:41:00,754 --> 01:41:02,639
The Hittites 
have invaded Syria.

1174
01:41:03,315 --> 01:41:05,535
Their chariots are approaching
the Delta of the Nile.

1175
01:41:05,538 --> 01:41:07,586
- Then the war has begun.
- No!

1176
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:10,881
My brother's refused to give Horemheb
permission to fight!

1177
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:12,949
Then he must be mad.

1178
01:41:13,016 --> 01:41:16,265
- I've known that for a long time.
- Physician!

1179
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:21,095
After you see my brother
come to my chamber.

1180
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:30,733
- Your Majesty.
- Thank you for coming.

1181
01:41:46,876 --> 01:41:48,065
Sire.

1182
01:41:48,844 --> 01:41:50,012
My friend!

1183
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:55,417
Sire, you must give Horemhed permission
to defend Egypt.

1184
01:41:55,718 --> 01:41:58,487
No! No!

1185
01:41:59,005 --> 01:42:01,418
Right or wrong,
I will not order death.

1186
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:05,587
I can not plunge Egypt
into a bath of blood.

1187
01:42:12,437 --> 01:42:13,936
They say I'm mad.

1188
01:42:13,978 --> 01:42:19,263
Horemheb, the priests,
even my own sister.

1189
01:42:20,612 --> 01:42:22,414
Are they right, Sinuhe?

1190
01:42:23,481 --> 01:42:25,285
Am I mad?

1191
01:42:29,021 --> 01:42:30,956
You are mad, Sire.

1192
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:35,546
But your madness is more beautiful
then the wisdom of other men.

1193
01:42:36,762 --> 01:42:38,248
Beautiful...

1194
01:42:39,231 --> 01:42:42,119
Yes, my vision of Aton
was beautiful.

1195
01:42:42,634 --> 01:42:46,209
I thought it would give peace
and happiness to all men.

1196
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:48,022
I thought I could be his voice...

1197
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,209
...and bring his message
to my people.

1198
01:42:51,177 --> 01:42:53,103
But I was wrong.

1199
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:55,393
The vision has faded.

1200
01:42:56,549 --> 01:43:01,225
My voice was no more than
the whisper of wind in the desert.

1201
01:43:02,054 --> 01:43:03,889
Aton has abandoned me...

1202
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:06,025
...to war...

1203
01:43:07,093 --> 01:43:08,461
...to madness...

1204
01:43:09,061 --> 01:43:10,733
...to the death.

1205
01:43:12,732 --> 01:43:14,434
If you love me, Sinuhe...

1206
01:43:15,235 --> 01:43:17,755
...lift the burden from my soul.

1207
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:20,214
Give me peace.

1208
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:33,634
A physician's task
is to prolong life, Sire...

1209
01:43:34,092 --> 01:43:35,936
...not to shorten it.

1210
01:43:41,128 --> 01:43:42,893
He should rest now.

1211
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,865
Can you do anything for him?

1212
01:43:55,543 --> 01:43:59,163
I'm sorry, but his illness
is not of the body, Your Majesty.

1213
01:44:32,948 --> 01:44:34,612
What is it you want?

1214
01:44:34,716 --> 01:44:38,486
What pharaoh himself asked you for:
"to give him peace."

1215
01:44:38,753 --> 01:44:41,394
You have more courage
than I thought.

1216
01:44:41,436 --> 01:44:43,282
If Horemheb
were to learn of this...

1217
01:44:46,261 --> 01:44:47,918
My men are ready!

1218
01:44:48,029 --> 01:44:50,373
The loyal Lord Commander!

1219
01:44:50,415 --> 01:44:51,722
You too?

1220
01:44:52,567 --> 01:44:54,176
Look, Sinuhe...

1221
01:44:54,803 --> 01:44:57,762
...I love Akhnaton,
as I love my own right arm...

1222
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:01,355
...but if my arm were gangrene,
I'd cut it off.

1223
01:45:01,443 --> 01:45:04,763
Just as Akhnaton
must be cut off from Egypt!

1224
01:45:04,779 --> 01:45:06,948
All Egypt knows that I'm right...

1225
01:45:06,983 --> 01:45:09,451
- ...and you know it!
- Yes.

1226
01:45:09,551 --> 01:45:12,356
Yes, in your place,
I'd tell myself the same thing.

1227
01:45:12,398 --> 01:45:15,409
Have you a potion that
will give him sleep, without pain?

1228
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:16,825
I'm to kill him...

1229
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:19,395
...when all around me
there is such a talent for violence?

1230
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,701
Do this, and the gods
will bless you forever.

1231
01:45:21,743 --> 01:45:25,185
I see, you speak for the gods
and Horemheb for Egypt.

1232
01:45:25,434 --> 01:45:29,052
Tell me one thing,
who succeeds to the throne?

1233
01:45:29,138 --> 01:45:32,209
Who else but the commander
of the army that will save Egypt...

1234
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:34,840
...and make it once more,
the greatest power in the world?

1235
01:45:34,844 --> 01:45:36,062
Yes.

1236
01:45:36,345 --> 01:45:38,113
Horemheb!

1237
01:45:38,681 --> 01:45:40,891
You, pharaoh?

1238
01:45:41,618 --> 01:45:45,898
- So that's the price for your treason.
- Call it treason if you like.

1239
01:45:46,056 --> 01:45:48,658
But there's only one thing
that can save Egypt now...

1240
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:51,315
...and that's courage.

1241
01:45:51,357 --> 01:45:53,136
Courage to act.

1242
01:45:53,178 --> 01:45:56,984
Courage to conquer our enemies
and put their leaders in chains.

1243
01:45:57,834 --> 01:46:00,270
Akhnaton is in his chamber.
He is helpless.

1244
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:02,623
Now is your chance to strike.

1245
01:46:03,473 --> 01:46:05,332
But you won't, will you?

1246
01:46:05,374 --> 01:46:08,411
Because no hand has ever been raised
openly against a pharaoh.

1247
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:09,846
If you strike him down...

1248
01:46:09,848 --> 01:46:12,180
...then the way will be clear,
the precedent established...

1249
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:14,459
...for someone else to strike down
the next pharaoh...

1250
01:46:14,462 --> 01:46:16,929
...whose name you hope
will be Horemheb.

1251
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:20,907
So, this dirty thing
must be done by indirection...

1252
01:46:21,224 --> 01:46:23,398
...as it's always
been done in the past.

1253
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:26,432
By a physician
pretending to heal him.

1254
01:46:27,497 --> 01:46:30,267
By a physician
who's known to be his friend.

1255
01:46:32,569 --> 01:46:34,607
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that man.

1256
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:55,205
Wait outside.

1257
01:46:58,696 --> 01:47:00,417
Don't go far away.

1258
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,181
Your Highness wished to see me?

1259
01:47:11,223 --> 01:47:12,959
Are you going to do
what they want?

1260
01:47:12,977 --> 01:47:14,280
No.

1261
01:47:14,879 --> 01:47:18,151
You should agree.
Akhnaton must die.

1262
01:47:19,217 --> 01:47:21,027
For his own sake.

1263
01:47:21,286 --> 01:47:23,488
Now it's for his own sake.

1264
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:25,876
Mekere, wants to kill him
for the gods...

1265
01:47:25,918 --> 01:47:26,992
...Horemheb for Egypt...

1266
01:47:27,058 --> 01:47:29,018
...and his sister
 for his own sake.

1267
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:31,672
Any hunter will show mercy
to a wounded animal.

1268
01:47:34,933 --> 01:47:37,135
Did they tell you how they plan
to dirty the throne?

1269
01:47:37,135 --> 01:47:39,371
They told me that Horemheb
was to be pharaoh.

1270
01:47:39,471 --> 01:47:41,845
And I'm to be his queen.

1271
01:47:41,887 --> 01:47:44,053
He is to come 
to my chamber tonight...

1272
01:47:44,095 --> 01:47:46,115
...and tomorrow our marriage
will be proclaimed...

1273
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:48,131
...in the temple of the old gods.

1274
01:47:48,173 --> 01:47:49,773
I see.

1275
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:52,017
A good plan.

1276
01:47:52,184 --> 01:47:55,066
This marriage will make him
acceptable to the people.

1277
01:47:55,108 --> 01:47:56,889
But not to me, physician.

1278
01:47:56,955 --> 01:47:59,947
When I marry, it will be
to no cheese-maker's son.

1279
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,444
Leave!

1280
01:48:06,365 --> 01:48:08,290
We haven't much time.

1281
01:48:08,568 --> 01:48:10,603
Horemheb's men
are in control of the city.

1282
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:13,626
Tonight the priests will open
and restore the old gods...

1283
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:15,640
...and make 
a sacrifice of blood.

1284
01:48:16,342 --> 01:48:18,302
But together, 
we can beat them.

1285
01:48:18,878 --> 01:48:21,630
Horemheb and 
all the the evil priests.

1286
01:48:22,315 --> 01:48:24,425
Sinuhe, come here!

1287
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,108
This is what you must do.

1288
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:31,157
Pretend to fall in 
with their plans.

1289
01:48:31,224 --> 01:48:34,096
Kill my brother,
and kill Horemheb too.

1290
01:48:34,761 --> 01:48:37,689
- Two murders.
- Then come to my chamber tonight...

1291
01:48:37,731 --> 01:48:39,933
...and I'll gladly open the doors
with my own hands.

1292
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,989
Willingly share the throne
with you, as pharaoh.

1293
01:48:43,337 --> 01:48:47,024
Why should the people accept
a nameless physician as their pharaoh?

1294
01:48:47,975 --> 01:48:50,626
Because you are pharaoh.

1295
01:48:55,015 --> 01:48:57,167
You're my half brother.

1296
01:48:57,329 --> 01:48:59,795
The only man in Egypt
fit to be my husband...

1297
01:48:59,799 --> 01:49:01,674
...and rule by my side.

1298
01:49:01,955 --> 01:49:04,547
Why do you think
my mother and I sent for you...

1299
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:06,462
...the day you first came
to the palace?

1300
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:09,937
Before she died,
she told me everything...

1301
01:49:10,197 --> 01:49:13,403
...and left it to my judgment,
if you should ever hear the truth.

1302
01:49:14,001 --> 01:49:17,602
She was not the first to bare
my father, the pharaoh, a son.

1303
01:49:17,644 --> 01:49:20,004
A few weeks before,
one of his other wives...

1304
01:49:20,007 --> 01:49:23,274
...was delivered 
of a boy child... You!

1305
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:26,944
You were taken away
from your mother...

1306
01:49:26,986 --> 01:49:30,360
...and cast adrift on the river,
in a boat tied with fowler's knots.

1307
01:49:30,402 --> 01:49:33,879
Tied by my mother herself,
who was a fowler's daughter.

1308
01:49:34,522 --> 01:49:37,841
And the mother failed to notice
that her newborn had disappeared?

1309
01:49:37,883 --> 01:49:40,879
She was shown a dead girl baby,
and told it was hers.

1310
01:49:43,965 --> 01:49:46,347
Hundreds of babies
are cast adrift every year...

1311
01:49:46,389 --> 01:49:48,870
...and boats are often tied
with fowler's knots.

1312
01:49:48,936 --> 01:49:51,218
In the Lower Kingdom,
not in Thebes.

1313
01:49:52,474 --> 01:49:54,848
But there is stronger 
evidence than that.

1314
01:49:55,977 --> 01:49:57,638
Get my chariot!

1315
01:50:01,116 --> 01:50:04,418
Come with me to the Valley of the Kings,
to my father's tomb.

1316
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:06,561
See for yourself.

1317
01:50:53,132 --> 01:50:55,741
The Third Amenhotep...

1318
01:50:55,783 --> 01:50:57,557
...the great pharaoh....

1319
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,868
...my father...

1320
01:51:01,295 --> 01:51:02,496
...and yours.

1321
01:51:04,465 --> 01:51:06,043
Look!

1322
01:51:06,467 --> 01:51:08,608
The finest artists
in Thebes made this.

1323
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:10,435
His exact likeness.

1324
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,133
Look at the nose,
the cheek bones...

1325
01:51:12,136 --> 01:51:14,134
...the forehead, 
the line of the jaw.

1326
01:51:15,409 --> 01:51:17,221
You wanted further proof.

1327
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:24,802
Look!

1328
01:51:27,138 --> 01:51:28,420
That's what my mother saw...

1329
01:51:28,422 --> 01:51:30,452
...when you stood before us
in the throne room.

1330
01:51:30,566 --> 01:51:33,277
What no one else, but she,
could recognize.

1331
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:35,863
The face of her husband
as a young man.

1332
01:51:35,905 --> 01:51:39,000
The great pharaoh come
to life again... in you!

1333
01:51:44,005 --> 01:51:46,373
Now have you any doubts?

1334
01:51:49,644 --> 01:51:51,423
Leave me alone here.

1335
01:53:04,084 --> 01:53:05,954
You know that
I've shown you the truth.

1336
01:53:06,687 --> 01:53:09,831
Yes, now I'm sure
that it's true.

1337
01:53:11,192 --> 01:53:13,476
But would Horemheb
ever accept such proof?

1338
01:53:13,479 --> 01:53:16,382
Of course not. He's eaten up
with his own ambition.

1339
01:53:16,465 --> 01:53:17,898
He's gone much too far.

1340
01:53:17,965 --> 01:53:20,348
He couldn't turn back now,
even if he wanted to.

1341
01:53:20,501 --> 01:53:23,413
That's why he must be killed,
along with Akhnaton.

1342
01:53:24,271 --> 01:53:27,180
You hold Egypt
in your hand, my brother.

1343
01:53:27,575 --> 01:53:29,009
The power
of a god is yours...

1344
01:53:29,076 --> 01:53:31,448
...if only you have
the courage to seize it.

1345
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,871
What's that?

1346
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:41,534
What is it?

1347
01:53:41,576 --> 01:53:43,462
Horemheb has began 
his holy war.

1348
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:47,966
Every follower of pharaoh's god
has been marked for death.

1349
01:53:48,796 --> 01:53:51,633
- A massacre!
- Why should we care?

1350
01:53:51,635 --> 01:53:53,789
Let Horemheb prepare
the ground for us.

1351
01:53:53,901 --> 01:53:55,853
When my brother is dead,
and we rule...

1352
01:53:55,888 --> 01:53:58,044
...we'll be better off
without these fanatics.

1353
01:53:59,673 --> 01:54:01,075
Let them go!

1354
01:54:38,946 --> 01:54:41,048
Merit! Merit!

1355
01:54:41,148 --> 01:54:43,060
Master! Master!

1356
01:54:45,419 --> 01:54:47,822
- Where's your mother?
- We were separated.

1357
01:54:48,489 --> 01:54:50,778
Kaptah listen,
get the boy down to the docks.

1358
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:53,153
Here, take this money
and these jewels.

1359
01:54:53,828 --> 01:54:56,797
Find a boat. Buy one. 
Steal it if you have to!

1360
01:54:56,864 --> 01:54:58,006
And you?

1361
01:54:58,399 --> 01:54:59,400
I'll find Merit.

1362
01:54:59,467 --> 01:55:01,903
We'll come to you when we can.
But don't wait for us.

1363
01:55:01,927 --> 01:55:03,460
- Get the boy out of the city!
- Yes.

1364
01:55:03,462 --> 01:55:04,616
I want to go with you.

1365
01:55:04,672 --> 01:55:06,952
No. You must go
with Kaptah, my son.

1366
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:09,877
Now hurry.

1367
01:55:12,355 --> 01:55:13,470
Hurry!

1368
01:55:29,747 --> 01:55:30,851
Stop them!

1369
01:55:35,202 --> 01:55:36,326
Is this yours?

1370
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:38,849
I never saw it
before in my life.

1371
01:55:38,905 --> 01:55:41,509
You're lying!
I saw you throw it away!

1372
01:55:42,576 --> 01:55:44,077
Be sensible, captain.

1373
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:46,314
Do I look like a follower
of the accursed Aton?

1374
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,115
They're simple people,
honest people.

1375
01:55:48,182 --> 01:55:49,921
I am the biggest rogue
in all Egypt.

1376
01:55:49,984 --> 01:55:51,662
Is this your cross?

1377
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:56,088
Captain, you have an honest
and intelligent face.

1378
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:00,394
I always collaborate with the soldiers.
I a was soldier myself.

1379
01:56:00,398 --> 01:56:03,834
In fact, I gave my eye
for my country.

1380
01:56:03,939 --> 01:56:06,014
- Well if that's all...
- Kill him!

1381
01:56:07,067 --> 01:56:08,692
Kill me for a thousand crimes...

1382
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:10,526
...but not for one
I never committed!

1383
01:56:11,205 --> 01:56:14,360
I hate the gods!
And the gods hate me.

1384
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:17,311
Oh, take everything then.

1385
01:56:17,344 --> 01:56:20,848
Take that, jewelry, silver...

1386
01:56:20,915 --> 01:56:22,378
...everything I have.

1387
01:56:31,159 --> 01:56:32,790
You've made a beggar out of me.

1388
01:56:32,816 --> 01:56:34,959
I will starve to death
for as long as I live.

1389
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:36,063
Let him go!

1390
01:56:37,965 --> 01:56:39,232
Come on!

1391
01:56:40,401 --> 01:56:42,736
What can you pay?
What can you pay?

1392
01:56:43,003 --> 01:56:44,815
Give me your jewels!

1393
01:56:44,839 --> 01:56:47,635
Go aboard! Only those
who can pay can go aboard!

1394
01:56:48,175 --> 01:56:50,647
Give me your jewels!
Give me your gold!

1395
01:56:51,112 --> 01:56:53,334
Only those who can pay
can go aboard!

1396
01:56:53,389 --> 01:56:55,040
Come on, step up!

1397
01:56:56,450 --> 01:56:59,854
Kaptah, how can we pay?
You gave those soldiers everything.

1398
01:57:02,022 --> 01:57:03,530
Not quite everything.

1399
01:57:14,702 --> 01:57:16,966
Savings of a dishonest lifetime.

1400
01:57:17,471 --> 01:57:18,923
Come on! Come on!

1401
01:57:20,007 --> 01:57:22,334
- Please! Please!
- What can you pay?

1402
01:57:22,337 --> 01:57:24,305
Take this ruby.
The child won't take up much room.

1403
01:57:24,388 --> 01:57:25,398
All right, let him go.

1404
01:57:25,479 --> 01:57:27,438
Only those who can pay
can go aboard!

1405
01:57:27,498 --> 01:57:29,518
- Come along!
- There, sit here.

1406
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:33,972
Well...

1407
01:57:34,278 --> 01:57:37,916
...I fear that at my age,
and all innocence...

1408
01:57:38,192 --> 01:57:39,989
...I'm becoming a father.

1409
01:57:46,066 --> 01:57:47,321
Thoth!

1410
01:57:51,705 --> 01:57:52,830
Thoth!

1411
01:58:38,886 --> 01:58:40,115
Kneel!

1412
01:58:40,755 --> 01:58:43,307
Aim! Shoot!

1413
01:59:16,098 --> 01:59:17,417
Merit!

1414
01:59:18,968 --> 01:59:20,342
Merit!

1415
01:59:24,899 --> 01:59:26,344
Sinuhe!

1416
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:38,638
No!

1417
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:43,084
Merit! Merit!

1418
01:59:49,924 --> 01:59:51,375
Thoth?

1419
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:54,395
He's with Kaptah.

1420
01:59:54,762 --> 01:59:56,704
With Kaptah he'll be safe.

1421
02:00:03,938 --> 02:00:05,671
Hold me, my love!

1422
02:00:19,253 --> 02:00:20,647
Merit!

1423
02:00:39,407 --> 02:00:41,706
Take the ones that are still alive
to the dungeon!

1424
02:00:41,976 --> 02:00:44,011
I want this temple torn down,
every stone of it!

1425
02:00:44,036 --> 02:00:46,080
- Yes, commander!
- Archers, follow me.

1426
02:00:48,349 --> 02:00:50,430
I'm sorry, my friend.
It had to be done.

1427
02:00:50,785 --> 02:00:53,713
It wasn't you that killed her,
but that madman in the palace.

1428
02:00:55,389 --> 02:00:57,055
He and his One God.

1429
02:00:58,192 --> 02:01:00,561
She believed in his god,
and she's dead.

1430
02:01:03,531 --> 02:01:06,988
- Is he still alive?
- Yes, he's at the palace.

1431
02:01:07,401 --> 02:01:10,061
Then go to the palace
and I'll meet you there before dawn.

1432
02:01:48,807 --> 02:01:50,529
How will you give it to him?

1433
02:01:50,827 --> 02:01:51,944
In a cup of wine...

1434
02:01:51,969 --> 02:01:55,201
- ...when you and I drink with him.
- I?

1435
02:01:55,781 --> 02:01:58,382
We're bound together
in this business, Horemheb.

1436
02:01:58,424 --> 02:02:01,441
As we we've always been bound,
since we were boys together.

1437
02:02:01,887 --> 02:02:04,210
Since what we do
is for the good of Egypt...

1438
02:02:04,357 --> 02:02:06,844
...you should be honored
to have a direct part in it.

1439
02:02:08,728 --> 02:02:10,382
Go and make sure he is awake.

1440
02:02:10,563 --> 02:02:12,306
Arrange for our audience.

1441
02:02:13,232 --> 02:02:16,976
Don't worry.
What's needed, will be in pharaoh's cup.

1442
02:02:57,351 --> 02:02:59,937
You finally came to your senses.

1443
02:03:02,815 --> 02:03:04,936
Why did you leave me there
in the street?

1444
02:03:04,978 --> 02:03:06,018
Where did you go?

1445
02:03:06,886 --> 02:03:08,393
To bury a dream.

1446
02:03:09,322 --> 02:03:11,278
It's dead now and forgotten.

1447
02:03:13,059 --> 02:03:14,769
For pharaoh...

1448
02:03:16,838 --> 02:03:18,330
...for Horemheb...

1449
02:03:20,866 --> 02:03:22,280
For me.

1450
02:03:22,335 --> 02:03:23,578
What do you mean?

1451
02:03:24,237 --> 02:03:25,871
Horemheb's no fool.

1452
02:03:25,972 --> 02:03:28,740
How can I persuade him to drink,
unless I drink as well?

1453
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:31,615
- But you'll die!
- I'm a physician.

1454
02:03:31,877 --> 02:03:33,412
This oil will smother
the poison...

1455
02:03:33,415 --> 02:03:36,467
...until I can come back here
and swallow this emetic.

1456
02:03:36,591 --> 02:03:38,417
And if something goes wrong?

1457
02:03:40,293 --> 02:03:42,059
Then I'll die in any case.

1458
02:03:44,156 --> 02:03:46,056
Be careful my brother.

1459
02:03:46,092 --> 02:03:47,693
I'll be waiting for you.

1460
02:03:47,893 --> 02:03:50,062
Let's not pretend, my sister,
that our bargain...

1461
02:03:50,065 --> 02:03:52,175
...is for anything but power.

1462
02:03:55,735 --> 02:03:58,314
Perhaps you can't be blamed
for the evil in you.

1463
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:03,109
It's not your fault 
that you were warped and twisted...

1464
02:04:03,113 --> 02:04:06,550
...like a tree forced to flower forever,
and never bear fruit.

1465
02:04:07,855 --> 02:04:10,119
What you are,
you were made to be by others...

1466
02:04:12,385 --> 02:04:14,287
...but I made 
the evil in myself...

1467
02:04:14,294 --> 02:04:15,793
...and I know it for evil.

1468
02:04:18,699 --> 02:04:19,986
You must go.

1469
02:04:30,244 --> 02:04:32,519
Sinuhe, open the door.

1470
02:04:38,878 --> 02:04:40,267
Sinuhe!

1471
02:04:47,595 --> 02:04:48,857
Why did you bar the door?

1472
02:04:48,883 --> 02:04:51,451
I couldn't be sure
that it would be you who came.

1473
02:04:54,226 --> 02:04:55,840
Is everything ready?

1474
02:04:56,395 --> 02:04:58,754
He's in the great hall
praying to his One God.

1475
02:05:02,501 --> 02:05:03,965
Which cup is his?

1476
02:05:04,403 --> 02:05:06,173
The one he will take.

1477
02:05:53,303 --> 02:05:54,721
Well, welcome, my friends.

1478
02:05:54,787 --> 02:05:57,867
We come to you as friends, Sire,
for we both love you.

1479
02:05:58,824 --> 02:06:00,069
I know.

1480
02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:03,313
We were just speaking of the time
the three of us first met on the desert.

1481
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:06,192
Yes, it was at sunrise.

1482
02:06:07,466 --> 02:06:10,378
I hoped that day would be
a sunrise for the world.

1483
02:06:12,104 --> 02:06:15,174
But you killed a lion,
his blood spilled out on the sand.

1484
02:06:15,196 --> 02:06:17,311
Violence must be met
with violence.

1485
02:06:18,477 --> 02:06:21,256
Drink, Sire.
To our memories.

1486
02:06:26,152 --> 02:06:28,225
Does Sinuhe invite me to drink?

1487
02:06:29,255 --> 02:06:30,529
Yes.

1488
02:06:46,422 --> 02:06:49,778
Have I drunk... death, Sinuhe?

1489
02:06:51,344 --> 02:06:52,697
Yes, Sire.

1490
02:06:58,517 --> 02:07:00,122
So be it.

1491
02:07:05,091 --> 02:07:06,814
The fault is mine.

1492
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:11,491
You gave me what I asked for,
but I was wrong to ask it.

1493
02:07:12,498 --> 02:07:14,329
I was weak.

1494
02:07:14,533 --> 02:07:17,025
I thought my god
had forsaken me...

1495
02:07:17,637 --> 02:07:19,562
...but he hadn't, Sinuhe.

1496
02:07:19,805 --> 02:07:22,020
Nor have you killed him,
as you believe.

1497
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:26,373
Horemheb seeks to kill him
by tearing down his temples...

1498
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:30,985
...but the house of god
is all creation.

1499
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:35,787
Tear down the mountains,
empty the seas...

1500
02:07:36,055 --> 02:07:38,789
...strip the sky of stars...

1501
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:43,503
...and still
you haven't touched god.

1502
02:07:49,135 --> 02:07:51,223
I see it clearly now.

1503
02:07:51,437 --> 02:07:53,809
I thought God
was the face of the Sun...

1504
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:56,224
...and thus I made his image.

1505
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:03,017
But God is more.

1506
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,483
Much more.

1507
02:08:06,294 --> 02:08:10,045
The sun is just a symbol
of his warmth...

1508
02:08:10,322 --> 02:08:12,248
...of his creative power.

1509
02:08:12,758 --> 02:08:15,920
He is no idol,
no tangible thing...

1510
02:08:16,862 --> 02:08:19,208
...but the creator of all things.

1511
02:08:19,799 --> 02:08:23,870
The loving spirit
that lives in all our hearts.

1512
02:08:25,204 --> 02:08:27,756
I'm fortunate beyond other men...

1513
02:08:28,549 --> 02:08:30,884
...that he permitted me
to recognize him.

1514
02:08:41,871 --> 02:08:44,972
Stay close to me, Sinuhe friend.

1515
02:08:47,869 --> 02:08:49,807
I cannot see you well...

1516
02:08:50,029 --> 02:08:51,997
...but there is no pain.

1517
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,488
I gave you no pain, Sire.

1518
02:08:55,635 --> 02:08:57,826
Nor does my death matter.

1519
02:08:58,571 --> 02:09:02,373
I was no more than a shadow
of things to come.

1520
02:09:02,909 --> 02:09:05,201
One voice that spoke for him.

1521
02:09:06,145 --> 02:09:08,514
But there will be other voices...

1522
02:09:08,915 --> 02:09:11,017
...clearer than mine.

1523
02:09:11,384 --> 02:09:14,603
For the hearts of men
will not be denied forever.

1524
02:09:15,588 --> 02:09:17,688
God is in us all...

1525
02:09:19,158 --> 02:09:20,760
...and one day...

1526
02:09:21,427 --> 02:09:24,226
...in his own good time,
he will speak out...

1527
02:09:24,931 --> 02:09:27,937
...in words that
cannot be misunderstood.

1528
02:09:34,774 --> 02:09:37,118
The others lied to me, Sinuhe...

1529
02:09:38,311 --> 02:09:41,080
...but I think 
you really loved me.

1530
02:09:47,353 --> 02:09:50,013
God forgives everything, Sinuhe.

1531
02:09:50,723 --> 02:09:52,675
He forgives you.

1532
02:10:03,703 --> 02:10:05,037
Poor soul...

1533
02:10:06,005 --> 02:10:07,978
...he was mad to the end.

1534
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:12,692
I will make sacrifice
to the gods on his behalf.

1535
02:10:15,490 --> 02:10:17,258
They won't refuse me now...

1536
02:10:19,143 --> 02:10:20,704
...for I am one of them.

1537
02:10:22,438 --> 02:10:24,201
I am Egypt!

1538
02:10:26,776 --> 02:10:27,777
Your cup, Sinuhe!

1539
02:10:28,845 --> 02:10:30,046
Drink with me.

1540
02:10:31,514 --> 02:10:34,157
Drink to the beginning
of a new Egypt!

1541
02:10:34,584 --> 02:10:36,178
Horemheb...

1542
02:10:36,452 --> 02:10:38,133
...don't drink it...

1543
02:10:38,654 --> 02:10:40,156
...or you won't be Egypt...

1544
02:10:40,223 --> 02:10:41,811
...or anything.

1545
02:10:46,028 --> 02:10:48,128
You dared!

1546
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:50,688
Put on the crown
and go to the princess.

1547
02:10:51,567 --> 02:10:55,161
She will be greatly surprised,
for it isn't you she expects.

1548
02:10:55,671 --> 02:10:58,966
But you can prevail,
and make yourself divine.

1549
02:11:00,476 --> 02:11:01,978
You really dared!

1550
02:11:02,044 --> 02:11:04,170
You're the pharaoh
that Egypt wants.

1551
02:11:04,881 --> 02:11:06,960
But that isn't
why I spared you.

1552
02:11:07,783 --> 02:11:09,910
Don't thank me for your life.

1553
02:11:10,887 --> 02:11:13,684
Thank this poor sick fool here.

1554
02:11:15,491 --> 02:11:17,837
For it was he
who saved us both.

1555
02:11:18,094 --> 02:11:19,812
Saved me?

1556
02:11:22,331 --> 02:11:23,799
Are you mad too?

1557
02:11:24,267 --> 02:11:25,992
I am pharaoh!

1558
02:12:56,125 --> 02:12:58,003
Silence!

1559
02:12:58,045 --> 02:13:00,911
Pharaoh comes! 
On your faces!

1560
02:13:00,953 --> 02:13:03,832
On your faces
before the Living God!

1561
02:13:54,475 --> 02:13:56,005
Sire!

1562
02:13:56,047 --> 02:13:57,845
The commanders
of the defeated armies...

1563
02:13:58,112 --> 02:14:00,182
...beg mercy of pharaoh.

1564
02:14:01,048 --> 02:14:02,922
I will deal with them later.

1565
02:14:03,651 --> 02:14:05,539
Let the physician come forward!

1566
02:14:16,097 --> 02:14:18,442
- On your knees!
- Let him stand!

1567
02:14:25,206 --> 02:14:27,457
What are the charges
against this man?

1568
02:14:28,276 --> 02:14:30,790
He has publicly spoken
against pharaoh.

1569
02:14:30,832 --> 02:14:34,207
He has belittled pharaoh's victories
in Syria and the land of the Hittites.

1570
02:14:34,248 --> 02:14:36,292
He has blasphemed
against the gods...

1571
02:14:36,295 --> 02:14:38,976
...and committed other acts
of treason, without number.

1572
02:14:39,454 --> 02:14:42,066
Once we stood together
before this throne...

1573
02:14:42,108 --> 02:14:43,963
...and you spoke up for my life.

1574
02:14:45,994 --> 02:14:48,470
Is there anyone here
who will speak up for this man?

1575
02:14:53,901 --> 02:14:56,016
You, my devoted wife?

1576
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,941
No.

1577
02:15:04,178 --> 02:15:06,114
You will have to speak
for yourself, physician.

1578
02:15:06,281 --> 02:15:08,201
Not for myself, Sire...

1579
02:15:09,330 --> 02:15:12,451
...but for one whose memory
you've tried to wipe out.

1580
02:15:13,062 --> 02:15:15,541
Whose very name
you've sought to destroy.

1581
02:15:15,832 --> 02:15:17,033
For Akhenaten!

1582
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,324
Do you flaunt
your treason in my face?

1583
02:15:19,369 --> 02:15:21,377
That name is forbidden!

1584
02:15:21,872 --> 02:15:23,206
Take care, physician...

1585
02:15:23,306 --> 02:15:26,109
- ...or I will...
- Will? Will? What you will?

1586
02:15:26,676 --> 02:15:28,799
You will go to war,
and win a battle?

1587
02:15:29,045 --> 02:15:32,564
You will conquer, and not know
that it is defeat?

1588
02:15:32,982 --> 02:15:36,403
You will raise Egypt to glory,
and watch her die?

1589
02:15:36,653 --> 02:15:39,605
We live in the twilight
of our world, Horemheb...

1590
02:15:40,156 --> 02:15:42,358
...and you will be it's sunset.

1591
02:15:43,026 --> 02:15:45,762
Nations rise, only to fall.

1592
02:15:45,829 --> 02:15:49,999
Kings build mighty monuments
only to have them crumble into dust.

1593
02:15:50,076 --> 02:15:52,545
Glory flees like a shadow.

1594
02:15:52,712 --> 02:15:56,583
All these things have
the seeds of death in them.

1595
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:59,786
Only a thought can live.

1596
02:15:59,953 --> 02:16:02,890
Only a great truth
can grow and flourish...

1597
02:16:03,025 --> 02:16:05,258
...and a truth can not be killed.

1598
02:16:05,425 --> 02:16:09,969
It passes in secret,
from one man's heart to another.

1599
02:16:10,265 --> 02:16:13,310
It is given in a mother's milk
to her child.

1600
02:16:13,367 --> 02:16:16,270
Are you trying to tell me
that you'll fight against me?

1601
02:16:16,312 --> 02:16:18,178
Oh, you will win that too.

1602
02:16:18,272 --> 02:16:21,979
For if you fail to silence me,
you know what I'll do.

1603
02:16:22,021 --> 02:16:23,783
What will you do, physician?

1604
02:16:23,911 --> 02:16:25,933
I will go among the people...

1605
02:16:26,647 --> 02:16:30,636
...and try to answer the questions
that burden their hearts.

1606
02:16:30,918 --> 02:16:34,325
The questions that I've asked
myself all my life...

1607
02:16:34,422 --> 02:16:37,075
...wherever I wondered
in the world...

1608
02:16:37,992 --> 02:16:40,105
...and which were answered for me...

1609
02:16:40,661 --> 02:16:42,622
...by a dying man.

1610
02:16:43,564 --> 02:16:45,700
I will wear
the clothes of a slave...

1611
02:16:45,766 --> 02:16:48,089
...and kick the sandals
from my feet...

1612
02:16:48,886 --> 02:16:50,071
...and speak to the wives...

1613
02:16:50,074 --> 02:16:53,491
...as they fry their fish
before their mud huts by the river.

1614
02:16:53,697 --> 02:16:55,476
To the porters on the docks...

1615
02:16:55,843 --> 02:16:57,912
...to the smiths by their bellows...

1616
02:16:57,979 --> 02:17:00,117
...to the slaves
under their yokes...

1617
02:17:00,448 --> 02:17:02,110
...and I will say:

1618
02:17:02,951 --> 02:17:06,783
"A man cannot be judged
by the color of his skin...

1619
02:17:06,825 --> 02:17:10,947
...by his clothes,
his jewels, or his triumphs...

1620
02:17:11,593 --> 02:17:14,027
...but only by his heart.

1621
02:17:14,162 --> 02:17:17,457
A good man is better
than a bad man.

1622
02:17:17,499 --> 02:17:20,180
Justice is better than injustice.

1623
02:17:20,222 --> 02:17:24,581
He who uses mercy is superior
to him who uses violence...

1624
02:17:24,623 --> 02:17:26,787
...though the latter
call himself pharaoh...

1625
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:29,291
...and make himself
Master of the Earth.

1626
02:17:30,512 --> 02:17:32,586
We have but one master.

1627
02:17:32,847 --> 02:17:35,258
The God who made us all.

1628
02:17:35,517 --> 02:17:38,189
Only his truth is immortal...

1629
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:42,317
...and in his truth,
all men are equal.

1630
02:17:43,925 --> 02:17:46,063
No man is alone."

1631
02:17:57,773 --> 02:17:59,376
The sentence:

1632
02:18:00,175 --> 02:18:02,306
exile for life!

1633
02:18:29,305 --> 02:18:32,319
<i>I have spent my life
in seeking knowledge.</i>

1634
02:18:33,142 --> 02:18:35,233
<i>This is all I know.</i>

1635
02:18:38,848 --> 02:18:41,895
<i>I have written this
for you, my son...</i>

1636
02:18:42,018 --> 02:18:43,705
<i>...wherever you are...</i>

1637
02:18:43,747 --> 02:18:47,157
<i>...and for your children,
and your children's children.</i>

1638
02:18:48,004 --> 02:18:49,837
<i>It's a poor legacy...</i>

1639
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,801
<i>...but it's all I have.</i>
