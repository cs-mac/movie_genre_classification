1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,490
The next drama is based on
lives of real people. Some scenes have

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:05,140
been invented, and the facts have been
unified for the sake of the narrative.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,059
Are we ready? Good morning to both.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,459
Wait. Live with the green light.

5
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,459
Here we go.

6
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:14,399
Miss Blyton... You
must be one of the

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,299
most prolific writers
of all time.

8
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:19,098
Yes, probably I am.

9
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:22,498
Although there have been rumors
malicious about a...

10
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:25,138
...The idea that
I write my own books.

11
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:28,417
I would like to make
clear, here and now that

12
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:31,657
these rumors have no
baseless.

13
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,977
- Of course, I have suggested
no time... - It is very important...

14
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:38,296
make clear that, for the sake
all my young readers.

15
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:40,296
Trust me implicitly.

16
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:42,996
No matter if they are in palaces
or tenements, take

17
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,656
a sense of my books
security, a sense

18
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,135
be subject to
something, and knowledge

19
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:50,575
what is right and what is wrong.

20
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,295
You've said it before and I say again.

21
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:56,055
I am the guardian of
ethics of our children.

22
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:59,494
But how I can keep
that position if there

23
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,894
the slightest doubt
I'm not what I look like?

24
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:26,342
YOUR FORUM TIME SERIES AND FILM

25
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:57,809
- Sorry.
- This is the third cold that you have this month.

26
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:04,488
If you have not got rid of him by the end
of weeks, I have to say goodbye.

27
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,208
Fit for Friday,
or you're fired.

28
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:20,526
Oh, lovely.

29
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,125
Lady...

30
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,605
Miss Blyton.

31
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,125
Miss Blyton...

32
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,764
Anything to say to
allegations, Miss Blyton?

33
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,924
Are you a fraud?

34
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:51,523
Are you a fraud? Why
children should read these books?

35
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:54,843
Miss Blyton, shall we go?

36
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,523
I feel all this, Miss Blyton.

37
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,042
Children are waiting. Are
excited to meet her.

38
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,682
- The shelter, shelter.
- Yes, of course.

39
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,962
Thank you. Thank you very much.

40
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,962
How charming. Charming.

41
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:13,121
- All quiet now, children.
- Hello everybody. How are you?

42
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,841
- Hello, Miss Blyton.
- You seem great.

43
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,161
All so smart.

44
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,840
Look what I brought.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Today I read my
book, The Secret Island.

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,880
First of all, is there anything
you please ask?

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
- Yo, Miss! Yo, Miss!
- Oh, my God.

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,839
Let me see.

49
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,399
Where do I start?

50
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,879
You know, children...?

51
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,758
I believe that childhood
is a magical time.

52
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,837
- Hey, Hanly.
- Yes?

53
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:54,597
Come here... I have you!

54
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,157
Back.

55
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,397
Hey! Carey come here.

56
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,876
And Enid, what is this?

57
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,076
- A sycamore.
- Okay. Y... "?

58
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:10,276
And this beauty, eh?

59
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,595
Hague.

60
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,115
Look at that. Mira.

61
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,195
Is not it beautiful?

62
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,275
Thomas, these children are starving.
They need to eat and have a cold.

63
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:24,234
Do you care about something
or you do not care?

64
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,274
Come on, guys.

65
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,794
Come.

66
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,871
Oh, for God's sake, Theresa, for!

67
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,151
After all this time,
How could you do this?

68
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:01,631
You who led me to do it!

69
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,830
"Enid?

70
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:15,309
Come.

71
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,029
Gets inside.

72
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,709
Let me tell you a story.

73
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:24,428
Children and dogs were Snapper
enjoying a vacation on the coast.

74
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:30,028
Snapper was the dog
fair and sweet in the world.

75
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,988
Snapper never disappoint them,

76
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:34,827
but always had
getting into trouble.

77
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,427
Mother had prepared
with a great picnic

78
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,987
all the things that
like children,

79
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,547
but children were not realized
Snapper that had escaped without them.

80
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,466
Wake up, guys.
I have something to say.

81
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,545
Your father has abandoned us.

82
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,665
"Dropped what?

83
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,384
- To us.
- No!

84
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:09,224
Your father has been found
another woman, Enid.

85
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,704
Enid, come here.

86
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:14,863
Enid!

87
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:20,383
Enid, listen.

88
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,903
Enid...

89
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,340
She drew the curtains

90
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,020
and looked toward the cliffs.

91
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,820
There was a secret path.

92
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,219
One who did not know anyone else

93
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,459
descending to the cave
rock, with its secret tunnel.

94
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,299
There might escape.

95
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,738
Enid.

96
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,538
- Will return.
- I will not.

97
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:17,057
What is supposed to
I tell people?

98
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,817
Tell them the truth. Me
I'm preparing for

99
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:20,537
be a professor, not by joining a circus.

100
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:23,897
- It is not good. You should...
- Stay home and sew socks?

101
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,936
I know.

102
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:28,696
That's what I've said.

103
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,576
What about your siblings?

104
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,894
"Dear Sirs,
I send my book

105
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:50,454
poems and short stories
to your kind attention. "

106
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:53,574
"Although I am preparing
to be a teacher,

107
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:56,653
My true ambition is
to become writers. "

108
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:00,733
"And I hope you find
potential in my work. "

109
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:05,013
"Sincerely, Enid Blyton."

110
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,732
"Dear Miss Blyton,"

111
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,772
"Although we found
his writing..."

112
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:12,972
".. The most entertaining
unfortunately, not

113
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:16,132
site in our list
Current. I hope that..."

114
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:18,611
".. In our meeting
Last week's editorial. "

115
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,011
"However, we regret
inform you that we did not find..."

116
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:25,891
".. As we were with your work, but
we have no place in our current list. "

117
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:28,430
"My advice to all
young writers

118
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,930
is to keep trying. Sincerely...".

119

'When I grow up, do not forget
I think things today. "

120
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,849
'Do not forget the kind of thing
I like to do or say. "

121
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,129
'Do not be like the people I meet
that seem too old '

122
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,848
'And have forgotten things
did when they were eight years old. "

123
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:51,568
'There are many other things,
Of course, also remember. "

124
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:56,688
'And then, when I grow up, remember
what they like to do to children. "

125
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,967
'I will know what they are afraid'

126

00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:08,086
'But know that long
I spent eight years. "

129
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:10,206
"Dear Miss Blyton,
please send

130
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,286
his manuscript of poems and stories. "

131
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:15,486
"Would you please call us at
our office for an appointment "

132
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:17,646
"Able to talk about
their job much better? "

133

"Sincerely, Hugh Pollock."

134
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,765
So, Miss Blyton, suffice it to say,

135
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:26,645
we can do something with their
stories, and definitely we will.

136
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,684
Can we talk about it in the food?

137
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,963
Of course, but above all
we recruit, right?

138
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:45,163
Autograph where I put the cross, here.

139
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,641
Congratulations, Ms. Pollock.

140
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,720
- Mr. Pollock.
- You're not

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,960
Miss Blyton.

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
Do not look, no matter what happens.

143
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,119
Do you understand me?

144
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,679
Do not look. Do not look.

145
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,519
- Mmm, weighed.
- Open it.

146
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:36,278
Thank you. Thank you.

147
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:49,077
But do not talk.

148
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,796
Ese.

149
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,716
That no.

150
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,236
Ese.

151
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,315
That no.

152
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:04,635
- What is wrong with that?
- No.

153
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:08,155
- I like it.
- Okay, I do not. No. Not really.

154
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:12,594
All right, I like it.

155
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,914
It's my book.

156
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,994
That down now.

157
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:26,753
- I have two children.
- Two? - How minimum.

158
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,912
Well, how I can explain this?

159
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:44,071
Her uterus to be frank, is the
a girl of twelve or thirteen.

160
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,671
- What? - It seems that there is no
developed properly.

161
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,311
My God.

162
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:52,470
- Does that mean...?
- Not at all.

163
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,910
While explaining why he
had problems in that regard.

164
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,930
No, now we
give treatment

165
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,910
hormone injections
that should fix it.

166
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,949
Indeed,

167
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:10,389
I wondered if he would mind
sign this for my granddaughter.

168
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:15,388
Of course, I love it.

169
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,268
She's crazy about Enid Blyton.

170
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,667
How likely
I have, indeed, of...

171
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:28,347
- .. Conceive?
- Half and half.

172
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,147
Maybe something else.

173
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:36,746
I am a woman
determined, Dr. Beresford.

174
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:38,666
If I want a baby

175
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:41,626
I have one.

176
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,864
Sshhh. Para.

177
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:01,304
Stop!

178
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,542
Dear children, I have news.

179
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,622
Could you guess what it is?

180
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,422
Well, I'll tell you.

181
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:21,902
We have a new pet in the family.

182
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:27,261
It is a sister to Gillian and
Bobs a new friend to the dog.

183
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:32,301
It's a sweet little thing,
as good and almost never cries.

184
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,660
For the love of God.

185
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,739
Scandal is often
arming. What happens?

186
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,618
I have no idea, Buns.
Gillian was exactly the same.

187
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,458
What am I supposed to do?

188
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,198
I'm trying to write my
column for "Teacher's Worid."

189
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,898
Could not take you a few days off?

190
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,218
I have a deadline
comply. I have never exceeded

191
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,498
a deadline in my life
and I will not start now.

192
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,137
Maybe we should take it
in arms, what do you think?

193
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,337
Throw I do not want to lose, Hugh.

194
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:13,697
You have to learn.

195
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:18,296
Moreover, if that
stop the scandal...

196
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,136
Come on.

197
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,176
This can not continue.

198
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,773
She is charming,

199
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:48,533
but loves to hear your
voice, as can be heard.

200
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,533
"His eldest daughter was babysitting?

201
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,173
Oh, yes, from day one.

202
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:54,932
Otherwise, there were no
able to complete any work.

203
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,792
I must say, I think it is very difficult

204
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,452
cope with them
when they are so small.

205
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,191
I imagined that
would do better, frankly,

206
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,891
but seems not to know
what to do with them.

207
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,631
Well, do not worry.
Most women

208
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,331
feel they are
failing in some way.

209
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,571
They imagine that everybody
manages extremely well.

210
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:19,370
- Of course you do not.
- Well, it's a relief. Come to visit.

211
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,210
See? It is absolutely terrifying.

212
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,610
Right, Bobs?

213
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,568
My God, how did that happen?

214
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,668
Well, I am a midwife, that helps, but

215
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:41,728
really is just a matter of confidence.

216
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:45,008
It is a beautiful child.

217
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:48,967
I guess it's pretty good, right?

218
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,927
But it's so bad.

219
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,167
Just a week.

220
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,846
And it's stubborn, you see.

221
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:59,706
A baby of one week
no concepts...

222
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,526
Believe very much in making piles
of fresh air invigorating.

223
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,486
When not in her stroller,
will be here in the room.

224
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,825
Among the four and five
children spend an hour

225
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,125
me, unless, by
course, is in London.

226
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:12,245
What do you think?

227
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,885
It seems very clear.

228
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:18,124
Well, I'm glad.

229
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:20,244
And please call me Dorothy.

230
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,044
I will,

231
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,644
and you shall call Enid.

232
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:38,762
Mail your fans.

233
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:42,122
Oh, lovely. Lots.

234
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:45,762
"We get into the new book?

235
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,201
Oh, it's a waste of
time. You do not have

236
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,601
prove that you have read
everything I've written.

237
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,321
How charming.

238
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,280
Would you mind sharing the joke?

239
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
Es..

240
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,600
Do not worry, do not understand.

241
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,478
That's the sound of a happy baby.

242
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,398
Is not it a blessing?

243
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,757
- God, I hope to stay with Dorothy
us forever. - Who is Dorothy?

244
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:33,997
For the love of God, Hugh,
know who he is. The Nanny.

245
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:36,436
Oh, now is Dorothy,
Right? Very cozy.

246
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,836
Not be foolish, Buns.
It's my new friend.

247
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:44,236
- I thought I was your friend.
- Still are.

248
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,116
Tonto.

249
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,795
- Let's make the proofs
within minutes... - Who is "us"?

250
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:57,275
Dorothy. It helped me as
corrective "The Adventures of Bobs."

251
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,534
I see. So it's a
and a trained babysitter

252
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,754
- Qualified proofreader.
- Leave protest, Hugh.

253
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:05,394
Look! There is still light outside. We play
a game of French cricket?

254
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,474
- No, thanks.
- Come on.

255
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:10,553
If not, I'll write a story about you:
"The Horrible Hugh hating fun."

256
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:12,313
Come on, come out.

257
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:14,633
You win.

258
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,592
Almost. Not good enough.

259
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:32,431
Come on.

260
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:37,791
You are not allowed to approach
More. You have to

261
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,510
from where you caught.

262
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,510
Come on, Hugh. Yes!

263
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,990
Six for me! Six for me! I do.

264
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,870
Come on, Hugh.

265
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,989
Come on.

266
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:09,827
Pen... Pen.

267
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:56,783
"The chair was raised in the air,
flapping their wings heavily

268
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,583
"And headed for the door.

269
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:03,622
"When he left high rose
in the air immediately.

270
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:07,102
"Children remained strong
tied, the largest of the joys.

271
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:10,382
"Thank God
was back all right!

272
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,341
"Good, old chair of desires,

273
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,341
"What would you do without it?"

274
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,420
He had a good life, Enid.

275
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,340
He believed that the veterinarian
said it would be nice.

276
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,699
No. No, he did, honey.

277
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:35,219
Said...

278
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:49,578
"Bobs is playful today.

279
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:53,657
"I know what happens.

280
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:57,617
"Do you know?, Has hidden
one of my slippers,

281
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,977
"Has stolen a sausage from the kitchen,
right in the face of the cook

282
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,776
"And he has chewed a brush
of teeth to crush.

283
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:08,376
"Then he started to
laps around the house as if

284
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:10,936
was a puppy, and has drawn
at my feet like a gift.

285
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,215
"And not even lunchtime.

286
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:15,735
"It's a very naughty asshole."

287
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:37,013
- Do it, do it yourself, do it yourself.
- Do you want a drink?

288
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:39,053
I would take one.

289
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,573
Thank you, Hugh.

290
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:45,652
Try loading. I
see you do it again.

291
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,891
Gillian no, no. Come on.

292
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:02,571
Come, let us again then. Come.

293
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:05,250
Come on.

294
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,170
Smile. So. Very good.

295
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,450
Enid, here it is.

296
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,309
Hugh! For the love of
God, how you been?

297
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,129
Sorry, I'm not
permanently available, Enid.

298
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,449
- I have to work from time to time.
- Well, hurry.

299
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,849
- I'm almost ready.
- Stay here. About me.

300
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:22,249
Closer. No, closer, baby.

301
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,688
According...Girls, now, perhaps
This time, yes, look at the book.

302
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,208
Look what I write,
as if, you know, as if you

303
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,688
- I was reading to you.
Agreed. - Ready, big smile.

304
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:34,247
And Hugh, trying to smile, please.

305
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,767
- So okay?
- Come on, then.

306
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,367
Faster, faster, faster.

307
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,487
My poor father.

308
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,446
He would have loved
see the girls grow.

309
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:48,086
When did your mother?

310
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:52,246
Erm... Not long after
that I go away from home.

311
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,765
She would have liked
housewives were small.

312
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:57,525
That's what he wanted me to be.

313
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,125
My father... he was different. "

314
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,285
It was...

315
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,285
He really hoped things.

316
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:05,684
It was brilliant. Funny.

317
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:09,324
You could totally trust him.

318
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:11,404
Perfect, really.

319
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:13,324
Perfect.

320
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,483
For the love of God.

321
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,962
It has been a little difficult lately.

322
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:27,482
He believes that there will be another war.

323
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,002
Nonsense, I say.

324
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,442
Well, is working on a book
with sr. Churchill, right?

325
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:34,282
He is obliged to meet
that sort of thing.

326
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,341
Yes, but is so pessimistic.

327
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,361
It's hard for men
of his generation, Enid.

328
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:41,321
Are not really
recovered from the last war.

329
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:43,601
His nerves still
are broken into pieces.

330
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:46,280
Yes, but was so
elegant when I met him.

331
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
It was so strong.

332
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,960
So true...

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
...And so much fun.

334
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,239
Probably getting
a brave face, do not you think?

335
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,719
- It's my turn. Now. Come on.
- Come on, girls. - It's not fair.

336
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,198
Nanny, can you take to
girls in immediately?

337
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,238
- The noise is quite unbearable.
- Come on.

338
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:12,438
Tea. More tea.

339
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:17,317
What do you mean
your father was perfect?

340
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:20,317
In what sense was
perfect? I left, Enid.

341
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:21,837
Yes, my father is dead, Hugh.

342
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,376
Perfect, flawless.
A father deified

343
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:26,876
you left without even
look back.

344
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,736
You told me yourself in one, we must

345
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:30,556
recognize, rare moment of candor.

346
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,196
I know you're not too
fond of the truth.

347
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,515
I know I prefer the
bunnies and picnics and talk

348
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,795
- With bloody rag dolls.
- You're drunk.

349
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,795
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,155
Let me remind you of
where this goes.

351
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:48,114
And let me remind you that I make a
negligible contribution, Enid.

352
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,194
I see your idea of success is
directly related to the amount of

353
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,254
mail your fans
receive, but some

354
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,274
we have to go to
office every day.

355
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:56,633
- Yes, but my books, pay for all this.
- Who ordered your books, woman?

356
00:24:56,673 --> 00:24:58,353
Your contribution was secondary, Hugh.

357
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,073
If you think that meant something
only a slight effect

358
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:03,713
in my success, you must be crazy.

359
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:09,352
- Enid! - My father was twice
of a man than you'll ever.

360
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:11,472
Never forget that.

361
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,190
"Miss Enid Blyton, Green
Hedges..."" Miss Enid Blyton..."

362
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,470
"Dear Miss Blyton..." "Enid
Blyton, Green Hedges, Beaconsfield..."

363
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,389
"My name is Annabel. I am writing to
tell you what I think is brilliant..."

364
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:42,709
"My friend Matthew and I had
adventures, just like the ones..."

365
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,009
"In my garden, where we made a

366
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,269
cache called the
Pixie Pit. "

367
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,548
"I'm still waiting to see elves
but I have not done..."

368
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:53,508
"I like both your books,
especially Hurrah for the Circus. "

369
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:56,588
"Wish you were my mother and
much fun we could. "

370
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:58,107
"With love for Edward."

371
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:04,547
"Dear Edward. I know

372
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:09,706
"If you were my son, us
would spend very, very well. "

373
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:12,626
"These are the events
main today.

374
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:17,306
"Germany has invaded Poland and
has bombed many cities.

375
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:21,905
"A general mobilization was
orderly in Britain and France.

376
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:24,665
"Parliament has been summoned
for 6 this afternoon.

377
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,944
"Completed Orders

378
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:32,484
"Navy, Army and
Air Force were signed

379
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:35,984
by the King in the meeting this
later the Privy Council.

380
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,224
"The details will be given more
later in this advisory. "

381
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,302
Ah, girls.

382
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:54,422
This evening will come some
children at a tea party.

383
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,422
They won a competition for
My Famous Five launch.

384
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:02,261
Anyway, this is work well
could you upload it to your room?

385
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,261
And I do not hear you, how
agreement?. Excellent.

386
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,339
Hello, dear!

387
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:22,419
My name is Enid Blyton. Enter.

388
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:26,019
Welcome to my tea party of
Famous Five. You must be hungry.

389
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,979
- Have you brought all caps
your milk bottles? - Yes

390
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,658
Wonderful.

391
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:45,657
Who are these two girls
the stairs, Miss?

392
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,617
- Oh, these are my girls.
- Are not invited to the party, Miss Blyton?

393
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:52,936
Oh, no. No, they see me
all day, every day.

394
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,776
Its totally boring
silly old mom. You know,

395
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:58,616
I have to search my site
work between trips to the beach

396
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:03,415
picnics, games, and all those
things that children love to do.

397
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:09,975
Do not you love the gelatin
Raspberry? Delicious.

398
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:12,334
Do not you love how he dances in the mouth?

399
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:14,094
Now.

400
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:17,194
Have you remembered to bring
the caps of bottles

401
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,254
- Milk for poor children
Great Ormond Street? - Yes!

402
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,413
My God, have worked hard.

403
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:48,291
You know that last year earned more
money that the Minister of Economy?

404
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,251
I have published 23 books.

405
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,770
Good for you.

406
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,690
- How did the tea party?
- Wonderful.

407
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,210
- By the way, where have you been?
- I went to the pub.

408
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,729
It is not a crime right?

409
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,529
No.

410
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,849
No, of course not.

411
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,888
No, the party was a great success.

412
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,848
We ate each
bit of gelatin.

413
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,768
We are about
go to war, Enid.

414
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,488
Stop talking as always
same, Hugh, is very depressing.

415
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:21,648
- The reality usually is.
- Really?

416
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:25,607
- I thought you would be too dull
as to realize. - Oh, forgive me.

417
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,907
Maybe we should beat us
raspberry jelly

418
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:30,167
flagellate with ginger beer,
like you and your little fans.

419
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:32,526
They are not my fans, they are my friends.

420
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:35,406
- They are children, for the love of God!
- I get bored, Hugh, and you're drunk.

421
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:38,646
We are about to enter
war! Are you worried remotely?

422
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,566
Hell, no, let's stay with
Five famous right?

423
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:43,585
If you are going to be so
unpleasant, rather

424
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:45,565
to sleep on the
guest room, Hugh.

425
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,884
Cool. I will.

426
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,221
Miss Blyton, you are
probably the writer

427
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:28,921
Children's most famous
of all time.

428
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,441
Actually, I describe
myself as an author

429
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:34,160
- Which happens... you type for children.
- Of course, forgive me.

430
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,860
I wonder if we
count, Miss Blyton, which

431
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:39,520
believed to be the secret to
extraordinary success.

432
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Well, it really is very simple.

433
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,439
"I can enter the
world of a child you know? "

434
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:49,999
"I understand that instinctively
children want a story. "

435
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,038
"They do not want brutality
poverty or violence. "

436
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:57,278
"No, they want familiarity,
want comfort. "

437
00:30:57,318 --> 00:31:00,238
"And above all, want to escape..."

438
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:04,917
"A magical world
adventures without their parents. "

439
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,317
Well, you yourself have two daughters.

440
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:10,277
How manages to combine
motherhood with writing?

441
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:12,317
How many words in a day?

442
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:14,556
- Six thousand.
- God!

443
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:17,116
I think that Trollope wrote
More or less the same.

444
00:31:17,156 --> 00:31:19,676
- Really?
- No.

445
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:21,436
I have of course
to juggle.

446
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:23,516
But children need their mothers.

447
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,555
Mothers are
heart of any home.

448
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:29,355
"No, I try and get it, spend
much time with my girls, "

449
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,955
"While I meet
my professional duties. "

450
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:36,754
It is difficult, but I think I make do.

451
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,114
I am sure that
ago. Thank you, Miss Blyton.

452
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,633
Yes, yes, of course.

453
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:53,233
No, no, I understand.

454
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,152
Thank you. Goodbye.

455
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,751
Enid, I'm afraid I must go.

456
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,031
What?

457
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,550
They asked me to make me
by the military in Surrey.

458
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,190
- Why Surrey?
- Because that's where I've been asked

459
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,550
I go, Enid. This is where my
old regiment is established.

460
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,150
You could have said no.

461
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,849
Why did not you tell them no?

462
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,509
Because there is a damn
war going on!

463
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,229
Oh, I see.

464
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,709
You did not have the guts to
explain that you had

465
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:36,308
responsibilities
you have a family.

466
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:38,308
It is so typical, Hugh

467
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:42,348
Totally inconsiderate
totally selfish!

468
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,628
- What about us?
- Not everything is about you.

469
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,868
You can not leave your family no more!

470
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,467
This is ridiculous!

471
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,147
I'm not leaving anybody.
I have a duty to perform.

472
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,227
- You have a house full of
things to do. You have to Dorothy

473
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:53,267
jumping in the morning, noon and night.
- Okay.

474
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,387
Go then! Long! Go to Surrey!

475
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:58,346
Abandónanos, let
fix us alone!

476
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:16,744
# On the farm, every Friday

477
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:22,784
# On the farm, is the
day of rabbit pie,

478
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:27,423
# So, each Friday when it arrives,

479
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:33,223
# I get up early and
sing the little song

480
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:38,382
# Rabbit runs, rabbit
run, run, run, run

481
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:41,382
# Rabbit run, run rabbit

482
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:43,102
# Run, run, run

483
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,901
# Bang, bang, bang, it sounds
farmer's gun. #

484
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,580
"Hugh?

485
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,499
'Vuesto father is gone. "

486
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,179
'You're lying. "

487
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,979
'Daddy will never leave me. "

488
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:18,018
'I said I was the most
important in the world for him. "

489
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:26,778
"The little boy who came to live in
next door was not a pleasant child. "

490
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:30,137
"Never let children
join their games. "

491
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:34,697
"He was reserved and spoilers,
and only thinking of himself. "

492
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:37,577
"So the children
decided to punish him. "

493
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,456
It's pretty sweet, right?

494
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,375
Yes No I admire them too.

495
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,515
If you want to put names,
should be "Ration Meat

496
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:53,615
Bunny # 1 "and" Serving
rabbit meat 2. "

497
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:55,935
But Mommy, I do not want
we eat our rabbits!

498
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:57,855
We may have to do it.

499
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,494
Give it back to the hutch, and
continue with the garden, right?

500
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,694
- What are we planting today?
- Pinto beans, Mommy.

501
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:07,094
Delicious! What else?

502
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:09,493
I thought we had put
carrots and radishes here...

503
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:12,053
Madam, a gentleman
are here to see it.

504
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:14,493
My God, is now the time?

505
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,933
- The beans will have to wait.
- What? No! - No, inside, girls.

506
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:20,092
No, no discussions. You know how

507
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:22,212
- I hate children arguing.
- Oh please.

508
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:25,772
Nanny can help you to sew blankets
for the troops. It will be fun.

509
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:29,651
- Come on. - It's not fair. - Do not
sulked, Imogen. Do not get angry.

510
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:32,011
- Are they in the room, Maggie?
- Yes, ma'am.

511
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,590
Hello. My husband still
're stuck with

512
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:45,170
maneuvers somewhere
Surrey's dark.

513
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,970
I'm afraid it will
to settle with me.

514
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,649
"They find it disappointing?

515
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,729
Absolutely.

516
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:53,849
It is an honor and a pleasure.

517
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,369
Oh, well.

518
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:57,009
What a relief.

519
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,249
Anyone want something to drink?

520
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:05,368
- You made it happen. - Can
know a lot by the teeth of a man.

521
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,288
- Really?
- I speak of the teeth, yeah!

522
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:29,486
Dorothy! What a surprise! My God.

523
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:31,965
Sorry, I interrupting something? I had not
realized that you had company.

524
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:35,605
Eh... no, do not be silly.

525
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:37,325
No, come, come.

526
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:40,724
Good to see you.

527
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:44,684
No, these guys came to see
Hugh. They knew I was in Surrey.

528
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:47,084
Had to settle with me.

529
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,484
Want something to drink?

530
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:52,163
Vale. Yes I will take some sherry.

531
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:55,803
Thank you. Excellent. Sit down.

532
00:36:57,163 --> 00:36:58,963
It's fun.

533
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:05,122
You're welcome. You have been great fun.

534
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:08,282
Goodbye.

535
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,521
- Was not it lovely?
- Enid.

536
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:17,521
This is not a good idea.

537
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,881
- What?
- Are you crazy?

538
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,220
Think of the scandal
come to light if you

539
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:24,520
entertaining the troops
while Hugh is out.

540
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,300
- Imagine if he finds out.
- Oh, Hugh will

541
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:28,040
dancing the fandango with a prostitute.

542
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm sure you could not
care less what I do.

543
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,359
- Fandango to a prostitute?
- An adventure.

544
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,079
I totally secure.

545
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,239
It has always been the most terrible flirt.

546
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,838
Try to charm every woman who
known. Had not you ever noticed?

547
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:42,878
No.

548
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:46,358
Obviously, not flirtearía you.

549
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,438
Why obviously?

550
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:53,037
Well, you know...
respects too.

551
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:56,917
Enid, this is...

552
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,597
It is not appropriate.

553
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:01,877
You should be entertaining
soldiers at home.

554
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,476
Oh, Dorothy!

555
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:06,636
I'm here alone.

556
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:09,076
Working hard for the cause of
war, and I'm bored to tears.

557
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:11,076
What am I supposed to do?

558
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:14,475
Well, my sister throws a party
Bridge over the weekend.

559
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:17,875
- Why do not you come?
- Because it sounds absolutely terrifying.

560
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,474
Well, what fun.

561
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:35,313
A feast of bridge, no bridge.

562
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:38,793
Oh, Miss Blyton, The Truth is
I do not know where he has been Kenneth.

563
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:42,193
I told you, and
is willing to meet her.

564
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,472
Oh, thank God, here
is. Kenneth, here!

565
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:52,472
We are here with Miss. Blyton.

566
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:56,431
Sorry. A woman with indigestion.
I thought it was a heart attack.

567
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,991
His salvation has come to the bridge.

568
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:03,270
Of course, I know the two...

569
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,290
- Kenneth Waters. - Enid...
-...Blyton. His fame also

570
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,950
of his skill with
bridge, you come.

571
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,750
- Preceding.
- Excuse me?

572
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,909
Proceed is where it comes from something.
Preceded by what is ahead.

573
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:18,349
Until now known
of my fame, but for the

574
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,749
when nothing is known
My game of bridge.

575
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:23,908
I think you will find
the word is "precede."

576
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,588
Well, my God.

577
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:31,447
I came to play bridge, and I
I met my grammar

578
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:34,267
reviewed by an expert.
Obviously it's my lucky day.

579
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:36,127
I must warn you
I can not trust much

580
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,947
in this device and
I have sometimes

581
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:40,507
Call hearing problems, so I

582
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:43,027
Please refrain in advance.

583
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,426
I hope it is the
word. "It is,

584
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,546
Miss. Blyton?

585
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,706
Perfect.

586
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:54,385
Excellent. "I can?

587
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:02,065
It's quite extraordinary, you know.

588
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:03,564
Normally I can not hear one word

589
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:05,024
but with you, everything is
crystal clear.

590
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:09,784
You will need to do with
the timbre of your voice.

591
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,824
Have you ever been...?

592
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,943
No, no, no. Torpedoed I
during the war.

593
00:40:14,983 --> 00:40:17,383
And yet, I was more fortunate than others.

594
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,983
"We took our coffee in the lounge?

595
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:24,823
I'd love to.

596
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:27,222
With your permission.

597
00:40:27,262 --> 00:40:29,502
It really is not coffee. Is
hot, is brown, and is liquid.

598
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,502
And there the similarities end.

599
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,982
Chapote not, right?
My deadline is chapote.

600
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,540
You're not like imagined
it would be a writer.

601
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,300
I thought all writers were
vague and drawn, waiting for his muse.

602
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,180
Muses are nonsense. If you want
write, you sit down and write.

603
00:40:57,419 --> 00:41:00,379
Do they read my books your children?

604
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,939
I have none.

605
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:06,618
I've always wanted, but
No luck, I fear.

606
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:09,858
...And your wife?

607
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,498
Marriage is not, er...

608
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:13,898
how can I say...

609
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,057
not happy.

610
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:19,177
But tell me about yourself. Tell me everything.
Parents, brothers, sisters, everything.

611
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:21,777
"Husbands? My God, how many you had?

612
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:24,137
Only one.

613
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:26,096
Why?

614
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:28,496
It has not been happy. No.

615
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:39,735
I just do not understand why
I left home so young.

616
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:42,415
I suppose

617
00:41:42,455 --> 00:41:46,055
that after the father left,
could not wait to leave.

618
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,814
And then I never wanted to return.

619
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:51,334
I could not face any of them.

620
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,774
And your mother?

621
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:56,693
- Dead.
- Sorry.

622
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:01,053
You know, for years I thought it was
my fault that my father is gone.

623
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:02,973
He thought I

624
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:05,293
should have done something
terribly bad.

625
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:09,892
That was a kind of evil,

626
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:13,332
very, very black, inside of me.

627
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:15,252
If not, why march?

628
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,491
Of course he will not quit.

629
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:19,251
Left to your mother.

630
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:22,451
I'm sure you wanted
with every fiber of your being.

631
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,051
Why should I?

632
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:32,170
God had never spoken
about it with anyone.

633
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,850
Your attitude should be comprehensive.

634
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,489
Not because we are...

635
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:48,368
It was much more fun
than I expected.

636
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:52,328
And Kenneth, that lovely surgeon.

637
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,008
He is married, Enid.

638
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,487
Charming. Thank you.

639
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:14,406
Is Dad?

640
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:16,526
Yes, yes it is.

641
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:24,565
'"Exploring the island!" cried Anne,
I was climbing the rocks. "

642
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:29,244
'"Oh, come on Oh, come on!"'

643
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:33,164
'It was a small natural harbor.
Nestled under the tall rocks. "

644
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:37,764
'The water was like glass,
and just had a flaw. "

645
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:40,163
'George was very happy. "

646
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:44,643
'He had often visited the island
before but always alone, except for Tim. "

647
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:49,242
'He had always vowed never,
ever, would anyone there, '

648
00:43:49,282 --> 00:43:52,322
'Because that would spoil the island
her. But he had not spoiled. "

649
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:55,482
'It had become much more enjoyable. "

650
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,841
Girls!

651
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,041
Girls, come here.

652
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,521
I want you to know someone.

653
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:11,280
Girls.

654
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,520
This is a friend of mom, sr. Waters.

655
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,640
He came to dinner. Is not it wonderful?

656
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,079
Well? What?

657
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,039
- How are you? How are you?
- Perhaps nothing of shaking hands. No.

658
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,559
- Why do not we teach what you do?
- Okay. Yes.

659
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:32,478
- It's wonderful, right?
- I did not know, er...

660
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:34,158
A garden.

661
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,878
- Where are you taking me?
- Just a site.

662
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:40,717
No, tell me.

663
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:53,876
What do you think?

664
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,916
I've rented for six months.

665
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:58,415
And to make sure
your reputation remains

666
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:00,875
intact, have hired
in a false name.

667
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:04,115
- What fake name?
- Well, he left

668
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:07,675
no more than my mouth. I could not help it.

669
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:09,315
Kenneth, what fake name?

670
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:15,474
Dorothy. Dorothy Richards.

671
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:18,634
It is not possible...is
terrible for poor Dorothy.

672
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,953
Never know, right?

673
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,912
- Father! Father!
- Hi, girls.

674
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:41,591
- Where is your mother?
- Gone with Uncle Kenneth.

675
00:45:41,631 --> 00:45:44,991
- Who? Is the uncle Kenneth?
- Yes, Mr. Waters. Your friend.

676
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:48,231
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know him. Him

677
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:49,431
You know him?

678
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:51,550
Your mother said, yes. "

679
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,310
- Do you want to come and see our rabbits?
- Okay.

680
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:59,070
We had two, but mother and
Uncle Kenneth ate another.

681
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,669
Oh, it sure is a shame.

682
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,269
Hugh.

683
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:06,069
What are you doing here?

684
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:07,869
How did you get?

685
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,429
- Technically, I still live here.
- Oh.

686
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,428
Well, well. Because in reality,
I think we need to talk.

687
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:17,108
Girls, with a babysitter.

688
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,588
See you soon, girls.

689
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:29,827
Shut the door, Hugh.

690
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:32,626
Oh, by the way, I will send
Gillian to school.

691
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,026
I think you feel good.

692
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:37,906
- Any objections? - It would have
difference that the case?

693
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:40,746
Probably not. Sit down, Hugh.

694
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:47,185
Did you ever stop?

695
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:50,105
No, I do not, Hugh. Because I know
what works with children.

696
00:46:50,145 --> 00:46:52,465
I know what they want
and know what they need.

697
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,744
They want something they can trust.

698
00:46:54,784 --> 00:46:56,624
And my intention is to
provide it.

699
00:46:56,664 --> 00:47:00,184
- I do not know how you get to be published.
No paper. - I got over that.

700
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:04,303
Six different publishers, six
different portions of paper. Simple.

701
00:47:05,863 --> 00:47:09,783
Only you, Enid, you could convert a
War in a business opportunity.

702
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,303
And that kind of commentary, Hugh,

703
00:47:11,343 --> 00:47:13,422
is one of the reasons
they want a divorce.

704
00:47:13,462 --> 00:47:14,942
Divorce?

705
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,461
Yes, I want this to end.
I want the marriage to end.

706
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:18,142
"Based on what?

707
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:20,222
- Adultery.
- That could be risky.

708
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:22,662
Do you think your sales could
survive the scandal?

709
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:25,561
"Enid Blyton has a
mistress. "Imagine that in the

710
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:28,421
- Front pages
- Not my adultery, Hugh. Yours.

711
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,061
I know what that girl
you've been seeing.

712
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:35,740
And as you say, the damage to my
reputation would be too large.

713
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,460
- What about my reputation?
- You have no reputation.

714
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,900
Although, sorry, of course
you have it. As drunk.

715
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,019
Since I left this house, I just

716
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,099
tasted a drop. Why
do you think will?

717
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:47,379
I really do not know, and I do not care.

718
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:48,979
Everything I know is I can not...

719
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:51,339
You are so hypocritical, Enid.

720
00:47:51,379 --> 00:47:53,518
How can you be a
model of morality

721
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,658
well when your fans
is how you really are?

722
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:59,658
The sole reason why your fans
I love it because you do not know.

723
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,698
You're despicable!

724
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,916
'Your father is gone. He does not want

725
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,896
to live anymore
us, it's gone. "

726
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:24,136
'Your dad has found
another woman, Enid. "

727
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:35,774
- I have a handkerchief. Here you go.
- Thanks.

728
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:37,294
Are not you excited?

729
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:54,693
"The first or second day of a
quarter are always exciting. "

730
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:57,172
"There is much baggage to undo."

731
00:48:57,212 --> 00:49:00,932
"And best of all, there
boxes full to empty. "

732
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:05,611
"The twins missed their
home and his mother, at first, "

733
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,851
"Like most of the girls."

734
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:12,291
"But there was much to do that
there was no time to worry. "

735
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:39,168
Maggie? Is anyone in the
way. Can you see who it is?

736
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:50,367
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

737
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:53,127
Sorry, I do not know where to start.

738
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,407
So go to the point.

739
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:58,526
I am... the wife of Kenneth.

740
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:03,086
"Kenneth?

741
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,606
This is very difficult for me.

742
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:08,045
You could try to be honest at least.

743
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:11,185
Sorry, I have no idea

744
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:14,285
- You talk.
- I know, I know you and him...

745
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:19,404
.. Which is having a
affair with my husband.

746
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:24,524
- Sorry, this is ridiculous. I would like
to leave. - I have been together.

747
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:28,163
May I speak low?
There's a girl in the house.

748
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:30,403
- I have been with my husband.
- Look...

749
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:31,963
I'm a public figure.

750
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:33,803
I view with many people.

751
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:36,363
Well, how says
called this man?

752
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:39,762
I know what house you have
rented in Knightsbridge.

753
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,082
Oh, dear.

754
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,922
Clearly she is very angry.

755
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:48,441
Why not sit a moment?

756
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:50,401
Sit here.

757
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:57,201
I'm sure everything
this is a great error.

758
00:50:57,241 --> 00:50:59,600
I'll get something to drink.

759
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,719
I want it back, okay?

760
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,319
How I can help
untangle this awful mess?

761
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,958
Lady... Sorry, what was his name?

762
00:51:18,998 --> 00:51:22,238
Really, I almost died in the
site. What could have possessed?

763
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:24,318
Do not know how he found
out what this place.

764
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:26,758
I thought I had taken the
papers with me when I moved.

765
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:28,637
Well, thank God
you put the name

766
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:30,477
Dorothy, is all I can say.

767
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:32,637
I think I managed
convincing.

768
00:51:33,797 --> 00:51:35,637
Oh, God!

769
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:40,116
Now think I have a
Dorothy Richards adventure!

770
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:43,916
Oh, no. You should think
I've gone crazy.

771
00:51:43,956 --> 00:51:45,436
That is very cruel.

772
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:54,415
Apparently, it is
public knowledge

773
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:57,035
I have an adventure
with Kenneth Waters.

774
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,794
- You? - We have a love nest
in Knightsbridge, apparently.

775
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:04,194
Where the hell
may have come from?

776
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,314
I have no idea.

777
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:07,914
Very peculiar.

778
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:10,333
Anyway, I
love you here,

779
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,713
because I have news.
Can you guess?

780
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:15,113
Probably sue you for slander.

781
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:19,552
- Do not be absurd. - Do not worry,
Enid. I will not. - Of course not.

782
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:22,832
It is as if someone
had died, right?

783
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,352
No. My News.

784
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:32,071
Hugh and I were divorced for
Kenneth and I can marry.

785
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:35,111
- Oh, God.
- Are not you happy for us?

786
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,191
Can not create the most
terrible scandals?

787
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,470
And the girls will be devastated!

788
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,110
Do not be ridiculous. Gillian
is always at school

789
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,710
and Imogen is too...
young to understand.

790
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,430
But remember how you felt
you when your father left.

791
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,869
That was an entirely different matter.

792
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:52,749
My father and I were kindred spirits.

793
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:54,849
Hugh has been a father
totally useless.

794
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,909
Girls do not lie down
absolutely less.

795
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:59,549
Oh, for the love of God,
Enid, that is absurd!

796
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:02,048
If you want this divorce
runs smoothly,

797
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:04,508
have to take into account
Hugh's feelings.

798
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,348
Of course I'm going to have their
feelings into account.

799
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:10,067
Obviously.

800
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:12,507
I'm not a monster, Dorothy.

801
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:16,907
- Do you want another, Gillian?
- No, thanks. - What about you?

802
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,027
No, thanks.

803
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:20,027
Surely you want another.

804
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:23,146
- No, thanks.
- No?

805
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:28,626
Well, then I think
we're done.

806
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,945
Maggie will call to clean.

807
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:34,665
- Are you having a good birthday?
- Yes, thanks, Dad. - Maggie!

808
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:39,745
- Can you come to clean this?
- Have you gone back to live here again?

809
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:45,464
Well, it's... Imogen. Es..

810
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:48,264
Girls, why not
you go out to play in the garden.

811
00:53:48,304 --> 00:53:50,624
Yes? Come on, Gillian.

812
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:52,623
Do not be silly, Imogen.

813
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:55,463
Dad has important work
to do during the war.

814
00:53:55,503 --> 00:53:57,543
You're lucky to have him.

815
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:02,062
Think of those poor children whose
parents are fighting far away.

816
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:05,862
Think of the poor children whose
parents have died. Now, go,

817
00:54:05,902 --> 00:54:08,822
plays with others, and stops
mount a number. Okay?

818
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,062
Go!

819
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:18,141
You called, ma'am.

820
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,461
Very funny, Hugh.

821
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:22,980
I've been thinking.

822
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,320
I realized how much
mean girls for you

823
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,620
so I do not want you to be
totally excluded from their lives.

824
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,300
Oh, I like that "totally."
Very interesting on your part.

825
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,939
I will give you unlimited access...

826
00:54:31,979 --> 00:54:33,659
Thanks, Lady Bountiful.

827
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,059
.. If you let me sue for adultery.

828
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,779
We both want to start
again, so get it over with.

829
00:54:43,178 --> 00:54:46,218
- And let me see them whenever you want?
- Totally.

830
00:54:46,258 --> 00:54:49,258
What will be over? Do not just get you
in my life in any way?

831
00:54:49,298 --> 00:54:51,138
Why would such a thing, Hugh?

832
00:54:51,178 --> 00:54:53,217
Because I know you, Enid.

833
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,257
C'mon, Hugh. I have no
all day. Yes or no?

834
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:04,016
Agreed.

835
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:06,690
Wait. There's something
we need to do first.

836
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,570
Enid, will you marry me?

837
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,330
Yes.

838
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:17,209
Oh!

839
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:41,207
Oh, Hugh. No, sorry, Hugh, I'm afraid
who is visiting some friends.

840
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:42,527
No, no bother.

841
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,646
Will not be home for hours.

842
00:56:44,686 --> 00:56:47,686
No, that is not good.
What next week?

843
00:56:47,726 --> 00:56:49,766
Yes, why do not you try that?

844
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,966
Totally. Yes, supueso I will. "

845
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:54,925
Yes, I promise. Oh, for the love of God,
Hugh, that I have really big hurry.

846
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,605
Goodbye.

847
00:57:19,043 --> 00:57:20,563
Yes, hi.

848
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,083
Mr. Hawes, please.

849
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:23,883
Enid Blyton.

850
00:57:23,923 --> 00:57:26,402
Yes, I want to promise me
that when the war ended,

851
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:29,522
Hugh Pollock will not
to work at Newnes.

852
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:32,202
No, sorry, I am
author your most valuable

853
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:36,081
Hugh Pollock is no longer part of my
life, and can not be in the building.

854
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:38,681
I do not think you're listening
I'm saying.

855
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,281
If Hugh returns to Newnes,

856
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,961
I'll go, and I will take
my books somewhere else.

857
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,000
Sure you understand
what are your priorities.

858
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,200
Good. Very sensible of you. Goodbye.

859
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,959
Your mother just said
wanted to tell you one thing.

860
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,159
So I'm sure it's not
There is nothing to worry about.

861
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:04,279
Adelante!

862
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,318
Here you are.

863
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,838
Come in, dear.

864
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:09,478
I have wonderful news.

865
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:11,118
Yes, Mom?

866
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,238
"Sit here, honey.

867
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:14,838
Here.

868
00:58:14,878 --> 00:58:16,397
Now.

869
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:20,397
Uncle Kenneth and I are going to marry the
next week. Is not it wonderful?

870
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,237
I do not know.

871
00:58:23,277 --> 00:58:26,197
Really, Imogen, sometimes
can be extremely thick.

872
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:29,156
- Do not know what this means?
- No.

873
00:58:29,196 --> 00:58:30,996
It means you'll have a new father!

874
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:34,196
What about my other daddy?

875
00:58:34,236 --> 00:58:37,995
Do not be stupid, Imogen. Would not you like
uncle Kenneth? It has been very kind to you.

876
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:39,715
I just want my other daddy.

877
00:58:39,755 --> 00:58:43,235
Yeah, well, you may want and
want until you get blue

878
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:47,034
but your father has joined
the war in America.

879
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:49,714
Are you still in England?

880
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:51,754
No, it's very, very far from here.

881
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:55,154
And will not return for a long time.

882
00:58:55,194 --> 00:58:58,273
Do not you realize, Imogen?
This gives us the opportunity

883
00:58:58,274 --> 00:59:01,353
starting our new
life as a new family.

884
00:59:01,393 --> 00:59:04,233
And in this new life
Kenneth uncle is Father!

885
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:06,233
No!

886
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,752
Well, I see you a bit
angry. Sure you are.

887
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:14,152
But what we do
when we are angry?

888
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:17,551
We take everything
bad and put them away

889
00:59:17,552 --> 00:59:20,911
right behind our
head until wham!

890
00:59:20,951 --> 00:59:22,631
Disappear.

891
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:27,590
So if anyone asks, just say

892
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:30,630
that, well, Uncle Kenneth's your father.

893
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,550
It will be our special secret.

894
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,150
What do you think?

895
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,469
Trust me, Imogen,

896
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,509
new beginnings
are always wonderful.

897
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,109
Go away now, honey.

898
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:46,669
I have a huge pile
of work to do.

899
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:50,548
Up, good girl.

900
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,708
And as special treatment, maybe you read

901
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:54,828
this story
night, lucky girl.

902
01:00:28,385 --> 01:00:30,704
'In his famous house, Green Hedges'

903
01:00:30,744 --> 01:00:32,924
'Enid Blyton enjoys game

904
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:35,104
Tiddly Winks with her husband
Kenneth, and their two daughters. "

905
01:00:35,144 --> 01:00:36,544
'Take care, girls'

906
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:39,183
'I think that mother is winning! "

907
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:42,143
Thank you. Is that all? Yes, thanks.

908
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:44,543
Agreed. Excellent. Gather up, girls.

909
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,383
Father and I are going to dinner.

910
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:49,182
Of course we will.

911
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:51,022
Well, that was good.

912
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:01,701
"Enid?

913
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:04,981
Yeah?

914
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:06,501
"I can help?

915
01:01:07,901 --> 01:01:09,660
Do not you recognize me, right?

916
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,500
No. Should I?

917
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,060
I Hanly.

918
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,220
"Hanly?

919
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,779
- Your Brother.
- Yes, Yes, I know.

920
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:23,979
You look a little surprised.

921
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:26,299
No... you called.

922
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:30,058
"Is something the matter?

923
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:32,298
Mom is dead.

924
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:37,218
Oh.

925
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:42,097
I take a cup of tea.

926
01:01:47,897 --> 01:01:48,937
Yes, of course.

927
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:05,655
How much time has passed since
I saw you last?

928
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,375
30. More or less.

929
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:14,814
He heard you divorced.
And you've remarried.

930
01:02:14,854 --> 01:02:17,854
Yes six months ago.

931
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:23,813
His funeral is the week
comes. I brought you your invitation.

932
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:26,373
The could have sent.

933
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,673
But I thought it
could lose between all

934
01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:30,933
mail from your fans,
as my other cards.

935
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:40,212
- Hanly, I... - Thank you for your support
Enid, after all these years.

936
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:44,251
I've been very...

937
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,491
Well, I...

938
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:49,771
She has been sick for about 10 years.

939
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,371
Lost his head.

940
01:02:51,411 --> 01:02:53,010
Sorry.

941
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,890
Really?

942
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,170
Almost fool me.

943
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,230
What I never understood
Enid, is why we

944
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,250
Carey left out and a
me as you did with Mom.

945
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,409
How did we hurt you?

946
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:07,529
Well, it was all her fault.
Distanced father and took me away to me.

947
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:12,288
That is nonsense, Enid. He was
a womanizer. Just see a skirt...

948
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:14,468
You have no proof!

949
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:16,608
- This is a mother of invention.
- You have not answered my question.

950
01:03:16,648 --> 01:03:17,928
What did Carey and me?

951
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:27,487
I did not want to see anything that

952
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,847
reminded me of me.

953
01:03:29,887 --> 01:03:31,687
What?

954
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,646
Everything.

955
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,526
Mother.

956
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:38,846
All this stifling respectability.

957
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:43,045
Father's departure.

958
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:47,685
Sorry, Hanly.

959
01:03:47,725 --> 01:03:50,285
...My husband, coming home soon.

960
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:53,204
It is working very hard, is a surgeon...

961
01:03:53,244 --> 01:03:56,644
Anyway, I think it would
better than you do not...

962
01:03:56,684 --> 01:03:58,644
Perhaps after the funeral.

963
01:03:58,684 --> 01:04:00,204
Will you come, then?

964
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,923
I'm leaving.

965
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:17,362
Menudo site.

966
01:04:17,402 --> 01:04:19,202
Yes.

967
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:21,002
Grander than Buckingham.

968
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:22,562
Yes.

969
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,121
A different world.

970
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:28,641
A different girl.

971
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:39,634
Come on, Enid.

972
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:42,074
It's time for picnic. Come on.

973
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:15,670
Ah-ha!

974
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,150
Hooray! I won! Maldita
that is, was right behind you!

975
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,470
Poor Imogen, was right at the bottom!

976
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,590
Actually, darling,
Yes, five o'clock.

977
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,509
Check back to your room.

978
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:30,469
Mommy?

979
01:06:30,509 --> 01:06:33,229
Who was that man
came this afternoon?

980
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:37,988
- What man?
- And said, "Mom's dead!.

981
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:42,548
- Did you mean your mom?
- I do not know what you mean, Imogen!

982
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:44,427
But you said your mother was dead.

983
01:06:44,428 --> 01:06:46,267
How could he be
killed if just died?

984
01:06:46,307 --> 01:06:48,307
Get up and go
bed immediately!

985
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:53,507
You're left without dinner, and no hours
special morning with father and mother.

986
01:06:53,547 --> 01:06:56,946
What the hell was talking about, Enid?

987
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:59,346
Dear, dear, dear...

988
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:00,906
It is a snake.

989
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:03,186
It is a snake. How dare you!

990
01:07:03,226 --> 01:07:05,466
How he spoke, Enid?

991
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:08,065
What, dear? Want?

992
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:09,585
My mother,...

993
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:13,465
.. My mother has been
dead to me since

994
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:15,465
the day I
left, do not you understand?

995
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:17,984
And now I really have
died, and the small

996
01:07:17,985 --> 01:07:20,464
Imogen has been spying on me, obviously.

997
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,984
Okay, okay.

998
01:07:23,024 --> 01:07:24,624
Everything is fine, I understand.

999
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:28,583
Of course I do. Dear,
dry your eyes. Everything's fine.

1000
01:07:32,303 --> 01:07:34,583
You need that we send to school.

1001
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:37,003
- It's all I can do.
- Well, I could not

1002
01:07:37,004 --> 01:07:39,382
agree more. Always
has been very difficult.

1003
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,142
We have spoiled, Kenneth.

1004
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,982
You need discipline.

1005
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:48,701
- I'll call the school tomorrow.
- Well, well...

1006
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:56,541
For the love of God,
if you do not fit there, put

1007
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:58,860
in the front seat.
Plenty of space!

1008
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,940
- Sorry, sir. - Just hurry up
we have to catch a train.

1009
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,260
Come on, Enid!

1010
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,099
- Sorry, sorry.
- In the back, dear.

1011
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:12,739
Imogen, do not be silly. Come on.

1012
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:15,499
- Open the door, please. - Imogen leaves
your mother into the car.

1013
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:17,899
I do not want to come.

1014
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:20,578
Stay here. I'll take.

1015
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:45,016
'In the small hours of this morning,'

1016
01:08:45,056 --> 01:08:50,055
'7 May 1945 saw the recognition
of the leaders of Germany,

of their country by land, sea and air. "

1018

'The final act...'

1019
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:14,453
- What? - Nothing. - Honey,
something bothering you. What is it?

1020
01:09:16,533 --> 01:09:20,332
- People say I do not write
my own books, Kenneth. - What?

1021
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:23,012
- Who?
- Do not know. A man Terribas the newspaper,

1022
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:24,952
Says I have a team of people who

1023
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,852
make as
sausages in a factory.

1024
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:30,011
It's so cruel. So unfair.
How can they say such things?

1025
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:34,211
It's ridiculous. You do
not know what they say.

1026
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,531
Take it.

1027
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,250
Have you called your agent?

1028
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,009
Why?

1029
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:53,129
As the newspaper.

1030
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:55,009
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1031
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:57,409
- It is taking care of it.
- Okay.

1032
01:09:57,449 --> 01:10:00,288
There are... something else.

1033
01:10:03,088 --> 01:10:06,288
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

1034
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:08,048
I am pregnant.

1035
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:11,247
Oh, my God.

1036
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,287
Wha...?

1037
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:14,967
Are you sure?

1038
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:17,927
I went to the doctor today.

1039
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:19,487
Er... "I... I did? Es..

1040
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,006
That's incredible. Yo... yo... yo..

1041
01:10:22,046 --> 01:10:24,646
- I never thought would happen.
- Me neither.

1042
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:26,366
You're amazing.

1043
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:30,246
I have 47 years, Kenneth.

1044
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:35,325
- It's really scary.
What if something goes wrong? - I'll take care.

1045
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:38,285
I always do right? You'll be fine.

1046
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,005
You're the most extraordinary

1047
01:10:40,045 --> 01:10:42,884
intelligent creatures.

1048
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:54,163
"They tried to remove the burden of
the backs of three children, "

"But they were crying in pain. No, No!"

1050
01:10:57,763 --> 01:10:59,763
"It hurts when you would start it."

Distant Land of Beyond, "

hard roads and trails. "

Put it there.

Do you really think this is a good idea?

1059
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,200
What?

1060
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,240
- I think I should go.
- Oh, do not be silly, Maggie.

1061
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,479
I'll be fine. Leave
to be picky. Now...

1062
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:34,999
There is one.

1063
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:38,239
Wonderful.

1064
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:39,999
Ah. Wonderful.

1065
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:41,519
There's one here. Lady.

1066
01:11:41,559 --> 01:11:42,958
Lady!

Kenneth...

1068
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:08,436
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:10,876
She wanted so much to have a son.

1070
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:15,715
I know what it meant to you.

1071
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:19,195
You must not blame yourself.

1072
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:21,795
Most importantly,
you're still here.

1073
01:12:21,835 --> 01:12:24,234
I do not know what he would do if
I had thought of something.

1074
01:12:24,274 --> 01:12:26,474
I'll be fine.

1075

Am as strong as an ox.

1076
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:30,594
You must be positive.

1077
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:34,913
Sorry, honey.

1078
01:12:34,953 --> 01:12:37,633
Honey, I'm sorry.

1079
01:12:37,673 --> 01:12:38,913
It was...

1080
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:40,913
He was a child, Enid.

1081
01:12:40,953 --> 01:12:42,473
Oh, no.

1082
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:52,912
Now...must rest.

1083
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,671
You get some sleep.

1084
01:12:57,431 --> 01:13:00,391
All right.

1085
01:13:26,788 --> 01:13:28,508

person, shaking his head. "

most charming little boy.

Sweet, right?

1096
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:42,541
See all those letters!

1097
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:45,621
My dear, the revenues are
fantastic, the show is a great success,

1098
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:48,380
and want to return year
comes. What more could you want?

1099
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,380
I want people to stop saying that
I do not write my own books, Kenneth!

"I suggest that you are a liar
and a fraud, Miss. Blyton. "

At least that breaks the monotony.

These people are horrible but
should try to overcome this.

1107
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,616
I know. But...

1108
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,576
the more I think
Therefore, it seems worse.

1109
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:33,056
What happens to children
they read my books?

1110
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,096
Think I'm a fraud.

1111
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:36,815
I think that...

1112
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:38,575
I cheated.

1113
01:15:41,055 --> 01:15:44,895
They say my life is a lie
Kenneth. And I am not a liar!

1114
01:15:44,935 --> 01:15:47,734
Of course not, dear,
course are not.

1115
01:15:47,774 --> 01:15:49,254
Come on.

1116
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:27,970
'Have you gone back to live here again? "

1117
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,930
'And what about my other daddy? "

1118
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:41,569
'What did Carey and me
to offend you? "

1119
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:47,009
'I do not want to come. "

1120
01:17:01,527 --> 01:17:03,287
If you can not beat them join them.

1121
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,687
I'm not a bad person, right?

1122
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:10,006
Of course not. Never
heard such nonsense.

1123
01:17:14,486 --> 01:17:17,606
By the way, you're very pretty
with the morning light.

1124
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:32,844
Now, go ahead. Criticism
often say about their books...

1125
01:17:32,884 --> 01:17:35,844
I do not care about criticism
who has more than 12 years.

1126
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:40,203
However, they suggest that perhaps their
books are a bit outdated.

1127
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:45,683
I only care about children.

1128
01:17:45,723 --> 01:17:48,883
And they have always
liked my books,

1129
01:17:48,923 --> 01:17:53,282
because, well, I understand what they want.

1130
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:57,002
I know the secret sites
who like to escape.

1131
01:17:58,602 --> 01:18:01,121
I do not think that changes ever

1132
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:02,761
Right?

1133
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:06,121
I am sure that no
will, Miss Blyton.

1134
01:18:26,519 --> 01:18:28,159
Well,

1135
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:29,719
everything went beautifully.

1136
01:18:29,759 --> 01:18:32,118
I think you deserve
something to drink, darling.

1137
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:33,598
What will you take? "G and T?

1138
01:18:36,358 --> 01:18:38,998
"G and T?

1139
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:41,717
- Gin Tonic.
- Oh.

1140
01:18:41,757 --> 01:18:44,437
No. Yes, please.

1141
01:18:44,477 --> 01:18:46,837
Are you okay?

1142
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:49,957
It was, erm...

1143
01:18:51,516 --> 01:18:55,716
I was wondering...
trying to remember,

1144
01:18:55,756 --> 01:18:57,636
the name of my brother.

1145
01:18:57,676 --> 01:19:00,276
- Hanly.
- Oh, yes.

1146
01:19:00,316 --> 01:19:02,875
Hanly.

1147
01:19:02,915 --> 01:19:05,035
How ridiculous.

1148
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:06,835
How could I forget?

1149
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:13,434
- What about the other?
- Carey. - Yes

1150
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:16,354
- Carey's.
- What happens to them?

1151
01:19:16,394 --> 01:19:20,074
Should we have this...?

1152
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:23,113
- What was the drink that mentioned?
- G and T.

1153
01:19:23,153 --> 01:19:27,073
Yes, sounds delicious.
Take one of those!

1154
01:19:27,113 --> 01:19:29,753
Soon!

1155
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:31,712
You should take off your coat, dear.

1156
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:40,472
Do you think the house very empty, Kenneth?

1157
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:02,629
"'Good evening, Isla
Secret, 'said the others.

1158
01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:06,189
'And then he slept.
And dreamed of their island, '

1159
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:09,989
'And the days of summer when
return there again, '

1160
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:13,468
'And live happily, and fortunately
completely alone, without adults'

1161
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,348
'Under the hot sun,'

1162
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:17,828
'Winter days
in the cozy cave. "

1163
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:20,348
'Cooking over a fire,'

1164
01:20:20,388 --> 01:20:23,747
'And deep sleep
heather beds. "

1165
01:20:23,787 --> 01:20:26,987
"Dear Secret Island '.

1166
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:28,187
'Just wait,

1167
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:32,467
'And you have children
you once again. "

1168
01:20:32,507 --> 01:20:34,666
'There'.

1169
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:36,146
End

1170
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:39,626
Wonderful.

1171
01:20:40,826 --> 01:20:42,586
Wonderful.

1172
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:28,582
Enid suffered from dementia
during his last years.

1173
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:30,861
He died in 1968 at age 71.

1174
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:34,960
He wrote about
And has sold 750 books

1175
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:37,060
500 million copies worldwide.

1176
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,160
His books still sell about
8 million copies each year.
