{11660}{11769}Just play it cool.|I don't think this bullshit's funny.
{11800}{11832}Understand?
{11851}{11885}Cutie!
{12140}{12181}Maybe we should wait...
{12185}{12260}Cool it. I know|what these jerks are like.
{12272}{12307}It's all for show.
{12324}{12338}Pencil.

{12594}{12620}My name's...
{12624}{12660}cutie!

{13894}{13949}Grégoire Andersen|and Michel Terlin...
{13959}{14022}all three law-enforcement officers.
{14035}{14132}In reply to the question|of extenuating circumstances...
{14136}{14203}the jury has replied|in the negative.
{14220}{14343}Therefore, the accused is sentenced|according to article 304...

{14423}{14512}With a 30-year minimum|before review for parole.
{14571}{14595}Court adjourned.

{15528}{15561}Out of the way!
{15574}{15603}Out of the way!
{16927}{16976}You can't do this.
{17042}{17097}I don't wanna go like this.
{17192}{17236}You gotta tell my mother.
{17270}{17302}She's been told.
{17416}{17483}So why ain't she here?
{17541}{17607}Why ain't my mother here?
{17698}{17762}Can't we wait a bit longer?
{17799}{17905}She'll come and fetch me.|My mother'll come and fetch me.
{18046}{18080}Mom.
{18227}{18267}Mom.
{20416}{20439}Hello.
{21475}{21506}What's your name?
{21573}{21601}Nikita.
{21700}{21726}Nice name.
{21740}{21769}Where's it from?
{21825}{21853}A song.
{21862}{21894}What's it about?
{22141}{22162}Mister...
{22182}{22256}is this Heaven here or not?
{22349}{22378}No... But...
{22418}{22457}it could turn out to be.
{22532}{22582}You died Saturday at 5 p.m.
{22599}{22659}The prison doctor confirmed...
{22663}{22764}suicide after an overdose|of tranquillizers. You're buried...
{22768}{22841}in Maisons-Alfort,|row 8, plot 30.
{22963}{23012}Titi... That's Titi!
{23166}{23186}I work, say...
{23221}{23259}for the government.
{23323}{23395}We've decided|to give you another chance.
{23590}{23616}What do I do?
{23628}{23654}Learn.
{23666}{23755}Learn to read, walk, talk,|smile and even fight.
{23766}{23804}Learn to do everything.
{23842}{23869}What for?
{23880}{23920}To serve your country.
{24002}{24045}What if I don't want to?
{24146}{24198}Row 8, plot 30.
{24360}{24428}Can I sleep a bit|before I decide?
{24617}{24654}I'll be back in an hour.
{25593}{25623}Motherfucker!
{25859}{25890}Where's the way out?
{25894}{25922}Straight ahead.
{26047}{26077}Who're these shits?
{26081}{26097}Employees.
{26156}{26200}Nobody move!|It's OK!
{26204}{26260}The hell it is!|Nothing's OK!
{26485}{26513}Open the door!
{26517}{26550}I can't open it.
{26640}{26692}Tell them to open the door!
{26728}{26748}They won't.
{26812}{26863}I'll blow your brains out.
{26867}{26906}It's not loaded.
{26918}{26960}Forget it.|Get off me!
{27138}{27164}Cool it.
{27307}{27361}Right, get back to your desks.
{27806}{27866}Rule 1, the first bullet's not for you.
{27953}{27999}That'll clip your wings.
{28947}{28984}Made your mind up?
{29136}{29159}That's good.
{29386}{29416}Fill that out.
{29565}{29596}If I don't make it?
{29692}{29725}You'll make it.
{29899}{29960}We'll start with an easy program.
{29964}{30049}It's like a typewriter keyboard -|letters and figures.
{30063}{30181}That's the mouse. There's a roller|under it to move the arrow.
{30185}{30266}If you press here,|you can make drawings.
{30307}{30331}Go on then.
{30367}{30464}There. Gently.|That's good. Gently. Gently!
{30481}{30561}Bring the arrow back now.|Back up to the corner.
{30565}{30615}Bring the arrow back here.
{30660}{30706}Very good.|Now press here.
{30762}{30786}There you go.
{30814}{30838}Again.
{31008}{31119}These are the firearms we use.|First, the simplest of all...
{31123}{31245}the Beretta 93R, 9mm automatic,|20 shots maximum.
{31299}{31358}The barrel towards the target.
{31403}{31507}Before learning the correct stance,|get to know the tool.
{31511}{31536}Target at 10 m.
{32087}{32118}Used one before?
{32137}{32182}Never on paper.
{32685}{32714}Nice and round.
{32871}{32902}Can't. My leg hurts.
{32911}{32988}Never mind.|We'll try a reflex exercise.
{33019}{33046}An easy one.
{33367}{33383}Get ready.
{33580}{33640}Now I've taken up my guard.
{33654}{33725}I want you to try to hit my face.
{34092}{34120}Next class.
{36103}{36129}Sit down there.
{36581}{36598}My dear girl...
{36602}{36678}you don't look much now-|chewing gum...
{36698}{36812}but if we work hard together|and if fortune smiles on us...
{36830}{36908}we'll be able to make you|into a human being.
{36917}{36995}An intermediary|but necessary step...
{36999}{37079}before becoming|man's perfect complement...
{37089}{37112}a woman.
{37448}{37481}Do you like it?
{37622}{37688}Can you give me|a definition of grace?
{37745}{37768}I'm not smart.
{37782}{37848}Smile then.|That'll be a good start.
{37854}{37913}Smile when you|don't know something.
{37917}{38013}You won't be any smarter|but it's nice for others.
{38080}{38181}Allow yourself to be taken over|by the faint fragility...
{38188}{38257}which will make|your face beautiful.
{38266}{38311}A smile.
{38407}{38448}A smile...
{38476}{38551}is surface sweetness.
{38587}{38634}Gentleness.
{38690}{38738}Almost a mood.
{39457}{39508}Shall we fix the wig?
{40018}{40059}How's it going?
{40066}{40103}I wish it had gone.
{40129}{40192}A sense of humor.|That's a good start.
{40365}{40386}Made friends?
{40415}{40464}I get on well with my mouse.
{40628}{40673}When do we go for a drink?
{40725}{40753}Not just yet.
{40800}{40841}No rest in this factory?
{40845}{40869}Never.
{40892}{40928}That suits you.
{41072}{41125}I'm going to be 20 next week.
{41194}{41260}Can't I have just|a bit of leave...
{41308}{41340}if you trail me?
{42370}{42466}How's it going?|I've a great program to try out.
{42587}{42609}Present.
{42743}{42779}Let's open it, huh?
{43036}{43058}"One white mouse...
{43062}{43142}"ran into my house.
{43146}{43262}"I grabbed its tail|and made it wail!"
{44800}{44852}In 3 months,|she's screwed everything up.
{44871}{44897}Lost your touch?
{44916}{44952}She has potential.
{44961}{44995}Potential?
{45003}{45104}I wonder what for, apart from|kicking and biting instructors?
{45114}{45196}Good agents take time|to train: 5...
{45202}{45232}6 years maybe.
{45236}{45263}Oh come on.
{45288}{45370}I'll give you 2 weeks.|After that, she's out.
{45634}{45665}Who are you?
{45669}{45691}I don't know.
{45734}{45772}But... You are...
{45776}{45800}Yes...
{45828}{45876}What are you doing in my arms?
{45880}{45909}I don't know.
{45939}{45988}But now we've got this far...
{46058}{46109}Maybe it's just a dream.
{46211}{46248}Oh my darling.
{46365}{46445}You've made progress,|especially in dance.
{46494}{46526}In art too.
{46570}{46624}But in all the other subjects...
{46719}{46760}nix, zilch...
{46782}{46807}zero.
{46910}{46935}I'll be right back.
{47425}{47462}Happy birthday.
{47592}{47615}Blow them out.
{48561}{48606}They've given us 2 weeks.
{48649}{48700}I can't do any more after.
{48751}{48787}Not a thing.
{51504}{51552}Are you looking at my hands?
{51613}{51660}They were beautiful once.
{51679}{51734}Now, they give me away.
{51802}{51842}Did you go through this?
{52692}{52754}Let your pleasure|be your guide.
{52781}{52830}Your pleasure as a woman.
{52869}{52907}And don't forget...
{52928}{53006}There are two things|that have no limit:
{53019}{53151}femininity and the means|of taking advantage of it.
{54361}{54398}I don't believe it!
{54418}{54450}Not ready yet?
{54498}{54536}You're uptight, Amande.
{54540}{54612}It's five to|and I hate unpunctuality.
{54631}{54694}Waiting sharpens the appetite.
{54741}{54776}Put this on.
{54851}{54899}God, this hanger's ugly.
{54917}{54955}I have to finish work.
{54959}{54991}No way! That'll do!
{55019}{55050}Only for a minute.
{55281}{55314}You look beautiful.
{55324}{55354}Are we dining?
{55358}{55377}Yes.
{55422}{55450}And why?
{55454}{55489}It's your birthday.
{55493}{55526}Your 23rd.
{55538}{55580}Hey, he didn't forget.
{55922}{55966}Amande, we have a guest.
{56166}{56216}I thought we'd have dinner...
{56251}{56272}out.
{56817}{56842}Shall I go?
{59262}{59297}The usual, sir?
{59440}{59460}You know...
{59464}{59505}you can put your bag down.
{59754}{59787}Watch this.
{59806}{59828}Magic.
{60130}{60163}Wait a minute.
{60256}{60322}Taittinger,|king of vintage champagnes.
{60695}{60720}To your future.
{60848}{60864}Now?
{61144}{61174}It's loaded.
{61194}{61266}Six titanium bullets,|plus an extra cartridge.
{61350}{61375}I don't get it.
{61400}{61511}There are 3 people behind you.|A woman and 2 men in suits:
{61516}{61538}a bodyguard...
{61550}{61624}and a VIP. You've 2 bullets|to kill him.
{61628}{61680}Then go down to the men's room.
{61684}{61768}In the end booth,|there's a small window your size.
{61772}{61881}It opens onto a courtyard.|A corridor leads to the street.
{61907}{61955}A car's waiting already.
{61977}{62013}You've 3 minutes.
{62130}{62182}Please wait until I leave.
{64530}{64568}Eddy, look down there.
{65755}{65782}Other side.
{65953}{65978}Stay there.
{67165}{67191}José!
{67251}{67280}Coming!
{69485}{69559}Miss! Miss! Stop!
{69645}{69664}Open up!
{69715}{69762}There's trouble down here.
{69774}{69789}Miss!
{69851}{69891}Open the door...
{69895}{69934}asshole!
{70339}{70405}The window was walled up, Bob!
{70417}{70475}The window was walled up!
{70511}{70555}Of course it was...
{70805}{70849}You filthy shit!
{70890}{70928}Stop it, Nikita!
{70938}{70976}Motherfucker!
{70988}{71093}It's all over. You get out tomorrow.|You get out tomorrow!
{71103}{71174}You get out tomorrow!|You get out tomorrow!
{71499}{71562}Just calm down, goddammit!
{71712}{71745}We have to...
{71766}{71873}have to do this sort of exercise|before letting agents out.
{72180}{72228}You've worked well, Nikita.
{72299}{72328}Tonight...
{72362}{72397}and all these years.
{72503}{72538}I'll miss you.
{73286}{73323}I'll never kiss you again.
{74143}{74165}What category...
{74169}{74203}of mission is she for?
{74207}{74230}S1.
{74258}{74299}Still as ambitious...
{74350}{74385}Don't sit down.
{74666}{74749}6 months set-up time.|I want her for September.
{74759}{74871}I can't stand you.|I'd have let you die. So toe the line.
{74887}{74933}You won't be warned. Clear?
{75117}{75152}How many do I take?
{75156}{75194}3 at the most.
{75233}{75252}Jeannot.
{75604}{75684}Marie Clément from Sarlat.|Nurse at the Salpétrière.
{75716}{75790}You're paid at the bank|opposite the hospital.
{75794}{75903}Passport, driving license...|And a bonus to help you out.
{75945}{75982}Your mission code name...
{76055}{76082}Joséphine.
{76394}{76426}Good luck.
{76572}{76593}I'm scared.
{76665}{76699}The worst's over.
{78175}{78293}Second floor, sunny,|central heating...
{78297}{78371}and, lucky for you, it's vacant.
{78388}{78403}Perfect.
{78449}{78475}Perfect.
{79920}{79979}Are you in a hurry? Huh?
{79986}{80027}No, no, not at all...
{80031}{80092}Good 'cos my register's acting up.
{80096}{80153}The belt's broken too. So...
{80179}{80221}I've plenty of time.
{80279}{80310}That's good.
{80314}{80375}Push it over and we'll sort it out.
{80557}{80585}Ravioli.
{80687}{80719}Hey, ravioli.
{80765}{80871}I'm slow. I've only been here 2 days.|It's really complicated.
{81066}{81116}Cookies.|Having yourself painted?
{81253}{81360}God, no tag! Can't be worth more|than 10 francs. Call it 10!
{81614}{81657}What time do you finish?
{81749}{81778}Six o'clock.
{81847}{81883}How about dinner?
{82001}{82024}10 francs!
{82309}{82343}It's not finished.
{82592}{82671}I'm embarrassed.|Usually, I do the inviting.
{82687}{82774}You've really confused me.|I don't know what to say...
{82786}{82822}Never mind. Eat.
{82876}{82918}Yeah, sure... eat.
{83049}{83075}It's really good.
{83102}{83140}Hey, something funny|happened this morning...
{83144}{83181}at the store. Really funny!
{83257}{83285}That neither.
{83381}{83432}I know, I'll eat while it's hot.
{83826}{83886}Don't start what you can't stop.
{83914}{83950}Sorry, I want you.
{83954}{83984}It'll get cold.
{85090}{85129}You were getting it!
{85140}{85185}I put the kettle on.
{85199}{85249}Yeah, you did fuck all!
{85352}{85382}Breakfast, highness..
{85522}{85575}There. Shit, I'll be late!
{85602}{85647}Your highness slept well?
{85748}{85807}I'll invite Léon to dinner Saturday.
{85901}{85971}He's missing Britanny, poor guy.
{85986}{86027}I'll make crêpes.
{86031}{86070}You know how to?
{86140}{86183}We might go into business.
{86187}{86219}Doing what?

{86276}{86343}- With him as the eraser?|- Hey, Léon's a nice guy.
{86390}{86455}I've seen more intelligent bananas.
{86469}{86499}Give him a break.
{86533}{86585}Why don't you invite your friend?
{86596}{86612}Who?
{86616}{86697}You made a friend|in a store, a blond...
{86719}{86760}didn't you? Last week?
{86777}{86854}Yes, but I don't know|if she's a friend yet.
{86858}{86911}This is your chance to find out.
{86915}{86998}If it doesn't work,|Léon will peel her bananas.
{87272}{87309}We get on well, huh?
{87378}{87433}We've been together 6 months now.
{87649}{87664}Marie...
{87698}{87758}How come you never|bring people here?
{87866}{87928}No relatives, no friends...
{87973}{88004}Nobody.
{88102}{88145}Because I love only you.
{88181}{88214}There you go.
{88370}{88420}No! Tell him I hate his guts.
{88747}{88772}Hello?
{88776}{88797}Joséphine?
{88902}{88959}The George V bar, in an hour.
{89114}{89132}Who was it?
{89171}{89238}The hospital. I'm on duty.
{89474}{89502}Tea.
{89603}{89637}Got a light?
{89663}{89712}The Régina basement,|in an hour.
{90444}{90473}Don't move.
{90543}{90573}Legs apart.
{90608}{90639}Joséphine.
{90697}{90723}'Scuse.
{91240}{91259}Put that on.
{92167}{92208}What do I do now?
{92237}{92264}You wait.
{93044}{93084}Room service, good morning.
{93186}{93214}Certainly, sir.
{96459}{96498}What do I do now?
{96516}{96552}Go home.
{96622}{96650}Is that all?
{97349}{97374}Marie?
{97439}{97469}Bob speaking.
{97522}{97550}How are you?
{97554}{97597}Fine... I'm just fine.
{97633}{97738}I wanted to congratulate you.|I'm glad the first job went well.
{97766}{97789}Thanks.
{97819}{97858}Have you settled in?
{97898}{97929}Yes, really well.
{97989}{98028}I have a fiancé.
{98048}{98138}Great. I'm glad|everything's going well.
{98180}{98269}I have to go now, Marie.|Good luck for the next.
{98282}{98304}Bob?
{98323}{98345}Yes?
{98381}{98447}I'd like you over for dinner.
{98492}{98527}I'd be delighted.
{98620}{98646}Bob?
{98665}{98699}Uncle Bob?
{98739}{98802}Come in. She's in the bathroom.
{98842}{98883}Let me help you.
{98887}{98981}You shouldn't have, for the flowers.|Champagne was a good idea.
{99048}{99070}Sorry.
{99111}{99155}I'm really pleased...
{99179}{99220}to meet you. It's...
{99259}{99321}I haven't met her family before.
{99346}{99391}The others aren't worth it.
{99558}{99620}I'll put it in the fridge|before it gets cold.
{99716}{99794}Delicious. Really.|Wonderful, fine, light...
{99798}{99924}Stop. I'll never be able to match that.|One last compliment, OK?
{99941}{100010}I haven't seen her|for a while. She's...
{100026}{100120}She's radiant. I'm sure|that's thanks to you as well.
{100129}{100221}My charm's really deceptive.|It's not immediate.
{100238}{100291}It can take 10 or 15 years.
{100518}{100608}Tell me, what was she like|when she was little?
{100612}{100654}No, Marco.
{100662}{100711}When she was 8 or so.
{100715}{100757}Marco, you promised!
{100761}{100834}It's him I'm asking,|Marie, not you.
{100841}{100899}See, I can't even ask questions.
{100910}{100954}Do I ask you things?
{100973}{101019}No, but I wish you would.
{101029}{101073}I love you all the same.
{101088}{101131}See, she's a brick wall.
{101135}{101168}So people say.
{101183}{101197}Marie!
{101242}{101285}At 8, she was so pretty.
{101423}{101484}She had golden hair in a pigtail.
{101502}{101565}There was a cousin called Caroline.
{101591}{101689}Only Caroline could touch|her pigtail. No one else.
{101793}{101832}She wore a ribbon...
{101844}{101894}and always had white dresses.
{101972}{102100}I only saw her when the family|rented a farm in summer.
{102116}{102203}With the cousins and neighbors,|there were 20 kids...
{102207}{102265}always causing trouble together.
{102328}{102421}Marie had her speciality.|She imitated frogs.
{102522}{102602}She'd squat by the pond|and jump into the mud...
{102606}{102689}going "croak, croak".|That cracked the other kids up.
{102728}{102756}She'd come back...
{102760}{102868}soaked to the skin,|but always with the same excuse:
{102904}{103003}"I slipped", she'd say|in her quiet little voice.
{103078}{103126}That's just like her!
{103148}{103191}Has she told you what I do?
{103247}{103319}No. See, I can't ask her questions.
{103372}{103477}I work in a travel agency.|I'm one of the partners.
{103497}{103565}Two tickets to Venice.
{103622}{103662}An engagement present.
{103835}{103876}I don't know what to say.
{103880}{103917}Don't say anything.
{104410}{104462}Acajou, acajou?
{104537}{104560}I feel rough.
{105411}{105448}Mind the step.
{105568}{105597}This way!
{105703}{105761}Oh no, not the gondola, Marie!
{105769}{105821}Not the gondola,|not the gondola...
{105875}{105938}Gondolier...
{105989}{106058}from... Venice!
{106170}{106189}I want you.
{106193}{106216}Me too.
{106220}{106242}I'm thirsty.
{106246}{106263}Me too.
{106267}{106295}I'm hungry.
{106300}{106317}Me too.
{106321}{106364}Copy-cat! Undo my skirt!
{106368}{106412}- Right away.|- It's undone.
{106450}{106478}No, take it off.
{106731}{106771}Here, hold this.
{106838}{106927}We'd like some San Daniele ham,|a portion of cheese...
{106931}{107019}and 2 bottles of water.|We get thirsty after sex.
{107085}{107110}She's crazy.
{107190}{107225}What did he say?
{107252}{107304}He has the same problem.
{107393}{107426}It's all OK then?
{107596}{107628}Don't move.
{107724}{107752}Joséphine?
{107839}{107869}Joséphine?
{108006}{108088}The bathroom cabinet|has a secret compartment.
{108295}{108380}Fine, make that|a green salad then.
{108637}{108676}They're out of ham.
{108687}{108728}Call the management.
{108826}{108854}I want a bath.
{108880}{108942}Relax and wait for room service.
{109904}{109948}Joséphine, in position.
{109967}{110031}First items under the sink.
{111207}{111235}Assembly completed.
{111245}{111281}Open the window.
{111431}{111475}There's no fucking handle!
{111479}{111507}I don't care!
{111600}{111616}Sweetheart?
{111700}{111745}Know what I'm thinking about?
{111764}{111784}No.
{111813}{111936}That day at the store. Your beauty.|I thought life's a bitch...
{111952}{112005}I'll never have a girl like that...
{112052}{112087}to share my life with.
{112137}{112162}Never.
{112313}{112377}I can't believe I'm saying this...
{112524}{112565}The white boat on the canal...
{112569}{112621}with a driver in a blue shirt.
{112639}{112731}To the left, there are 2 people|outside a door.
{112759}{112791}Take aim on them...
{112795}{112819}and get ready.
{112838}{112871}We're awaiting orders.
{113233}{113264}Can we talk?
{113275}{113323}OK but stay there.
{113446}{113469}Marie...
{113606}{113658}I know questions piss you off.
{113713}{113824}I don't know what's up...|what shit you've been through...
{113858}{113906}to put you in that state.
{113958}{114063}But I've got an imagination, OK?|And I imagine the worst.
{114153}{114202}The worst would be a relief.
{114382}{114403}Who is it?
{114407}{114438}Room service.
{114473}{114495}Coming.
{114627}{114697}Hello, sir.|Beautiful day, isn't it?
{114701}{114738}Weren't you out of ham?
{114742}{114763}Sorry?
{114772}{114809}OK, it's no big deal.
{114844}{114887}How many targets?
{114901}{114935}One but double.
{114939}{114965}What's he like?
{114969}{115015}I haven't been informed yet.
{115036}{115093}My name's Roberto|if you need me...
{115097}{115155}Yeah, Harry Vederchi.
{115235}{115304}Target visible in 10 seconds.
{115545}{115584}Which one of them is it?
{115588}{115636}I haven't the data yet.
{115702}{115730}The target, dammit!
{115737}{115761}The woman.
{115790}{115823}The woman in brown.
{115837}{115864}For Chrissakes!
{115868}{115891}The woman.
{115908}{115938}The fucking woman!
{116138}{116184}What's up? Why don't you reply?
{116188}{116234}You promised not to come in.
{116247}{116302}I know, but I heard a noise...
{116310}{116424}I spent 15 minutes at the door.|You could have replied!
{116800}{116834}You didn't hear me, huh?
{117165}{117186}Fine.
{117260}{117295}This'll keep you going.
{118595}{118618}Miss?
{118640}{118702}Hot chocolate. Cake.
{118848}{118888}Interested in my vacation?
{118951}{119030}I know you and your sadistic games.
{119064}{119146}You're sick, Bob.|I need to tell you that.
{119184}{119237}Your job's a sewer for you.
{119306}{119342}I'm happy to see you.
{119457}{119546}I miss the time when I had you|to myself every day.
{119557}{119613}An ambassador,|leaving in 5 months.
{119617}{119718}Get him before he goes.|It's your mission. Choose your team.
{119722}{119822}You've 5 months. The Boss wants|a clean, smooth job.
{119826}{119862}I thought of you.
{119967}{120014}Always on 2 jobs at once, huh?
{120056}{120098}It's to show I love you.
{120926}{120985}What a welcome! I'll try again.
{121168}{121214}There, that's much better.
{121294}{121320}From now on...
{121324}{121386}no more "Mr. Cashier". I resigned.
{121398}{121412}Exactly.
{121416}{121437}To make boats?
{121441}{121468}You bet!
{121472}{121486}Champagne!
{121490}{121520}It's taken care of.
{121847}{121893}Who taught you to smile?
{121897}{121924}You did.
{121986}{122033}I think we should move.
{122045}{122158}I thought something...|bigger might suit you better.
{123112}{123222}He's seeing his mistress there.|You're in for a two-hour wait.
{123321}{123355}Got a light?
{123668}{123713}Sorry, I got held up.
{123784}{123864}Maximilien Jedreck posted|in Paris 7 years ago.
{123901}{123973}He's keeping data|in the embassy safe...
{123977}{124042}waiting until he goes home.|Classic.
{124065}{124108}What sort of data is it?
{124112}{124191}All sorts: computing,|electronics, mechanics...
{124245}{124281}Who's the girl?
{124298}{124386}Anne-Marie. Together for 2 years.|She's an art dealer.
{124390}{124435}Seems safe enough.
{124489}{124543}We're not interested in him.
{124567}{124666}We're after the companies|selling the data...
{124670}{124741}and to get them, we need proof.
{124745}{124804}The proof's in the embassy safe?
{124808}{124872}Yeah and the keys|are in his pocket.
{124876}{124914}So we know where to look.
{124956}{125068}Relations are strained.|Go easy and don't hurt him.
{125092}{125170}Try to work magic, not havoc.
{125557}{125585}Sweetheart?

{129669}{129725}Marie-Hélène, how do you do?
{129824}{129852}How do you do?
{130238}{130280}I won't be long.
{130673}{130725}That'll take some selling.
{130849}{130878}Who's it by?
{130897}{130999}A guy who was a pain in the neck|even before I carried his stuff.
{131006}{131040}What'll you drink?
{131092}{131123}Whiskey.
{131514}{131595}So you work with Anne-Marie?
{131599}{131659}Sometimes.|Dad's gallery's near hers.
{131678}{131711}In the same street?
{131725}{131773}Yes, a bit further up.
{131876}{131938}A bit further up,|a bit further up.
{132117}{132146}Ah, I see.
{132191}{132217}Thank you.

{132841}{132879}It's time to sleep.
{133580}{133652}Christian, it's just|a housewife coming up.
{133677}{133716}OK, message received.
{134044}{134077}- Joséphine?|- Yes.
{134111}{134174}The ambassador uses a code|with his guards.
{134178}{134215}Yeah but we got it.
{134219}{134246}They changed it.
{134277}{134337}Surveillance just told me.
{134347}{134381}So we drop everything?
{134385}{134426}Hold on, I'll find out.
{134777}{134824}No, mission maintained.
{134828}{134849}What d'you mean?

{147549}{147586}The mission's not over.
{147650}{147744}Please, Victor.|I can't take any more of this.
{147767}{147834}Please, let's go!
{147947}{147974}Who's that?

{148031}{148094}Sir?|What's happening, sir?
{148125}{148156}Oh shit!
{148306}{148347}Let's get out of here!
{148556}{148578}They're ready.
{148618}{148653}Nothing's wrong.
{148657}{148686}False alert. Calm down.
{149018}{149085}They've shut the gate.|We can't get out.
{149122}{149151}We'll call back.
{149155}{149182}Stop!
{149275}{149327}A quick drive|and we'll call back.
{149331}{149351}Please stop!
{152022}{152051}Move over.
{152495}{152535}Look at me, Marie.
{152860}{152899}My poor love.
{152990}{153017}They'll wear you out.
{153066}{153122}The job's too tough for you.
{153184}{153224}Look at your tiny hands.
{153277}{153327}They need protecting.
{153403}{153443}They mustn't get old.
{153554}{153617}Stop before it's too late.
{153723}{153757}Why do you say that?
{153875}{153913}I know everything, Marie.
{153999}{154095}There never has been|a Marie Clément at your hospital.
{154197}{154237}I also know about...
{154312}{154364}the stake-outs, the tailings...
{154383}{154418}the video cassettes.
{154474}{154511}Why didn't you say?
{154584}{154628}Because I love only you.
{154781}{154806}Thank you.
{155266}{155309}My little Marco.
{155436}{155514}You're the most beautiful|person I ever met.
{155648}{155704}The only one who helped me too.
{155881}{155907}Are you going away?
{156199}{156238}Got a little place for me?
{156286}{156334}You're better in a big place.
{156920}{156949}I love you.
{158594}{158653}Mathieu! I'll go up first.
{158675}{158721}I'll call if there's trouble.
{159032}{159059}Come to shoot me?
{159249}{159287}Don't you think...
{159325}{159368}she's paid her dues?
{159407}{159458}Hasn't she the right to live?
{159544}{159580}Her life's been ruined.
{159595}{159623}I know all that.
{159632}{159700}But she ruined a life|a few years ago.
{159715}{159747}A policeman's.
{159779}{159819}Those are heavy dues.
{159873}{159914}She killed for you too.
{159933}{159989}It only counts when it suits you.
{160153}{160241}OK, Marco, you know|what it's all about now.
{160248}{160340}I'm listening.|What do you want me to do?
{160366}{160403}Protect her.
{160487}{160512}I'll try...
{160544}{160583}but she's in danger, Marco.
{160619}{160671}She took the embassy documents.
{160691}{160778}She's out of danger then.|I've got the documents.
{161423}{161450}She left you a note...
{161475}{161509}but I tore it up.
{161602}{161625}What did it say?
{162165}{162199}We'll miss her, huh?
{162362}{162380}Yeah.
