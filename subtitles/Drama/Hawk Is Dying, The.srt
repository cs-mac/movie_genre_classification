1
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,213
There.

2
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,305
Technicals, 9 o'clock.

3
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,549
Oh, shit!
Did you see that?

4
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:25,108
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at 9 o'clock.

5
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,781
I got it, Matt.

6
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't think
we can touch this.

7
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,964
Command Super 6-4, we got
militia shooting unarmed civilians

8
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,768
down at the food
distribution centre.

9
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,275
Request permission
to engage.

10
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,706
Super 6-4, are you taking fire? Over.

11
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:50,887
- Negative, Command.
<i>- U.N.'s jurisdiction, 6-4.</i>

12
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,398
<i>We cannot intervene.
Return to base.</i>

13
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:55,197
- Over.
- Roger.

14
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,373
6-4 returning.

15
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,813
Mm.

16
00:05:58,351 --> 00:05:59,857
Leaving.

17
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,651
General Garrison?

18
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,162
- No. No, thanks. I got one.
- But these are Cuban.

19
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:12,384
Bolivar Belicoso.

20
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:13,849
So is this.

21
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,495
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

22
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,083
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

23
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:32,683
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

24
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:36,449
Me? But am I that important?

25
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,458
I hardly think so.

26
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:41,765
- You're just a businessman.
- Trying to make a living.

27
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:44,819
Selling guns
to Aidid's militia.

28
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,227
You've been here, what,

29
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,403
six weeks?

30
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:59,551
Six weeks you are trying
to catch the general.

31
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,396
You put up reward posters.

32
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,489
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

33
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:07,000
What is this,
gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

34
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,144
It's, uh... It's the O.K. Corral.

35
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:15,956
Do you think bringing me in would
make him suddenly come to you?

36
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:18,174
Make him more agreeable?

37
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,113
- Hm?
- Well, you know where he sleeps.

38
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,671
You pay for his beds,
much less his militia.

39
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:32,278
We're not leaving Somalia
until we find him.

40
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,292
- And we will find him.
- Don't make the mistake...

41
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,225
of thinking because I grew up without
running water, I am simple, general.

42
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,410
I do know something about history.

43
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:48,182
See all this?
It's simply shaping tomorrow.

44
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,743
A tomorrow without a lot of
Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

45
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:56,066
Well, I wouldn't know
about that. I'm from Texas.

46
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,821
Mr. Garrison, I think you
shouldn't have come here.

47
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,349
This is civil war.

48
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:07,617
This is our war, not yours.

49
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:12,263
Three hundred thousand
dead and counting.

50
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,820
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

51
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:19,670
Now, you enjoy
that tea, you hear?

52
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,496
How did he strike you?

53
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,217
Urbane,
sophisticated, cruel.

54
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,225
Yeah, he's a good catch.

55
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:34,904
It'll take some time,
but Aidid will feel the loss.

56
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,917
I'm not sure time is something
we got in great supply.

57
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:42,270
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

58
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,613
Boss, most of Washington
might disagree.

59
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:48,882
I'm just saying, they've been calling for these
dang situation reports every morning this week.

60
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:54,825
Well, tell them the situation
is, uh, fragile.

61
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

62
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,664
I'll be your pilot this afternoon.

63
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,557
Federal regulations has designated this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

64
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,402
For those of you enrolled in our
Mogadishu frequent-flyer program,

65
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,328
you'll be earning 100
free credits this afternoon.

66
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,922
And as always,
the air-sickness bags are located

67
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:19,936
in your seat back in front of you.

68
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:24,246
Number one indications
are good, Cliff. Put her on two.

69
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,871
6-1, this is 6-4. Go to U.H.F. secure.

70
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:46,511
I've got some bad news.
"Limo" is a word, Durant.

71
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,519
I don't wanna hear about it.

72
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,156
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

73
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,333
"Limo" is a word
in common usage.

74
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:57,267
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

75
00:10:57,435 --> 00:11:00,364
No. If it's not in the dictionary,
it doesn't count.

76
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,541
It doesn't have
to be in the dictionary.

77
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,800
It does have
to be in the dictionary.

78
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:09,027
Listen. When we get back to the
base, it's coming off the board.

79
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:12,040
You touch my limo and I'll spank
you, Nightstalker. You hear me?

80
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,133
Yeah, promises.

81
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,350
That's a nice beach
down there.

82
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,192
How's the water?

83
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,712
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

84
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,412
- Name?
- Todd.

85
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,589
- Last name?
- Blackburn.

86
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:37,528
- First name, Todd.
- So, what's it like?

87
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,708
- What's what like?
- Mogadishu. The fighting.

88
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:44,433
- Serial number?
- 7-2-1-6-3-4-2-7.

89
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:47,739
Firstly, it's "the Mog,"
or simply "Mog."

90
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,748
No one calls it
Mogadishu here.

91
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,347
Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

92
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:56,360
- Why not?
- Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

93
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,554
Look, kid, you look like you're about
12, so let me explain something to you.

94
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,362
I have a rare and mysterious skill that
precludes me from going on the missions.

95
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,339
- Typing.
- Can you type?

96
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,891
No.

97
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,072
- Date of birth?
- 2-27-75.

98
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,899
Well, I'm here
to kick some ass.

99
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:30,595
Let's bring it in.

100
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,669
Nice, man! Very smooth!

101
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,762
Single shot through
the engine block.

102
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,445
Shit, that's a shame.
That was a nice jeep.

103
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:19,351
Cease fire! Cease fire!

104
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,489
- Check your weapons.
- Sergeant Eversmann!

105
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,591
- Sergeant.
- Yeah?

106
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,182
Private First Class
Blackburn.

107
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,195
- Yeah?
- Reporting for duty.

108
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,788
Not to me, you're not. You're
reporting to Lieutenant Beales.

109
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,132
He should be around
here somewhere.

110
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,430
Can I leave him
with you?

111
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,067
Yeah, go ahead.

112
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,996
- You brought your weapon.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:45,090
Want me to shoot?
I'm rested.

114
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,647
- When did you get in?
- Just now, sergeant.

115
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,380
Hey, who's hungry?

116
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,997
What is this, sergeant? Another
taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

117
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,676
- Not if General Garrison's asking.
- Well, I'm asking.

118
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:25,852
Have a nice meal, captain.

119
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,427
- Hey, man, there's a line.
- I know.

120
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:36,147
- Well, this isn't the back of it.
- Yeah, I know.

121
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,541
Sergeant. Sergeant!

122
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,592
What's going on here?

123
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,611
Oh, just some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't wanna leave it behind.

124
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,782
I'm talking about your weapon.

125
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,585
Delta or no Delta,
that's a hot weapon.

126
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,808
You know better than that. Safety
should be on at all times on base.

127
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,486
Well, this is my safety, sir.

128
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,345
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't
eaten in a couple of days.

129
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:05,359
You Delta boys are a
bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

130
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,953
Let me tell you
something, Sergeant.

131
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:11,971
When we get on the five-yard line,
you're gonna need my Rangers.

132
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,148
So y'all better learn
to be team players.

133
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,035
We're done here.

134
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,377
Speak up.

135
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,302
You say this is your safety?

136
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,395
Well, this is my boot, son.

137
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:36,788
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

138
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,630
Is that your Jersey accent?

139
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,807
I'm trying to do this. Give me a break.

140
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,184
Take those sunglasses off, soldier.

141
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,321
If Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

142
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,293
I don't wanna see them
on you again. Hoo-ah?

143
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,134
Hoo-ah.

144
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,228
Is that a hot weapon?

145
00:15:56,292 --> 00:16:00,141
- Is that your move?
- Is my hand on the piece?

146
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,867
I can mate you in three
whatever you do.

147
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:07,299
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counselling with others.

148
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,641
Well, she's just lying in wait.

149
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,999
Griz. Yikes.

150
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,268
It's good.
You're really improving.

151
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,113
- Ah.
- If I may make a suggestion.

152
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,880
- Observation.
- It's a children's book, right?

153
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,889
Right.

154
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:31,571
They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of the children.

155
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,292
This is the part of the story
where our knight, our warrior,

156
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,300
is about to slay
the one-eyed dragon.

157
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,602
That's scary. Besides,
my daughter loves this stuff.

158
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:43,458
- I thought you finished that last week.
- You done?

159
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:48,396
Hey. We are at the
ten-yard line here, men. You understand?

160
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,489
Can you count?

161
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:54,003
One, two, 10. Okay?
Where are my running backs?

162
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,770
- Where are my running backs?
Hoo-ah!

163
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,621
Hey, I didn't see you
in church on Sunday, soldier.

164
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,713
You had something
more important to do?

165
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,890
Not on Sunday, you don't.
Not anymore.

166
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,903
I will make you believe,
you understand?

167
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,434
It's pretty funny, hoo-ah?

168
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:28,406
Hoo-ah.

169
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:31,964
It was a good impression.
I recognise myself.

170
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,901
All right, carry on.

171
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,664
- Quick word, specialist.
- Sir.

172
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:41,881
Tell me, Pilla.

173
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,393
You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

174
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,564
Roger that, sir.

175
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,540
'Cause if I ever see you
undermining it again,

176
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,043
you'll be cleaning latrines with your
tongue until you can't taste the difference

177
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,302
between shit and French fries.
Are we clear?

178
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,102
- Hoo-ah, sir.
- All right.

179
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,151
Listen to this.
If one skinny kills another skinny,

180
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,206
his clan owes the dead guy's clan
a hundred camels.

181
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,972
- A hundred camels.
- Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

182
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,776
Must be a lot
a fucking camel debt.

183
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,367
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

184
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,464
Well, ask Sergeant Eversmann.
He likes the skinnies.

185
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:22,519
Sergeant Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

186
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:26,704
It's not that I like them
or I don't like them. I respect them.

187
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,922
See, what you guys
fail to realise

188
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,057
is the sergeant here
is a bit of an idealist.

189
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:34,907
He believes in this mission down to
his very bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

190
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,714
Look, these people,
they have no jobs,

191
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:42,649
no food, no education,
no future.

192
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:46,500
I just figure that... I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

193
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,601
We can either help or we can sit back and
watch the country destroy itself on CNN.

194
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,358
Right?

195
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:55,624
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

196
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,632
You trained to fight,
sergeant?

197
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,315
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

198
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,663
Like the man said,
he's an idealist.

199
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:08,596
Wait. This is my favourite part.

200
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,088
Stay away from the cans!

201
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,809
Die, gas pumper!

202
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,692
Stay away from those cans!

203
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,170
Beales!

204
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:28,141
No, no, no, no.
Stay back. Stay back.

205
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,276
Wilkie, he's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

206
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,958
Hey, John. It's okay.

207
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,720
John, it's okay. It's okay.

208
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,602
Well, he'll be fine,
but not in this army.

209
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,453
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic. Going home.

210
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:36,943
I'm putting you
in charge of his chalk.

211
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,623
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.

212
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,008
Now, it's a big responsibility.

213
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,226
Your men are gonna look to you
to make the right decisions.

214
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,491
Their lives depend on it.

215
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,499
All right.

216
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:52,848
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.

217
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,023
Good luck, sergeant.

218
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,227
The long anticipated
meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet

219
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,780
may take place today
at 1500 hours.

220
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:46,584
I say "may" because
we all know by now,

221
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:49,597
with the intel we get on
the street, nothing is certain.

222
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,946
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

223
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:56,670
Two tier-one personalities
may be present.

224
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,483
Omar Salad, Aidid's
top political advisor,

225
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:04,328
and Abdi Hassan Awale,
Interior Minister.

226
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,798
These are the guys
we're after.

227
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:08,388
Today we go.

228
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:11,569
Same mission template
as before.

229
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:14,038
Fifteen forty-five,
Assault Force Delta

230
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,047
will infiltrate
the target building

231
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,265
and seize
all suspects within.

232
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:21,906
Security Force Rangers: four Ranger chalks,
under the command of Captain Steele,

233
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:26,636
will rope in at 1546 and hold
a four-corner perimeter

234
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,686
around the target building.

235
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:31,951
No one gets in or out.
Extraction Force:

236
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,754
Lieutenant Colonel McKnight's
humvee column

237
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:38,269
will drive into the city at 1547
on Hawlwadig Road

238
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:40,278
and hold just short
of the Olympic Hotel.

239
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,538
Wait for the green light.

240
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,715
Now, once Delta
gives the word,

241
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,891
McKnight's column will move
to the target building

242
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,570
and load the prisoners
on flatbed trucks.

243
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:51,829
Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded,

244
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:54,424
the four Ranger chalks

245
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:58,567
will collapse back to the target
building, load up on humvees,

246
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:02,920
and the entire ground force will
exfil the three miles back to base.

247
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:05,975
Mission time from incursion to
extraction no longer than 30 minutes.

248
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,235
Now,

249
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:12,335
I had requested light armour
and AC-130 Specter gunships,

250
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:16,521
but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

251
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,823
Too high-profile.

252
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:22,130
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover

253
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:24,138
with mini-guns and 2.75 rockets.

254
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,147
Colonel Harrell.

255
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:28,156
In the C-2 bird,

256
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,542
Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission,

257
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,848
and I will coordinate
ground forces.

258
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,690
Colonel Matthews.

259
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:38,535
Mission launch code word
is "Irene."

260
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:40,293
Questions?

261
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:44,645
Which building is it, sir?

262
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,198
Exactly which building
we're confirming right now.

263
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:50,337
Somewhere around
the Bakara market.

264
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:53,769
I don't choose the time
and place of their meetings.

265
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,615
I didn't say
a word, sir.

266
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,623
Make no mistake.

267
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:02,809
Once you're in the Bakara market,
you're in an entirely hostile district.

268
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:06,408
Don't underestimate
their capabilities.

269
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:10,216
We'll be going through friendly
neighbourhoods before we hit the market.

270
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,225
So remember the rules
of engagement:

271
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:14,569
No one fires
unless fired upon.

272
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,540
Let's go get this thing done.

273
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,633
Good luck, gentlemen.

274
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:27,584
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

275
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:30,054
No Specter gunships,
daylight instead of night,

276
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:32,689
late afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat,

277
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:37,127
only part of the city Aidid can mount a
serious counterattack on short notice.

278
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:40,391
- What's not to like?
- Life's imperfect.

279
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,491
Yeah. For you two. Circling above
it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.

280
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,379
Down in the street,
it's unforgiving.

281
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:25,589
What the fuck, Smith?

282
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,268
- Well?
- Well, what?

283
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,780
We going?

284
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,081
Why should
I tell you that?

285
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:36,053
Because I'm me.

286
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:40,405
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

287
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,414
- Bakara market.
- All right.

288
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,390
Listen, Smith. I need you to back
me up out there today, all right?

289
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,775
Keep sharp.

290
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,290
- Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
- All right.

291
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,512
Ev, it's gonna
be nothing, man.

292
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,689
Nothing.

293
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,791
It's all in the grind,
Sizemore.

294
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:05,432
Can't be too fine.
Can't be too coarse.

295
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,943
This, my friend,
is a science.

296
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:11,794
I mean, you're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

297
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:14,304
You know?
About "be all you can be."

298
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,070
I made coffee
through Desert Storm.

299
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,687
I made coffee through Panama while
everyone else got to fight,

300
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,758
got to be a Ranger.

301
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,352
Now it's "Grimesy,
black, one sugar,"

302
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,450
or "Grimesy, got
a powdered anywhere?"

303
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,852
- What happened to you?
- Ping-Pong accident.

304
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:38,912
- What?
- So guess what.

305
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,758
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

306
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:43,767
You're fucking me.

307
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,571
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

308
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,463
Sergeant Eversmann said to get
your stuff and get ready.

309
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:52,598
It's what you wanted,
isn't it?

310
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:54,774
Oh, yeah.

311
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,327
Hell, yeah.

312
00:26:57,495 --> 00:27:01,596
Grimesy, I want you to stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it. Hoo-ah?

313
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:04,525
- Hoo-ah.
- I wouldn't worry about that.

314
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:06,660
Generally speaking,
Somalis can't shoot for shit.

315
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:11,222
Don't worry about it. Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the fucking rocks, and you'll be fine.

316
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:14,067
- Might even be fun.
D-boys do their thing now.

317
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:16,620
All we got to do
is cover them.

318
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:19,424
Choppers gonna cover us,
and we'll be all right.

319
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:23,441
Look, you guys, I know this
is my first time as chalk leader,

320
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,414
but this isn't our
first time out together.

321
00:27:26,582 --> 00:27:28,045
This is serious.

322
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:31,645
We're Rangers,
not some sorry-ass J.R.O.T.C.

323
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:35,328
We're elite.
Let's act like it out there.

324
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:37,462
- Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah!

325
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:39,304
Any questions?

326
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,632
We're gonna be okay.

327
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,017
All right, grab your gear.
Let's move out.

328
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,859
Hoo-ah!

329
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,653
You're not gonna
need that, dude.

330
00:28:11,822 --> 00:28:14,165
We're not out there
long enough.

331
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,707
Hey, you're not gonna
need that either.

332
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,511
We'll be back
before dark.

333
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,148
You might as well take
dope and beer instead.

334
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:30,697
What?

335
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:33,082
Ammo, dude.
Take ammo.

336
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:41,536
Let me tell you something,
Grimes.

337
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:44,633
You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.
You don't need another 12.

338
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:48,944
I don't know about you, but I'm not planning
on getting shot in the back running away.

339
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,286
Well, I better keep mine in.

340
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:54,174
Hey, Grimes.
The most important thing,

341
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:57,313
just remember when everybody else is
shooting, shoot in the same direction.

342
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,452
All right.

343
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,869
Look at this, Ruiz. He's taping
his blood type to his boots.

344
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:13,845
- That's bad luck.
- No, it's smart.

345
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,439
All Delta do that.

346
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:20,122
That's bad luck too, man.
Come on. Let's go.

347
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,563
It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

348
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,251
If not, I don't know
what you'd do.

349
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,427
You're a funny guy, man.

350
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:37,490
I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

351
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,550
I'll give it
to you back in an hour.

352
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,735
Blackburn. You okay?

353
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:49,042
I'm excited. In a good way.

354
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,887
I've been training
my whole life for this.

355
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,612
- You ever shot at anybody before?
- No, sir.

356
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,457
Me neither.

357
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:33,863
You think he's reliable?

358
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,872
Well, we'll see.

359
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,300
It's his first time out.

360
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,678
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,533
- Tell him to turn his radio off.
- Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

362
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,987
Hi. You've
reached Stephanie and Randy.

363
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:04,331
Leave us a message.
Thank you.

364
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,772
Hey, baby, it's me.
Are you there?

365
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,948
Pick up if you're there.

366
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,520
I'm just calling to check up on you,
make sure everything's all right.

367
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:19,649
I'll call you
in a couple of hours.

368
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:22,494
You'd better
not be sleeping.

369
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:25,173
Your move, Randy.

370
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:31,199
I'm missing you.
I love you, baby.

371
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,045
Hello? Hello?

372
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,189
Thanks, bud.

373
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:42,039
You know,
it's kind of funny.

374
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:46,266
Beautiful beach,
beautiful sun.

375
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,274
Could almost be
a good place to visit.

376
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:50,617
Almost.

377
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,557
You don't think
we should be here?

378
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:59,407
You know what I think?

379
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:01,750
It don't really matter
what I think.

380
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:05,183
Once that first bullet
goes past your head,

381
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:09,493
politics and all that shit
just goes right out the window.

382
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:12,549
I just wanna do it
right today.

383
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:15,059
Just watch your corner.

384
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:17,403
Get all your men
back here alive.

385
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,196
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

386
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:51,051
Abdi, come in. Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?

387
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,576
Abdi, come in.

388
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:04,778
Can you hear me? Abdi.

389
00:33:04,946 --> 00:33:08,293
Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?

390
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,805
To my right-hand side,
above the café.

391
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:13,148
Sir he says
this is the building.

392
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:15,156
He's certain?

393
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:19,342
Abdi, you need to be sure.
Are you sure?

394
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:25,954
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

395
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,963
But there's too many militia.

396
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:31,144
If I go closer,
they might shoot me.

397
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:34,493
Now he's saying the building's
actually a couple blocks down.

398
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,045
But if he's seen outside it,
he'll be shot.

399
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:40,100
I'll fucking shoot him myself
a couple blocks down.

400
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,783
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked
in front of the damn building.

401
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:47,215
He's not getting paid
until he does exactly that.

402
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:50,312
It's three miles to the target area.
We're never off the main roads.

403
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,618
At the K-4 traffic circle,
we turn north, then east on National,

404
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:57,091
and we wait until extraction
of prisoners is complete here.

405
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,937
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig.
We load the prisoners,

406
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,160
and then the assault and blocking
forces, and bring them back.

407
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,378
Home in an hour.
Okay?

408
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:09,061
Now, there will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

409
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:11,990
But be careful what you shoot at
because people do live there.

410
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:13,831
Hoo-ah!

411
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,552
Hoo-ah!

412
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,321
Last one of these guys shot himself in the
head playing Russian roulette in a bar.

413
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,889
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

414
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:51,163
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time?

415
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,632
He sounds scared shitless.

416
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,102
Good. That's always a good sign.

417
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,243
That's it. That's our signal.

418
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,457
All right.

419
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:18,199
All QRF,
Out of the airspace.

420
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:25,063
All units, Irene.

421
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,950
I say again, Irene.

422
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:39,878
Check in when ready. Barber
5-1 up and ready. Star 4-1 up and ready.

423
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:43,142
- Irene!
- Copy Irene.

424
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,319
Fucking Irene!

425
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,510
Come on.

426
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,425
Good luck, boys.
Be careful.

427
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,601
No one gets left behind.

428
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:15,283
What's wrong?

429
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:19,259
Nothing. He's just
never done that before.

430
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,561
Aw, fuck!

431
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:27,839
Let's go.

432
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:31,773
Sergeant Struecker, let's roll.

433
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,815
Two minutes.

434
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,740
Two minutes.

435
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,952
Why are they burning tires?

436
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,380
Signals to the militia
that we're coming.

437
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:11,323
5-6, it looks like there's
some friendlies on the ground.

438
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,498
It look like I've got intel
on the voice intercept.

439
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,994
But we've got burning
tires in the front of us. Over.

440
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:24,882
One minute.

441
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:31,704
What's that for?

442
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:34,760
Last rope
I almost bit my tongue off.

443
00:41:06,274 --> 00:41:07,906
Touch base.

444
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:15,396
Two feet, one foot. Clear.

445
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:19,624
Little Birds
touching down at target.

446
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,417
Ropes!

447
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:10,263
Go! Go! Go!

448
00:42:17,212 --> 00:42:20,851
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

449
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,535
This is McKnight. Uniform
6-4 approaching staging area.

450
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,767
Down! Get down!
Down! Stay down!

451
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:43,241
- Everybody down!
- Down! Down!

452
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,669
Get down on the floor!

453
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:57,053
Let's go! Let's go!
Grimesy! No fear!

454
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,229
Oh, yeah, right!

455
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:05,841
Rangers securing perimeter.
Four corners.

456
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:11,282
They're shooting at us!
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

457
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,955
Well, shoot back.

458
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:19,610
This is 6-4. Chalks on the ground.
Going into holding pattern.

459
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:22,498
This is 6-2. Delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

460
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,181
Super 6-2, take up an overhead
pattern to provide sniper cover.

461
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,189
- Over.
- This is Super 6-5.

462
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,285
Chalks on the ground.
Going into holding pattern.

463
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:41,372
Go, Blackburn. Go! Go!
Go, Blackburn!

464
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:46,102
- RPG!
- Hold on!

465
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,082
No!

466
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,469
C-2, we got a man fallen.

467
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:06,608
Super 6-1, you're
a sitting duck there.

468
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,450
Blackburn!
Take up overhead pattern

469
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:10,375
to provide sniper cover. Over.

470
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:12,719
Roger that. 6-1 coming out.

471
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:16,067
1-3, go ahead.

472
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:18,578
I need you to move
to the north of the street.

473
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:21,214
Right to the north.
Right there. Over.

474
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,187
Doc! Doc Schmid!

475
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:26,195
Come on!

476
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,623
Schmid, we got a man hit.

477
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:33,309
- Where is he hit?
- He's not. He fell.

478
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:36,281
- What?
- He fell.

479
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:40,759
Why aren't you shooting?

480
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:43,270
We're not being shot at yet.

481
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:46,199
- How can you tell?
- A hiss means it's close.

482
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,548
- A snap means...
- Now they're shooting at us.

483
00:44:58,253 --> 00:44:59,759
Galentine!

484
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:05,954
Get me Captain Steele.
Get me Captain Steele.

485
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,301
Juliet 6-4, this is Juliet 2-5.
Come in. Over.

486
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,645
Blackburn, can you hear me?

487
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:13,988
Juliet 6-4, this is 2-5. Come in.

488
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:16,624
Over. I can't get him.

489
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:20,182
Juliet 6-4, this is Chalk Four.

490
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:23,448
We've got a man down. We need
to get him out of here. Over.

491
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:26,795
This is 6-4.
Say again, 2-5. Over.

492
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:30,812
We've got a man down. Over.

493
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:34,914
Take a breath, 2-5,
and calm down. Over.

494
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,095
- Man down!
- Missed your last, 2-5.

495
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,104
- Fuck it!
- Say again.

496
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,196
Matt, it's a long way
to the humvees.

497
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,879
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

498
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,887
What did he say?

499
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:52,115
Super 6-1, we got a
man wounded on the ground.

500
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,253
Stretcher! Jamie, Stretcher!

501
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,346
Stretcher!

502
00:45:57,514 --> 00:45:59,606
Come on! Come on!

503
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:01,908
Grab this end!

504
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,372
Let's go!

505
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:07,223
All right. Go.

506
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:09,398
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

507
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,994
Up to the humvees.
Now!

508
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,561
Go. Go!

509
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,452
Keep moving.
Grimes, run.

510
00:46:26,434 --> 00:46:28,107
- Secure.
- Let's move out!

511
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:30,576
- Everybody up!
- Let's go!

512
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,631
- Come on!
- Let's go! Let's move!

513
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:39,406
- Grimes, run!
- All right!

514
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,391
C-2, this is Super 6-1.
Beginning my orbit of the target area.

515
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,526
- Roger that.
- Chalk Four,

516
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:49,702
10-4 clear. Coming in.

517
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,756
Kilo 1-1, this is 6-1.

518
00:46:52,925 --> 00:46:55,226
Providing sniper cover
for prisoner extract.

519
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:57,067
Kilo 6-4, green light.

520
00:46:57,236 --> 00:47:01,085
- Ready for extraction. Over.
- Roger that, Kilo 1-1. Will relay.

521
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,261
That's it. We got them.

522
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,735
Uniform 6-4, ready
for extraction. Over.

523
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:09,581
Roger that.
There's the call. Let's move out!

524
00:47:09,749 --> 00:47:12,008
Let's move out!
Hold on!

525
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:28,581
There's fire on the rooftops.

526
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,947
- How much longer?
- Five minutes, sir.

527
00:47:36,115 --> 00:47:37,955
- What?
- Five minutes!

528
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:40,132
Nothing takes five minutes.

529
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:48,292
- What happened to him?
- He fell. Missed the rope.

530
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,804
How'd he do that?

531
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:54,655
Put him in that humvee.
Grimes, give him a hand.

532
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:56,663
Let's go! Let's move it!

533
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,007
- Move! Move! Move! Get them up!
- Come on!

534
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:01,057
Come on!

535
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:03,151
Get him in there!
Get ready to move!

536
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,573
We're ready for your prisoners.

537
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:06,373
Go! Everybody move! Move!

538
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,591
- Hey! Hey!
- Get the fuck up!

539
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:10,767
Grimes!

540
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:14,115
Come on!
Wait! Wait!

541
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,411
Fuck this!

542
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,893
Fuck!

543
00:48:54,502 --> 00:48:58,141
Stop! Hey! Come on!

544
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,159
Move! Move!
Romeo 6-4,

545
00:49:02,328 --> 00:49:05,378
I need to send out three humvees with a
critical casualty. He looks real bad.

546
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:08,102
I need to evac now.
Roger that, Uniform 6-4.

547
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:10,655
We'll chop a team
of gunships to you. Over.

548
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:15,008
Roger that. Hey, Sanderson, I need
extra security on these humvees.

549
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:18,189
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

550
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:21,034
Do it. Struecker,
you're lead humvee.

551
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:22,541
Hoo-ah!

552
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:29,217
First three vehicles mount up.
We're moving back to base.

553
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:32,712
Move out! Go!

554
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:52,507
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

555
00:49:52,674 --> 00:49:56,314
I don't wanna talk
about it now, colonel. I'm busy.

556
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:28,875
Sergeant Pilla's hit.
Christ, he's fucked up.

557
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:30,883
Is anyone hit?

558
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:34,901
Struecker, talk to me.
It's Sergeant Pilla.

559
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:39,170
What's his status?
What's his status?

560
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:43,271
- He's dead.
- He's dead.

561
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,406
Pilla's dead, sir.

562
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,340
C-2, this is McKnight.

563
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,562
We have a KIA,
Dominick Pilla. Over.

564
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:54,655
Roger that.

565
00:50:54,823 --> 00:50:58,924
Get on that 50!
Someone get on that 50!

566
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:02,146
It's mine!

567
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,070
Three guys with RPG's
coming up on your side now!

568
00:51:58,269 --> 00:51:59,775
Stay with it!

569
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:03,458
This is 6-1. I'm hit. I'm hit.

570
00:52:03,627 --> 00:52:05,969
Super 6-1 is hit.

571
00:52:06,137 --> 00:52:08,648
He is hit. Wolcott's bird is hit.

572
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:13,167
You wanna pull those PCL's
off-line or what?

573
00:52:13,336 --> 00:52:14,842
Right, babe.

574
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:16,976
Come on.

575
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:26,560
6-1 going down.
6-1 going down.

576
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:30,494
6-1 is going down.
He is going down.

577
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:33,005
- Super 6-1 is going down.
6-1 going down.

578
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:36,729
6-1 is going down.

579
00:52:36,898 --> 00:52:39,575
I repeat, 6-1 is going down.

580
00:52:42,882 --> 00:52:45,434
Hold on!

581
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:10,922
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

582
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,436
Super 6-1 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

583
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:16,613
Super 6-1 is on the deck now.

584
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:19,962
Get an MH-6 on site.
Check for survivors.

585
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,304
Send in the SAR Bird.

586
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:26,113
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

587
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:28,373
Can you guide
the convoy in there?

588
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:31,094
- Roger that.
- Well, move quick.

589
00:53:31,262 --> 00:53:34,525
The whole damn city will be
coming down on top of them.

590
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:39,213
Star 4-1, come inbound and see if
you can land at the crash site.

591
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:42,059
Roger that. Star 4-1 inbound.

592
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:56,414
We just lost the initiative.

593
00:54:02,483 --> 00:54:05,663
- 2-5, this is 6-4. Over.
- This is 2-5. Over.

594
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:09,806
2-5, Chalk Four is closest
to the crash site. Over.

595
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:12,485
6-4, I can't see
the crash site. Over.

596
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:15,874
2-5, it's due east of you.
You will find it.

597
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:17,883
Leave a security
element in place.

598
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:20,018
Take the rest of your chalk
on foot to the crash.

599
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:23,575
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow. Over.

600
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,723
- 2-5, do you read me? Over.
- Roger that.

601
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,234
Galentine! Schmid!

602
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:34,205
Go get Yurek.
Get Twombly.

603
00:54:34,373 --> 00:54:36,632
Hey, there's
a Black Hawk down.

604
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,231
Twombly, Nelson, you're gonna stay here.
You're gonna hold this corner

605
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,240
and then exfil
with the humvees.

606
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:45,338
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
All right? Let's go. Hoo-ah?

607
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,848
Hoo-ah!
- How come I gotta stay back here?

608
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:51,029
Because you're dependable.

609
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:53,122
All right.

610
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,051
Let's go!

611
00:55:00,907 --> 00:55:02,874
I hate being dependable, man.

612
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:20,898
Juliet 2-5, hostiles advancing
parallel west to your position.

613
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:23,157
Be advised, women and children
among them. Over.

614
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:25,417
Hit the wall.

615
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:42,911
Incoming!

616
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:50,277
Grenade!

617
00:56:05,805 --> 00:56:08,440
Go!

618
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:19,991
We still got guys inside.

619
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,046
All right, all right.
I'm gonna go to the crash.

620
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:24,008
You take the rest
of the team.

621
00:56:24,177 --> 00:56:26,017
- I'll finish loading the prisoners.
- Negative!

622
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:28,235
You'll proceed
to the crash site together.

623
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:30,663
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees. Roger, sir?

624
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:32,546
- Roger that.
- Follow my lead.

625
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,391
Sarge,
are you receiving me?

626
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,740
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving, sir.

627
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,921
All right, we need
to move out now!

628
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:43,929
I'll finish loading
the prisoners

629
00:56:44,098 --> 00:56:46,273
and pick you up at the crash site.
All right.

630
00:56:46,441 --> 00:56:49,453
Let's move out!
Move it out! Go!

631
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:59,331
Get in! Get in the truck!
Go! Move!

632
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,018
In there! Move it!

633
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,278
Grimes!

634
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:14,815
Eight o'clock!

635
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:30,803
Hey, Grimes,
stay away from the walls.

636
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,291
Hey, Grimes.

637
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,054
- You okay?
- Yeah!

638
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:53,151
Let's go, Maddox.

639
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:56,331
- C-2 convoy moving out.
- Roger that.

640
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,926
Maddox, look at these jerks,
these idiots!

641
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:01,396
Go, go!
Right, Maddox, right!

642
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,950
Twombly,
the convoy's leaving!

643
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:17,968
- Hey, Twombly!
- What?

644
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:20,856
- I think they've forgotten us.
- What?

645
00:58:21,024 --> 00:58:23,116
Doesn't matter.

646
00:58:29,563 --> 00:58:33,161
6-3 confirm. We got skinnies
moving in from all directions.

647
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:35,671
We need to get them help now.

648
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,485
Indigenous personnel
advancing to Wolcott crash site.

649
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:45,129
- Say again. Over.
- A lot of people closing in.

650
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:50,152
How far is Chalk Four
from the crash site?

651
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,542
- Six blocks, sir.
- Well, they need to haul ass.

652
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:49,789
Get down! Get down!

653
00:59:49,957 --> 00:59:52,091
Scotty, are you okay?

654
00:59:54,185 --> 00:59:56,444
No, don't go back!

655
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,167
Get down! Get down!

656
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:12,263
- Technicals!
- Got them!

657
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,141
Six o'clock! Move, move!

658
01:00:43,945 --> 01:00:46,664
Go! Go, go, go!

659
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:53,277
Go, go!

660
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:57,923
Come on!

661
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:08,093
Yurek, leaving!

662
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:11,985
Yurek! Come on!

663
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:41,574
Shh.

664
01:02:39,328 --> 01:02:42,675
Uniform 6-4, left turn, left turn.

665
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:48,032
Romeo 6-4, I need to know before
I get to the goddamn street!

666
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:50,460
You have to slow down.
There's a delay

667
01:02:50,628 --> 01:02:52,468
from the time directions
are relayed

668
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:55,105
from surveillance
to JOC, then to me.

669
01:02:55,274 --> 01:03:00,253
We can't slow down! We're taking heavy
enemy fire! We can't slow down!

670
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:04,605
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

671
01:03:04,774 --> 01:03:07,493
So get me my fucking
directions to the crash site!

672
01:03:07,662 --> 01:03:11,637
Danny, hold on. I no longer
have the best view of your route.

673
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:14,357
Then get your ass in
the right place, goddamn it!

674
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:18,123
What in the hell is the status
of Struecker's humvees?

675
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,844
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

676
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:24,444
ETA base momentarily.

677
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:31,976
Open the gate.

678
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:55,371
Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!

679
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:56,542
Come on!

680
01:03:59,138 --> 01:04:01,857
Watch his head. Easy.

681
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:12,614
Blackburn, can you hear me?

682
01:04:47,476 --> 01:04:50,279
Star 4-1 is at the crash
site to evacuate the injured.

683
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:52,414
- Over.
- Roger that.

684
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:34,934
I got you. Easy, easy.

685
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:45,690
Galentine, you all right?
Galentine, Kurth, with me!

686
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,662
- Cover fire now.
- Full cover!

687
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:04,480
Hey, Jones!
How many are in there?

688
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:08,247
Two pilots are dead.
Two crew chiefs are wounded.

689
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,549
This guy's hurt bad.
We gotta get out of here now.

690
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:12,098
All right, go ahead!

691
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:48,090
2-6, 2-6, this is 2-5. Is that you
shooting up the technicals? Over.

692
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:50,894
This is 2-6. Roger that.

693
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:53,111
DiTomasso,
take the southeast corner.

694
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,995
We're setting up
a perimeter. Over.

695
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:58,719
This is 2-6. Roger that.
Moving there now. Move out!

696
01:07:01,692 --> 01:07:04,244
Captain Steele,
Captain Steele, come in.

697
01:07:06,212 --> 01:07:08,178
Go ahead, 2-5.
This is 6-4.

698
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:12,740
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper.

699
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:14,749
We need a medivac
over here now!

700
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:17,845
2-5, they're telling me
it's too hot to land the bird.

701
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:20,733
You got to secure
the perimeter first. Over.

702
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,407
Where are the humvees?

703
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:25,672
Be advised, 2-5,
the convoy will be there.

704
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,355
They're encountering
a lot of resistance. 6-4 out.

705
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:42,873
Get the 50 up!

706
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,383
You should see
the crash directly ahead.

707
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:47,853
All I see is a roadblock!

708
01:07:48,021 --> 01:07:51,410
All right. I'll have to
figure out another way.

709
01:08:16,145 --> 01:08:19,576
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

710
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,924
Fire your weapon,
Othic!

711
01:08:52,806 --> 01:08:57,241
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

712
01:09:02,599 --> 01:09:03,811
Othic!

713
01:09:06,282 --> 01:09:08,122
Medic!

714
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:10,299
Hoo-ah!

715
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:40,766
Medic! Medic!

716
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:43,319
Joyce! Joyce!

717
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:46,626
Come on, help me pick him up!

718
01:09:46,794 --> 01:09:51,229
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again!

719
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:56,084
- Keep going straight 200 metres.
- Roger that.

720
01:09:57,424 --> 01:10:01,190
Let's go! Let's go,
goddamn it! Let's go!

721
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:22,785
- Hey, Twombles. Come here.
- What?

722
01:10:26,595 --> 01:10:28,896
The humvees
ain't coming back, dude.

723
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:31,657
What?

724
01:10:31,825 --> 01:10:34,168
Were we supposed
to go to them?

725
01:10:34,337 --> 01:10:36,177
I thought they were
supposed to come to us.

726
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:39,651
Shit. Shit, I think we're
supposed to go to them.

727
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,786
Shit.

728
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:43,794
Okay.

729
01:10:43,963 --> 01:10:46,137
- Let's go to the crash site.
- Okay.

730
01:10:46,306 --> 01:10:49,821
Just don't fire that thing so close to
my head. I can barely hear as it is.

731
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:51,704
Okay, move out.

732
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,561
Shit! Get down!

733
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:09,950
What'd I just tell you?

734
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:12,127
I swear to God,
you do that again...

735
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:17,108
You okay?

736
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:19,618
Nelson, you all right?

737
01:11:19,787 --> 01:11:21,627
What?

738
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:25,227
Search and rescue bird
on station, inserting medics.

739
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,227
Go, go!

740
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,834
Son of a bitch.
C-2, this is 6-8. We've been hit.

741
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:53,350
Super 6-8, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

742
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:57,536
Advise you to come out now.
Roger. Dropping last man.

743
01:11:59,838 --> 01:12:02,683
Art, I've got skinnies
with RPG's at 12 o'clock.

744
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,482
- Go! Go!
- Can you see them?

745
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:07,077
- Got them.
- Give me 90 degrees left.

746
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:19,884
6-8 coming out.

747
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:23,232
Super 6-8 is out. Over.

748
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:35,285
Hey, Wilkie,
what's the situation in there?

749
01:12:35,454 --> 01:12:37,671
Both pilots are dead.

750
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:41,312
2-5, we can't move
these guys, Matty.

751
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,320
We'll kill them
just carrying them.

752
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,497
- Stabilise in here?
- Roger.

753
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:48,593
Stabilise in the bird.
Repeat, stabilise in here. Over.

754
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:51,397
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

755
01:12:51,565 --> 01:12:55,121
Super 6-4, come inbound
and take Wolcott's position.

756
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:58,428
Roger. 6-4 is inbound.

757
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,179
Super 6-4, you all right?

758
01:13:27,348 --> 01:13:30,193
This is Super 6-4.
We're good.

759
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,872
You sure? You look like
you got clipped pretty good.

760
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,224
Instrument panels are okay.
No, we're good.

761
01:13:37,393 --> 01:13:39,610
Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

762
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:44,297
All right, put her down on the airfield,
Super 6-4. Have it checked out to be safe.

763
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:47,101
Roger.

764
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:53,337
I'm getting a lot of movement in these
pedals. Check the systems again.

765
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:10,035
We lost the tail rotor.
It's gone.

766
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,728
6-4 is going down!
6-4 is going in hard!

767
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:19,786
6-4 going down.

768
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:26,524
We're going down. Wait!

769
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:32,550
Get Struecker's column
back out there.

770
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,518
They need to get
to Durant's crash site fast.

771
01:14:34,687 --> 01:14:36,150
We got another bird down.

772
01:14:36,318 --> 01:14:39,708
I want them out of there.
All of them.

773
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:46,362
Captain Steele, we gotta move
or we're gonna get pinned down!

774
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,041
We're moving
just as fast as we can.

775
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:52,472
You let me do my job
and you do yours. Over.

776
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,148
Fuck! Fuck!
Ruiz, stay down! Medic!

777
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:08,334
Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll
take out the threat in the window.

778
01:15:08,502 --> 01:15:11,138
We'll rally point at the grey building.
Coming through, Captain.

779
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,105
- Sergeant!
- All right, let's move!

780
01:15:13,273 --> 01:15:16,662
- Move! Let's move now!
- Move!

781
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:21,894
Cover me!

782
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,966
Let's go, let's move!
Move out!

783
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:36,918
Friendly!
Friendlies coming through!

784
01:15:37,086 --> 01:15:39,345
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Move up!

785
01:15:39,514 --> 01:15:43,153
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

786
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:52,403
Move it out! Move up!
Go! Go! Go! Move up!

787
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:54,662
What the fuck are you
doing out there?

788
01:15:54,831 --> 01:15:56,838
I'm doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

789
01:15:56,923 --> 01:16:00,020
We got to get out on that street,
and we got to move!

790
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:03,033
You have got to keep up, sir!

791
01:16:03,201 --> 01:16:04,957
Don't you ever
give me orders, sergeant.

792
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:09,980
We are combat ineffective, you understand
me? We got too many damn wounded to move!

793
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:13,077
Then give me some of your shooters,
and I'll circle us to the bird.

794
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:18,601
Grimes!
You're with Chalk Four?

795
01:16:18,769 --> 01:16:21,321
- Yes, sir!
- All right, hook up with Delta!

796
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,330
Rejoin with
Sergeant Eversmann.

797
01:16:23,499 --> 01:16:27,641
The rest of you men secure this
position, treat the wounded.

798
01:16:27,809 --> 01:16:31,199
We'll wait for the convoy, then we'll
rally at the crash site. Roger!

799
01:16:31,366 --> 01:16:32,914
My guys, let's go!

800
01:17:04,011 --> 01:17:05,977
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,

801
01:17:06,145 --> 01:17:09,576
Shughart and Gordon, volunteering
to secure crash site two. Over.

802
01:17:09,744 --> 01:17:13,635
No, Super 6-2.
Negative that request.

803
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:15,686
Can't risk another bird.

804
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,532
We don't see anything
moving down there now.

805
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,541
We don't even know
if anyone's alive.

806
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,474
A ground team is being
organised to go in now.

807
01:17:24,643 --> 01:17:29,622
- ETA on ground team. Over.
- Unknown, not long.

808
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:32,301
Do what you can from the air.

809
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,500
All right, gather around!
Durant's 6-4 is down.

810
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:42,303
- We're going back in to get him.
- That's crazy.

811
01:17:42,472 --> 01:17:44,312
- Is there anyone alive on that?
- Doesn't matter.

812
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,005
No one gets left behind.
You know that.

813
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:48,497
- We're wasting time here.
- All right.

814
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:51,762
Refit and max out ammo
and grenades. You got five.

815
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,820
Sizemore, where the hell
you think you're going?

816
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,123
- With you guys.
- Not with that cast on, you're not.

817
01:17:58,292 --> 01:18:00,383
All right, all right, all right.

818
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,731
Go get your K-pot.
Hey.

819
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,912
- Talk to me.
- I can't go back out there.

820
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:11,849
Thomas, everyone feels
the same way you do, all right?

821
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:15,114
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

822
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:19,885
It's your call. Hoo-ah?

823
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:26,874
Hoo-ah.

824
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:46,293
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

825
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:58,011
Sergeant Struecker!

826
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:01,695
Sergeant Struecker!
Can I go, sarge?

827
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:03,829
- You got some ammo?
- Roger that, Sarge!

828
01:19:03,997 --> 01:19:06,674
Hop in!

829
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:26,219
Wait!

830
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:29,191
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

831
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:53,506
Which way?

832
01:19:58,362 --> 01:19:59,408
That way, I think!

833
01:19:59,575 --> 01:20:03,132
Don't talk so fucking loud!

834
01:20:35,316 --> 01:20:37,073
Nice donkey.

835
01:20:55,153 --> 01:20:56,492
Rangers?

836
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:02,434
- Who?
- It's Yurek, you fucking assholes!

837
01:21:02,602 --> 01:21:06,786
- Fuck!
- Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

838
01:21:06,955 --> 01:21:10,260
- Well, come to us!
- Fuck you! Come to me!

839
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:23,946
Sorry, Sarge!

840
01:21:24,114 --> 01:21:26,122
Dude, where the fuck
have you been?

841
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,088
Never mind.
You brought NOD, right?

842
01:21:28,257 --> 01:21:29,763
No. No, I didn't bring it.

843
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:33,464
You wanna know why? You said, "You're not gonna
need that. We'll be back in a half hour."

844
01:21:33,614 --> 01:21:35,454
I wasn't saying it to you.

845
01:21:35,623 --> 01:21:37,924
- Aaugh!
- Nelson, cover this way.

846
01:21:38,092 --> 01:21:40,560
- We're gonna need night vision.
- What's the matter with you?

847
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:43,113
- Huh?
- Oh, he's deaf.

848
01:21:43,282 --> 01:21:46,587
It's my fault. I...
We need to get out of here.

849
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:49,391
That way. We can't be
far from the crash.

850
01:21:49,559 --> 01:21:51,650
Which way?

851
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:54,623
I thought you might know.

852
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,258
Let's move out.

853
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,211
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.

854
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,260
Nelson, Twombly, come in.
This is Galentine.

855
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:10,651
We need a position
of the convoy. Over.

856
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,037
I can't raise them, sergeant.
I can't raise them.

857
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:15,213
Sir, let's get the fuck
out of here and evac!

858
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,668
- Let's move out!
- All right!

859
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:21,909
Back to the stronghold!
Come on!

860
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,890
Ground forces have occupied several
buildings along Marehan Road,

861
01:22:27,058 --> 01:22:28,898
but they're all spread out.

862
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:33,585
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site here.

863
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:36,138
DiTomasso is in
the adjacent structure.

864
01:22:36,307 --> 01:22:39,696
Captain Steele and about
40 men, Rangers, are here.

865
01:22:39,864 --> 01:22:42,500
A couple blocks away.
They're banged up pretty bad.

866
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,843
He set up a casualty
collection point.

867
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:46,852
I don't think they're
gonna be able to move.

868
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,488
Sergeant Sanderson
and a small Delta team

869
01:22:49,657 --> 01:22:54,092
are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

870
01:23:04,263 --> 01:23:09,117
Draw off fire! When this asshole
stops to reload, cover me!

871
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:12,214
Go!
Sir!

872
01:23:14,266 --> 01:23:16,483
Again!

873
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,174
Loading!

874
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:27,323
Keep going! Keep going!
I'm jammed!

875
01:23:28,913 --> 01:23:30,963
I got it!

876
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:33,140
Ah, shit!

877
01:23:46,993 --> 01:23:49,671
RPG!

878
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:04,109
You all right?

879
01:24:04,277 --> 01:24:06,117
- You okay?
- Yeah.

880
01:24:06,286 --> 01:24:08,504
I can hear bells ringing.

881
01:24:09,843 --> 01:24:10,846
Come on!

882
01:24:11,015 --> 01:24:15,074
Come on! Go!

883
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:25,328
There's a crowd advancing
six, seven blocks from the crash.

884
01:24:25,496 --> 01:24:29,262
Shughart and Gordon again request
permission to secure until convoy arrives.

885
01:24:29,556 --> 01:24:31,354
Over.

886
01:24:31,522 --> 01:24:34,619
General, crowd's
in the hundreds now.

887
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:37,505
From where they are, they can see
things clearer than any of us.

888
01:24:37,674 --> 01:24:40,310
They know what they're asking.

889
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:43,239
Let me talk to them.
This is Garrison.

890
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:46,002
I want to make sure that y'all
understand what you're asking for,

891
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,475
so say it out loud and clear.

892
01:24:49,644 --> 01:24:53,410
We're asking to go in and set up a
perimeter until ground support arrives.

893
01:24:53,577 --> 01:24:56,716
And you realise that I cannot
tell you when that might be.

894
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:59,771
- It could take quite a while.
- Roger that.

895
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:02,993
- And you still want to go in there?
- Yes, sir.

896
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:08,559
- Harrell?
- Yes, general.

897
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,778
It's your call.

898
01:25:10,946 --> 01:25:12,535
Roger that.

899
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:16,512
Goffena, put them in.

900
01:25:36,642 --> 01:25:38,106
RPG!

901
01:25:48,235 --> 01:25:50,871
Set up your perimeter!

902
01:25:56,815 --> 01:25:59,618
There's a fucking rocket
in him, sir!

903
01:25:59,786 --> 01:26:03,928
Othic, calm down, goddamn it! That's
live ordnance! Now get out! Get out!

904
01:26:04,097 --> 01:26:06,858
Son of a bitch.

905
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:09,872
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up!

906
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,340
Easy, easy!
All right, get him in there!

907
01:26:12,508 --> 01:26:16,065
Good, good! Easy, easy!

908
01:26:16,233 --> 01:26:18,408
Get in that truck and drive.
But I'm shot, colonel.

909
01:26:18,577 --> 01:26:22,175
Everybody's shot! We need
the prisoners! Let's go!

910
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:26,110
Surveillance says to take
Hawlwadig, then go straight.

911
01:26:26,277 --> 01:26:30,712
McKnight, we need you to turn
around and head back to Hawlwadig.

912
01:26:30,881 --> 01:26:32,889
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

913
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:34,897
There's gotta be a better route!

914
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:37,074
That's the info I'm getting
from JOC

915
01:26:37,243 --> 01:26:40,297
You need to turn around
and head back.

916
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:43,729
Roger that, roger that.

917
01:26:43,897 --> 01:26:46,700
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

918
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,634
They're trying to get us
all fucking killed!

919
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:51,472
- Just get it over with! Drive!
- Goddamn!

920
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,192
Get us out of here!
Goddamn it, drive!

921
01:27:01,767 --> 01:27:02,938
Keep your foot on the gas!

922
01:27:03,944 --> 01:27:05,701
Keep your foot on the...

923
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:18,255
Fuck!

924
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:22,231
Shit.

925
01:27:37,425 --> 01:27:40,437
C-2, Shughart and
Gordon are on the deck. Over.

926
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:41,608
Roger.

927
01:28:07,766 --> 01:28:09,774
Friendlies!

928
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:12,871
God, it's good to see you!

929
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,758
- It's good to see you. How bad?
- My leg's broken

930
01:28:15,927 --> 01:28:18,060
and my back feels
kind of weird.

931
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:22,413
We've got to get you out of here, buddy.
Pulling him out! Cover!

932
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:28,650
Wait. I... Aah!

933
01:28:35,514 --> 01:28:37,270
Put you down.

934
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:39,525
C-2, we're at the 6-4
crash site, securing perimeter.

935
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:40,534
Roger that.

936
01:28:40,703 --> 01:28:42,334
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

937
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:45,263
You're locked and loaded. Any
skinnies come around these corners,

938
01:28:45,432 --> 01:28:48,611
you watch our backs.
Hey, where's the rescue squad?

939
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,872
We're it.

940
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:58,100
All right, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Maddox, stop.

941
01:28:59,913 --> 01:29:03,511
Son of a bitch. Romeo 6-4,
we're back where we started.

942
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,487
I'm running low on ammo,
I got many wounded, including me,

943
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:09,495
vehicles that are
barely running.

944
01:29:09,664 --> 01:29:12,509
Okay, Danny, I need a no-B.S.
assessment here.

945
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:15,061
Can you get to the crash site?

946
01:29:15,858 --> 01:29:18,493
Colonel, I can't see shit.

947
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:26,403
Negative. With the amount of wounded
we have, we'd do more harm than good.

948
01:29:26,572 --> 01:29:28,580
We need to come back to base,
rearm and regroup,

949
01:29:28,748 --> 01:29:31,342
 -...and then we can go back out.
- Roger.

950
01:29:33,393 --> 01:29:37,117
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

951
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:39,963
Roger. Return to base.

952
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:44,483
We're going home!
Let's go. Left.

953
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,390
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

954
01:30:05,786 --> 01:30:07,626
- What's up?
- They're sending them back.

955
01:30:07,795 --> 01:30:10,262
The convoy's headed
back to base camp.

956
01:30:10,431 --> 01:30:13,778
That makes sense, don't it? We
need to exfil the wounded now

957
01:30:13,947 --> 01:30:17,293
and get out of here
before it's too late!

958
01:30:17,462 --> 01:30:19,805
If Colonel McKnight went back to
base, then he had a good reason.

959
01:30:19,973 --> 01:30:22,650
- It changes nothing.
- All right, listen up.

960
01:30:23,824 --> 01:30:26,834
We're gonna hold the perimeter, and we're
gonna hold the strongpoint. Hoo-ah?

961
01:30:26,837 --> 01:30:28,008
Hoo-ah!

962
01:30:28,176 --> 01:30:31,522
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

963
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:33,155
Hoo-ah.

964
01:30:33,324 --> 01:30:38,093
The convoy's gonna come.
We're gonna get home.

965
01:30:49,771 --> 01:30:51,235
Loading!

966
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,112
Loading!

967
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,497
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

968
01:31:16,765 --> 01:31:18,061
Loading!

969
01:31:21,452 --> 01:31:23,878
Randy, last mag!

970
01:31:26,725 --> 01:31:27,938
Gordy!

971
01:31:31,162 --> 01:31:32,249
Fuck!

972
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:47,943
Gordy's gone, man.
I'll be outside.

973
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:50,161
Good luck.

974
01:32:10,628 --> 01:32:13,849
We need the 10th Mountain
in there. Everything they got.

975
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:17,364
Pakistanis, Malays.
I want their tanks and A.P.C.'s.

976
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,499
They still don't know
we've gone in.

977
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:24,185
Look, we have stirred up the hornet's nest
here. We're fighting the entire city.

978
01:32:24,354 --> 01:32:28,203
I want every vehicle possible that's
got four wheels and armour. Get it.

979
01:32:28,372 --> 01:32:30,087
Get everything.
Once they've assembled,

980
01:32:30,255 --> 01:32:34,104
we're gonna move our men out of the hostile
area and back to the Pakistani stadium.

981
01:32:34,273 --> 01:32:36,113
The safe zone. Let's go.

982
01:32:36,282 --> 01:32:38,415
Roger that, boss.

983
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:17,951
On your knees!
Get down! Get down!

984
01:35:22,806 --> 01:35:26,572
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

985
01:35:31,177 --> 01:35:34,022
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

986
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:37,788
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

987
01:35:37,957 --> 01:35:41,053
Go 100 metres past it.
That's the crash.

988
01:35:41,221 --> 01:35:43,396
Negative.
You don't understand.

989
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:48,712
It's roadblock after roadblock. You
have to find us another route. Over.

990
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:52,519
There ain't one. The only other
route is all the way around the city.

991
01:35:52,688 --> 01:35:56,370
Roger that.
Kilo 6-4, this is Kilo 1-1.

992
01:35:56,538 --> 01:36:00,848
Request permission to move to crash
site number two on foot. Over.

993
01:36:01,686 --> 01:36:03,945
Green light,
Kilo 1-1. Green light.

994
01:36:04,113 --> 01:36:07,167
Stop the vehicle.
Let me out.

995
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:55,213
After I'm finished with this, I'll
whip you boys up some margaritas.

996
01:36:55,381 --> 01:36:58,310
The usual.
Blended, no salt.

997
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:07,936
This is Kilo 1-2. We've got
to change our position. Over.

998
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:25,596
Eversmann, come in.
Eversmann.

999
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:31,204
Roger, who is this?
Sanderson. Do not...

1000
01:37:31,372 --> 01:37:34,803
I say again, do not fire to the east.
We are coming to you.

1001
01:37:36,311 --> 01:37:40,495
Understood. DiTomasso and his men
are on the southeast corner.

1002
01:37:40,663 --> 01:37:42,378
We need you on
the northeast building.

1003
01:37:42,546 --> 01:37:44,303
Roger. We'll take it.

1004
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,605
Hey, watch out for skinnies.
They're all over the rooftops.

1005
01:37:46,774 --> 01:37:50,121
They're in prayer,
but not for much longer.

1006
01:37:52,842 --> 01:37:54,305
Hold your fire to the east.

1007
01:38:16,613 --> 01:38:18,453
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1008
01:38:18,622 --> 01:38:21,258
I got Nelson
and Twombly with me.

1009
01:38:21,426 --> 01:38:24,313
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1010
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:25,861
We're on the southwest corner.

1011
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:27,411
Where the hell have you
been? Are you okay?

1012
01:38:27,578 --> 01:38:28,959
Yeah.

1013
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:33,353
Hold your fire.
We're coming in.

1014
01:38:37,455 --> 01:38:38,458
We got to go.

1015
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:41,430
Shawn, listen!
Yurek's gonna run first.

1016
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:45,992
When he gets across the street, he's gonna
turn around and cover you as you run.

1017
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:49,800
When you get there, you're gonna turn
around and you're gonna cover me, okay?

1018
01:38:51,726 --> 01:38:53,693
You're not just gonna
run to Eversmann's position.

1019
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:56,831
You're gonna stop, you're gonna turn
around, and you are going to cover me.

1020
01:38:56,999 --> 01:38:59,635
It's important
you understand that.

1021
01:38:59,804 --> 01:39:01,686
Okay, you ready?

1022
01:39:01,855 --> 01:39:03,946
Yeah, I guess.

1023
01:39:07,043 --> 01:39:09,762
Hey! Don't forget.

1024
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:12,567
- What?
- Don't forget.

1025
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:29,266
I got them in my sight.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1026
01:39:29,434 --> 01:39:31,316
I see them.

1027
01:39:33,536 --> 01:39:35,209
Let's move out.

1028
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,979
- Can you cover us, sergeant?
- We got you.

1029
01:39:48,183 --> 01:39:49,939
Nelson!

1030
01:39:56,386 --> 01:39:57,808
Fuck!

1031
01:40:05,426 --> 01:40:06,889
Twombly!

1032
01:40:08,397 --> 01:40:10,907
Smith! No!
You all right?

1033
01:40:14,633 --> 01:40:17,101
Get it off of me! Get it off!

1034
01:40:19,236 --> 01:40:21,914
Come on, man! Come on!

1035
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:25,221
Doc! Give me some help
with Smith here!

1036
01:40:33,131 --> 01:40:34,679
My leg! My leg!

1037
01:40:34,847 --> 01:40:36,728
Come on, Jamie,
I got you!

1038
01:40:43,761 --> 01:40:47,401
Up, one, two, three. You're all right.
You're all right.

1039
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:49,536
All right. I need
pressure on this wound.

1040
01:40:49,704 --> 01:40:51,795
My right thigh!
Pressure, okay?

1041
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:53,638
Are my balls okay?

1042
01:40:53,805 --> 01:40:56,399
You still have your balls.
I need more men in here.

1043
01:40:56,567 --> 01:40:59,537
Twombly! Nelson!

1044
01:40:59,706 --> 01:41:02,049
Put him down.
Oh, man, that really...

1045
01:41:02,218 --> 01:41:04,184
I need that chair.
It really hurts!

1046
01:41:04,352 --> 01:41:06,067
Pressure.
Direct pressure on that.

1047
01:41:07,826 --> 01:41:10,545
- Let me see it!
- All right.

1048
01:41:10,714 --> 01:41:12,680
Let me get a look at that.

1049
01:41:15,024 --> 01:41:16,278
Oh, fuck!

1050
01:41:16,447 --> 01:41:18,664
What the fuck was that?
It's all right.

1051
01:41:18,832 --> 01:41:20,965
Hold that down.
I need a medivac now.

1052
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,681
Galentine!

1053
01:41:23,938 --> 01:41:25,820
Galentine!
Get me Captain Steele!

1054
01:41:26,658 --> 01:41:29,504
Sergeant?
Sergeant Ruiz, how you doing?

1055
01:41:29,671 --> 01:41:31,386
They're not gonna
come and get us.

1056
01:41:31,555 --> 01:41:33,480
They're not gonna
come for us.

1057
01:41:33,648 --> 01:41:36,136
I need you to suck it up, sergeant.
I need you to focus for me.

1058
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,496
Can you do that?

1059
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:39,714
Come on, 6-4! Come in. Over.

1060
01:41:39,883 --> 01:41:42,644
- Can you hold your weapon?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:41:42,813 --> 01:41:47,081
Anybody comes through that door, you give
him two in the chest and one in the head.

1062
01:41:47,249 --> 01:41:50,680
- You understand?
- I'm still in the fight, sir.

1063
01:41:50,848 --> 01:41:55,451
Captain Steele! Captain Steele, I need a medivac
in here now! Corporal Smith's been hit!

1064
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:58,214
- Hold on, 2-5.
- Still in the fight.

1065
01:41:58,381 --> 01:42:00,724
He's hurt pretty bad.
2-5, we got wounded too.

1066
01:42:00,893 --> 01:42:03,612
You're just gonna have to
maintain your situation. Over.

1067
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:06,415
If he doesn't get to a hospital
in a half hour, he's in trouble.

1068
01:42:06,584 --> 01:42:10,517
C-2, this is 6-4. I'm requesting
an immediate medivac

1069
01:42:10,686 --> 01:42:13,531
for a critically wounded at
Chalk Four's location. Over.

1070
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:16,795
Command, Chalk
Four is requesting medivac.

1071
01:42:16,963 --> 01:42:19,389
Can't risk it.
It's still too hot.

1072
01:42:19,558 --> 01:42:24,788
Captain, we cannot send in
medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1073
01:42:24,957 --> 01:42:28,806
C-5, this is 6-4. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1074
01:42:28,974 --> 01:42:30,689
JOC cannot risk
another bird.

1075
01:42:30,858 --> 01:42:32,740
You're just gonna
have to hold on.

1076
01:42:39,228 --> 01:42:40,775
All right. I got him.

1077
01:42:40,944 --> 01:42:43,370
I want direct pressure
on the wound. Yeah.

1078
01:42:45,213 --> 01:42:47,053
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.

1079
01:43:31,918 --> 01:43:34,972
This is Kilo 1-1.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1080
01:43:35,141 --> 01:43:36,563
Roger that.

1081
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:00,083
Crash site two secured.

1082
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:02,970
Lieutenant Colonel
Cribbs for you, sir.

1083
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:04,185
Cribbs?

1084
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,946
Sir, they're still debating the route.

1085
01:44:07,115 --> 01:44:08,203
How long?

1086
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:11,802
At least a couple hours.
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1087
01:44:11,969 --> 01:44:16,531
Pakistani general says since we didn't
deign to inform him of the raid,

1088
01:44:16,698 --> 01:44:20,422
it's gonna take some time to mobilise the
10th Mountain and a hundred vehicles.

1089
01:44:20,591 --> 01:44:22,809
You tell the general this.

1090
01:44:22,977 --> 01:44:25,947
I understand, but it is
my duty to remind him

1091
01:44:26,115 --> 01:44:30,090
that my men are surrounded by
thousands of armed Somali militia.

1092
01:44:30,259 --> 01:44:33,397
It is imperative that we move
them out of the hostile area

1093
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:35,405
and into the safe zone.

1094
01:44:35,574 --> 01:44:37,414
I need his help now.

1095
01:44:38,461 --> 01:44:40,385
Yes, sir.

1096
01:44:44,697 --> 01:44:46,579
Durant.

1097
01:44:46,748 --> 01:44:51,309
- Michael Durant.
- Yes.

1098
01:44:51,477 --> 01:44:54,154
You are the Ranger
who kills my people?

1099
01:44:54,323 --> 01:44:58,298
I'm not a Ranger.
I'm a pilot.

1100
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:03,152
That's right.

1101
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,914
None of you Americans
smoke anymore.

1102
01:45:09,599 --> 01:45:10,979
You all live long,

1103
01:45:11,147 --> 01:45:14,368
dull, uninteresting lives.

1104
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:18,721
What do you want with me?

1105
01:45:18,889 --> 01:45:21,357
You have taken hostages.

1106
01:45:21,526 --> 01:45:23,366
We have you.

1107
01:45:23,535 --> 01:45:26,966
My government will
never negotiate for me.

1108
01:45:27,134 --> 01:45:31,736
Then perhaps you and I
can negotiate, huh?

1109
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,419
Soldier to soldier.

1110
01:45:36,969 --> 01:45:39,019
Hm?

1111
01:45:41,949 --> 01:45:44,250
I'm not in charge.

1112
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:51,531
Course not. You have the
power to kill, but not negotiate.

1113
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,671
In Somalia,
killing is negotiation.

1114
01:45:56,136 --> 01:45:59,609
Do you really think
if you get General Aidid,

1115
01:45:59,778 --> 01:46:03,251
we will simply
put down our weapons

1116
01:46:03,419 --> 01:46:06,347
and adopt American
democracy?

1117
01:46:06,515 --> 01:46:08,774
That the killing will stop?

1118
01:46:08,943 --> 01:46:13,044
We know this. Without victory,
there can be no peace.

1119
01:46:13,211 --> 01:46:16,558
There will always
be killing, you see?

1120
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:19,111
This is how things are
in our world.

1121
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:35,434
Mike Durant,
we won't leave you behind.

1122
01:46:37,778 --> 01:46:41,293
Mike Durant,
we won't leave you behind.

1123
01:46:43,889 --> 01:46:46,483
You got to take
over for me. Both hands.

1124
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:57,908
It's the femoral artery,
but I can't see it,

1125
01:46:58,076 --> 01:47:01,590
which means that it's
retracted up into the pelvis,

1126
01:47:01,759 --> 01:47:03,645
which means that I have
to find it and clamp it.

1127
01:47:04,855 --> 01:47:08,287
It's the only way to stop the
bleeding. I got no more IVs,

1128
01:47:09,585 --> 01:47:12,471
so I'm gonna need you
to assist, okay?

1129
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,314
Yeah, yeah.

1130
01:47:14,481 --> 01:47:18,247
Now, listen, Jamie.
I gotta do something. It's gonna hurt.

1131
01:47:18,415 --> 01:47:21,511
Okay?
I gotta cause you more pain,

1132
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:24,567
but I have to do it to help you,
you understand?

1133
01:47:24,735 --> 01:47:27,412
- Morphine.
- I can't.

1134
01:47:27,581 --> 01:47:29,965
It'll lower your heart rate
too far. I'm sorry.

1135
01:47:30,133 --> 01:47:32,141
Twombly, why don't you
take his hands there.

1136
01:47:37,164 --> 01:47:39,590
I need you to hold the wound open.
Keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1137
01:47:39,759 --> 01:47:42,311
Yurek, you're gonna take
the feet and a flashlight.

1138
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,203
On my count.
All right, Jamie. All right.

1139
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:52,062
One, two, three.

1140
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:04,493
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay. I feel it. I feel the pulse.

1141
01:48:06,167 --> 01:48:08,971
I got it. I got it.
I got it, yeah. I got it. I got it.

1142
01:48:09,138 --> 01:48:12,067
- You got it? Good.
- I got it. Clamp.

1143
01:48:14,538 --> 01:48:17,215
I got it clamped.
Hold it. Got it.

1144
01:48:17,383 --> 01:48:19,140
Here, grab it.

1145
01:48:19,309 --> 01:48:21,107
It's tearing.
I got it.

1146
01:48:21,276 --> 01:48:23,074
- Doc, it's going back in.
- Hold it! Hold it!

1147
01:48:23,242 --> 01:48:24,623
It's tearing!

1148
01:48:24,791 --> 01:48:28,138
Okay, get out. Hold the wound.
Okay, I'm holding.

1149
01:48:28,808 --> 01:48:30,189
Move your hand.

1150
01:48:41,866 --> 01:48:44,041
What?

1151
01:49:02,081 --> 01:49:04,926
Fix it?

1152
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:09,362
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1153
01:49:24,596 --> 01:49:26,687
What the hell are you doing?

1154
01:49:26,856 --> 01:49:28,696
It's all in the grind, sarge.

1155
01:49:28,865 --> 01:49:31,166
Can't be too fine.
Can't be too coarse.

1156
01:49:31,334 --> 01:49:34,011
Grimesy,
you are squared away.

1157
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:54,350
Sarge, how'd you like
a nice hot cup of joe?

1158
01:49:56,235 --> 01:49:58,746
- Gold Coast blend.
- Sit down.

1159
01:49:58,913 --> 01:50:01,005
Let me take a look
at that foot.

1160
01:50:01,174 --> 01:50:03,349
No, it's not a problem.
Come on, come on.

1161
01:50:10,088 --> 01:50:12,891
- Where the hell did they find you?
- Behind a desk.

1162
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:18,416
No, really.
Do you think I'm kidding?

1163
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:23,438
- Anybody hit?
- We're good!

1164
01:50:28,586 --> 01:50:30,760
- You all right?
- Yeah!

1165
01:50:30,929 --> 01:50:32,225
Is everybody all right?

1166
01:50:32,394 --> 01:50:34,527
Yeah!

1167
01:50:47,586 --> 01:50:49,971
Incoming!

1168
01:51:54,589 --> 01:51:56,597
DiTomosso's hit.
Pull him out!

1169
01:52:29,954 --> 01:52:31,962
Ranger here.
This is Kilo 1-1.

1170
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:34,849
This is Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash site. Who's this? Over.

1171
01:52:35,018 --> 01:52:36,942
This is Hoot. I'm coming
in with three friendlies.

1172
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:38,992
I need some
covering fire. Over.

1173
01:52:39,161 --> 01:52:41,252
Roger that, Kilo 1-1.
Hold your fire!

1174
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:44,140
Deltas coming in.
Hold your fire.

1175
01:52:48,745 --> 01:52:54,101
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1176
01:52:54,269 --> 01:52:57,784
Get Little Birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1177
01:52:57,952 --> 01:53:00,755
If we don't hold back
this city,

1178
01:53:00,923 --> 01:53:03,977
we're gonna have a hundred
caskets to fill by morning.

1179
01:53:04,146 --> 01:53:07,409
Yes, sir. Colonel Harrell, ground
personnel at crash site one

1180
01:53:07,578 --> 01:53:13,059
will have to mark the target with infrared
strobes in preparation for air strike.

1181
01:53:17,873 --> 01:53:19,546
McKnight.

1182
01:53:23,565 --> 01:53:27,121
Between the 10th Mountain and U.
N., we got enough personnel, okay?

1183
01:53:28,545 --> 01:53:31,013
Danny, you guys do not
have to go back out again.

1184
01:53:51,688 --> 01:53:55,078
I can't die here, man.

1185
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:59,388
You're not gonna die, all right?
You're not gonna die.

1186
01:54:00,352 --> 01:54:01,816
I'm sorry.

1187
01:54:01,983 --> 01:54:04,829
You don't have anything
to be sorry for.

1188
01:54:04,997 --> 01:54:07,591
You saved Twombly.
You did perfect.

1189
01:54:07,759 --> 01:54:08,930
Yeah.

1190
01:54:09,099 --> 01:54:11,316
You okay, Twombs?

1191
01:54:11,484 --> 01:54:13,743
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1192
01:54:14,874 --> 01:54:16,672
You did what you were
trained to do.

1193
01:54:18,222 --> 01:54:19,644
You should be proud of that.

1194
01:54:23,161 --> 01:54:24,583
Be proud of that.

1195
01:54:25,378 --> 01:54:26,674
Ev?

1196
01:54:26,843 --> 01:54:28,475
Yeah.

1197
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:30,692
Do me a favour.

1198
01:54:31,572 --> 01:54:32,868
Yeah?

1199
01:54:33,749 --> 01:54:38,435
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1200
01:54:38,603 --> 01:54:41,741
And that I...

1201
01:54:41,909 --> 01:54:44,001
That I...

1202
01:54:46,137 --> 01:54:48,479
That I fought hard.

1203
01:54:49,945 --> 01:54:52,623
You're gonna
tell them yourself, okay?

1204
01:54:52,791 --> 01:54:54,339
Do you hear me?

1205
01:54:55,804 --> 01:54:56,975
All right?

1206
01:54:58,943 --> 01:55:01,997
Are the humvees here?
They're coming, Jamie.

1207
01:55:02,165 --> 01:55:04,383
They're coming.

1208
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:07,815
You just gotta hang in there a little bit.
Hold on for just a little bit.

1209
01:55:07,982 --> 01:55:10,828
I can. I can.

1210
01:55:12,126 --> 01:55:16,477
It's nothing.

1211
01:55:16,646 --> 01:55:19,072
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

1212
01:55:19,241 --> 01:55:23,886
It's nothing.
Nothing.

1213
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:33,888
Oh, shit. Hold the wound.

1214
01:55:58,748 --> 01:56:01,007
Doc.

1215
01:56:01,176 --> 01:56:08,081
Doc.

1216
01:56:23,859 --> 01:56:25,908
It's okay.

1217
01:56:51,564 --> 01:56:53,613
What are you doing?

1218
01:56:56,502 --> 01:56:58,635
We need the ammo.

1219
01:57:06,588 --> 01:57:08,638
You did all you could here.

1220
01:57:08,806 --> 01:57:11,484
They should've sent a medivac.

1221
01:57:11,653 --> 01:57:15,251
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1222
01:57:15,419 --> 01:57:18,055
More men would get torn up.

1223
01:57:21,069 --> 01:57:25,797
- Maybe.
- See, you're thinking. Don't.

1224
01:57:25,965 --> 01:57:28,768
Because, sergeant, you can't control
who gets hit or who doesn't,

1225
01:57:28,937 --> 01:57:31,741
who falls out of a chopper
or why.

1226
01:57:31,908 --> 01:57:34,712
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1227
01:57:36,637 --> 01:57:39,691
Yeah, well,
Smith's still dead.

1228
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:41,700
Blackburn wouldn't have fallen,
none of this would've happened.

1229
01:57:41,869 --> 01:57:44,881
Should have or could have,
it don't matter.

1230
01:57:45,049 --> 01:57:48,563
You'll get plenty of time to think
about all that later. Believe me.

1231
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:56,264
Sergeant,
you got your men this far.

1232
01:57:56,433 --> 01:57:58,357
You did it right today.

1233
01:57:58,525 --> 01:58:01,119
You need to start thinking
about getting these men out of here.

1234
01:58:08,067 --> 01:58:11,164
Well, shall we?

1235
01:58:19,074 --> 01:58:22,254
I need four guns
in this corner now!

1236
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:30,498
RPG!

1237
01:58:34,015 --> 01:58:36,482
This is Barber 5-2
in position for gun run.

1238
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:38,784
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1239
01:58:39,456 --> 01:58:42,594
This is 2-5! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1240
01:58:42,762 --> 01:58:46,025
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who
down there. Too much activity.

1241
01:58:46,277 --> 01:58:48,495
I'll mark the target
with a strobe. Over.

1242
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:50,336
Roger that.

1243
01:59:01,428 --> 01:59:03,226
You see it?

1244
01:59:05,068 --> 01:59:06,950
Nah. I can't see shit.

1245
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:09,335
I'm putting it on the roof.

1246
01:59:09,504 --> 01:59:12,015
- You're gonna need some help!
- Cover me.

1247
01:59:13,481 --> 01:59:18,167
Okay, guys, we're gonna lay down some
cover fire for him! On three! Ready?

1248
01:59:18,335 --> 01:59:22,477
One, two, three! Go!

1249
01:59:55,206 --> 01:59:58,134
I got your position. I got the target.
We re inbound and hot.

1250
02:00:23,162 --> 02:00:28,183
C-2, mini-guns dry. Request
permission to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1251
02:00:28,352 --> 02:00:29,998
Roger that. Second team inbound.

1252
02:00:30,026 --> 02:00:33,457
Your station.
On your location, four minutes.

1253
02:00:41,409 --> 02:00:43,542
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1254
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:44,965
Move, move!

1255
02:00:45,134 --> 02:00:48,397
Lay down some cover fire!

1256
02:00:49,905 --> 02:00:51,913
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1257
02:00:52,081 --> 02:00:53,713
Get your men loaded up.
We're getting out of here.

1258
02:00:53,881 --> 02:00:55,135
Yes, sir.

1259
02:00:58,066 --> 02:01:02,417
2-5, this is 6-4. Rescue column has arrived.
We'll be at your location in about 5 minutes.

1260
02:01:02,585 --> 02:01:04,425
Prepare your men for exfil.

1261
02:01:04,594 --> 02:01:07,857
Yeah, roger that, sir!
Roger that!

1262
02:01:08,026 --> 02:01:11,164
Five minutes! The convoy's
gonna be here in five minutes!

1263
02:01:32,216 --> 02:01:34,098
I need a mag!
Eversmann, I'm out!

1264
02:01:34,266 --> 02:01:36,902
Kurth, my last one!

1265
02:01:45,985 --> 02:01:48,160
The convoy's here!

1266
02:02:06,157 --> 02:02:07,579
Sergeant Eversmann.

1267
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:10,048
I heard you guys
needed a lift!

1268
02:02:10,217 --> 02:02:11,974
Yes, sir!

1269
02:02:12,141 --> 02:02:14,589
Bring your wounded right over
there and start loading them up!

1270
02:02:21,474 --> 02:02:24,110
I got you, I got you.

1271
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:27,459
It's okay.
I want to walk.

1272
02:02:27,627 --> 02:02:30,639
Yeah, I would too.
Let's go!

1273
02:02:39,847 --> 02:02:41,102
Move, move!

1274
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,631
We get the pilots' bodies out,
then we go to the stadium.

1275
02:02:47,799 --> 02:02:50,058
We're running out of room
around here.

1276
02:02:50,226 --> 02:02:52,193
Just gonna have to cram
into every possible space.

1277
02:02:52,318 --> 02:02:58,093
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for
armour, walks us out of the hot zone.

1278
02:02:58,262 --> 02:03:03,032
10th Mountain? No. Sir, with respect,
my Rangers can provide rear security.

1279
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:07,342
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then jump on the last few vehicles.

1280
02:03:08,348 --> 02:03:10,983
Okay, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

1281
02:03:11,152 --> 02:03:14,332
- All right, you got him?
- Yeah, come on.

1282
02:03:15,337 --> 02:03:16,508
Come on!

1283
02:03:18,015 --> 02:03:21,027
These things are fucking bullet
magnets. Come on, let's go!

1284
02:03:21,196 --> 02:03:23,790
We go when
I'm ordered to, soldier!

1285
02:03:26,511 --> 02:03:28,310
Careful.

1286
02:03:28,478 --> 02:03:31,114
Easy, easy.

1287
02:03:45,512 --> 02:03:47,352
Colonel, what is going on
down there?

1288
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:51,495
They're dismantling the entire
cockpit around the body.

1289
02:03:51,664 --> 02:03:55,346
How long's it gonna take? I need
an honest, no-shit assessment.

1290
02:03:56,142 --> 02:03:57,689
I can't say.

1291
02:03:59,657 --> 02:04:03,925
Danny?
No one gets left behind.

1292
02:04:04,093 --> 02:04:06,980
You understand me, son?

1293
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:09,198
Yes, General.

1294
02:04:09,366 --> 02:04:10,830
Do what you have to do.

1295
02:04:12,296 --> 02:04:13,760
Roger.

1296
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:21,335
All right, come on.
Bring him through.

1297
02:04:21,503 --> 02:04:22,925
I got him.

1298
02:04:23,094 --> 02:04:25,771
Get all of his gear.
Get the wounded out of here.

1299
02:04:25,939 --> 02:04:27,319
Got you, sir!

1300
02:04:30,961 --> 02:04:33,555
Go! Move, go, move!

1301
02:04:33,724 --> 02:04:36,359
Move out! Move out!
Let's go!

1302
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:47,324
Fuck!

1303
02:04:49,752 --> 02:04:53,559
Fire in the hole! Let's go! Move!

1304
02:04:53,728 --> 02:04:56,113
Let's go! Move out! Come on!

1305
02:05:04,024 --> 02:05:05,990
Open up the hatch!
We got men back here!

1306
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:07,454
- No room!
- Go on the roof!

1307
02:05:07,622 --> 02:05:09,463
What's going on?
The roof?

1308
02:05:09,631 --> 02:05:11,806
I'm not getting on
no fucking roof!

1309
02:05:11,975 --> 02:05:14,193
- Sir...
- No, no, it's full!

1310
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:18,879
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1311
02:05:21,433 --> 02:05:23,818
Move it! Let's go!

1312
02:05:40,434 --> 02:05:43,028
All right, hold it up.
Hold it up.

1313
02:05:44,368 --> 02:05:46,376
Let's go! Move, move!

1314
02:06:42,792 --> 02:06:45,428
Get down! Get down!

1315
02:06:46,433 --> 02:06:47,938
Get down, lady!

1316
02:06:50,283 --> 02:06:53,965
I'm out of ammo!
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1317
02:06:59,826 --> 02:07:01,666
Don't you do it.

1318
02:07:01,834 --> 02:07:03,883
What are you doing?
Don't you damn do it.

1319
02:07:06,521 --> 02:07:07,860
Kurth, let's go!

1320
02:09:32,163 --> 02:09:34,171
Easy. Easy.

1321
02:10:23,388 --> 02:10:25,438
Ah, shit.

1322
02:10:25,606 --> 02:10:27,740
Bullet missed your jugular by about
three millimetres. Don't move!

1323
02:10:27,908 --> 02:10:28,911
All right.

1324
02:10:30,795 --> 02:10:33,263
Hurry up, hurry up.

1325
02:10:33,432 --> 02:10:35,523
Grimes?

1326
02:10:36,697 --> 02:10:40,546
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1327
02:10:44,313 --> 02:10:47,158
How you doing, soldier?

1328
02:10:47,327 --> 02:10:49,167
Can't feel a thing.

1329
02:11:31,689 --> 02:11:32,692
Ruiz.

1330
02:11:34,284 --> 02:11:37,212
Hey, Sergeant. Hey.

1331
02:11:40,561 --> 02:11:42,904
- Captain.
- Lorenzo.

1332
02:11:43,073 --> 02:11:45,081
How you doing?

1333
02:11:47,216 --> 02:11:52,027
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay, a couple of days.

1334
02:11:52,196 --> 02:11:56,129
- That's great news.
- We going after them?

1335
02:11:56,297 --> 02:11:59,184
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1336
02:12:00,692 --> 02:12:03,034
Don't go out without me.

1337
02:12:03,202 --> 02:12:07,386
Don't go back out there
without me.

1338
02:12:07,555 --> 02:12:10,567
I can still do my job.

1339
02:12:11,615 --> 02:12:14,334
You get some rest now, okay?

1340
02:12:29,485 --> 02:12:30,824
You going back in?

1341
02:12:32,666 --> 02:12:34,674
There's still men out there.

1342
02:12:37,018 --> 02:12:39,485
Goddamn.

1343
02:12:43,756 --> 02:12:46,057
When I go home,

1344
02:12:46,225 --> 02:12:49,447
people ask me, "Hey, Hoot,"

1345
02:12:49,615 --> 02:12:51,706
"why do you do it, man?"

1346
02:12:51,875 --> 02:12:55,724
"Why? You some kind
of war junkie?"

1347
02:12:55,893 --> 02:12:58,947
I won't say
a goddamn word.

1348
02:12:59,116 --> 02:13:01,124
Why?

1349
02:13:01,291 --> 02:13:04,513
They won't understand.

1350
02:13:04,682 --> 02:13:06,941
They won't understand
why we do it.

1351
02:13:08,615 --> 02:13:12,591
They won't understand
it's about the men next to you.

1352
02:13:14,601 --> 02:13:17,404
And that's it.

1353
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:19,579
That's all it is.

1354
02:13:28,411 --> 02:13:32,009
Hey, don't even
think about it, all right?

1355
02:13:32,177 --> 02:13:34,603
I'm better on my own.

1356
02:13:38,372 --> 02:13:42,431
Hey, we started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1357
02:13:55,405 --> 02:13:59,338
I was talking to Blackburn
the other day and he asked me,

1358
02:13:59,507 --> 02:14:02,226
"What changed?
Why are we going home?"

1359
02:14:03,901 --> 02:14:06,244
And I said, "Nothing."

1360
02:14:06,412 --> 02:14:11,140
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1361
02:14:11,894 --> 02:14:13,233
I know I've changed.

1362
02:14:19,009 --> 02:14:21,561
A friend of mine asked me
before I got here...

1363
02:14:21,729 --> 02:14:24,113
When we were all shipping out.

1364
02:14:24,282 --> 02:14:26,918
He asked me,

1365
02:14:27,086 --> 02:14:30,308
"Why are you going to fight
somebody else's war?"

1366
02:14:30,476 --> 02:14:33,070
"What do y'all think,
you're heroes?"

1367
02:14:35,874 --> 02:14:39,264
I didn't know what to say
at the time, but...

1368
02:14:41,357 --> 02:14:43,868
if he asked me again,
I'd say no.

1369
02:14:46,421 --> 02:14:49,308
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1370
02:14:49,476 --> 02:14:52,112
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1371
02:14:56,716 --> 02:14:59,100
It just sometimes
turns out that way.

1372
02:15:02,911 --> 02:15:06,091
I'll talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

1373
02:15:48,737 --> 02:15:50,578
<i>"My love,"</i>

1374
02:15:50,746 --> 02:15:54,512
<i>"you're strong
and you'll do well in life."</i>

1375
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:57,943
<i>"I love you
and my children deeply."</i>

1376
02:15:58,112 --> 02:16:02,757
<i>"Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow."</i>

1377
02:16:02,925 --> 02:16:08,322
<i>"Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down."</i>

1378
02:16:08,491 --> 02:16:11,043
<i>"So, in closing, my love,"</i>

1379
02:16:11,211 --> 02:16:14,809
<i>"tonight,
tuck my children in bed warmly."</i>

1380
02:16:14,978 --> 02:16:16,818
<i>"Tell them I love them,"</i>

1381
02:16:16,987 --> 02:16:22,342
<i>"then hug them for me and give them
both a kiss good night for Daddy."</i>
