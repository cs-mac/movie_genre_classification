1
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,286
I keep saying to myself,

2
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,485
"Death is a celebration."

3
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,289
Dougy.

4
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,066
Morning, Tim.

5
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,427
- Your hair.
- Yeah. It went quick.

6
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,537
Chemo must be bad.

7
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,306
Yeah, I quit. The nausea was a disgrace.

8
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,582
What are your chances, big fella?

9
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,553
Son, who the fuck can say?

10
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,292
I handle everything
but the middle of the night.

11
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,327
Where's your wife?

12
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,727
Patty Lareine took off November 1st.

13
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,357
28 days ago, with the chauffeur.

14
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,294
What the hell does Patty Lareine
need a chauffeur for?

15
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,736
She didn't, she just didn't need me.

16
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,899
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

17
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,911
Any guy that marries a rich dame
deserves everything he gets.

18
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,340
Is this your blessing?

19
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,518
You married the wrong girl, that's all.

20
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,747
Should have married the other one.

21
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,188
The Italian girl, what was her name?

22
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,523
- Madeleine.
- You should have married that one.

23
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,119
I thought you liked Patty Lareine.

24
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,963
I liked her guts, but certain dames
ought to wear a T-shirt that says,

25
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,003
"Hang around,
I'll make a cocksucker out of you."

26
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:43,299
- Thanks.
- Just a figure of speech. Nothing personal.

27
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,776
You always worried I'd turn out queer.

28
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,914
Your mother was delicate,
she spoiled you a lot.

29
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,945
I worried about you.

30
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,457
I did my three years in the slammer
standing up, nobody made me a punk.

31
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,326
Good for you. I didn't wanna ask.

32
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,758
Should you drink?

33
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,031
Six months ago
they told me to stop or I was dead.

34
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,197
I stopped.

35
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:18,334
Now the spirits circle around my bed
and they tell me to dance.

36
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,813
I tell them, "Tough guys don't dance."

37
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,720
They answer me, "Keep dancing."

38
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,952
You know, son,
my illness makes me think you're all I got.

39
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,769
I don't want to die
without you knowing my regard for you.

40
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,101
I haven't even seen you in a year.

41
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,506
That's distance, space. It means nothing.

42
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,771
But I know when you're having a bad day.

43
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,713
You old bull, if you're not abusing me,
you're embarrassing me.

44
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,843
There's something wrong in this house.

45
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,887
Not a thing.

46
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,722
- You look a mess.
- A fight, a small fight.

47
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,386
- Did you win?
- You don't stop, do you?

48
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,695
There's something going on here,
I can feel it.

49
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,369
Look, it was a crazy summer.
An idiotic, crazy summer.

50
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,320
That's my boyfriend.

51
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
Oh, boy! Oh, God. Patty.

52
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,337
Great party. Pipe it down.

53
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,410
Hey, back there. Cool the stereo.

54
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,253
- Thank you, ma'am.
- And who are you?

55
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,189
I'm new here.

56
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,023
Acting Chief of Police,
Alvin Luther Regency.

57
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,531
That's one hell of a name.

58
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,535
- You got to live up to it, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

59
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,005
Come on in.

60
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,576
- On duty.
- Bullshit. Make it off duty.

61
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,934
I was tired of throwing parties
for people I didn't care about.

62
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,496
But Patty Lareine had to give parties.

63
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,340
My blood itself was turning mean.

64
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,280
Were you in Vietnam?

65
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,927
No.

66
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,024
How come I got this feeling
you were there?

67
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,301
I'm an ex-con.

68
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,644
You trying to wake up
all the ghosts in Hell Town?

69
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,120
That's the idea.

70
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,056
Don't let those motherfuckers sleep.

71
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,087
Lady, you sound like a witch.

72
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,088
Well, honey, I am a witch.

73
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,135
Good blondes are.

74
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,130
You're not a real blonde.

75
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:16,078
My pussy hair was
bright gold in high school.

76
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,112
Until I went out and...

77
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,983
scorched it with the football team.

78
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,925
I believe you love your wife a great deal.

79
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,273
No more than twice a week.

80
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,533
Madden, you are foul-mouthed.

81
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,678
Drink a bit more of my liquor,
why don't you?

82
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,487
I gotta go.

83
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,852
I was out of line, I apologize.

84
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,883
I misspoke, Officer.
It's not my liquor, it's my wife's.

85
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,665
You're a funny guy.

86
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,565
I like you. I like your house.

87
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,998
After that party,
all through September, October...

88
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,913
I don't want to talk about it.

89
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,279
At Halloween we gave a séance.

90
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,848
- A what?
- A séance.

91
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,117
You're damn right
we're going to have a séance.

92
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,317
Why? Just tell me why.

93
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,486
Cos those two dead whores
keep whispering to me.

94
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,860
Here we go again. What do they say?

95
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,329
They say they're too old, baby.

96
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,338
They been dead for 100 years,
they do not like that.

97
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm gonna bring them back.

98
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,808
It's a full moon.

99
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,689
I know it is.

100
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,251
You know how disturbed you get
when it's a full moon.

101
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,007
We are gathered together

102
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,340
to ask you two women murdered
100 years ago in Hell Town

103
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,381
to reach out to us.

104
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,451
If you hear my words,
speak to us through our hands now

105
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,613
and through our fingertips.

106
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,953
Where are you going?

107
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,220
To the moon, asshole.

108
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,094
- You need your chauffeur on the moon?
- Yes, baby.

109
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,464
I need a big, black chauffeur.

110
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,828
You'll come back. You always do.

111
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,109
Not this time.

112
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,577
Honey, that séance was my warning.

113
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,312
You and your dumb séance.

114
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,546
My séance? It was your idea.

115
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,354
Bolo.

116
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,928
I was her chauffeur once.
Maybe she digs chauffeurs.

117
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,803
Now you watch your mouth.

118
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,069
She wanted me to kill her husband.

119
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,543
She wanted us to live on his money.

120
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,172
- Wardley Meeks?
- That's the man.

121
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,410
But you didn't do it.

122
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,952
I couldn't get that heavy shit to flush.

123
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,682
How come she got the money, then?

124
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,383
Divorce, man.

125
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,757
You make more money
from divorce than a drug run.

126
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,160
Figures.

127
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,205
How I hated Patty Lareine's
all-superior fuck-you face.

128
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,144
She had been
the largest addiction in my life,

129
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,512
pure love, pure hate,
all squashed up together.

130
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,930
Do you buy coincidence?

131
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,126
Yeah, I do buy it.

132
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,002
Something bad's about to happen.

133
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,570
Strange things fall into place.

134
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,407
- I agree.
- You agree? On what?

135
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,277
Something rotten has happened.

136
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,680
Come on, kid, tell me.

137
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,278
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready. Level with me.

138
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,491
Last week two people were murdered.

139
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,722
- Who did it?
- I don't know.

140
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,231
Have you seen the bodies?

141
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,268
They're in the cellar.

142
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,034
Part of the bodies.

143
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,374
I didn't do it.

144
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,443
I don't think I did.

145
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,345
But my head's been peculiar lately,
I have blackouts.

146
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,674
I hallucinate.

147
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,115
Let's have all of it.

148
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,593
It's been a bad five days.

149
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,437
Five days ago, when I got up,
I changed the number in the mirror.

150
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,808
That's what I do every morning,
change the number in the mirror.

151
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,777
That morning, Patty Lareine
had been gone for 24 days.

152
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,151
Have you ever lived with the foul spirit

153
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,856
that comes along when you lose a wife?

154
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,460
I had an unmistakable premonition.

155
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,867
Something bad was going to happen.

156
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,973
What I didn't know was just how bad
the next five days were going to be.

157
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,399
Miss, give me a Chivas Regal.
Lots of diamonds.

158
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,805
Rocks, angel.

159
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,638
Just drinks for now. The same, miss.

160
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:39,151
Darling, when an attractive man
and woman go on a trip,

161
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,183
the fear of disenchantment
is always lurking.

162
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,393
Jessica, I'm not bored. Not bored at all.

163
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:52,267
- Darling, I am.
- But remember why we're here.

164
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,830
Is Daddy mad at
brand-new red-hot Mama?

165
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,877
Is Mama being careless?

166
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,114
I said I wanted to go
to this place on the map,

167
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,492
Provincetown, the very tip
of the little finger of Massachusetts.

168
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,999
Now it's a matter of waiting,
looking at one another, right?

169
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,967
No action, right?

170
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,197
That's what you get for trusting a map.

171
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,638
Hear, hear.

172
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,577
Won't you join us?

173
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,209
As a matter of fact,
you may have seen me before.

174
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,256
I made a number of movies.

175
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,122
God, let's not blow that trumpet again.

176
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm proud of it. I made many notable films.

177
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,425
Jessica, must you let all the kittens
out of the bag?

178
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,460
Lonnie, if we can't let it hang out here,
where else can we?

179
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,506
Let it hang out.

180
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,010
I made X-rated films.

181
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,914
Triple X-rated.

182
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,441
Now I'm in real estate, Santa Barbara.

183
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,488
Lovely place. Fine homes.

184
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,853
Here, there's nothing but shacks.

185
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,286
Some of them are interesting.
They were ferried over from Hell Town.

186
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:28,356
Hell Town? Do tell us about Hell Town.

187
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,069
It folded.

188
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,764
Wouldn't you know.

189
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,966
150 years ago, out there,

190
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,170
across the harbor, a mile.

191
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,009
Whores, whalers, pirates.

192
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,049
Pirates? In New England?

193
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,347
On a moonless night,
they'd build a beach fire.

194
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,857
Incoming boat would mistake it
for the lighthouse and run aground.

195
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,291
And these pirates would plunder it.

196
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,823
Orgies of plunder.

197
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,525
And they floated all that bedlam over here.

198
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,667
In certain houses you can still hear
the cries of slaughtered sailors.

199
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,137
He's cute, isn't he, Lonnie?

200
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,743
Cute.

201
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,780
Tell us a joke.

202
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,346
- What makes surgeons happy?
- What?

203
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,683
To cut people up and get paid for it.
That's happiness.

204
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,667
You look like one of those
method actors who plays the killer.

205
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,335
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

206
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,270
Because I could kill you.

207
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,717
Would you do that to me?

208
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,847
I don't know.

209
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,254
- I feel demented tonight.
- In what way demented?

210
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,624
I could fuck your woman
right in front of you.

211
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,130
Only if the lady agrees.

212
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,163
She'll agree.

213
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,205
Come here, Jessica.

214
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,608
Take a look at this.

215
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,862
Would you let me speak?

216
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:52,008
In the name of decency,
would you let me speak?

217
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,017
I woke to the sound of that man crying.

218
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:11,153
I couldn't remember how
the night ended or how I got home.

219
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,254
My memory was lost.

220
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,493
But I had a brand-new tattoo on my arm

221
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,035
and no recollection of who put it on me.

222
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,706
I needed to clear my head.

223
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,769
- Mr. Madden?
- You got him.

224
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,283
Acting Chief of Police Regency
is on the line.

225
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,486
Hello, Tim. You OK?

226
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,420
Sure.

227
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,891
Are you sure you're all right?

228
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,928
I'm hungover.

229
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,427
Would you clean your Jeep?

230
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:26,060
Christ. I had a terrible nosebleed last night.

231
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,905
Well, a couple of your neighbors figured
you'd lopped somebody's arm off.

232
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,076
Why don't you get a sample?
Check my blood type.

233
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,546
Drop over the police station, will you?

234
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,486
Last night I saw this blonde lady
at the end of my high-beams.

235
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,055
You sure Patty Lareine isn't in town?

236
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,466
No word.

237
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,232
Such a dazzler.

238
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,568
I feel for your loss, buddy.

239
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,539
Couldn't you have told me this
on the phone?

240
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,177
You still have your marijuana patch
in Truro woods?

241
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,877
- What do you care?
- I don't.

242
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,218
You know me, I like marijuana.

243
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,818
I like your home-grown,
it puts feathers on my ass. Godly stuff.

244
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,289
You ought to be on TV.

245
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,992
I could reach a good many people.

246
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,003
Reach me. Why am I here?

247
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,564
Your stash in Truro.

248
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,609
I don't keep anything in Truro.

249
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,272
Kidding is kidding, I am talking about
where you keep your grass.

250
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,407
All right, why are we talking about that?

251
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,921
I can't tell you everything.

252
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,350
Just want to tickle my stick?

253
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,426
Look, I've been a state trooper.

254
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:02,389
They're all right.
They're not your kind but they're all right.

255
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,935
They're not nice about marijuana.

256
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,971
No, they're not.

257
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,174
Move your stash.

258
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,346
Whose head is it?

259
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,714
- Whose head...
- Whose head is it?

260
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,794
Merwyn Finney from the Widow's Walk.

261
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,322
I hate to bother you like this
but I couldn't help noticing

262
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,269
you seemed to be getting along with the
couple in the lounge the other night.

263
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,135
We had a nice drink together.

264
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,837
The only reason I ask is because
their car is still in our parking lot.

265
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,374
- How odd.
- I was hoping...

266
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,712
you might know where they are.

267
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,948
- I guess you don't.
- I don't.

268
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,151
The name on the credit card
is Leonard Pangborn.

269
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,651
You didn't get the lady's name, did you?

270
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,461
I'm darned if I can remember now.

271
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,899
- May I call you if I do?
- Sure.

272
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,102
I'm sorry to disturb your morning.

273
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,772
It's just so peculiar.

274
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:27,627
- Gray's in motion. It's play action...
- Get gonorrhea, you idiots!

275
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:36,405
- You're gonna lose your bet today.
- I fucking better not lose.

276
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,383
Honey, my folks won't send
another check this month.

277
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,513
Beth, do me a favor -

278
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,558
drink my piss.

279
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,827
Hit the hole, clap-head!

280
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,222
Go get 'em!

281
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,305
Why don't you guys die?

282
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,745
- Why are you here?
- I want to talk about the séance.

283
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,049
Ignore the séance.

284
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,147
Let's get into the deal.

285
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,192
What deal?

286
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,191
Respect my intelligence, will you?
I know you're in on it.

287
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,527
- I'm here to talk about the séance.
- Don't bring it up.

288
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,400
That night was horrendous. Disruptive.

289
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,201
- What did you see in that séance?
- What your wife saw.

290
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,607
- How do you know?
- Cos she was screaming with me.

291
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,668
What did you see?

292
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,382
Patty Lareine dead.

293
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,411
With her head cut off.

294
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,519
I like your tattoos.

295
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,901
I got them in Boston.

296
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,504
Anybody do them around here?

297
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,598
Boston.

298
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,643
Nobody nearer?

299
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,344
I do them gratis, for friends.

300
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,507
Did you do this one?

301
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,122
I did.

302
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,760
Why can't I remember?

303
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,730
Cos you were too shit-faced!

304
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,265
I never seen anybody so shit-faced.

305
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,929
You said, "Madeleine, I wronged you.

306
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,531
"I'm gonna put your name
on my forehead."

307
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,170
I should have put her name on your
forehead, I could have fucked you good.

308
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,716
I put it on your arm.

309
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,353
You were out of it.

310
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,433
I don't have to look for him, he's here.

311
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,506
Regency wants you,
out at the Widow's Walk.

312
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,477
We're getting close
to that two-minute mark

313
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,243
and the West Virginia coach
looks like he's ready to eat his hat.

314
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,683
Those Mountaineers
are no longer in gear.

315
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:34,191
You get any make on Pangborn
as a swish?

316
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,489
He might wash his hands
after making love

317
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,086
but I wouldn't call him a swish. Why?

318
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,429
Was Lonnie in bad shape? Desperate?

319
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,871
Why are all those police cars out there?

320
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,806
The Widow's Walk called
about an hour ago.

321
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:57,479
They requested that Pangborn's car
be removed from their lot.

322
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,347
I took a look. Pangborn was inside.

323
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,285
- Dead.
- Dead?

324
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,725
My friend, he put himself in the trunk
and pulled the trigger.

325
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,592
I don't have a high opinion
of your acumen.

326
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,964
You read Pangborn wrong,
he was a flaming faggot.

327
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,004
You're certain?

328
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,435
Hot from the dead man's pocket.

329
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:39,080
"This time it is not a lovely boy
from the Air Force,

330
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,388
"nor a darling little churchman
who is hot to trot.

331
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,487
"No, I'm with a woman, Wardley,
and it is heaven,

332
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,828
"pure carnal, licky-sucky heaven.

333
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,597
"She tells me no man
has ever been better with her.

334
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,571
"You've been down
this road before, Wardley.

335
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,804
"Well, may it keep us dear friends
even if you are a perfect bitch

336
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,870
"for sending her and me
on this awful job, Love Stuff."

337
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,922
I'm just a country boy, Tim.

338
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,217
I'd like to kill homos.

339
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,355
I dig law enforcement,
puts the good ones in uniform.

340
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,227
Maybe so.

341
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,662
- Who's Wardley?
- I don't recall the name.

342
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,705
Seems I heard that name in passing.

343
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,267
- Could that have been from your wife?
- Ask her.

344
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,358
- I have regards to you from my wife.
- Do I know your wife?

345
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,698
- Madeleine Falco?
- The same gorgeous Italian.

346
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,897
Yes, once in a while she used to take
a drink in a place I did some bartending.

347
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,034
She'd just come over from Italy.
I do remember.

348
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,103
- A model. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

349
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,547
We have two fine boys.

350
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,745
That's a surprise. I didn't know that...

351
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,290
- Us.
- Very nice. Tell Madeleine hello.

352
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,540
Bourbon, neat.

353
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,846
You're not gonna believe this

354
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,213
but you're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

355
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,447
That leaves me no choice,
I have to believe you.

356
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,355
Tomorrow's my day off,
how about dinner?

357
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,826
Tell me, why are you a bartender?

358
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,023
My father's one. What do you do?

359
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,465
I'm a salesgirl in a boutique for now.

360
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,197
Do you listen a lot to your father?

361
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,900
Hey, goddess, I'm going for dinner,
not the diamond ring.

362
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,779
I felt myself in the pull of memory.

363
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,484
That is as strong a pull as a magnetic field.

364
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,023
I went back to New York eight years ago,

365
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,583
when I lived with Madeleine
in a cold-water flat.

366
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,658
I didn't really know
if I was in love or trapped by love.

367
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,832
We were in the season when one marries

368
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,705
or one parts.

369
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,903
I read something you wrote.

370
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,704
You're not supposed to look.

371
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,749
"After two years of love,

372
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:57,311
"Madeleine's ass may be
more real to me than her mind."

373
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,847
How could you say that?

374
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,917
I'm not a good enough writer
to delineate how I really feel.

375
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,395
- You feel wasted on me.
- I love you.

376
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,523
- Wasted.
- I love you.

377
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,128
- Love is just one side of the street.
- What's the other side?

378
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,698
Variety.

379
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,538
Your mind is more real to me
than your ass.

380
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,772
Tell me the worst, dearest.

381
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,649
I saw something in Screw magazine.

382
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,720
In the personals.

383
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:38,385
"Young Christian couple seeks outlet
weekend with other Christian couple."

384
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,396
That made me curious.

385
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,397
And let me guess,
you wrote them a letter?

386
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,128
Here's how they look.

387
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,339
He must have the longest prick
in Christendom.

388
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,975
- Why?
- There is no other explanation for him.

389
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,542
It's an eight-hour drive to North Carolina.

390
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,454
We take a quick look and we turn around.
We need a trip.

391
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:27,943
- Your gal sure seems to like Big Stoop.
- That's cool.

392
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:32,880
- You feel like a faggot?
- More like a masochist.

393
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,386
You're sweet.

394
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,423
Why am I so sweet?

395
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,926
Cos your mean

396
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,430
and nasty-minded,

397
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,897
and so pleasureful.

398
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,762
Kiss me!

399
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,829
You Yankees got tongues
like tallywhackers.

400
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,475
Last night, I had a dream.

401
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,508
Brethren,
it was a vision of the end of time.

402
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:15,415
I saw two women grinding corn.

403
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,955
The bible says there will be
two women grinding corn.

404
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:27,266
Brethren,
it's the devil that wants you to say,

405
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,297
"Well, it wouldn't hurt to miss
just this one night."

406
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,874
It sure didn't.

407
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,937
Brethren, give your hearts to Jesus.

408
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,644
Be joined with him.

409
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,153
Patty Erlene, come to the piano.

410
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,495
Number 256.

411
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,714
You'll make New York by midnight
with stops to eat and tinkle.

412
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,423
If you could be whatever
you wanted to be,

413
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,259
what would it be?

414
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,060
A writer.

415
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,102
A writer?

416
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:12,602
I want to get rid of Big Stoop
and be an airline stewardess.

417
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,677
Find a rich guy, marry him.

418
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:21,650
And then we'll meet again,
I'll divorce the rich man,

419
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,712
marry you and make you a writer.

420
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,792
You're gonna give me all this
for one night?

421
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,455
You marked me for life.

422
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,228
How could you be so horrible?
She was laughing at me.

423
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,065
She was laughing and laughing.
She was happy.

424
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:44,130
- Yeah, and you were in misery all night.
- You heard?

425
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,971
I'm glad you heard.

426
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,207
- How could you dig Big Stoop?
- Because I'm crazy. This country's crazy!

427
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,648
- This country's crazy. I'm crazy!
- Stop it.

428
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,293
Did you speak to the doctor?

429
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,335
Yes.

430
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,030
Who wants babies?

431
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,067
I'm sorry.

432
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,305
Got any coke?

433
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,183
Should you be doing coke?

434
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,193
Why do I know
that you're going to fuck up?

435
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,326
I'll never get busted.

436
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,144
What are you in for?

437
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,237
Dealing.

438
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,680
Coke is a bad bust in Florida.

439
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,877
I never should have left New York.

440
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,139
This is my first drink in over three years.

441
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,515
Would you like a quarter for the jukebox?

442
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,503
Hello, asshole.

443
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,741
Patty Erlene.

444
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,942
I've changed it to Patty Lareine.

445
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,675
You married your rich man.

446
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,774
Sure did.

447
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,450
When I tell you who it is,
you're gonna puddle in your pants.

448
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,650
You and Wardley went to school together.

449
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:21,925
Wardley Meeks III?
What a wild coincidence.

450
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,935
We been following your sorry career.

451
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,638
- Wardley got you this job.
- Great job.

452
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,610
I expect to have something better.

453
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,746
Twice a week, three times a week,

454
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,846
my husband, Wardley,
would slap me around

455
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,016
if I wouldn't do drugs with him.

456
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,060
And insult you as well?

457
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,186
Said I was a cheap redneck.

458
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,926
Our jury's gonna be loaded with rednecks.

459
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,298
Try to get a little more vulnerability into it.

460
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:11,444
My husband said I was a cheap redneck.

461
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:17,982
Not so many tears.
Your grief is deep within.

462
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,822
Wardley said I was a...

463
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,826
low-class,

464
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,960
no-account

465
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,895
redneck.

466
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,004
That's it.

467
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:51,087
Tell the jury why was Wardley Meeks
so friendly to you here in Tampa.

468
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,487
I believe I was his idol at Exeter.

469
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:57,152
- You played football there?
- An athletics scholarship.

470
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:01,925
When you worked
as Patty Lareine's chauffeur,

471
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,866
Wardley Meeks confided in you, therefore?

472
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,197
Frequently.

473
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,732
Before we try to fine-tune this testimony,

474
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,835
I want to get straight on the facts.

475
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,308
Did Wardley ask you to escort
Patty Lareine to a motel

476
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,376
so that he could stage a break-in
with a private detective?

477
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,183
That's not exactly true.

478
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,850
I can't put you on the stand saying that!
Get ready.

479
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,724
They're gonna paint you
as an ex-con, a beach bum.

480
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,763
Are you ready to take a beating
for Patty Lareine?

481
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,794
I love her.

482
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,707
Good for you. God bless you.

483
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,618
You were a perfect son of a bitch in court.

484
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,561
But I don't sit on bad feelings.

485
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,228
What a generous nature you have.

486
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,170
I'm not convinced
that you and Patty Lareine

487
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,573
will always live in moonlight and roses.

488
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:24,404
- She's a difficult lady, I fear.
- She is!

489
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:29,418
She will get more and more uncontrollable
as she runs out of my moolah.

490
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,944
The settlement she was awarded
was a little too large for my taste,

491
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,651
but much too small for hers.

492
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,093
Pal, I don't care one way or the other
about the money.

493
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,131
I believe you.

494
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:45,601
Patty Lareine, however,
is a study in low greed.

495
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,737
I feel for her future pain, and yours.

496
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:54,438
- You're splendid, Wardley.
- Thank you, Tim.

497
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,470
I want you to comprehend me.

498
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,743
I desire Patty Lareine back.

499
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,116
Why?

500
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,020
That girl is a social creature, true promise.

501
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:12,790
And you have no idea how quickly
she developed under my tutelage.

502
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,627
Patty Lareine and I, together again,

503
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:20,466
would be able to give the finest, craziest,
most legendary parties

504
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,506
this great American republic has ever seen.

505
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,289
I had slept right here through the night,

506
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,688
my memories turning over one by one.

507
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,751
Now I knew what I wanted.

508
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,956
It was to talk to Madeleine.

509
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,135
Your husband says you send regards.

510
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,801
- It's Tim.
- No, baby.

511
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,643
I get a little Ionesome out here
but I don't send regards.

512
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,480
Lonesome...
Don't you have two sons to take care of?

513
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,985
- What?
- Your husband.

514
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,853
He showed me a photograph
of two little boys.

515
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:18,657
I can't have children. You know that.
They are his brother's kids.

516
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,959
- Why would he lie?
- He's a liar.

517
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,398
What's the big news? Most cops are.

518
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,493
You don't like him.

519
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,937
He is a cruel, selfish son of a bitch.

520
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,799
- I see.
- But I like him.

521
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,816
You should not have hung up on me.

522
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,922
I wanna talk.

523
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,488
I'm still in love.

524
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,366
You're such a bad guy.

525
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,463
You really are rotten.

526
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,211
You shouldn't have come.

527
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,133
I can't tell you how funny it felt, Dougy,
to be alone in her house.

528
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,262
Living with Madeleine in the old days,

529
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,830
we could hear
each other's thoughts so clearly

530
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,741
that we seemed
to be drawing them from the same well.

531
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,006
Now she was with Regency.

532
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,948
Regency, with his machete...
missing from the wall.

533
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,522
How could you marry Regency?

534
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,191
How could you marry him?

535
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,864
I feel so sorry for you, Tim.

536
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,302
Are you that miserable with Patty Lareine?

537
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,408
I gather she's paying your way.

538
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,817
We have a little agreement. Whatever
I make from my writing goes to her.

539
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,382
Do you write much?

540
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,087
Maybe you are a bartender after all.

541
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,959
- Maybe I am.
- You chose Patty Lareine.

542
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,936
I hope you're happy, because I am.

543
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,872
Mr. Regency and I
make out five times a night.

544
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,171
That's what I call him, Mr. Five.

545
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,237
Cheers.

546
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,576
I want you to go.

547
00:50:56,653 --> 00:51:00,749
After you read this,
don't come running right back.

548
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,088
- Promise.
- I promise.

549
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,153
Hold it till you're home.
Open it. Think about it.

550
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,755
Don't ring me. Don't ask me how I know.

551
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,768
That's six promises.

552
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,572
Mr. Six.

553
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,508
Keep your word.

554
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,473
My husband
is having an affair with your wife.

555
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,573
I don't think we should talk about it...

556
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,874
unless you're prepared to kill them.

557
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,348
Oh, man! Oh God! Oh, man!

558
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,671
- Your day is near.
- Stoodie, you're out of it tonight.

559
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,947
Gotta move, honey.

560
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:40,179
- Stoodie has lost his mind.
- We're all on Space Street.

561
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:44,193
Don't you believe that you and I
are special looney-tunes?

562
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,059
- Why?
- We never fucked each other.

563
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,742
This is Spider. Meet me at your stash.

564
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:06,839
- Why?
- Don't argue. Meet me at your stash.

565
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,147
You're being set up.

566
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,188
For what? Set up for what?

567
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,156
Murder. Murder one.

568
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,814
Get in the car.

569
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,347
We contacted Santa Barbara.

570
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,520
It's a Photostat of the blonde
Lonnie associated with.

571
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,164
I'd say that's Jessica.

572
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,464
We don't need you to tell us, pal.

573
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,471
The waitress at the Widow's Walk
already confirmed.

574
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,507
You done a lot of work.

575
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:16,080
Now, what happened
with you and the woman?

576
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,616
I don't remember.

577
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,090
If Pangborn killed himself,

578
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,129
somebody drove the vehicle afterward.

579
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:31,156
The blood on the floor of the trunk
coagulated with a ripple.

580
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,266
Go back to your night
with Jessica and Lonnie.

581
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,842
Did you bang her?

582
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,877
I may have.

583
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,912
Can't even remember a screw.

584
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,416
I believe I drove away and left them,

585
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,454
after I made love to her
in front of Lonnie Pangborn.

586
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,489
That bothers me.

587
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:59,221
You better hope and pray
Jessica doesn't surface as a corpse,

588
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,161
because if she does,

589
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,722
that little nosebleed
on the seat of your Jeep

590
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,531
is gonna look like
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

591
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,766
You've done a lot of thinking.

592
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,112
- Let's have a drink.
- What?

593
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,587
Where's my wife?

594
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,538
Where's my wife?

595
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,673
Drink hardy. You're gonna need it.

596
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,858
Seven nights ago,
Patty Lareine was in California.

597
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,660
- California?
- Santa Barbara.

598
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,928
With this Wardley fellow.

599
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,661
Good bourbon?

600
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,536
Can't you speak?

601
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,979
In your office?

602
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,292
Putting the suspect at ease.

603
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,491
Beautiful.

604
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,458
Seven nights ago,
Patty Lareine and Wardley

605
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,664
had dinner with Jessica Pond and
Lonnie Pangborn at Lonnie's Beach club.

606
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:53,300
Do you want to know
what they talked about? A cocaine deal.

607
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,470
Two million-dollar investment,
ten million profit.

608
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,673
Wardley was there to put up the cash.

609
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:04,417
The plan?
Lonnie and Jessica drive to P-town

610
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,547
with the two million dollars
and act like they're tourists,

611
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,650
until they're contacted
by the cocaine supplier.

612
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,662
Who's the supplier?

613
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,766
Why do you think
I'm telling you this story?

614
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,133
Why?

615
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:25,538
Word from my informant
says the supplier to the source is you.

616
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,907
Who's your informant? Patty Lareine?

617
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,549
When would I speak with her?

618
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,085
The word I get form my informant

619
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:40,282
is that you and Patty Lareine
are rolling around in the same honey jar.

620
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,098
No evidence.

621
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,869
Evidence is everything.

622
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,869
I'd like to tell you a story
about a strange case.

623
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,304
There was this young man.

624
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,776
He'd pick up a girl from time to time,

625
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:13,583
take her to one of those
old-fashioned tourist cabins,

626
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,989
where he'd take Polaroids
of her in the nude. Click!

627
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,053
Then he'd kill her, after which - click! -

628
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,726
he'd take a Polaroid of the dead body,
after which he would...

629
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:29,932
paste both photographs in an album.

630
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,934
His mother, she -
he lived with his mother -

631
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,970
she got nosey, broke the little lock
on the album, opened it up,

632
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,016
took a look and fainted.

633
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,810
But when she came to,
she called the authorities

634
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,254
and that's when they had him. Why?

635
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,882
Evidence.

636
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,955
Why do you tell me this story?

637
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,029
Because it turns me on.

638
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:02,393
I'm a law enforcement officer
and it turns me on.

639
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,809
Does my story turn you on?

640
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,079
You didn't tell it well enough.

641
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,344
Wouldn't a good DA
like to have you on a witness stand?

642
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,217
I wanna go now.

643
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,486
I didn't mean to upset you.

644
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,564
Not one bit.

645
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:53,548
I didn't know what Regency
was trying to tell me - or not tell me.

646
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:58,617
I didn't know what Spider and Wardley
were doing in the white Rolls-Royce.

647
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,755
I didn't know anything.

648
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,823
But for the sake of my own sanity

649
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,860
I had to find out whose head
was in the burrow.

650
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,881
Have a heart, man.
I need medical attention.

651
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:10,552
Your knife is in my dog.

652
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,760
I'm sorry, man.
I got nothing against your dog.

653
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,748
I brought you up here to this room

654
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,809
because this is where
I cut up Patty's pictures.

655
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,617
I still remember myself doing it.

656
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,420
It scares me. What if I'm prey to spirits?

657
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,793
Half the killers in the world
make that claim. Fuck 'em.

658
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:05,493
Even if it's true, they're just
a lightning rod for the bad stuff.

659
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,128
- I'm betting you didn't do it.
- Have a drink.

660
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,172
Forget the drink.

661
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,333
Someone's trying to hang
a murder rap on you.

662
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,004
How were the women killed?
You study their necks?

663
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,707
It's my wife, for God's sakes.

664
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,773
I didn't look.

665
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,255
All right, kid. Look after yourself.

666
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,291
Wash up.

667
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,517
I'll manage the cellar.

668
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,506
- The one who's not your wife...
- Jessica.

669
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,447
Machete. One big stroke.

670
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,781
She was dead already.

671
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,343
.22 hollow tip fired into her mouth.

672
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,287
And Patty?

673
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,985
Probably a bullet in the heart.

674
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,620
And somebody used a knife
to sever the head.

675
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,655
- There were no other marks on the head.
- Just stop repeating that word.

676
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,894
- "Head"?
- It gets to me.

677
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,268
- There's no substitute.
- Use their names.

678
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:20,105
You're as sensitive as your mother,
may she rest in peace.

679
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,408
- Who do you see using a machete?
- Regency.

680
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,448
He's no Chief of Police.

681
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:31,214
He's gotta be a narc.
And he's gonna try to pin it on you.

682
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,621
I say we deep six the heads.
You got an anchor?

683
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:40,187
All right, I'll use it for both of them.

684
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:42,230
Oh, criminy!

685
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,789
You look at me and see a crude man.

686
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:46,994
I look at you and see a sitting duck.

687
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,364
I'll go with you. It's a burial.

688
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,737
No. I'll go alone.

689
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,701
I'm just an old guy fishing.

690
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,596
Jessica Pond. Came in ten days ago.

691
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:21,261
She flew out two days later for San
Francisco, connecting to Santa Barbara.

692
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,464
Anyone accompany her?

693
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,374
No, but Chief Regency
brought her to the airport.

694
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,175
"Take good care of this lady," he said.

695
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,795
Darling, I'm terrified.

696
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,301
He's wearing his Green Beret uniform.

697
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,770
And he keeps his machete
in the police car.

698
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:01,208
He's mutilated my photograph,
the one in the living room.

699
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,405
Get out of your house as fast as you can.

700
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,508
Where would I go?

701
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,177
You come here, you come to me.

702
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,220
I'll try.

703
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,220
I just deep sixed two heads.

704
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,060
- You did?
- Yeah, I did. I had to.

705
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,563
You didn't have the balls.

706
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,604
Right.

707
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,673
Unreasonable, aren't I?

708
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:09,370
Well, I love you.

709
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:17,816
I'm going.
It's getting too rich for my blood.

710
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,480
What are you up to?

711
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:25,254
If Regency stops by,
keep him happy until I get back.

712
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,694
I'm gonna poke around
the police station.

713
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,393
Let's walk on the beach.

714
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:40,162
- I hurt my foot.
- Yeah, kicking Stoodie.

715
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,604
But it's all right.
We won't see Stoodie anymore.

716
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:51,535
In brief, Stoodie is dead
and Spider is dead.

717
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,849
How do you know?

718
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,885
I killed them.

719
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:11,924
Is it true the pilgrims landed here
before they went on to Plymouth?

720
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,529
Now they've built
that wonderful motel, right on the spot.

721
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:25,903
Only a country as mad as ours
could be such a roaring success.

722
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,861
- May I ask?
- Please, feel free.

723
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:48,664
- Where are they buried?
- Right where we're going.

724
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:52,639
- Right in Hell Town.
- I thought it would be appropriate.

725
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:56,109
Patty Lareine
was always talking about the place.

726
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,308
- Why do that?
- Exuberance.

727
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:11,950
Spider and Stoodie are resting
next to the graves of Patty and Jessica.

728
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,930
Should the urge occur,
they can all rise and waltz together.

729
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,968
It's a good piece of work.

730
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,084
Anything, Tim.

731
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,713
Did you kill Patty?

732
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:45,818
Your desire to know is so powerful.

733
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,863
It is.

734
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,825
By the way, where are the heads?

735
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,074
The bottom of the sea.

736
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:07,608
If I should kill you,
and I'm not saying I will or I won't -

737
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:12,052
to tell you the truth,
I don't even have a clue -

738
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,954
but if I should pull this trigger,

739
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:18,652
do you believe you'll go out
into that dark dominion better armed

740
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,662
because your questions
have been answered?

741
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,530
- I do.
- Good. So do I.

742
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,764
Don't try to blind me with that sand.

743
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:37,237
- You're a good shot.
- Didn't come naturally to me.

744
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:41,043
Nothing graceful has
ever come naturally to me.

745
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,977
D'you think that's unfair?

746
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:47,215
- Maybe.
- It's enough to solicit the devil.

747
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,658
She ever give you a rim job?

748
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,396
Don't even think about it.

749
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:02,162
Please don't tease my temper. My father
would strike me without warning.

750
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,497
Can you take the truth?

751
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,101
Rich people are always lied to.
Try presenting me with the truth.

752
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,144
It did happen in Tampa.

753
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,184
On which occasions?

754
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,379
When she was trying to convince me
to murder you.

755
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,550
This is horrible.

756
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,661
Why didn't you kill me?

757
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,930
Isn't it insane? I couldn't.

758
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:40,898
I kept remembering your crying, the day
we got kicked out of Exeter together.

759
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,845
My, that was one fancy shot.

760
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:54,980
- Thought you were dead?
- For an instant.

761
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,058
Is it a remarkable instant?

762
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,434
I believe it's the kind of moment

763
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,563
where we're able to see
what others have done

764
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,607
when we weren't there.

765
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,137
Something like that.

766
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,681
I see such odd things
when I pull a trigger.

767
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,012
I see Lonnie and Jessica,

768
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,556
just as they were last Friday night.

769
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,094
They are fighting.

770
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:37,995
How they are fighting, after that
terrible night you spent with them.

771
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:55,415
Did you consider my feelings
for an instant? You are a slut!

772
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,918
I'm no more of a slut than any faggot.

773
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,287
You let him make love to me.

774
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:11,297
You didn't even have the balls
to use your gun.

775
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,425
You think it's simple?

776
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,868
Here, go ahead. You pull the trigger.

777
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,464
I could, you fool.

778
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,532
But you won't.

779
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,580
I won't.

780
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,782
I'm going to disappear.

781
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:32,479
One can travel far on two million dollars.

782
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,449
Give me the keys to the car.

783
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:40,219
Not bloody likely, princess.

784
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,060
I am perfectly capable of shooting you.

785
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,598
- Give me the keys.
- Fuck off!

786
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,105
I have awful news.

787
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,148
Lonnie's dead.

788
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,415
My God. What a loss!

789
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,455
How is he dead?

790
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,817
He shot himself, standing right next to me.

791
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,395
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

792
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,228
Race Point, it's called. Race Point.

793
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,895
- Where is Race Point?
- I don't know!

794
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,940
Where is that?

795
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,135
I'm in a parking lot.

796
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,179
Come quick. I'm so alone.

797
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,383
Pick her up right away.

798
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,022
I must compose myself.

799
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:25,993
If you don't get down there soon,
she could take the money and run off.

800
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:29,401
- Come with me.
- No. No, I will kill her.

801
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:35,068
- How do I get to Race Point?
- At the motel exit, take a right.

802
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,111
It's a few miles down.

803
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,977
I'm so wrong for this kind of imbroglio.

804
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,243
Just go, the first right.

805
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:25,289
All I could remember was,
"Turn right at the motel exit."

806
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:29,461
I had a feeling I would
never find Race Point.

807
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,839
She had tricked me.
Now I know whom she called after I left.

808
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,676
- Where's Wardley?
- Get in the car. I'll take you to him.

809
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,686
What about Lonnie? He's in the trunk.

810
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,814
We were seen together
at the Widow's Walk.

811
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,859
Anyone else there?

812
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,326
We met a fellow named Tim Madden.

813
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,731
That's of interest.

814
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:11,828
Let's take Lonnie's car back
to the Widow's Walk. You drive.

815
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,419
Can I trust you to take care of me?

816
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:38,555
You put your belief
in those two sensational nights we had.

817
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,074
Easy!

818
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:50,501
Come on, baby. Cool, cool down.

819
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,275
We'll dump her first.

820
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:27,376
- Get in the back!
- I don't take orders from white trash.

821
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:31,943
Get in. Patty Lareine,
get your ass in the car right now.

822
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,647
Now!

823
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:48,896
He don't want you, sweetie-pie.
He was using you.

824
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:53,570
- He was using you.
- Just keep barking.

825
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:56,440
Both of you, shut up.

826
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,906
That's the money. Where's the cocaine?

827
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,679
That's the money. Where's the cocaine?

828
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,950
I call that two million and change.

829
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,389
- Where's the cocaine?
- Shut your mouth.

830
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,086
- Should be tomorrow.
- I don't believe you.

831
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:16,426
Before I give you this money,
I'll turn us all in.

832
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:19,729
- Like hell you will.
- Get out of my face.

833
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:43,054
You did it, you did it, you did it!

834
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:48,626
You played with her
and you played with me.

835
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,098
It can't be done, Alvin.

836
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:55,295
No, it can't.

837
01:22:56,471 --> 01:23:00,430
I love you
and I'll walk through hell with you.

838
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:04,501
You're going to.
You are gonna walk right through...

839
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:15,086
The bed in my house
used to belong to two whores

840
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,717
killed in Hell Town one hundred years ago.

841
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,922
They floated the bed across on the water.

842
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:28,498
Invite those whores into you and me.

843
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,538
Hold your mouth!

844
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:40,246
Make money while you sleep.
Buy yourself some whores.

845
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,309
Make money while you sleep!

846
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,812
Buy yourself some...

847
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,914
Swallow it!

848
01:23:55,697 --> 01:24:01,658
You're just a door hanging on one hinge.

849
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,704
Me!

850
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,975
Alvin Luther Regency,

851
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:17,377
where is Jessica now?

852
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,420
Shut...

853
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,456
I crossed a bridge tonight.

854
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,320
Will you cross over with me?

855
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:31,766
Wait and see.

856
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,930
Give it to me!

857
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,839
Hit me on those whores, honey.

858
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:46,403
We're gonna wax the floor with whores.

859
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,948
What do you want?

860
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,985
He dared to drop the body on you?

861
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:31,589
- The arrogance!
- This gives us a grip on the son of a bitch.

862
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:36,255
I wanna find where he's hiding
that woman's head. It's heavy.

863
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,128
Straight out of the séance.

864
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:43,861
Why you're so stupid
as to trust that guy...

865
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:46,805
They're informers. They're tools.

866
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,844
They dump in their pants if I tell them to.

867
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,948
We're gonna zoom, Patty Lareine.
You and me, we are on a zoom.

868
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,984
- I want this two million to become ten.
- Wardley has ten.

869
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,111
One potato a man eats,
a thousand potatoes he sells,

870
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,156
but a billion...

871
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:06,293
- It corners the market.
- Which market?

872
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:09,563
Someday...

873
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,890
I'm gonna run for president.

874
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:20,004
I wanna work with you.
I'm interested in large operations.

875
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,408
What do you bring to large operations?

876
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,074
The number one narc in town.

877
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,346
He can put together the product.

878
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,979
Where's my money?
Who has my money?

879
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:38,856
The narc has it.
We can force him to deliver the product.

880
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,157
And you expect me to believe this?

881
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,632
We control the narc.

882
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,865
He put himself in our hands.

883
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,634
My evaluation of the situation

884
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:55,005
is you will be able to sit on
a shit-Ioad of drugs.

885
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,872
And how do you control this narc?

886
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:02,108
Give the man a clue, Stoo.

887
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,943
Hold on to your hat, Dixie.

888
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,633
Oh, my God.

889
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:30,767
I will sit on a mountain of drugs.

890
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,049
I'll be equal to a Renaissance prince.

891
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,743
The Duke of Dixie.

892
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,757
Lonnie is dead, Jessica is dismembered,

893
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:48,159
Patty Lareine is off
on some kind of toot,

894
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:50,390
and I'm about to go into business

895
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:54,026
with you two unspeakable sleazos!

896
01:27:56,537 --> 01:28:02,169
I know I am out of my mind
but I've never felt more alive.

897
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,938
All right!

898
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:16,483
Before I left that shack
there was a call from Patty Lareine.

899
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,821
We had to talk, she said.

900
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,396
That phone call did it.

901
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:31,694
I don't want to know
where you've been or anything.

902
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:35,538
It doesn't matter what you do.

903
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,976
I love you.

904
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:41,504
I am supposed to love you.
You are my predestination.

905
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:47,045
Wardley, be calm. Be real calm, you hear?

906
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:50,090
I'll listen.

907
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:53,494
You're the first to know.

908
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,695
I'm very much in love with a man.

909
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,335
There will always be someone else.

910
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:03,370
It's my karma.

911
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:16,148
Marry me. Marry me again.

912
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,845
You can have your other guy
for as long as it lasts.

913
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:25,716
Two nights ago,
I crossed a bridge with this lover.

914
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:28,057
Do you want me to step out of your life?

915
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:32,497
No, sugar. Not altogether.

916
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,967
Not altogether?

917
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:38,563
I want your friendship.
Darling, I want that so much!

918
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,073
You have my friendship, I vow that.

919
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,504
Darling, I need support.

920
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,482
My two million has disappeared
and you talk of support.

921
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,518
Get your ass off my pillow.

922
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:54,581
I want the product.

923
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:59,215
Don't be a fool.
What could you do with all that cocaine?

924
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:03,093
- Sell it, like I said I would.
- You, a dealer?

925
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:08,231
- They'd gobble you up.
- I knew you'd say something like that.

926
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:13,433
- Why do you desire to be a coke dealer?
- Fuck it, darling, I think it's exciting.

927
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:20,705
Building up your balls.
Your spoiled, rich little balls.

928
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:29,950
Honey, you have so far to go,
don't you know?

929
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:31,992
Don't you have any judgment?

930
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,587
I may be a physical coward
but I will assert that I have death guts.

931
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:42,135
- My friend and I want more money.
- No. You have enough money.

932
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:50,276
You always told me
how much I grew by knowing you.

933
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:55,773
It's true, I did grow.

934
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:03,089
I was the real social news in Tampa.

935
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:07,020
Now I wanna go to Palm Beach.

936
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:11,823
You unredeemed redneck.

937
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,834
It is you who is utterly without judgment.

938
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:22,500
I have suffered deadbeats
and dopeheads in Provincetown

939
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:24,636
because of you.

940
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,605
Because you didn't try to keep me
when Tim came along.

941
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,776
That hurt.

942
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:34,253
But now I want to take my rightful place.

943
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,690
I'm gonna move to Palm Beach
and buy my way in.

944
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,818
I'll have dynamite parties.

945
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:45,264
Before I'm done, I'll be a member of the
Everglades Beach and Tennis Club,

946
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,961
that is just as sure as hogs can shit!

947
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:54,904
Do pardon my French.

948
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,611
Motherfucker!

949
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:06,216
You are going to find me
ten million dollars.

950
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,489
Deliver the cocaine, Pattykins.

951
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,690
I got bad news.

952
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:18,721
There isn't any cocaine, it was a scam
to get the first two million out of you.

953
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:21,927
Now we want another ten, in cash.

954
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,664
I don't believe this.

955
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:27,202
Jessica and Lonnie are dead, darling.

956
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:32,843
If you don't give us more,
you'll be all over the newspapers again.

957
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:38,611
Make your life simple.
Give us the ten million.

958
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,748
You'll still have 90 million left.

959
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:45,690
And what do I get
for this excess of charity?

960
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,990
Peace, sugar.

961
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:52,795
Tim will have to catch the burden.
Murder one, both deaths.

962
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:56,003
Wardley, be sensible.

963
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,336
This is an elegant solution.

964
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,034
Cash.

965
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,177
Excuse me a moment.

966
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,881
I'm not feeling well.

967
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,752
I'm feeling sick.

968
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:15,118
Do you want me to hold your fat head
while you puke?

969
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,208
Do you love me?

970
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,973
More than anyone.

971
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,788
I asked Spider to bury Patty

972
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:54,487
and afterward I went to look at the grave.

973
01:33:56,397 --> 01:34:00,265
Patty's resting place
looked a little too small.

974
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:07,337
I realized that Spider
had performed a decapitation.

975
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,843
He wanted to stick you for the homicide,

976
01:34:11,912 --> 01:34:15,279
hit the narc for two million
and move in on me.

977
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:21,213
People think my money is there
to make raids on,

978
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:25,691
as if it were not a part of me,
like a precious organ.

979
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:33,898
There is such pleasure in shooting people.

980
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,002
I'd like to shoot you.

981
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:43,408
You deserve it,
for fouling up your life and mine.

982
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:48,539
But I'm not certain
I can get myself that angry anymore.

983
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:52,916
I'm too depressed.
Should I turn myself in?

984
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:58,254
- I can't advise you.
- No, you really can't.

985
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:02,124
Conflict of interest, wouldn't you say?

986
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,668
Well, hear this -

987
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:12,528
during my divorce trial,
I suffered abominably.

988
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:18,879
I could never live
through such public ridicule again.

989
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,914
I guess you're in luck.

990
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:26,111
Afterward, you cover me with sand?

991
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:40,563
You were hoping I would kill myself.

992
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:44,071
Not altogether.

993
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:46,606
Not altogether?

994
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:50,944
What if I were to say to you,

995
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:55,141
"Madden,
take it in your mouth or you die"?

996
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,781
Would you take
my pride and joy into your mouth?

997
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:06,190
You don't care anymore about that.

998
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:18,401
Sit beside me.

999
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,587
Put your arm around me.

1000
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,398
You like me a little?

1001
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,568
I do like you, Wardley.

1002
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:52,072
I hope so.

1003
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,676
How do you expect I feel?

1004
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:03,245
Ashes.

1005
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:07,276
You're right. You do feel for me.

1006
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:11,382
I do feel like ashes.

1007
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,418
Dougy, tell me -

1008
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,614
is the trouble ever over
when you want it to be?

1009
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,634
As I figured.

1010
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,672
Regency's police cruiser.

1011
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,920
Come on.

1012
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:05,068
Your father's a prince.

1013
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:08,165
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1014
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,515
- Are we drinking to your retirement?
- Getting shit-faced.

1015
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,677
You're there already.

1016
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:21,016
I burn through this stuff
faster than it burns me.

1017
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,750
You got a lot to burn.

1018
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:32,896
Life gives a man two balls. Use 'em.

1019
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,766
It's a rare day I don't bang two women.

1020
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:41,865
As a matter of fact, I don't sleep too well
unless I get that second hump in.

1021
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:45,776
Both sides of my nature
are obliged to express themselves.

1022
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:49,111
Tell me, what are your two sides?

1023
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,619
The enforcer...

1024
01:39:54,388 --> 01:39:56,015
and the maniac.

1025
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,351
And who do we have the honor
of addressing?

1026
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:05,595
You never met the maniac.

1027
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:12,001
When you turn in the police cruiser,
you wanna wash out the trunk.

1028
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:14,233
Blood stains are all over it.

1029
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:25,348
Would you believe it? That sobers me up.

1030
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:37,226
I'll try to be a gentleman.

1031
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:40,357
Leave town quietly
so I don't have to haul you in.

1032
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:43,562
We don't need threats. Let's talk.

1033
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:46,606
You want me to talk? I'll tell you...

1034
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:48,971
I don't think much of your son.

1035
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:53,346
Your son put Madeleine in orgies

1036
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:59,043
and your son cracked her up in a car
and destroyed the womb.

1037
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:03,149
That's the woman I inherited.

1038
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:07,892
So let's get it straight - I hate your son.

1039
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:11,424
I hate your guts.

1040
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:14,296
That's why you poured blood
in the seat of my Jeep.

1041
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,928
I wanted to see you die in your own shit.

1042
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,972
I wanted to make you crazy.

1043
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:25,944
All Patty could talk about
is how Tim used up her life.

1044
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:29,073
That's when I got the picture.
Do a job on Tim Madden.

1045
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:33,085
Forsake my police vows
but do the job. Do it!

1046
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:36,987
- It was no small job.
- It was brilliant.

1047
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,719
Putting a machete through Jessica.

1048
01:41:40,794 --> 01:41:44,252
I wanted to get her face
out of my system.

1049
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:51,035
I wanted total fidelity with Patty.

1050
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:55,508
All right?

1051
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,003
Now we're almost there.

1052
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:03,349
Where's Patty?

1053
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:07,143
Wardley killed her.

1054
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,091
I don't believe that.

1055
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:15,193
She's dead. Dead!

1056
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:55,898
I made you come sixteen times in a night.

1057
01:42:59,473 --> 01:43:01,441
Not one of them was good.

1058
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:08,477
That's because you got no womb.

1059
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:13,978
You got eyes for my woman.

1060
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:17,319
I'm gonna take you down. Murder one!

1061
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:22,192
- It's gotta be done, Tim.
- He's sick.

1062
01:43:22,262 --> 01:43:24,457
He's sick but he's no victim.

1063
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:28,234
I'll do it.

1064
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:33,031
- I can manage it.
- No, he's mine.

1065
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:35,097
I understand him.

1066
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:39,402
She was big time.

1067
01:43:42,082 --> 01:43:45,176
I thought you were big time

1068
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:50,280
but you turned out to be small potatoes.

1069
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:08,565
I could have told him.

1070
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:11,509
Never call an Italian small potatoes.

1071
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:41,270
Do you know something? I'm taking
to this more than I thought I would.

1072
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:46,570
You've been
in the wrong occupation all these years.

1073
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:49,411
This has got to be the answer to cancer.

1074
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:54,211
Maybe that's why cancer
costs so much to cure.

1075
01:44:55,989 --> 01:44:59,686
The way I see it,
schizophrenia's the cure for cancer.

1076
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:04,288
Cancer's probably the cure
for schizophrenia.

1077
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:12,864
People just don't know
how tough it is out there.

1078
01:45:35,095 --> 01:45:37,063
Why are we here?

1079
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,894
- Who owns this place?
- You and me.

1080
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:51,301
- What did it cost?
- Two million, and change.

1081
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:55,576
I found a fat attaché case
with a lot of money.

1082
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:59,483
- Where?
- In the closet, with his uniforms.

1083
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:05,118
And to think he called you small potatoes.

1084
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:10,225
Carry me over the threshold, you dummy.
