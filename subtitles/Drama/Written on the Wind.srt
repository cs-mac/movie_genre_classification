[Gunshot]

23
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:47,852
Hello

24
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,502
- What happened to Mrs. Black?
- My predecessor? She was paroled

25
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,873
So you're the new
executive secretary, huh?

26
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:57,516
Don't let that title deceive you
I do everything but wipe windshields

27
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,984
- I'm Mitch Wayne
- Yes, I recognized you

28
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,309
- I'm Lucy Moore
- Recognized me? From where?

29
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,546
Oh, come now
Surely you realize

30
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:08,134
how often your photograph
has graced our tabloids?

31
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:13,058
But the captions usually read,
"Kyle Hadley, Prince Charming
of the oil empire, and friend"

32
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,749
The dashing Kyle Hadley

33
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,956
I saw him dash through
the office recently

34
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,130
Seems he misplaced
his money belt

35
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:24,705
- Again?
- A hat was passed,
and I contributed $1647

36
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:28,189
Well, for that, you ought to get
an oil well named after you

37
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:31,774
- Your boss in?
- No, Mr. Ryan's out of town

38
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:34,844
- I guess you'll have
to pinch-hit for him
- What can I do for you?

39
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,143
Kyle Hadley's at 21,
in the mood for a conference

40
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:42,300
- Business, of course
- Look, I'm only Mr. Ryan's secretary

41
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:46,045
- I don't think it'd be proper to...
- Would you rather wipe windshields?

42
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,597
All right

43
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:53,084
Kyle and I flew in
from Texas this afternoon

44
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,733
- Sounds urgent
- Very

45
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:59,064
- Kyle said he felt
like a steak sandwich
- Steak sandwich?

46
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,529
And who serves the best
steak sandwich in the world?

47
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:04,210
- 21?
- Simple, isn't it?

48
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,510
Or should I say
simpleminded?

49
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,155
1,380 miles for a...

50
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,976
- Then you were fooling me
about a business conference
- No, that was my idea,

51
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:20,784
you know, in case
Mr. Jasper Hadley should ask
why we came to town

52
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:23,882
Oh, the big boss Well...

53
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,855
Cheer up You might
get your picture in the paper

54
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,033
Is that all you live for?

55
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:34,282
- Guess again, Miss Moore
- I'm sorry

56
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:37,643
I just wanted you to understand
how I feel about such things

57
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,746
- Know something?
- What?

58
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,666
Maybe we're two of a kind

59
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,377
Harry, put it on my tab

60
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,263
- Of course, Mr. Hadley
- Who's this friend we're waiting for?

61
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,042
Mitch Wayne, my sidekick

62
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,379
Mmm, where do his millions
come from?

63
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,713
He's eccentric...
he's poor

64
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:03,227
- [Chuckles] I'll bet
- Honey, you would lose

65
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:08,032
Mitch is just a country boy
The kind of assets he's got
you can't buy with money

66
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:13,016
Sorry, kids
I'll have to make this
some other time

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,980
- He's not eccentric
- No, he's as rich as Rockefeller

68
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,932
- Hello, I'm Kyle Hadley
- I'm Lucy Moore

69
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,323
Lucy Moore
Your taste is improving

70
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,266
Miss Moore is Bill Ryan's
new executive secretary

71
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:29,526
A member of the happy, happy
Hadley Industrial family

72
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,270
This is sure cozy

73
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:44,491
There are rare moments
when only champagne will do
This is one of them

74
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:49,008
Like the lyrics say,
"Are you from Dixie or where?"

75
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,723
Indiana Small town
you probably never heard of

76
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,897
Anytime you ask me,
I'll put it on the map

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,236
What shows
in your crystal ball?

78
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:59,498
Oh, I'll probably walk down an aisle
and wind up in a suburb

79
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,893
- with a husband,
mortgage and children
- That's not for you

80
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,370
- Why not?
- Got too much beauty and brains
to fall into a trap like that

81
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,744
Just what sort of trap
do you suggest?

82
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:12,551
How would you like to join
the Kyle Hadley Society
for the Prevention of Boredom?

83
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,812
- [Chuckles]
What would my duties be?
- Not duties

84
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:19,653
Pleasures, such as Kyle Hadley's
guided tour through the gossip columns,

85
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,823
around the world
in 80 headlines

86
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:25,633
- I'm afraid that'd bore me
- What wouldn't bore you?

87
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,554
My career... advertising

88
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,368
Bravo...
as they say in Texas

89
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:35,001
- Where did you learn
the advertising game?
- With the Sheraton Agency

90
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,657
- Top drawer?
- One of Madison Avenue's finest

91
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,582
Good enough

92
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,501
I'll buy you the agency

93
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,500
What if I took you up on that?

94
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:47,735
[Snaps Fingers]
A phone, please

95
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,658
[Man]
Yes, Mr. Hadley

96
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:53,910
- You're really serious, aren't you?
- Sure I am

97
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,856
- What's the number?
- The agency or my apartment?

98
00:07:56,953 --> 00:08:00,018
- Seriously...
- Very seriously, forget it

99
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:05,780
I'm only following the advice
of a Texas philosopher who said,
"Give the little girl a big..."

100
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:09,968
I think it's time we heard from
another county What do you do
for the Hadley Oil Company?

101
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:13,133
We're troubleshooters
Wherever they want trouble,
they send for us

102
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,772
I, uh, have a sheepskin
that says I'm a geologist

103
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,808
- That adds up
- I was kicked out
of the same school

104
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,431
They found rocks
in my head

105
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,803
Shouldn't you be going back
to the office?

106
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,789
Apparently,
I never should have left

107
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:31,626
- We haven't finished
our champagne
- Remarkable, isn't it?

108
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,414
I think we need cigarettes
Get a carton

109
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,650
We'll get a cab, meanwhile

110
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,573
Thank you, Mr. Hadley

111
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,948
Carton of Mullhall, please

112
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,137
Thank you

113

[Taxi Departs]

114
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,898
Don't look now,
but you've dropped your friend

115
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:11,641
You advertising people...
so clever with words

116
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,268
Guess I've fallen
from your grace

117
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,193
Does it really matter?

118
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,831
Change your course
Teterborough Airport

119
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,352
Look, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get off
the merry-go-round

120
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,627
I can't quit now

121
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,377
I want you to meet
another fellow... a real one

122
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,865
- Some other time, perhaps
- Some times, like now,

123
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,134
I can get you
in the terminal

124
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,470
I want us to be friends
when we say good-bye

125
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,642
Well, then let me
give you a tip

126
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:46,119
- Drop me at the office
- And if I do, I lose you

127
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,687
Look, Lucy, once we're up in the blue,
I'm a different fellow...

128
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,374
a lot different
from this character

129
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:59,717
All right
Maybe I should meet him

130
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:07,010
No stunts now, like buzzing
the Empire State Building

131
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,022
The only stunts I do
are in nightclubs

132
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,949
May I ask why?

133
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,828
I wouldn't admit this
to anyone but you,

134
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,748
but I drink too much

135
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:32,638
- Here's your change
- Can't shake you, can I?

136
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:34,557
Goes both ways

137
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,921
Am I safe in this crate?

138
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:45,142
I guess so
The tanks are loaded, and
the pilot isn't, for a change

139
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,063
Lucy

140
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,003
You know, I've seen you before
at the office

141
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:12,007
- A fleeting glance, wasn't it?
- How much did you contribute?

142
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:15,111
Enough
How long have you known Mitch?

143
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,670
My dad introduced us
when we started the first grade

144
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:21,668
- That must have been
before your father struck oil
- Dad was worth 100 million then

145
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:26,114
He had no use for private
schools, and he wanted me
to grow up with Mitch

146
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,455
Why Mitch in particular?

147
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,295
Mitch's old man
is my dad's boyhood pal...
his idol, I guess

148
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,977
A small rancher...
kind of a legend in our county

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,861
Great hunter, sort of
a throwback to Daniel Boone

150
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:42,203
I used to wish
he was my father

151
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,589
Is your father aware of this?

152
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:51,960

- So what?
- Who is Lucy Moore?

311

- That's a good question
- You don't know her?

312

- Not very well
- What is she?
A showgirl, model, what?

313
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,973
Just a girl... a lady

- I got news for you, Mr. Wayne

- Promising

How much
would you gamble on it?

about Marylee

We grew up together,

any other way

Yeah

336
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:21,047
It's a shame, though,
in a way

337
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,418
It's a real shame

338

- Okay

Well, son, l...
I just couldn't be happier

- You sure did

346
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,347
Now you vamoose for a few
minutes I want to talk
to my daughter-in-law alone

Sure, Dad
I'll be in Mitch's office

- Would you like a soft drink?
- No, thanks

349
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,428
Just had one
in the drugstore

350
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,908
- Have you been out
to the house?
- Yes, it's beautiful!

351
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,900
And it's home

352
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:08,417
- Did you meet Marylee?
- No, she was out

353
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:12,832
Oh, that's too bad
l-I know she's gonna like you
just as much as I do

354
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,752
I was afraid you might
be wary of me...

355
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,598
that, perhaps, you'd regard me
as a gold digger

356
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,151
[Laughs] Now, look
I'm gonna be honest with you

357
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:24,254
That's just what I figured,
until I talked to Mitch

358
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:28,452
Mitch? Interesting

359
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:30,370
Yeah I wasn't easy
to convince,

360
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,987
but Mitch sold me

361
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:36,254
In other words,
you trust Mitch's judgment
more than Kyle's

362
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,768
Well, I wouldn't put it
that way

363
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:44,798
- May I ask you a favor?
- Anything at all

364

Please give Kyle a chance
You may have to change
your opinion of him

365
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:51,514
How much liquor
has he been puttin' away?

366
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:54,426
I haven't seen him drunk yet

367

Does he still...

368
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,727
Well,

369
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,375
I better not ask about that

370
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,555
You mean, about the pistol
he keeps under his pillow

371
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,179
- You know
- Yes

372
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:18,630
I know all about his anxieties
and fears

373
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,965
You can forget
about the pistol

374
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:24,998
Kyle threw it in the ocean

I'm still up on cloud seven

ever found out,

Tell me another pretty story

775
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:51,677
- Once upon a time, there was
a poor little rich boy
- Kyle Hadley, by name

776
01:04:51,777 --> 01:04:55,092
- Who pickled his tiny brain
with gin and bourbon
- Not so Scotch

777
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,413
Till he got so stinking blind,
he couldn't see what was going
on right under his big red nose

778
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:03,160
But his charming, righteous
little sister did

Yes

780
01:05:06,428 --> 01:05:09,013
She saw the end
of a marriage

781
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,415
and the beginning
of a love affair

But you don't have to take
my word for anything

Just try keeping your head clear
and your eyes open

You've never cared about me

- Or your wife
- Why are you putting
your two cents in?

788
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:45,035
Only because of Mitch

to the hospital till morning

to steal them

I couldn't talk you out of it,
so I went along

But when he caught us, he didn't
blame you, he blamed me

And he grabbed me and he
kicked the tar out of me

"This is what Hadley gets

for letting his boy
play with trash like you"

those bottles, just like

I never touched Lucy,

I could tell the police

that I saw you kill
my dear brother

1038

1039
01:27:33,029 --> 01:27:34,851
On the other hand,

1040

1041
01:27:38,371 --> 01:27:41,370
and couldn't testify
against her own husband

1042

You know, for a beautiful girl,
you can look real ugly sometimes

1043
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:53,627

1086
01:30:40,289 --> 01:30:43,484
What was your relation
to the deceased?

1087
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:46,167
He was my brother

1088
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:49,564
Exactly where were you at
the time Kyle Hadley was shot?

1089
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:57,746
I repeat, Miss Hadley,

1090
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:01,230
exactly where were you at
the time Kyle Hadley was shot?

1091
01:31:04,694 --> 01:31:07,214
You refuse to answer
the question?

1092
01:31:09,748 --> 01:31:12,595
Can you tell us anything
about the shooting?

1093
01:31:12,692 --> 01:31:16,432
Yes My brother,
he was killed

1094
01:31:18,129 --> 01:31:20,103
By whom, Miss Hadley?

1095
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:22,313
By whom
was your brother killed?

1096
01:31:30,382 --> 01:31:34,504
- Mitch Wayne
- [Indistinct Chatter]

1097
01:31:34,604 --> 01:31:36,992
Stop those men!

1098
01:31:37,099 --> 01:31:40,513
No one will leave this chamber
till after this inquest is closed

1099
01:31:40,618 --> 01:31:42,526
[Chattering Continues]

1100
01:31:44,169 --> 01:31:46,110
Miss Hadley,

1101
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:48,037
you named Mitch Wayne

1102
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,468
Are you here and now
testifying

1103
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:52,899
that Mitch Wayne shot
and killed Kyle Hadley?

1104
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:03,073
Mitch Wayne was there

1105
01:32:04,801 --> 01:32:06,807
in the study
with my brother

1106
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,383
Kyle had a gun in his hand

1107
01:32:11,486 --> 01:32:13,340
He was raving mad...

1108
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:17,754
raving about things
that weren't so

1109
01:32:18,843 --> 01:32:21,144
Mitch tried
to talk to him,

1110
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:23,608
to make him understand
how wrong he was,

1111
01:32:24,696 --> 01:32:26,736
to stop him
from using the gun

1112
01:32:28,824 --> 01:32:31,157
Afraid he might even use it
on himself

1113
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:33,425
I made a grab for the gun

1114
01:32:33,526 --> 01:32:35,348
Kyle and I struggled

1115
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:39,378
The gun went off

1116
01:32:41,043 --> 01:32:43,792
Miss Hadley,
five persons under oath

1117
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:47,783
have testified that Mitch Wayne
threatened to kill Kyle Hadley

1118
01:32:56,973 --> 01:33:00,649
They don't know Mitch Wayne
as I know him

1119
01:33:02,027 --> 01:33:04,001
Whatever he may have said

1120
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:07,682
means nothing

1121
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:11,938
Except he was worried
about Kyle

1122
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,788
as a brother for a brother

1123
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:18,202
Why would Kyle Hadley
want to kill himself?

1124
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:21,406
He was depressed

1125
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:25,208
by Father's sudden death,

1126
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,215
and he'd been drinking

1127
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:31,733
Heavily?

1128
01:33:32,864 --> 01:33:34,935
[Sighs]
Yes

1129
01:33:36,767 --> 01:33:39,067
My brother always drank
too much

1130
01:33:42,076 --> 01:33:43,897
He was sad...

1131
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:48,562
the saddest of us all

1132
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:52,471
He needed so much

1133
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,854
and had so little
