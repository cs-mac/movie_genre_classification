2
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:57,085
Monsieur Wraysford,

3
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,772
we had almost given up on you.

4
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:00,147
Your train was late?

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,333
A little.

6
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,352
You're certainly not the last.

7
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:10,742
Let me introduce you
to Monsieur and Madame Berard...

8
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:12,961
Enchante.

9
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:14,887
Monsieur.

10
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,182
Isabelle, my wife...

11
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,757
Pardonnez-moi, Rene.

12
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,312
Who came all the way from England.

13
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,085
She, I suspect, only
from one of the more

14
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:23,161
fashionable shopping
parades in Amiens.

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,319
Enchante.

16
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,641
Gregoire, don't tease the dog,
please.

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,360
We have dinner?

18
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,400
Oui.

19
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:49,525
Bravo! Bravo!

20
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,017
Papa has such a beautiful voice!

21
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,135
An artist is nothing
without his patron.

22
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,207
Do you sing, Mr Wraysford?

23
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:02,791
Very badly. Pity. I have a particular
fondness for the patriotic song.

24
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:05,162
You'll be staying with us long,
Monsieur?

25
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:06,979
A month or more.

26
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:10,088
London is very keen
to see how these new machines work.

27
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:13,542
They can do in a single day what
30 of my women manage in a week,

28
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,239
and for one third of the cost.

29
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,938
Monsieur? How old are you?

30
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,436
Gregoire.

31
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,353
I'm 20. How old are you?

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,794
Ten.

33
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,873
Remember, Lisette,

34
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:33,721
we are speaking in English tonight
for the benefit of Mr Wraysford.

35
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:36,781
Madame?

36
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:40,317
Did I see you today
walking along the Rue Saint Leu?

37
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,168
I might have walked that way.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
I passed that...

39
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,440
beautiful house
near les jardins d'eau.

40
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:51,877
There was someone playing piano.

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
I couldn't recognise the melody.

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,239
I just stood in the garden,

43
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
trying to stop myself
from walking right inside.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,824
And did you?

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,512
Stop yourself?

46
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,785
It was one of those
sentimental folk songs, I bet.

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,639
I cannot bear them!

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,279
Musicians of today are now satisfied
with four notes

49
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,842
they can sell on the song sheet
on the street corner.

50
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,139
Give me one of our great composers.

51
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,287
Now, Camille Saint-Saens...

52
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,645
Now, there is a composer.

53
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:29,967
Rene, forgive me.

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,225
I cannot shake this headache.

55
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,404
Perhaps Monsieur Wraysford
can take my place at cards?

56
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,034
Of course.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,787
And I had another little song

58
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,229
I was so looking forward to singing.

59
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,270
Another time?

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,319
Madame, Monsieur.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,359
Good night.

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,120
Good night. Bonne nuit.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,119
Poor Madame Azaire!

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,999
I hope she's not unwell?

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,240
My wife is of a nervous disposition.

66
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,257
Sir. Captain Weir's taken
two men underground.

67
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,599
How long have they been down there?

68
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,919
Six, seven hours, sir.

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,318
Who told Captain Weir
he could take two of my men?

70
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,360
Captain Gray, sir.

71
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,778
(Turner's heard something.)

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
(Turner's heard something.)

73
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,233
(Turner's heard something.)

74
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,399
(Just here.)

75
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
(Vibrations.)

76
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,440
(Could be Fritz laying a wire.)

77
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,240
(Too far down.)

78
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,760
(They'd blow their own boys up
at the same time if it was.)

79
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,321
(Close the air feed off.)

80
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,633
Tyson!

81
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,508
Tyson!

82
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,199
Cut off the air feed.

83
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Turner's heard something.

84
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,640
The air feed's off.

85
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:58,664
For God's sake, Firebrace!
We're expiring down here.

86
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,639
I can't bloody breathe.

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,240
So shut up and save your breath,
Tipper.

88
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,953
Shell fire.

89
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,279
I heard wrong.

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,008
Just shell fire.

91
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,997
Get out!

92
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,237
Get out, get out! Get back!

93
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,605
Jack!

94
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,381
I want my men out now.

95
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,435
We want everyone out, sir.

96
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,479
I can't get you out, Turner.

97
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,600
Can't get you out.

98
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,367
Hurry up!

99
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,459
Keep going forward! Come on!

100
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,539
Look at me!
Keep looking at me, all right?

101
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,939
Look at me! Look at me, Turner.

102
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,819
Damn it, Weir! I will not allow you to
take my soldiers and put them in danger.

103
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,299
Christ's sake!
We're fighting this war, too!

104
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,339
Hurry up!

105
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,420
Tipper!

106
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,699
Breathe out sharp.

107
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,460
It makes it quicker.

108
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,400
Go on, go on!
Go on, go on!

109
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,779
Tipper! Tipper!

110
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,819
Tipper! Tipper!

111
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,260
Tipper?

112
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,099
You all right?

113
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,300
Turner.

114
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,035
Tipper!

115
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,841
Tipper!

116
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:20,823
For God's sake! Do you want to get us
all bloody killed?!

117
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,259
Don't you EVER let me see you
do that again.

118
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,619
Do you hear me?

119
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,659
Sir.

120
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,900
I will not have you endanger
the lives of the other men.

121
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,780
Get him to the MO.

122
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,935
Tyson, Shaw. Rest up.

123
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,259
Then I want you back down
to start to pump out.

124
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,177
Yes, Captain Weir. I'm on
sentry duty in an hour, sir.

125
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,732
Tunnelers don't do duty.
They're short of men.

126
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,248
Firebrace, take his watch.

127
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,696
Yes, Captain.

128
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,459
Water table must be too high.
It's all the rain.

129
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,643
So, how many men did you lose?

130
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,859
One.

131
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,420
Turner.

132
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,139
You talk to Gray. It was his idea.

133
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,935
I will.

134
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,499
Sir?

135
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,339
Did you order my men down
with Captain Weir, sir?

136
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,500
Weir? Captain Weir?

137
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:39,219
Yes. He's an engineer, isn't he?

138
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,146
Yes, and we're infantry, sir.

139
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,358
We're not claykickers. Those
claykickers are doing their bit.

140
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,216
You'll find you'll like them when they
blow Fritz sky high from underneath.

141
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,005
My men nearly drowned. Yes, I know.

142
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,619
Water table's up. There's nothing
we can do, unfortunately.

143
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,247
Sir, we are infantry.
We do not go underground.

144
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,539
Wraysford, they are laying mines
under Fritz's trenches.

145
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,459
If the Boche hear them, they will
dig down and break through.

146
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,982
They need protecting.
Try telling that to my

147
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,599
men when they're on a
shilling a day, sir.

148
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,967
Try leading by example
and go down with them.

149
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,260
Are you frightened, Lieutenant?

150
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:17,979
No, sir.

151
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,659
Refresh those sewer rats
in the basics of combat,

152
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,299
and then maybe I'll reconsider.

153
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,419
They may have been taught how to
hold a rifle,

154
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,989
but I'm not convinced
they'll be able to fire

155
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,241
it if the Boche break
through into our tunnels.

156
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,716
Yes. Yes.

157
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,340
Thank you, Riley.
Sir.

158
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,659
Rumour has it we'll get
some rest tomorrow.

159
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,820
Then who will keep
the French company?

160
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,299
I don't know what's worse ...

161
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,180
being underground,
or coming up and being under this.

162
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,059
You'd better get used to it.

163
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,179
Big guns take at least a week
to dig in.

164
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,060
They're not going anywhere now.

165
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,339
Aren't you going to open that?

166
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,020
It's been lying there all day.

167
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,091
Christ!

168
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,980
Mother has surpassed herself.

169
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,555
At least I GET post!

170
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,259
If only from my wretched mother.

171
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,659
I've never even seen you get
so much as a bar of chocolate.

172
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,939
Even the Red Cross send socks.

173
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,699
You ought to get yourself
a sweetheart, Lieutenant.

174
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,420
Riley! Bowl!

175
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,059
Are you lost, Monsieur Wraysford?

176
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,419
No, I'm...

177
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,019
Yes, I am.

178
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,859
I meant to turn left, but...

179
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,419
There IS a quicker route,

180
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,059
but then one would miss the roses.

181
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,724
Are you...

182
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,850
settling in well?

183
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,700
Quite well, thank you.

184
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,539
Sorry that you're joining us
at such a difficult time.

185
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,980
I fear the situation at the factory
will grow worse before it is better.

186
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,685
Gregoire is a fine boy.

187
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,729
Yes.

188
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,313
And Lisette, she's...

189
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:26,888
They're my stepchildren.

190
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,233
Rene's first wife
died eight years ago.

191
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,198
We married two years after.

192
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:45,547
I saw you today.

193
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,629
Near the Rue de la Gare.

194
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,310
There's very fine cafe there.

195
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,277
I know it well.

196
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,150
You were visiting a friend?

197
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,790
A friend? No.

198
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,590
I have very few of those.

199
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,585
'On the command, load, '

200
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,389
safety catches off,
and open the bolt.

201
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,869
I've forgotten how you hold it.
Like you hold your sweetheart.

202
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,949
Quiet!

203
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,748
Take the charger clip of five rounds
and place it in the breech.

204
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:31,429
Push the rounds firmly
into the magazine.

205
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,055
Open the bolt.

206
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:36,201
Close the bolt.

207
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,212
Safety catches on.

208
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,195
Check the safety catches, boys.

209
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:49,809
Good.

210
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,129
The weapon is now loaded.

211
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,358
Fire!

212
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,727
Miles away!

213
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,189
My finger's too fat for the trigger.

214
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,030
Hope you don't have that problem
anywhere else, Mr Shaw!

215
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:19,946
Don't hold it like you're
in a penny arcade.

216
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,109
Tuck it under your shoulder.

217
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:25,615
No, tuck it UNDER.

218
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,590
Tuck it in.

219
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:33,068
Fire!

220
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,549
Good man!

221
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,989
Not bad!

222
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,310
It's all muscle from
that hard digging we do

223
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:42,717
while you boys are nancying around
upstairs that does it!

224
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:45,725
Anytime you want to swap places,
mate? No, thanks.

225
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,900
At least we get some peace
down there. Unload.

226
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,521
Close the action,

227
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,589
safety catches on,

228
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,349
and rest your rifles.

229
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:57,737
Douglas, check the targets.

230
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:02,189
That's not much cop if that's all
we get to practise,

231
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,790
shooting at Fritz in the tunnels!

232
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,469
Suits me.

233
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,829
I came to dig, not hold a gun.

234
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,248
You'll do what I say if it's needed.

235
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,400
Sir.

236
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,030
He is a cold bastard.

237
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:19,709
He's a queer one, all right.

238
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,909
He's just trying to get through
this war, like the rest of us.

239
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,030
I'd rather him
than Florence back there.

240
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,115
Captain Weir's all right.

241
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,949
Jesus Christ!

242
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,589
Don't Fritz ever stop for tea?

243
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,470
Nor for breakfast, nor dinner.

244
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,150
Move out!

245
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,577
Douglas, look at me.

246
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:54,388
I'm here, Douglas.

247
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,230
Hold onto my arm.

248
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,469
Grip harder.

249
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,030
Harder, Douglas!

250
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,350
There you are.

251
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,150
Do you have a sweetheart, Douglas?

252
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,907
Morphine!

253
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,390
You do? What's her name?

254
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:19,978
Iris.

255
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,904
Iris.

256
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,589
I want you to think of her...

257
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,456
I want you to think of
the last time that you saw her,

258
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:27,925
and I want you to think
of the first things

259
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,986
you will say to her
when you see her again.

260
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,950
Think of her...

261
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:45,749
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MORPHINE!

262
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,683
Keep thinking of her. Keep thinking.

263
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:50,466
Keep gripping.
Keep thinking of her.

264
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,901
Keep gripping my arm.

265
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,463
Get him out of here.

266
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,109
Bad luck...

267
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,150
today.

268
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,469
This war provides daily lessons

269
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,026
in the extraordinary simplicity
of the human anatomy.

270
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,401
See this muscle here?

271
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,135
I never knew that there was
another one...

272
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,189
here, inside the sartorius.

273
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,990
Not until I saw it.

274
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,110
You're drunk.

275
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,464
Not nearly enough.

276
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,030
Who's she?

277
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,589
Someone I once knew.

278
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,030
Would you believe it if I said
I've never been with a woman?

279
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,352
Never?

280
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,230
How old are you, Weir?

281
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,109
Old enough.

282
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,797
The next village.

283
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,019
We don't want you to die curious.

284
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,448
Your family are close, Monsieur?

285
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,789
No. No, I have no family.

286
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,029
No parents?

287
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,190
No. No parents.

288
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:23,149
My...

289
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,106
My father before I was born,

290
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:27,630
and my mother when I was four.

291
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,589
Then you must have children,
Monsieur.

292
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
They are the greatest gift.

293
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,445
People say that.

294
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,669
Gregoire, how many is that now?

295
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,709
Five, but one is a fat one.

296
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,670
I promised him a centime
for each one that he caught.

297
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,510
Then you're more foolish
than I thought.

298
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,703
It's too hot.

299
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,189
It's beautiful.

300
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,429
Maman?

301
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,330
Do we know her, Stephen?

302
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,510
You mean Monsieur Wraysford, Lisette?

303
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,589
Gregoire, attention!

304
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,910
Gregoire, you will bankrupt me!

305
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:42,131
They're all asleep.

306
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,070
(It's very beautiful here.)

307
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,670
Yes.

308
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,630
Yet, all around, there's such decay.

309
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:30,815
I take bread to the workers.

310
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,790
That's where I was going when you
saw me in the Rue de la Place.

311
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,910
The children are starving.

312
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,082
My husband would not approve.

313
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:05,007
Madame, forgive me,
but I cannot stay silent.

314
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:10,389
At night, I hear you crying.

315
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,749
Maman!

316
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,910
Regardes, Maman,
ce que Papa a attrape.

317
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,497
Everyone!

318
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,483
Un souvenir, if you please.

319
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,050
Attention!

320
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,605
Un...

321
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,324
deux...

322
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:48,457
trois...

323
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:53,027
Perfect!

324
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:29,308
Were you asleep?

325
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,470
I don't know.

326
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,394
Yes, sir.

327
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,121
What's your name?

328
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,896
Firebrace.

329
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:43,535
Pick that up, Firebrace.

330
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,809
Some of my men think you tunnelers
don't work fast enough,

331
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,849
that you don't hear the noise
of the enemy,

332
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,096
so they're terrified of being
blown up from underneath.

333
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,674
And now they must escort you
underground

334
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:01,934
as well as fight a war above it.

335
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,596
And in return...

336
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,166
you fall asleep on your watch,

337
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:10,945
just 50 yards from
the German front line.

338
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:19,102
You know the punishment for falling
asleep on sentry duty, Firebrace?

339
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:22,463
Court-martial.

340
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:28,064
Sergeant Major Price
will bring you down in the morning.

341
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,570
Eyes skinned, Brennan.

342
00:33:39,571 --> 00:33:40,675
Yes, sir.

343
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:43,120
Byrne, bail out some of this water
if you don't want your feet to rot.

344
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:44,202
Sir.

345
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,449
Smarten yourself up, lad.

346
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,050
Cap on straight.

347
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,516
Firebrace?

348
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,529
Is there something wrong?

349
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,650
Lieutenant Wraysford
asked to see me, sir.

350
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:56,683
He was asleep on sentry duty.
It's punishable by firing squad.

351
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:03,058
For Christ's sake, Lieutenant!
You can't be serious!

352
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,437
He's the best tunneler I've got.

353
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,534
Sit down, Firebrace. Have a drink.

354
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:19,393
No.

355
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:20,822
Thank you, Captain.

356
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,706
Sit down.

357
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:42,864
My son's not well.

358
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:45,995
My...

359
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:47,587
wife...

360
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,890
she says it's worse this week.

361
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,792
Diphtheria.

362
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,810
You turn it over in your mind.

363
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,917
Funny, you know.

364
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:08,886
Your head's here, but
your heart's always somewhere else.

365
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,548
Do you have children, sir?

366
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:31,649
No.

367
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,023
No, I don't.

368
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,100
I've not been sleeping properly...

369
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:42,768
I have two men on guard in
a shell hole in no man's land

370
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:44,643
for three days with
their feet rotting in their boots.

371
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,245
What happens if one of them
falls asleep?

372
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:47,887
Each one of them is someone's son.

373
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:57,901
Yes...

374
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,307
sir.

375
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,694
You a gambling man, Firebrace?

376
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,159
No, Sir. I don't believe in chance.

377
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,245
Tap that top card.

378
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,612
(Tap it.)

379
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,401
For Christ's sake, Lieutenant!

380
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,432
You don't have the authority
to have this man shot.

381
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,175
Seems like the man upstairs is
on your side today, Firebrace.

382
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,917
The ace...

383
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,115
power and stability.

384
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:01,273
No further charge.

385
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:12,448
You may go, Firebrace.

386
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:28,165
Yes, Captain.

387
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:12,143
I should fire every one of them
and let them go hungry.

388
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:15,119
One cannot deny progress, Monsieur.

389
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:19,838
When the world is demanding more and we
must supply them with what they need.

390
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:23,967
But they do not understand commerce.

391
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,447
One must be fearless,
if one is to survive.

392
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,731
Big order.

393
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:36,143
French military.

394
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,947
Jeanne?

395
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,367
This is my darling sister, Jeanne.

396
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,057
Jeanne. Enchante.

397
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,535
And this is Monsieur Wraysford,
our visitor from abroad.

398
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,657
- Monsieur! Monsieur!
- Raoul!

399
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,611
C'est pas tres convaincant?
Non, pas du tout.

400
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:26,556
Quoi! C'est pas bien?
Je prie pour ma belle soeur.

401
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,550
C'est mieux, quand meme, hein?

402
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,609
My sister was just reminding me
that as children we used to say

403
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,479
that I would open a shop in Paris

404
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,932
and she would live in the jungle
and be a missionary.

405
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,252
But only after your lover had
rejected you.

406
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:45,973
Maman!

407
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:50,908
What about you, Monsieur? What
did you imagine as a little boy?

408
00:42:52,691 --> 00:42:54,131
The usual, I suspect.

409
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,486
And what was that?

410
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:00,541
A life of sorts.

411
00:43:02,534 --> 00:43:03,877
No adventures at all?

412
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,900
Every child should wish
for adventure, Monsieur.

413
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,292
Lisette...

414
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,252
That's the way all the young ladies
are wearing it.

415
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:26,143
Do you not think it should be
a little higher, Monsieur?

416
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,489
Maybe a little higher?

417
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,690
Lisette.

418
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:42,779
Gregoire!

419
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,970
You bat. I'll bowl. D'accord.

420
00:44:02,627 --> 00:44:04,747
You must think we are silly,
Monsieur.

421
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:08,463
But we see each other so little.

422
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,049
Then when we are together...

423
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:14,301
Not at all. She seems very happy
now that you are here.

424
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,988
No.

425
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:20,590
I don't think it is MY visit,
Monsieur Wraysford.

426
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:29,013
At last she has someone under 40
to keep her company.

427
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,320
You never married, Madame? No.

428
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,170
I resisted my father's
choice for me.

429
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:47,847
And Isabelle did not?

430
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:51,737
Be careful, Monsieur.

431
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:58,052
My sister is very dear,

432
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,910
but I am afraid you will be the one
who is hurt.

433
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:12,699
Merci beaucoup, merci.

434
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,629
Have you read it ... Freud?
No, sir.

435
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:41,629
Pity.

436
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,889
Captain Weir said you
wished to see me. Yes.

437
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,209
We are sure Fritz is going to
break through any day now,

438
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,810
but we need to keep laying charges.

439
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,222
I need you down with those
tunnellers.

440
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:01,699
It's not natural to be buried alive,
I know, but,

441
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,809
we need a regular rota
going down with them

442
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,824
if we are ever
to mobilize near Amiens...

443
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,871
Where, sir?

444
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,700
Amiens. In around six weeks.

445
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:11,893
Yes. You know it?

446
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,387
I spent a summer there
before the war.

447
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,689
I will not... I will not go down
that tunnel, sir.

448
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,870
I did what you asked, I went over
their basic training with them.

449
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:26,050
For God's sake, is
that not enough?

450
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,207
You're curious to me, Wraysford.

451
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:36,011
I've seen all that rubbish
in your dugout.

452
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:38,107
Your carved figures
and bits of candlestick.

453
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,970
You're quite superstitious.

454
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,527
Aren't we all? No. An officer
can't afford to be superstitious.

455
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:47,418
Our lives depend on strategy
and tactics,

456
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:50,441
not matchsticks or card games.
It passes the time.

457
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,867
You'll go down with them.

458
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,130
All right. Dismissed.

459
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,930
Armitage, Byrne and Tipper.

460
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:48,798
Here, give us that.
You do my watch tonight.

461
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:53,579
Cheers.

462
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:57,766
Oi, what about me?

463
00:47:57,814 --> 00:48:00,053
Give over, will you?

464
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:04,356
Cigarettes out.
Wraysford, you joining us today?

465
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,570
It would seem so.

466
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,656
You keep that pump working.

467
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:11,477
Brennan, you go first.
Yes, sir.

468
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,799
There better be no crawling.

469
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:57,857
Just shut up, Byrne.

470
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:19,195
(Down here.)

471
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:39,656
Fighting tunnel.

472
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:41,504
Fighting.

473
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,375
Listen ... we've heard Fritz just been,

474
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,875
so if they break free,
move back yourself.

475
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:51,098
We stick together
and talk only when I do.

476
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,531
Firebrace?

477
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,850
You sure this will hold?

478
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,997
It's not up to London Underground
standards, sir,

479
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,290
but I reckon you could run a train
through it good enough.

480
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,570
Brennan, you first, then Byrne.

481
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,930
I can't! I can't!

482
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,381
I can't!

483
00:50:48,391 --> 00:50:49,431
No, sir.

484
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,089
I'm infantry.

485
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,809
I'm not supposed to be down here.

486
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:58,852
I'll take my chance in a trench,
but not in a bloody hole.

487
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:00,251
None of us signed
up for this, Byrne.

488
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:01,649
But if the sewer rats
can do it, so can you.

489
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,153
You will go down that tunnel.
Or I'll send you

490
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:06,871
on every patrol until
you've cut the wire

491
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:08,711
from here to Switzerland.

492
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:08,253
Back! Get back, back!

493
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,489
Sir. Sir.

494
00:53:33,158 --> 00:53:34,277
Sir...

495
00:53:34,317 --> 00:53:35,917
Sir?

496
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,170
You're leaving already? Yes.
I must leave on business.

497
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,894
I will not be back
until tomorrow.

498
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:08,136
I leave you in charge
of the factory, Monsieur..

499
00:54:08,794 --> 00:54:10,393
Jeanne, are you ready? Oui.

500
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:12,584
Tell her, Rene. Tell her to stay.

501
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,363
I will not let you leave today.

502
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:17,489
Do not be silly,
your sister cannot visit for ever.

503
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:23,367
You are shaking. Have you a chill?

504
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:24,941
No.

505
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,650
Marches avec moi.

506
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,690
Au revoir.

507
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,890
I am so sleepy.

508
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:37,355
Merci.
A walk in the garden and then a

509
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,659
little nap, I think.
A walk is a good idea.

510
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:42,855
Do you want to go into town?

511
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,750
No, I think just a nap.

512
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:55,448
Wake me
if I am not up by five, please.

513
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:36,605
Excuse me.

514
00:58:24,053 --> 00:58:25,532
We got him. We got him.

515
00:58:31,743 --> 00:58:33,894
Get him out! Get him out!

516
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,570
Move!

517
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,410
Papa! Papa est arrive.

518
01:02:30,448 --> 01:02:34,208
I can't look at you.
I am going to give myself away.

519
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:46,218
Rene.

520
01:02:46,397 --> 01:02:47,476
All's well?

521
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,758
Bonjour.

522
01:02:48,804 --> 01:02:49,952
Bonjour.

523
01:02:50,274 --> 01:02:52,196
Nous avons des droits!

524
01:02:52,232 --> 01:02:53,951
Nous avons des droits!

525
01:02:54,023 --> 01:02:55,782
Nous avons des droits!

526
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:56,977
Nous avons des...

527
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:59,827
This malevolence has spread
to the other workers.

528
01:03:00,303 --> 01:03:02,902
"Nous devons rester unis dans
ce combat ou nous tomberons tous."

529
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,015
We must stand together in this
matter or we will all fall.

530
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,330
Does she seem preoccupied to you?

531
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:26,433
My wife?

532
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,179
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

533
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,530
No, not at all.

534
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,330
But she doesn't. I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.

535
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,507
You are very good for us,
Monsieur.

536
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,050
Morphine.

537
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:27,217
Morphine.

538
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,971
No, he's gone. Name, tag him
and lay him out.

539
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:31,453
No, no, a moment longer.

540
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:35,261
Rene will be home really soon.

541
01:05:56,372 --> 01:05:57,972
(Do you feel guilty?)

542
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,205
No.

543
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,352
Is that terrible?

544
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:15,126
I don't know why, but no...

545
01:06:17,884 --> 01:06:19,604
no, I don't believe it is.

546
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,850
Perhaps I should.

547
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:35,879
You must want more.

548
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,775
Than what?

549
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,627
Than...

550
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,174
Picnics...

551
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,736
and endless dinners,
the numbing hours with him.

552
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:51,951
Let us not talk of this, Stephen.

553
01:06:51,984 --> 01:06:53,464
I could take care of you. Please!

554
01:06:55,526 --> 01:06:57,166
(I could take care of you.)

555
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:00,767
So that he won't hurt you any more.

556
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,267
He doesn't mean to hurt me.

557
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:04,862
Then why does he do it?

558
01:07:10,258 --> 01:07:12,098
He grows frustrated.

559
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:17,494
He can't...

560
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:21,377
for some reason, with me...

561
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,510
He is unable to.

562
01:07:34,994 --> 01:07:36,410
My boy...

563
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:41,659
So serious.

564
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:50,996
Now that you are here,
he can't hurt me at all.

565
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,611
How does this fasten?

566
01:08:01,218 --> 01:08:02,778
How does...? Is it...?

567
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,530
Mademoiselle.

568
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,017
The trees are too close together.

569
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,994
Or perhaps you are trying
to sketch Maman?

570
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:53,018
Isabelle.

571
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,130
Isabelle.

572
01:09:08,923 --> 01:09:11,828
What do you mean? I have seen you

573
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,461
when you think we are all asleep.

574
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,633
Do you not want me?

575
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,310
Do you not want to do those things
to me?

576
01:09:32,058 --> 01:09:33,778
She is not even my mother.

577
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:53,739
She need only say a word.

578
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,930
She won't.

579
01:09:59,223 --> 01:10:00,343
Leave.

580
01:10:12,106 --> 01:10:13,826
This is madness.

581
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,700
Did you want her?

582
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:49,820
She's a child.

583
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,781
Did you?

584
01:10:54,744 --> 01:10:56,264
I want you.

585
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,339
Morning, beautiful.

586
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,540
Fancy a bit of that, Jack?

587
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:48,648
Too early for me.

588
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,046
Oi, I'm starving.

589
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:52,540
Put 'em away.
You're putting me off me eggs.

590
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,219
Who's the new brass?
Must be Wraysford's replacement.

591
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,979
Do you know where they put him?

592
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,659
Over with the rest of them.

593
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,940
Might be a brass but we're all
the same when we're dead.

594
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,060
Sir.

595
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,259
Lieutenant Cartwright.

596
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,562
He'll be taking over
from Lieutenant Wraysford.

597
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,078
Yes, sir.

598
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,779
Sir, has Lieutenant Wraysford
got a family?

599
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,260
I don't know...

600
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:51,689
I really don't know.

601
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:59,186
Someone should write
to his family, sir.

602
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,380
Send his badge.

603
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,780
Yes...

604
01:13:19,406 --> 01:13:21,110
Would you like me to go, sir?

605
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,100
Say a prayer?

606
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,650
Yes, Firebrace.

607
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,700
That would be very...

608
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:45,525
kind. Yes, if you wouldn't mind.

609
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,860
Captain.

610
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:08,270
Get me a souvenir? Get it yourself.

611
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:11,946
You're going soft, Jack.
You'll miss breakfast. Save us some.

612
01:14:49,337 --> 01:14:50,979
Another order in today.

613
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,860
2,000 more coats for the military.

614
01:14:54,253 --> 01:14:57,407
The promise of five francs extra in
their pay and they just look at me.

615
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,759
Where's their sense
of national duty?!

616
01:15:02,009 --> 01:15:03,940
We'll break the strikers yet.

617
01:15:10,349 --> 01:15:12,797
The strangest thing, I heard today.

618
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:17,548
Someone has been taking
parcels of food to their families.

619
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:22,699
Well, they...

620
01:15:23,414 --> 01:15:25,156
They do have some supporters, sir.

621
01:15:26,503 --> 01:15:28,159
One or two sympathetic men.

622
01:15:28,277 --> 01:15:29,579
No.

623
01:15:29,688 --> 01:15:33,034
This is the oddest part.
It was a woman.

624
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:35,784
Apparently of some rank.

625
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,020
Now, isn't that the strangest thing?

626
01:15:44,988 --> 01:15:46,588
The children were hungry.

627
01:15:48,552 --> 01:15:50,773
I saw them going through
the dustbins in Saint-Leu.

628
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,117
Don't ask me to stop,
because I'll do it again.

629
01:15:56,157 --> 01:16:00,141
Isabelle... Punish the men,
not their families.

630
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,227
Leave the room.

631
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:17,832
Lisette, I said leave the room.

632
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:21,953
It is all your fault. Lisette!

633
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,820
We were happy before you came.
Your father is right. Leave the room.

634
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,157
I discounted these rumours,
even though it was

635
01:16:40,168 --> 01:16:41,751
your name attached to them.
Rene... Be quiet.

636
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:46,657
Monsieur, if you please, I would
like to be alone with my wife.

637
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,780
Sir? No.

638
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:00,501
Let him stay.

639
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,729
I want him to stay.

640
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,639
There was another piece of idle
talk. I chose to ignore it.

641
01:17:32,745 --> 01:17:34,345
I'm so sorry...

642
01:17:37,202 --> 01:17:39,539
I meant you no harm.

643
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,220
This boy...

644
01:17:42,647 --> 01:17:44,407
This English boy!

645
01:17:48,488 --> 01:17:49,968
In which room?

646
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,413
In my own house! Which room?

647
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,506
I pursued your wife, sir.
I seduced her.

648
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,258
You have never taken the
trouble to know me, Rene.

649
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,699
Forgive me Yes, I forgive you.

650
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:05,834
I forgive you any wrong
you have done me...

651
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:09,647
and I ask you to forgive
me for all the wrong I

652
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,890
have done to you.
You will leave my house, now.

653
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:14,771
(Then I will go with him.)

654
01:18:43,976 --> 01:18:46,056
You think you will be able
to keep her?

655
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,979
Isabelle. We must leave now, come.

656
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,020
J'enverrai quelqu'un pour prendre
le reste de mes affaires.

657
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,300
Wraysford...

658
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,260
Wraysford.

659
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:04,819
Maman!

660
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,139
Maman!

661
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,660
Maman!

662
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,940
Isabelle!

663
01:21:13,352 --> 01:21:14,852
If you go with him,

664
01:21:15,758 --> 01:21:17,180
you go to hell.

665
01:22:03,258 --> 01:22:04,700
Help.

666
01:22:05,642 --> 01:22:07,122
Help.

667
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,680
Get me up.

668
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,060
Isabelle.

669
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,133
I know that many of you

670
01:23:49,462 --> 01:23:53,907
will be relieved
that we are going to attack.

671
01:23:55,993 --> 01:23:57,739
How do we look?

672
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,139
Happy.

673
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:03,019
No, no let's raise a glass
to all those already forgotten.

674
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,660
You're as bad as Weir. Always trying to
get me underground with you sewer rats.

675
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,820
This is for
the next time we meet.

676
01:24:26,064 --> 01:24:28,228
