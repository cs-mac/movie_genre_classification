00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,220
Which part of your body are you going to emphasize?

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,700
I'm confident in everything.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,100
I think I'll look good if I do this.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,540
What is the prettiest part of my face?

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,850
My husband said he fell for my eyebrows. So do my eyebrows, and...

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,780
Make it as big as a 500 won coin.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,490
You have to put on more.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,280
- You must be a strange person who likes things like this.<br>- Bigger!

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,530
All done.

Get up.

♫<i> It's not like I couldn't do the hard things </i>♫

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,460
Yi Suk. I want to eat something sweet.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,510
Wait a minute. Wait.

20
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,600
Come out.

21
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,050
Wait a second.

22
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,510
What are you doing here? Did you come to see me?

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,650
I came here because I had something to say to this guy, but seeing how it is, there won't be any need.

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,410
Then, I'll go in.

25
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,120
Go in where? You want to go back there?

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,330
It seemed like it was a patient, so of course I should go. He can't see patients if I'm not there.

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,540
You say he can't see patients without you? You believe that?

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,490
Then what about that girl inside? What is she? Is she not a person?

29
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,350
There must be a reason. I'm going to ask.

30
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,210
Ask what?

31
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,830
It was very clear. Don't be like that.

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,950
Hey, Cha Hong Do, what are you doing?

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,760
Aren't you going to guard the hospital?

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,870
Oh, you look familiar. We've seen each other before, right?

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,840
Well, since we didn't even greet each other that day, you probably wouldn't remember.

36
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,530
What's that?

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,360
Hey, Ko Yi Suk!

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,400
I'll wait for you in the car, Darling.

39
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,430
What's with you? Why are you always hanging around here?

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,140
You're really a shameless bastard.

41
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,090
Hong Do, get in quickly.

42
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,940
Hey, Cha Hong Do, what are you doing?

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,500
Don't get involved and go!

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,260
How could you do that? That girl is your ex-lover, isn't she?

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,490
So what? Huh?

46
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,520
Get off! Can't you see I'm talking with this girl?

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,440
Is your decision already made?

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,310
Before asking anything, you just assume that I am an as*hole and you are the victim?

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,720
Fine. You were going to last only three months anyway.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,700
Let's end it.

51
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,620
Hey, remove your car. Coming here with your shitty car...

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,170
As excepted, sweet things are great. 
It seems like my stress is all relieved.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,270
You seem very at ease.

54
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,640
Why did you suddenly appear and make everything so noisy?

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,970
It's just I played a joke because I wanted to see you.

56
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,540
What kind of joke is that? Are you bored?

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,790
I feel so uneasy now that my wedding is soon.

58
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,790
So you came to brag about your wedding.

59
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,080
Hey, but what's with you hugging your ex-boyfriend so tightly.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
I was almost flustered for a moment.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,260
You were flustered? Did you miss me?

62
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,760
Tsch.

63
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,780
What? So you didn't even think about me at all?

64
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,090
What time would I have to think about somebody
else's bride, when I need to take care of my girl?

65
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,200
Would that be a waste of time?

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,410
That's right. I like you because you're constant.

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,950
That girl who got angry in front of the hospital,
that was the girl from that time, right?

68
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,610
Yeah.

69
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,690
Hey. But you must have some kind of problem, right?

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,390
You've been crossing your legs. It looks
like you are worried about something.

71
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,310
What's going on?

72
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,580
Why? You seem like someone hoping that
there'd be something wrong with my marriage?

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,370
No.

74
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,830
Actually, I came to play with you.

75
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,050
When I get married, I have to act like a good, faithful wife.

76
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,950
Then, I can't do that anymore. So I want to play with you, once.

77
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,780
What about you?

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,160
You changed your helmet.

79
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,150
It's cute. It looks like an egg.

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,110
I got a bandage.

81
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,730
I got hurt a little while trying to catch a criminal.

82
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,050
It seems like you get hurt at least once a year.

83
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,170
You suffered so much when you broke your ribs last time.

84
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,770
Ah that's true.

85
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,190
You remembered it all.

86
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,920
Ever since I was little, I always had the title of the
eldest grandson, and so I grew up with a lot of attention.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,470
When I got sick, the soup could be smelled across the whole town.

88
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,340
If they knew you were hurt like this, the whole
neighborhood would've been in an uproar.

89
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,400
For sure. I won't be able to tell them.

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,890
Back then, that attention was so annoying and burdensome.

91
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,070
But still, it doesn't seem like you would
have been annoyed, Detective Jang.

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,640
Because you're kind.

93
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,920
Hong Do, there's somewhere I'd like
to go with you now. Is that okay?

94
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm going.

95
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,330
How is it? Do you like it?

96
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,860
Your wedding is right around the corner, what
were you doing, not even having chosen a bed yet?

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,540
I did choose one, at the price adding
zero to the price of this bed.

98
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,790
Then why did you want to come here?

99
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,650
I just felt like it. Wondering how it
would be if I was getting married to you.

100
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,850
I think about it when I see even just any man passing by.

101
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,300
What would it be like to get married to that guy?

102
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,130
Is it really right for me to get married now?

103
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,140
It's the typical marriage blues.

104
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,520
That's pre-wedding depression.

105
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,700
It will be gone when you get married. Just hurry set up a date.

106
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm getting married and you don't even have an ounce of regret?

107
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,020
What if this marriage goes wrong?

108
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,860
That bastard. That bastard from a
rich family. Don't you love him?

109
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,270
No.

110
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,480
I don't.

111
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,970
Please hold onto me, Yi Suk.

112
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,060
Special Sushi.

113
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,250
Th-thank you.

114
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm more thankful.

115
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,750
It's nice to see you two. Play until morning. All the way till then.

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,610
Go, quickly.

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,980
This is really delicious.

118
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,830
He made it specially today, so eat and don't leave any.

119
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,490
Yes.

120
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,610
I think you got a text.

121
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,380
I'll eat well.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Are you waiting for Ko Yi Suk's call?

123
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,330
Do you still like him even though
he was holding his ex in his arms?

124
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,270
Hong Do, he's the first man you went out with, right?

125
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,070
I really don't care what kind of person he is but,

126
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,410
I just wish you wouldn't get hurt.

127
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,490
I know you're worried about me.

128
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,740
But I'm not that innocent. I know a few things.

129
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,830
You really don't know about what's going on in the world.

130
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,960
Open your eyes and look at it realistically.

131
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,200
Does it really seem to you as if he cherished and loved you?

132
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
He's playing with you right now.

133
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,270
I know that, too.

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,660
That I don't match with him.

135
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,460
He wasn't holding another girl because you're lacking anything.

136
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,260
That's not what I'm saying at all.

137
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,600
I want to go home.

138
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,110
I'm sorry. Eat.

139
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,190
Why isn't she answering her phone?

140
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,200
<i>Helmet</i>

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Oppa, do you know Detective Jang Doo
Soo from the Gangnam police station?

142
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,790
How do you know that bastard?

143
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,080
So you really know him. How? Is he a friend of yours?

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,120
He was the detective in charge of the drunk driving accident.

145
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
He's the one I sued before.

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,410
That was Detective Jang?

147
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,890
That bastard, really. Why did you get involved with him?

148
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,280
That's enough. Don't even deal with a bastard like him.

149
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,840
You guys must have been in bad terms.

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,500
What's that on your clothes?

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,420
Oh! That's lipstick!

152
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,340
He-hello...

153
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,750
<i> Now you even get a woman's lipstick on your clothes? </i>

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,960
<i> You're so dirty. How can you get lipstick on your shirt?</i>

155
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,730
Who is it?

156
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,250
When did that get stained?

157
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,240
Did that happen on the bed?

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
<i> You are so shameless.</i>

159
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,980
Really, if you weren't my brother I'd...

160
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,030
Who is that woman, who is not careful?

161
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,920
<i> That's why I keep telling you to stop dating just anyone.</i>

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,760
<i> Is it an announcer? Did you get a new one again?</i>

163
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,010
Hey, please leave. I'm tired, hurry! Leave!

164
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,060
You would be tired, meeting all those girls...

165
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,320
Hey, after you wash up, draw some water for me.

166
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,870
Hello?

167
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,150
Hey, you didn't pick up the phone. Where are you?

168
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,370
Why did you call?

169
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm giving you a chance right now.

170
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,130
You should have an explanation for getting in Detective Jang's car
in front of me and leaving with him. Do you have nothing to tell me?

171
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,620
You said we should end it.

172
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,170
So it's the end? Really the end?

173
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,650
Why aren't you answering?

174
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,110
You heard what we were saying just then, didn't you?

175
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,160
I don't know.

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,260
When I was talking to my sister about the shirt and the lipstick?

177
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,220
Yes. Something about the bed and whatever. I heard it all.

178
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,680
Are you acting as if you didn't hear? Or are you just not interested in me?

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,170
Are you having fun, huh?

180
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,730
Your really looked down on me.

181
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,280
At least I ate something delicious with Detective Jang.

182
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,240
So, you like it?

183
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,380
Yes. But I was sad.

184
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,670
And angry.

185
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,680
I had decided not to get hurt again, but it is sad.

186
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,210
I'm hanging up.

187
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,180
Hey! Hey! Hey!

188
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,640
Who's the one who's angry?

189
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,620
Wow, this is the king of reversals. How dumbfounding.

190
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,620
Every time that girl comes, she doesn't even eat and runs away.

191
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,010
No matter how I see it, she doesn't seem interested in you.

192
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,560
It's not. I was wrong.

193
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,230
I did all I can do.

194
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,630
I don't know what more I should do.

195
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,190
Then, don't think about it and make progress with your body.

196
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,560
Like go and grab her wrist. Or say "be my girl!"

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,910
You are so nice. So frustrating.

198
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,030
I wish I could turn back time.

199
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,950
I'll be going now.

200
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,650
See you tomorrow.

201
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:59,240
Aigoo, grandma. I wish you'd be careful with the way you act.

202
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,740
I don't think that, but if Doctor Go and Se Ro

203
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,110
and the kids saw, they'd definitely misunderstand.

204
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,400
Misunderstand? What misunderstanding?

205
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,470
You didn't hear about it?

206
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,750
Our chairman with his charming, white hair

207
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,730
You were touching his hair, while saying
that you will dye his hair or whatnot.

208
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,150
Then they'd think you're trying to seduce our Chairman!

209
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,150
Don't you think they'd see it like that?

210
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,330
No! No! What's wrong?! No!

211
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,480
So that you won't make men misunderstand, from now on,

212
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,900
be careful how you act. Understood?

213
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,880
Yes. I'll be careful. Good-bye.

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,140
Leave carefully.

215
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm in front of Ko Yi Suk's house. I'll wait for you.

216
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,650
Madame Oh. You're going now? I'll take you.

217
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,210
Uh... it's enough.

218
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,090
You're a really difficult person.

219
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,450
Do you feel burdened? Or is it that you dislike me?

220
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,570
I'm a bit hurt, because you're always avoiding me.

221
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,640
Just think of me as a grandson and be comfortable.

222
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,570
It's because I'm thankful that you got my grandpa to laugh.

223
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,470
A man should not act so cheap.

224
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,020
Even if you are nice to a person, you could be
misunderstood. You shouldn't be nice to everyone.

225
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,440
A man should stick to one person.

226
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,270
How are you just anybody? You're my grandfather's friend!

227
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,390
She's weird.

228
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,120
Detective Jang, what are you doing here?

229
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,760
I wanted to drop you off.

230
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,320
Detective Jang! That person is coming! That person is coming!

231
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
It's okay, it's okay.

232
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,200
So you came on your own feet. My
body was feeling itchy today anyway.

233
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,110
You bastard, let's fight.

234
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,610
Madam Oh! How do you know this bastard? Is he your relative?

235
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,720
Does she have to tell you that kind of things?

236
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,720
It's just that it felt like someone who works at my house
was caught by a gangster. It's not just one or two times.

237
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,760
You even dragged Cha Hong Do away in front
of me. Is dragging women away your hobby?

238
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,850
- Then, what about you? Is making women cry your hobby? <br>- Detective Jang, aren't you going?

239
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,370
No, he is a neighbor. Detective Jang, let's go.

240
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,670
You take care of everyone in your town.

241
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,260
Coming with your shitty car...

242
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,770
Remove your car, quickly! So I can go.

243
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,060
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The ♥ to Heart Team @ Viki
Timed by Myuu </i>

244
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,150
I'm sorry. Every day...

245
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,890
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,060
Why are you apologizing when I'm the one who did wrong?

247
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,520
It's me who put you in trouble because I came
and waited without telling you ahead of time.

248
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,840
You should be mad at me.

249
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,160
I don't have any right to say this. But it's because I hate it.

250
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,340
Ko Yi Suk's house, Ko Yi Suk's hospital, Ko Yi Suk's
family. I hate that you're in all of these things.

251
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,310
I...

252
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,730
Today, I've thought about it.

253
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,590
I realized that I've been lying to people just for my own benefit.

254
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,670
That person. That person's Grandfather. And the family.

255
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,670
If they knew I'm not a granda but Cha Hong Do...

256
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,070
How betrayed they would feel.

257
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:15,200
After looking at myself all scared that he will found out,

258
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,530
I realized then, that I'm

259
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,880
doing something really bad.

260
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,900
Detective Jang... I'll take the bus.

261
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,530
You mean a lot to me, so

262
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,040
I don't feel comfortable.

263
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,770
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,530
I'll be quiet from now on.

265
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,570
Please feel at ease.

266
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,620
I mean, she asked me to treat her pre-wedding depression.

267
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,840
I knew girls were selfish, but isn't that being too shameless?

268
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,500
Weren't you going to give that to me?

269
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,720
- Here. Enjoy your coffee. <br> - Thank you. Do you want to try this?

270
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,510
Thank you, as expected.

271
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,140
Why are you grinning so wide?

272
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,530
Are you that happy that she's clinging onto you?

273
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,540
She wants to play.

274
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,920
Well, since she's about to marry, how Ko Yi Suk is the alpha male,

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,480
she is just realizing.

276
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,470
She wanted to play, there was no reason to refuse, was there?

277
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,240
That bullsh*t, really.

278
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,930
Hey, send that announcer to me. Play!? You're
not even a kid, what do you mean play. Aigoo.

279
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,420
Eun Ho's eyesight came back.

280
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,690
She must feel a lot better after talking about her anger.

281
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,060
They are both getting better because she is getting consulted with Jin Ho.

282
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,600
The mother was so grateful she said she'd buy you a meal.

283
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,780
The twins were fighting for their mother's attention.

284
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,710
They've grown a lot.

285
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,220
But did you counsel that TV presenter alone?

286
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,490
Yes. Why?

287
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,710
You were okay without Cha Hong Do?

288
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,790
Did your fear for patients subside?

289
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,460
That...

290
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,560
How can that be?

291
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,330
Is it because you didn't see her as a patient?

292
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,190
What are you doing? Go away.

293
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,870
What the heck, seriously.

294
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,830
Do you want to take a dump?

295
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,010
Hyung. I got myself into trouble.

296
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,610
What trouble.<br>- Last night.

297
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,990
You know I like girl groups. With them,

298
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,770
we had a group chat and I sent your picture.

299
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,010
You know the picture of you looking really
handsome at the last sporting event. That one.

300
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,090
<i>[sigh]</i>

301
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,790
There's a girl in the group and she kept
asking me to introduce her to my friend.

302
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,440
She said she's going to bring a pretty friend if he looks nice,

303
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,690
and send me a picture. Wow, she's really pretty, totally like Miss Korea.

304
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,110
So I sent her your picture, instinctively.

305
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,480
Hey, are you out of our mind? Sell me out to get yourself a girl?

306
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,720
Ridiculous punk.

307
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,410
Man.

308
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,440
Tonight at 7 o'clock.

309
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,830
Help me out! Don't just tell me to meet women.

310
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,040
Let's say hi.

311
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,370
It's me. Can you come over here after work?

312
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,390
<i>Play at the clinic?</i>

313
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,520
You said you wanted to receive my counseling.

314
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,130
Of course you have to pay the counseling fee.

315
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,960
Ex-girlfriend discount?

316
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,180
We'll see.

317
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll see you after work. Okay.

318
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,670
Alright. Shall we start our own counseling session?

319
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,120
Have a seat. Come over here.

320
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,450
You did well/

321
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,050
Do what?

322
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,640
Going to a restaurant with Detective Jang was a bad move,

323
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,380
but going to a public restaurant.

324
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,780
Congrats.

325
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,750
The girl I saw at the clinic last night. It's her, isn't she?

326
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,720
The one at the studio apartment last time.

327
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,400
I was hugging here here, alright. Got a lipstick mark too.

328
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,030
Why did she come?

329
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,960
You heard it. To receive counseling.

330
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,450
But why here?

331
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,560
She's a famous person that everyone recognizes.

332
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,190
Would she go to another psychiatrists to get counseling?

333
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,980
I should give her the counseling.

334
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,820
Right. Go home once Yeon Woo gets here.

335
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,630
Why go home? You said she's coming to get counseling.

336
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,690
Me... Is it okay without me?

337
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,970
Hey. There's a place we need to go.

338
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,340
So let's head there. And you can go home straight from there.

339
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,620
Okay? Let's go.

340
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,480
What's he saying?

341
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,800
Miss Korea.

342
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,030
Get that away.

343
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,970
FYI, she's 23, in college. Young, isn't she?

344
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,390
Forget it.

345
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,540
Hyung. When are we ever going to meet college girls?

346
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,730
Hey. What am I supposed to do?

347
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,420
The date? You can just go out there.

348
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,900
No, waiting.

349
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,460
Waiting, keeping by her side. How do you do it?

350
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,820
So... You just need to be her shadow.

351
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,870
Whether it rains, snows, or the wind blows, you never get swayed

352
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,300
and you just need to stay by her side. Difficult, isn't it?

353
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,950
Shadow?

354
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,100
She's pretty though.

355
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,820
Tonight at seven.

356
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,610
Seven. Not much time left. Let's go.

357
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,720
Forget it!

358
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,580
First, let's visit the tasting booths.

359
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,220
If you go around this way, there's dumpling,
sausage and all the other stuff. Go and eat them.

360
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,960
This isn't it. I can't.

361
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,910
What do you mean, you can't?

362
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,290
I absolutely can't!

363
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,120
I'll tell you how.

364
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,810
First, you just walk over there.

365
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,160
Keep on walking, without thinking. Got it?

366
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,230
Here. Just go. Keep walking forward.

367
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,830
Okay. Second,

368
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,390
just go there and enjoy the food they give you. Isn't it easy?

369
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,810
Easy for you, but for me, it's not. It's only easy for other people.

370
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,870
Do you know how hard it is for me to be just standing here?

371
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,080
Are you really going to be like this? Don't you want to fix it?

372
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,360
Why does that announcer need counseling?

373
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,990
She's pretty and smart and doesn't have a disorder like I do.

374
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,780
So why am I seeing you?

375
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,110
I guess it's strange for you too.

376
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,640
When a girl like Woo Yeon Woo is the right match for me. Right?

377
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,240
To date me, you have to do this like a piece of cake.

378
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,390
Okay? I'll demonstrate first. Take a look.

379
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,980
Is this too soon?

380
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,390
She should do this much though.

381
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,050
<i>Yi Suk. Take me!</i>

382
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,420
<i>Please take me!</i>

383
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,880
Here are dumplings. Try one, Ma'am.

384
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Try one, Ma'am.

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,500
It's very good.

386
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,060
We have dumplings. Try one!

387
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,790
Hello.<br>- You can go home by yourself, right?

388
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,180
Why? Are you going somewhere?

389
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,730
I think something happened to Yeon Woo. Take a cab.

390
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,500
You can do that much.

391
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,520
You have to believe that you can do it.

392
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,280
Hello? Hello?

393
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,470
Hello?

394
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,750
<i> There will be a special sale for ten minutes.</i>

395
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,420
<i> Just ten minutes! A beef set worth $100</i>

396
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,240
<i> To the first fifty customers...</i>

397
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,330
Don't pick up. I don't want to see anyone.

398
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,210
No one. Go to a place where there is no one.

399
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,210
Quickly.

400
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:20,810

<i>Reporter Shin Na Ra reports.</i>

405
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,070
I don't remember it.

406
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,730
I'm so embarassed I could die.

407
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,070
What hapened to me? Why am I like this, Yi Suk?

408
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,650
First, rest.

409
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,500
You are not in a condition where I can check you right now.

410
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,470
How can I rest when the Internet and the
broadcasting station are all going crazy!?

411
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,340
This is all because of you.

412
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,500
You always hurt my pride

413
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,180
So I wanted to meet someone better, get married and act proud.

414
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,660
But...

415
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,810
Why are all men like that?

416
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,810
My friend saw him coming out of a hotel with another woman.

417
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,270
I confronted him and he didn't even give any excuses.

418
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,280
Throw away that kind of bastard.

419
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,850
Cancel the wedding. What's holding you back?

420
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,550
After I said I'd get married into a rich family

421
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,240
My mom and dad were so happy.

422
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,820
I don't know what to do.

423
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,680
I can't.

424
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,800
I can't go through this marriage.

425
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,860
We've been overworking with all that's been going on,
so we're all still single. We shouldn't live like this.

426
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,820
So I've come up with the kind of man which the modern women prefer.

I'm sorry, but...

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:11,940
when you get off work, c-c-can you come here?

431
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,810
Where are you right now?

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,910
Welcome.

435
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,680
Excuse me. Where is the storehouse here?

436
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,580
What's the matter?

437
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,260
-A person is trapped in there. <br> -Huh?

438
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,600
Wait, but right now I...but...

439
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,800
Which way is it?

440
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,080
It's this way.

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,650
-The password. <br> -Okay.

444
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,590
It's open.

445
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,880
Hong Do, are you okay?

446
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,040
It's cold, right?

447
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,240
It must have been hard on you. What happened?

448
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,610
It's...

449
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,660
It's not Ko Yi Suk's fault.

450
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,110
It's my fault.

451
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,860
That person told me to

452
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,680
believe that I can do it.

453
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,720
But I...I...just ran away because I was scared.

454
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,370
Let me just ask you one thing.

455
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,110
Where is Ko Yi Suk right now?

456
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,750
With a patient.

457
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,190
He had something urgent to do with another patient so he went there.

458
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,110
Your reply is suspicious right now.

459
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,310
I couldn't ask him.

460
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,110
If there really was something going on with that woman...

461
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,610
Whether he was going to go back to her...

462
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,530
I was too scared so I couldn't ask.

463
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,200
Because I know all too well

464
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,200
that I don't match well with him.

465
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,420
Hong Do, you're not the type of person to be comparing yourself.

466
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,720
Why did you become like this after meeting Ko Yi Suk?

467
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,190
Here, wear this to sleep.

468
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,880
So you can leave me all alone?

469
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,560
So you can sleep comfortably.

470
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,960
Don't go.

471
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,940
What do you like so much about that girl? She's not even your type.

472
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,470
You're right. I even told her that.

473
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,230
That there was no part of her I could possibly like.

474
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,490
Then why?

475
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,910
I wasn't really sure all along,

476
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,000
but "this" was different.

477
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,960
With a person you really like.

478
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,080
Now I think I know.

479
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,520
Yi Suk, you're really cruel and petty.

480
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,980
That woman was real and I'm fake?

481
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,580
Sorry. Here.

482
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,930
Fine, go! Go away!

483
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,290
-Hello? <br><i> -Yeah.</i>

484
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,610
Where are you? At home?

485
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,750
Yes...

486
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,110
Hey, why do you sound so down. Did you just wake up?

487
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,480
I sle...I slept...

488
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,940
You took a taxi home right?

489
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,210
<i>Yes.</i>

490
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,620
How is it? Was it doable?

491
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,420
Um...

492
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,290
What happened to that TV presenter?

493
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,630
Who do you think I am?

494
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,870
Well, since she's my ex-girlfriend, I should treat her.

495
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:25,370
Hey, Cha Hong Do. I'm going right now to meet
you so don't fall asleep and wait for me.

496
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,330
I'm sleepy though...

497
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,740
Wow, look at this woman playing hard to get.

498
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,450
Fine. I'll let it go since today was a nervous day for you.

499
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,770
Since I don't think you'll be able to fall asleep if I tell you how I feel right now,

500
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,310
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

501
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,160
Hello?

502
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,280
I'm crazy, I'm crazy.

503
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,320
I'm talking about that ugly thing, Cha Hong Do.

504
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,940
What the? Why are you here again?

505
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,470
You bastard, hey! Hey!

506
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,300
You need to get beat up you bastard.

507
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,780
You bastard! Bastard!

508
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,740
I'm going to...

509
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,380
Just!

510
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,910
You're dead today. This bastard.

511
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,260
Come over here. Come here, here!

512
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,060
Come here!

513
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,840
-You're dead! <br> -Let go!

514
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,190
It's all misunderstanding that arose while I was patrolling.

515
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,370
We'll settle this and part our ways. So you can head out.

516
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,080
-Are you a detective? <br> -Yes.

517
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,540
Do I look like I hit him? That bastard's the one who hit me first!

518
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,250
Catch that bastard! You guys are all gangster huh!?

519
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,170
-Be quiet! <br>-Hey, I'm going to sue!

520
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,160
Hey! You're not catching him? Take him away!

521
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,920
This bastard, really!

522
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,770
Good work.

523
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,750
I'm going to sue you.

524
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,480
Hong Do

525
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,160
was left all alone.

526
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:19,060
At the storehouse. In that dark and gloomy
storehouse, she was trapped inside alone.

527
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:24,950
Hey you bastard, I don't know if you think
it's funny making a woman cry or be in pain,

528
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,280
but I can't forgive that.

529
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,950
So please, please just piss off, yeah?

530
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,650
Hey. Stop talking nonsense.

531
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,640
Do you really even know how I feel?

532
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:54,170
Hey, you already have that pretty and smart girl.

533
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,800
But why is it Hong Do!?

534
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,670
That woman doesn't even know anything about Hong Do, right?

535
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,850
If she doesn't know, are you going to tell her? 
What kind of policeman gives threats?

536
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,870
Look at you...You're weak with alcohol.

537
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,990
That's why you always causing trouble!

538
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,970
No matter what you say, I choose Cha Hong Do.

539
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,250
Until when?

540
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,210
What?

541
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:31,220
Two weeks? One month? Can you even last three days?

542
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,380
This bastard's all talk.

543
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,210
Drink this all.

544
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,250
Look at him gulping it down.

545
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm sure Hong Do will be the only one getting hurt.

546
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,530
But I won't just stand aside and look.

547
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,980
Before she gets hurt more, I...!

548
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,400
I'll put her back to what's originally her place.

549
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Her original place?

550
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,450
Yes, her original place!

551
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,010
how hard it is to get her out. what?

552
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,540
that woman, in that box again...

553
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,340
put her back in that box-like house again?

554
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,900
to give to who? to give to you?

555
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,570
You seem to be really misunderstanding.

556
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,940
the original place is not that box,

557
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,580
It's also not next to you. But to me. Here!

558
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,320
Here, beside me.

559
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,100
That bastard, you're drunk.

560
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,570
Drink a bit more.

561
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,730
Drink.

562
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,650
Let's kill you for once today.

563
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,990
Yeah, let's do that.

564
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,000
grandma..

565
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,520
I'm going to stop disguising as you, grandma.

566
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,340
All that time...

567
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,350
I wanted to live and eat...

568
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,510
So I only thought of myself.

569
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,920
I think I didn't think about others.

570
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,200
I feel really sorry,

571
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,260
And I'm scared.

572
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,960
So I'm going to stop pretending to be you, grandma.

573
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,910
That's the right thing to do, isn't it?

574
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,490
Ko Yi Suk, are you playing with me?

575
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:39,100
But I like you.

576
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,200
Very much.

577
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:02,080

578
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,310
What's that?

579
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,200
Doo Soo?

580
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,970
Doo Soo Jang! Did you sleep in my brother's room?

581
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,730
Your hair is cute. Ah, you smell of alcohol!

582
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,270
What happened? Did you drink with my brother?

583
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,160
I'm a bit late. I have to go quickly, so see you next time.

584
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,180
That's right, I got a role. Would it be okay
to get some experience at your police station?

585
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,050
We're going to start shooting soon, and I won't be able
to do it for long, so it will be for about a week.

586
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,590
If you send the forms to the police station, the general affairs
department will take care of it for you, so please do that.

587
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,840
Who doesn't know that? It's because I don't have time.

588
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,310
That's the good thing about knowing people. 
You can help each other in need.

589
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,580
And you! You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

590
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,240
I already told you there's someone I like.

591
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,140
I don't think that's true.

592
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,750
I've investigated in many different aspects and

593
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,270
You don't seem bad, even for a marriage.

594
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,830
You and me are also very compatible.

595
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,340
Compatible? What are you saying?

596
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,560
Does it seem like a joke? I'm not joking.

597
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,260
I am a very impetuous and straightforward person,

598
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,050
But you're the first man I know to accept it all like that.

599
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:42,700
"Do whatever you want, and I'll accept it all." That kind of impression.

600
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,200
Will you realize it if I do this?

601
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,510
Aigoo, oh my word! What are you doing? At the house at that!

602
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,240
How can you so easily...

603
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,220
Hello. I'm Jang Doo Soo.

604
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,850
I don't remember it very well, but I think took
advantage of your hospitality. Really, I'm sorry.

605
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,440
Ahjuma, how is he? He's my brother's friend, right?

606
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,760
I don't know about that but I I saw him with your brother

607
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,550
I saw him crawl home last night dead drunk.

608
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,700
I am very sorry.

609
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,410
I'll be going now, then. Goodbye.

610
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,650
The bean sprouts fell.

611
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,330
I'll come to the police station!

612
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,700
Why to the police station, again?

613
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,600
I got a new role, and it's a female police officer.

614
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,590
I want to get a hands-on experience.

615
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,510
What a good morning!

616
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,390
Who are you calling first thing in the morning?

617
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,080
You know Sam Dam's president, right?

618
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,800
The one who used to own a rice store, located
right next to your store a long time ago.

619
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,690
It's his eightieth birthday this weekend,
so for the Jang Yoon Jeong dinner show,

620
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,670
he's sending an invitation. He's sending two tickets,

621
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,800
so he said you should bring your girlfriend.<br>- What?

622
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,990
He told me to bring this?

623
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,330
You should go. I heard it's difficult to get a hold of those tickets.

624
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,870
Where would I be going all alone?

625
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,430
Then can I take those tickets?

626
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,590
I love seeing those kinds of things alone.

627
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,170
I know you love being alone, but

628
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,650
Why are you taking something that's for me?

629
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,290
What about giving Madam Oh a fancy dress as a nice gift?

630
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:31,130
If she wore it to go see a certain
singer's show, it would be really nice.

631
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,570
Okay, I got it, well...

632
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,340
ah.. my head..

633
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,650
Where did that bastard go?

634
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,060
Has he left?

635
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:10,750
Instead of me, she sent an S.O.S. to Detective Jang, is that right?

636
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,130
There's none.

637
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,360
If not a call, then there should at least be a text message.

638
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,980
Well, Detective Jang would be more
comfortable than me, since he's good to her.

639
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,490
Hello?

640
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,390
Hey, I have something to say, so come out.

641
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,710
now?

642
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,610
Did you forget I had another part time job
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings?

643
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,670
Just what is that Monday, Wednesday, and Friday part-time job?

644
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,000
Where are you?

645
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,290
Why?

646
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:59,430
Come to the hospital when you get off work. I have something to say.

647
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,200
Don't I always do that?

648
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Okay.

649
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,830
This woman. She's not letting it out.

650
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,860
Ah, that was that.

651
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,420
That voice she had on the phone yesterday.

652
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,150
Ah, she cried.

653
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,610
Why doesn't she tell me?

654
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:44,480
Hello? What is it, Butler Ahn?

655
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,650
What? Evening work, you say?

656
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:55,500
Well then, it would be better after six o'clock.

657
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,420
Ah, I got it. Yes.

658
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,080
Ah, my body.

659
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,370
My body's aching all over.

660
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,470
Ahjumeoni, did everyone go somewhere? Why is nobody here?

661
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,650
They went out, and Se Ro went out too.

662
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,470
You need to keep Se Ro under control.

663
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:25,070
I don't know if it's because she's lived in America, but
going around everywhere...smooch, smooch, smooch...

664
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,090
What?

665
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:30,250
That friend you came with yesterday, he's dating with Se Ro, right?

666
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,340
That's exactly how it looked.

667
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,440
A friend?

668
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,490
Detective Jang? Hey, Ahjumeoni, you must have seen wrong.

669
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:46,070
Seriously. How can the chairman be so indifferent?

670
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,380
He knows full well that I like Jang Yoon Jeong,

671
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,010
but he's going with that old lady Madam Oh or whatever

672
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,350
to see the Jang Yoon Jeong show.

673
00:49:54,350 --> 00:50:00,900
Ey~ So now you're upset? I'll get you
the tickets immediately. Don't worry.

674
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,540
Do you think I'm doing right now this because of the tickets?

675
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,610
I have money too! Don't you think I could get a
hundred tickets or ten tickets if I wanted to?

676
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,570
I don't want to see you, so go over there.

677
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,230
Just eat pollack soup in a little bit. Aigoo.

678
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,920
You're here?

679
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,240
You still haven't thrown it away.

680
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,760
So we finally get to eat breakfast together?

681
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,820
I already ate breakfast.

682
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,080
You're still the same.

683
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,130
I spent the night thinking.

684
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,730
Even if I ask anyone on the streets,
their answers will probably be the same.

685
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,150
I think it's right to end it.

686
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,920
But I... didn't know that I was such a materialistic person.

687
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,460
If dreaming of marrying a chaebol is being materialistic,
then all the women in the world are materialistic.

688
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,860
Then what do I do? Not get married?

689
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,960
Do it. Get married and get a divorce.

690
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,820
With evidence of his cheating, get a huge alimony payment from him.

691
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,920
Are you really a doctor?

692
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,660
This is something that no one can do for you.

693
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,560
The only thing I can tell you is this :

694
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,080
Whatever you choose, give it your all in that decision.

695
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,860
That's the way you'll live, okay?

696
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,840
Eat that.

697
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,150
Even if you're not the best doctor in this world

698
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,030
Even if you're a psycho, a player and a crook, you have to fix me.

699
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,570
Otherwise, otherwise, you're...

700
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,430
Otherwise... I'm gonna die right here.

701
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,970
Please fix me.

702
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,300
♫<i> I'm in love. </i>♫

703
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,970

710

It's really you.

711
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,720
What are you doing here?

712
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,210
I was on my way to work and I thought I should come to thank you.

713
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,410
I thought about just texting you...

714
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,790
If you'd done that, I'd have been resentful.

715
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,330
Thank you.

716
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,190
That kind of thing won't happen again.

717
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,690
I'm sorry that I was bothersome.

718
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,950
Why are you saying that when you know it wasn't bothersome at all?

719
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:33,810
Far from being bothersome, since you looked for me, I thought, "Ah,
Hong Do hasn't forgetten about me completely", so I was comforted.

720
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,260
I was really happy yesterday.

721
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,800
Happy that there was still something I could do for you.

722
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,180
Hong Do, you said that I was in your heart for the last seven years, right?

723
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,640
Do you know what the motto of the Gangnam police is?

724
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,800
It's, "The tenacious detective wins."

725
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,420
I'm really tenacious.

726
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,500
Wait and see. Right now is the start of seven years for me.

727
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,440
Is that burdensome?

728
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,920
Don't feel burdened.

729
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,700
You just need to think of it as winning the loto.

730
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,160
You get a bonus, and you get to do something meaningful.

731
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,890
You said you wanted to make an event, right?

732
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:23,140
It's an event. He's going to give us a bonus.

733
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,440
I'm counting on you.

734
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,760
-These workers are the best in... <br> -Beauty.

735
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,910
The enthusiastic ones, the ones who do a good job.

736
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,620
Yes.

737
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,700
Then I will touch up everyone's faces.

738
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,960
You can knead them until they pop.

739
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,360
Touching it, then?

740
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,140
Do well.

741
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,220
Yes, of course. Fighting!

742
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,500
Hwaiting!

743
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,230
It's this way.

744
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:57,350
Here. I think it's across from here. Let's see...

745
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:04,490
There. It's that house.

746
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,530
I'll wait here.

747
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,750
Go and give it to her.

748
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,730
Why? Let's go together!

749
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,310
When Madam Oh sees these clothes, she'll be really happy.

750
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,390
Don't you want to see her happy face?

751
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,450
When we go see the Jang Yoon Jeong show, I'll see it all anyway.

752
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,090
Just go and give it to her.

753
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,030
And... wait, wait.

754
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:28,090
Don't throw it to her as if you're handling a bag of chips

755
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,690
but deliver it gently.

756
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,010
Yes. I'll go quickly.

757
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,140
So she lived in that kind of place.

758
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,830
Who is this?

759
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,430
Huh?

760
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,710
What? He died?

761
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,250
Where's the morgue?

762
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,460
This punk.

763
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,600
Chairman! Chairman!

764
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,910
Did you come after your part time job?

765
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,940
All this time... were you playing with me?

766
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,740
What?

767
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,480
Did you get tired of always meeting pretty and well-off girls,

768
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,060
Since I'm a girl who's ugly,

769
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,720
uneducated and pathetic enough to have anthrophobia too...

770
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:51,020
Did you find it interesting and new, so you decided to play with me?

771
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,990
How is it, after playing with me for a few days?

772
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,790
Are you sick of it again? Or is it since you
met another smart and pretty girl again

773
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,630
do you feel like I'm really not the one?

774
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,470
How is it? What are you going to do now?

775
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,770
Now you've gotten the courage to ask?

776
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,250
That inferiority complex of yours, it's pretty considerable.

777
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:11,950
Yes, I'm asking you now because I'm foolish.

778
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,310
Answer me.

779
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,050
Let's go out. We have somewhere to go.

780
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,900
Were you lying about doing counseling with that woman

781
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,200
Even though you say you can't counsel without me?

782
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,280
You're really stupid. How did you go
to medical school with that brain?

783
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,220
It's just that I wanted to try it once because
it seemed I could maybe do it even without you.

784
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,780
What am I lacking, that I would lie to you?

785
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,480
So...

786
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,120
Was it okay?

787
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,920
No. I almost died.

788
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,140
I can't do it without you.

789
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,330
Why are you crying?

790
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,610
