1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,640
- What do you want?
- Why is this door locked, Andrew?

2
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm getting ready for school.

3
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,560
Open the door, Andrew.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,760
- Listen to me.
- No, you're drunk.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm what?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,480
Excuse me?

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,640
I said unlock the door.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,400
Andrew?

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,700
Dad, it is 7:30 in the a.m.,
and you are drunk.

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,800
Listen. You don't tell me if I'm
drunk or not, you little shit.

11
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:03,884
Aren't you?

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,440
What are you doing in there, huh?

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
- I'm filming this.
- Huh?

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,645
- What?
- I bought a camera,

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,368
and I'm filming everything
from here on out.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,440
<i>And it is yours
right now for only 46.50! Yeah!</i>

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Mom? Mom.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,920
Hey.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,760
Say hello
to my new camera for me.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,900
- Who's the audience?
- Just the millions

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,184
of people that are
watching at home.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,640
- Do I look awful?
- No, no, no, Mom.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,680
You look—
You look great.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,720
- It's a nice camera.
- Well, thanks, Mom.

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,240
So, um, should I ask
about the camera or

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Uh, I don't know.
I'm— I'm filming things now.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,480
- I'm filming everything.
- You're filming everything?

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

Have you ever read
any Arthur Schopenhauer?

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,920
No. What is Arthur Schopenhauer?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's, um-He's this philosopher
that I'm reading at the moment.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
- For school?
- No, no.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,320
Uh, basically, human beings
have to recognize themselves...

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
- as beings of pure will, right?
- Okay.

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,080
So all emotional and physical desires
can never be fulfilled.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,360
So basically you're telling me
that I should give up on life.

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,080
- Yes.
- Okay.

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,040
- Come on, man!
- Oh, God.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,520
- I'll see you later.
- All right, dude. Peace.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,760
Learning time.

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Get out of the way.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,960
- Are you not coming in?
- I'm gonna hang back a while, okay?

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,520
Uh, you're gonna be late
for first period.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah. I'll pick you up after seventh.

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,760
This is my school.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
I guess.

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,612
- Hey, you! Hey, guy.
- W-What?

59
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,064
Vote for Steve for
senior class president.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,480
- Vote for Steve.
- Yeah, I got it.

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,880
This is where I eat lunch.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Out here on the bleachers.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,000
<i>...Four, five, six, seven, eight.
And one</i>

<i>'Cause I don't wanna
see anybody pull up-That's right.</i>

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,560
<i>Way to your left. There you go, Jack.
That's right. Okay.</i>

66
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,200
<i>A cohesive unit today.</i>

67
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,120

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,240
<i>I don't want to see
any crap out there. All right?</i>

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
<i>...T-O-R-Y!</i>

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>- Whoo!
- Good job. All right.</i>

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Hi.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
Hey.

73
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,880
Could you not videotape us, please?
It's really creepy.

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Uh, no. I wasn't—

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,271
- Hi!
- This is the hallway

76
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,944
where my locker is.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,560
What is this?

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,280
What's up, Detmer?

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,760
- Wow, you should be on television.
- Man, you're on a film, man.

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,080
Pretty on camera.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,760
- Smile, man. You look pretty.
- You gonna cry? You gonna cry?

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,640
Sean, come on.
Give it back.

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,640
Huh? You want your camera?
Piece of shit from, like, 2004?

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,080
Here you go. Here she is.
In one piece.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
- Oh!
- Oh, guys.

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,200
Almost.

87
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,960
- Assholes!
- Come on!

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,560
- All right. You ready to bounce?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,560
There's a party tonight.

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,800
Okay.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Haven Hills.

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
Wait.
I thought Haven Hills was closed.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
It's abandoned, yeah.
What, you don't want to go?

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
No.

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,400
- When was the last time you went to a party?
- I don't go to parties.

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,360
- You're a senior. You are a senior.
- I don't go to parties.

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,360
- Just come.
- I'll think about it, okay?

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay.

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,240
But when we go tonight, Andrew,
can I give you, like, a pro tip?

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
What?

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Maybe leave your camera at home.

102
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
- Why?
- Because it's a little weird.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560
It serves a purpose.

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm— I'm just trying to be
a good cousin here, okay?

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,200
This is me being your friend
and telling you...

106
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,000
you should probably
not take the camera to a party.

107
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Okay.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,360
This is my street.

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,400
And those are the official
douche bags of my street.

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, great.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,480
Hey! What you doing?
Andrew!

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,720
- No, I wasn't—
- Don't film me, Detmer! Don't film me.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
Run to your house, bitch!

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
<i>This is where I eat lunch.</i>

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
<i>Out here on the bleachers.</i>

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,520
What do you want?

117
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,520
When I say open that door, you
open the door. You got it?

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,440
Finish your goddamn homework.

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,680
- Matt, are you sure it's here?
- Dude, it's here. Calm down, okay?

120
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,920
Oh, here it is.

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,680
Oh, yeah.

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
Wow. Look. A rave.

123
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, wow. Look.
A nerd with a camera.

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,150
What?

125
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,064
Just don't follow me
around all night, okay?

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,800
What do you mean? I thought— I thought
you wanted me to come with you.

127
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,480
I did. I did. But just go and do
your own thing for once, okay?

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Just... have a beer, talk to people.

129
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
I don't drink.

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,120
Hey! Hey!

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,680
Hey!

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Excuse me.
Hey! Hey, what are you filming for?

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
Oh, I don't— Um—

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
- Uh—
- What?

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,920
- I can't hear you.
- I'm just filming.

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,480
- Oh. Oh, cool. Cool. I'm filming for my blog.
- Oh.

137
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,520
- You should check it out. It's actually—
- Andrew. Andrew.

138
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,680
- Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.
- Hey.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,280
- How you doing?
- I'm good. I'm good.

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,040
This is pretty lame, right?

141
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,080
Why is it lame?

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,840
You know, Jung said
parties are just...

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,680
people's way of
seeking widespread validation.

144
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm not one to clamor
to be cool, you know.

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Wow. Way to put an analytical psychology
spin on this barn party, Matt.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
That's awesome.

147
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,160
Awesome.

148
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,080
- You're awesome.
- Hey, Matt.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Hey, what did Jung say about glow sticks?

150
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,640
You filming my girlfriend?

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Yes or no?

152
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,932
No, I— I'm not filming anything.
I'm just filming the party.

153
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:18,516
Okay

154
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,600
I should break your bitch-ass nose.
You know that?

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,640
- No, I wasn't—
- Don't talk back to me.

156
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
- Bitch.
- Okay.

157
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,200
Andrew?

158
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
Andrew.

159
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
Andrew.

160
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,280
With the camera.

161
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,520
- Can we— Can we use that thing?
- What?

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,480
We found the craziest shit,
and we gotta get it on tape.

163
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,440
- Uh, it's not—
- What's up, man?

164
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,400
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm— I'm Andrew.

165
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
Okay. I'm Steve.

166
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,520
- Steve Montgomery.
- Yeah, I know.

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,760
Really?

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,640
Matt and I were just hanging out,

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,320
and we found this cool little—

170
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,920
- This thing.
- Wait. You're with Matt?

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,560
- You might want to get it on tape.
- No, I just— I don't really—

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,520
Dude, just come on.
Just come get it on tape. It'll be cool.

173
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,760
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
- All right.
- Yeah, man.

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
You know there are, like,
tons of girls around here, right?

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,840
And you're all by yourself
next to a tree?

177
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm just really picky.

178
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,682
Listen. I really don't think—

179
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,864
Is there a light on that thing?
Like, on the camera?

180
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Uh, yeah. Here.

181
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,720
What were you guys
doing out here?

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,120
A bunch of people were out here 'cause
we were, like, obsessed with the thing.

183
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
What thing?

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
You'll see.

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh, that's— that's right!
Andrew Detmer!

186
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I remember you from homeroom,
freshman year.

187
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,160
You always had that
gray zip-up hoodie.

188
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,960
- Garetty!
- You remember that?

189
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,640
Yeah, I got a— I got a thing for faces,
which is why I'm going into politics.

190
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Ironically enough,
'cause I'm so ridiculously hi—

191
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,120
- Down here!
- Ah, there we go.

192
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
- Garetty, what's up? I see you!
- Matt!

193
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
- You see me?
- Yeah, where did everybody go?

194
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,520
They left! They left! Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

195
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,200
- Do you see that?
- Guys, what is that?

196
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,440
- Do you see it? Is that the camera?
- Yeah, I got him!

197
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,160
- Do you guys know how to get back from here?
- Is it still making that sound?

198
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,520
- Yes. Did you tell Andrew?
- Andrew, it's making that sound, dude.

199
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
Dude, come and listen to this.
Listen to this.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,120
- No, no, no, no. You gotta get in.
- Okay, okay.

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,900
You gotta get close, like
literally almost in the hole.

202
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,704
Okay, don't push me.
Just don't push me.

203
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,444
- Check this shit out.
- We're not gonna push you in.

204
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,304
We're just trying to
get it on camera.

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,280
- Listen. Can you hear that?
- Shh, shh.

206
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
What—

207
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,360
I think we got it.

208
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,160
Wait. How creepy is that?

209
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,539
Is this sound coming up?

210
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,864
I don't know. I mean, probably.
It's pretty loud, right?

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
- Hello!
- All right, dude. We're going inside.

212
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,920
- I'm going back. Come on, you guys.
- I gotta know.

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,880
Matt, seriously,
we— Hey, wait, wait. Steve!

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Steve!

215
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
Oh, shit! He's a ninja.

216
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,360
Matt—

217
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
Whoa, Matt, Matt, Matt.
What are you doing?

218
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,760
Are you serious?

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,480
- Andrew, can you give me some light?
- Matt, don't be an idiot.

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,480
Whoop! Whoop!

221
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,760
Matt! Matt, you're my ride home!

222
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Hello?

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Oh!

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,680
Smells terrible.
You guys!

225
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,400
Matt!

226
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,000
Hello?

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,267
Andrew's such a pussy.

228
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,464
All right. Does it go
down much deeper, or what?

229
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,360
- Yeah, man. It goes really, really far.
- Andrew, bring the light.

230
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,920
Look at the walls.
It's like a straight shot down.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,440
Probably already come
like 40 or 50 feet.

232
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,920
Yeah, just don't
talk about it, okay?

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,960
You ever— You ever heard of
Plato's "Allegory of the Cave"?

234
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,120
I don't know, Matt.
Let's just get this over with.

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
Oh, Shit!

236
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,560
Holy shit.

237
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,040
The hell is that?

238
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,280
Matt, I'm not kidding.
I can't breathe.

239
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,720
- Come on.
- Andrew, look at this.

240
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,160
What—

241
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Can you believe this?

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
Matt.

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,360
What am I looking at?

244
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
- Ah, shit!
- I am freaking out right now!

245
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Matt!
Can we get out of here, please?

246
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Is it showing up
on the camera like that?

247
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know, man. It's messing with it.
I don't really want to film—

248
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,640
Dude, I'll buy you a new one.

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Touch one.

250
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,760
Matt!

251
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
- Matt, look at this!
- What?

252
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Look at this!

253
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,960
Dude, what is—

254
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Dude, no way!

255
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,040
- It's changing colors!
- Oh, my God.

256
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Must be reacting to heat.

257
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,640
- I can't hear you over that—
- This is awesome.

258
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Oh! Dude, your nose!

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,880
Steve, Steve!

260
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,000
Steve!

261
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,200
Steve!

262
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,840
Matt, dude, put your phone down.
Turn it off.

263
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,160
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Steve, you too.

264
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,160
- All right.
- We have to document this.

265
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,760
- Okay. Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. I'm ready.

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
- All right. Here we go. Okay, Steve—
- What?

267
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,160
Can you move to your left?

268
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,960
- Here?
- Um, yeah. That's good.

269
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,280
And then, Matt,

270
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,560
can you just go
right in front of Steve?

271
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,840
Um—

272
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,960
- Here?
- Yeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

273
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,720
This is the ball test.

274
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,520
- You ready?
- Yep.

275
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Oh!

276
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,080
What the shit, Steve?

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,520
Get off! Get off!
What are you doing? Underhand.

278
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,400
I tried, man. I tried.

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,560
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- All right.

280
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,400
- All right. Wait, wait.
- We good?

281
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
- We said underhand, right?
- Yeah, it is underhand. Yeah.

282
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Okay.

283
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,830
Underneath.

284
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,384
I'm on you. You're not
gonna get me this time.

285
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,720
- You ready?
- Yeah.

286
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
- I'm on it. Yeah.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
Let's go.

288
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh!

289
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
Yeah!
The crowd goes wild!

290
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,120
- Yeah, I'm ready. All right.
- Matt, beam him. Beam him.

291
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
- I'm— I'm going to.
- Beam him.

292
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,760
Oh!

293
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,800
- Oh!
- No way! Shit!

294
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Wait, wait, wait.
That's great!

295
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,400
- He did it!
- I did it! I did it!

296
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,160
- That is crazy!
- Oh, my God!

297
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
- Look at it!
- Oh, my God!

298
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.

299
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, my God. Oh, dude, you're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

300
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,720
Oh, man, shit. Stop, stop, stop.
Get a tissue.

301
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,680
You did it! Yes!

302
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,280
- Oh. All right. Pop-up. Ready?
- Yeah.

303
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes!

304
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,160
- Put on the music.
- Oh, yeah.

305
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,360
Yes.

306
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,080
Yes.

307
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,560
Matt, you have— you have to pretend like you're
squeezing them together with your hands.

308
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,360
That's what I'm doing.
Look. That's what I'm doing.

309
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,680
I can't do it, dude.
I give up.

310
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,720
You do it.
You're better at this than I am.

311
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,520
Oh, really? Am I?
Really?

312
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
Just do it.

313
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,680
Oh.

314
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,880
Sick.

315
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,480
Dude, I hate you!
That's—

316
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,480
- I'm impressed, man. I am impressed.
- That's amazing.

317
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
That was awesome, dude.

318
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,840
- Oh, no!
- Come on, dude.

319
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,680
- That is not cool.
- What?

320
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
- That is not cool.
- My Legos.

321
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
<i>You've been hanging out with
those two guys for the last three weeks.</i>

322
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
- "Three weeks"
- <i>I'm not stupid</i>

323
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,720
<i>I think you're hiding something from me.
You better call me back.</i>

324
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,440
- Wow.
- <i>I love you.</i>

325
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm gonna get a brick through my window.
I am legitimately scared.

326
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,280
I have an election coming up,
and I don't have time for this.

327
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,080
Dude, why are you asking us
for advice on girls?

328
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,800
Because we're his mistress.

329
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,520
So, what, you think it's,
like, radiation or something?

330
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,880
- Radiation from what?
- Dude, it's the government.

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
What? Matt, what are
you talking about?

332
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,520
I'm feeling pretty
spelunked out actually.

333
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,160
Andrew, relax.

334
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,400
That's so weird. It looks completely
different during the day.

335
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Look. I don't care, okay?
I am not going in the hole again.

336
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,720
Asshole.

337
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
It's like sunk in or something.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,720
- There goes your old camera, dude.
- Oh, shit.

339
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,400
That's weird.
I can still feel it down there.

340
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
I can't believe
we made it out of there.

341
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,440
Well, I mean, that answers that, right?

342
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,720
Um, what does?
We still don't know what happened.

343
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
- No—
- Well, we're still alive.

344
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
- I mean, I was definitely—
- Hey!

345
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,980
You kids can't be here, okay?
You gotta move on out.

346
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:06,884
What?

347
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,200
The ground's unstable.
We're taping the whole place off.

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
Okay. We're going.

349
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
Vote for Steve!

350
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,888
New camera's working out for you.
That's good.

351
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,504
Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

352
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, smaller.
Does that shoot on tape?

353
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,271
No, it just— It, like,
records right onto the camera.

354
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
No, I just want to record all the
stuff that we can do, you know.

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah, but it's like all the time.

356
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,520
You don't feel like
it's a little weird,

357
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
like it puts a barrier between
you and everything else?

358
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,640
Uh, I don't know.

359
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Maybe I want a barrier.

360
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,000
So, like, what's up with your dad?
What's his story? What does he do?

361
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Um, my dad's a firefighter.

362
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,423
Okay. That's cool. Oh, man,
that must have been awesome—

363
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,624
Yeah, well, he was, I guess.

364
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,890
What happened?

365
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,104
Uh, I don't know. He
didn't die or anything.

366
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,560
He just— He got injured on
the job, and now he, um—

367
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
He collects the
insurance, you know.

368
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,920
Um, so he doesn't
really do anything.

369
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,640
He just— He, um— He'll go out during the
day, but I don't know where he goes.

370
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Uh, he drinks a lot.

371
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,880
I know that much.

372
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
I've actually been having
some problems with my parents too.

373
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Oh, yeah?

374
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah. I mean,
they're nothing like yours.

375
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,120
I mean, not like that—
I just— Never mind.

376
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,400
They just been fighting a lot lately.

377
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,040
And I think my mom
is actually cheating on my dad.

378
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,800
Can you not say
anything about that?

379
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,080
- Yeah. No way.
- Thanks.

380
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,560
Yes. Karen Detmer.
D-E-T-M-E-R.

381
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,120
Yes. Thank you.

382
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
She's in pain.

383
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,600
She needs something stronger.

384
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,800
Her breathing's worse.

385
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,360
Sir, she's suffering.

386
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,360
Please help me.

387
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm on disability.
I can't afford $700.

388
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,172
Please, don't put me on hold!
She can't breathe, okay?

389
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:32,564
I don't know what
to do any more.

390
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,372
Is it on?

391
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,520
Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

392
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I want to remember you like this.

393
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,600
Oh, Mom.

394
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,920
You're stronger than this.

395
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
Can you say that for me?

396
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
Please?

397
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm stronger than this.

398
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,880
Oh, nice.

399
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
All right. Here. Watch this.

400
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
- Weak.
- Hey, Matt.

401
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Yeah?

402
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Do you like me?

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,160
Um, yeah, of course.

404
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,600
I mean, you know,
I didn't—

405
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,960
- I mean, you know, I didn't always.
- What do you mean?

406
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,160
I don't know.
Like, you haven't—

407
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,480
You haven't always been
super-easy to talk to, you know.

408
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,120
I mean, I'm not saying that
you're not now. I'm just—

409
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,720
You're such an asshole.

410
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,320
That's what I'm talking about, dude.
You're hostile, see?

411
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,920
Better.

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
- Hey, Matt.
- Yeah?

413
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,800
Do you ever think about, like,

414
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,400
doing more with it?

415
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
What, with this?

416
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,040
Not really.

417
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,360
Why? What else is there?

418
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,040
- "Telekinesis."
- Yes. Do tell.

419
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,920
"The ability to move, lift, vibrate"—

420
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,440
That's my favorite.

421
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,240
"Spin, bend, break or impact objects...

422
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,080
"through the direct influence of mental
power or other nonphysical means."

423
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,560
- Okay.
- Sounds familiar.

424
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,280
- It does sound familiar.
- Very familiar.

425
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,480
You want to see direct influence?

426
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,080
Andrew.

427
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,840
She's wearing black today.

428
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
- Hi.
- That's direct influence.

429
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
This is my theory though
is that it's like a muscle.

430
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,720
Like, it's elastic. If you stretch
it too far, too quick, it'll tear.

431
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,280
Ew.

432
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
That's why I think we're
getting stronger, you know,

433
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,520
because we're working it out,
getting buff.

434
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,480
Buff.

435
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,520
How about this for a workout?

436
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Holy shit!

437
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,320
That was awesome.

438
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Classy.

439
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Mm-hmm. Attractive.

440
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,240
I think it's time we took this
out of the backyard.

441
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,240
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Right here. This is perfect.

442
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Really? This is it.

443
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,040
Matt. Yah!

444
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
Let's get this one.

445
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,680
Whoa! Hey! Hello!

446
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,280
- Hey, what—
- Andrew.

447
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,480
Help! Somebody grab that!

448
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

449
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,413
Okay, I'll get the top.
I'll get the top.

450
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:42,384
Got it. Got it.

451
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,280
- Let's get the legs.
- Okay. Wait.

452
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm flying!

453
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,600
She's just looking at it.

454
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,440
What you looking at, girl?
Stay in school!

455
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,050
Okay, see the guy
chewing the gum?

456
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:54,544
I'm gonna get the gum and pull
it right out of his mouth.

457
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,280
Okay, I got him.

458
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh!

459
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are we running?
We don't need to run.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,560
- Five—
- I don't want to do it.

461
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
- Four—
- Dude, I don't want to do it.

462
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,058
You're creating a scene.
I don't want to do it.

463
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:12,910
Come on, Matt. Don't
be a bitch about it.

464
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,360
- Just do it.
- Put your hand on the table.

465
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,420
- Okay. Are you ready? Do it.
- Give me a countdown.

466
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,480
- I will. I promi—
- Ow!

467
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,040
Oh, snap!

468
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
- Like I said—
- You gotta pay for that now.

469
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,964
- Like I said. See?
- Holy crap.

470
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,160
Man!

471
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:29,843
Just pretend that there's a barrier
over your hand, right? And then—

472
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,710
Mm-hmm.

473
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,624
When things are gonna hit
you, as long as you're ready,

474
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,640
- they will not hurt you because of the barrier.
- That's so sick.

475
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,040
- That's me right there. I need that.
- Steve, Steve, you have to try this, dude.

476
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,600
Give me your hand.

477
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,720
When I was a kid though, I actually— I
actually did want to be a police officer.

478
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,720
- A cop? No shit?
- Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
You do know that you can't smoke
weed when you're a cop, right, Matt?

480
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,480
Oh, no. Really?
Uh, I didn't know.

481
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,920
Uh, but, no, I-I-I just—
I really got into, like, altruism.

482
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,560
What does that mean?
What does "altruism" mean, Matt?

483
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,600
It's like wanting to make things
better for everyone.

484
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Really? This coming from the man who is
always talking about how pointless life is.

485
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah, I know, but this is what
I've been thinking about lately.

486
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,200
Like, I'm looking back,
and I just think...

487
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,880
the way I used to think about things
was probably a lot better, you know.

488
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,240
So, what, you want to go out and
start a charity or something?

489
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
- That's lame.
- Wait. Why is that lame?

490
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,640
Uh, I don't know.

491
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,960
Douche bag.

492
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm not good at everything.
I just do my best at everything.

493
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,640
All right?
That's what it's about.

494
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
I mean, you talk about philosophy
and shit all the time,

495
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,560
but what has he really done, hmm?

496
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,120
Have you even applied
to colleges yet?

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,080
No, but I'm getting—
I'm getting to it.

498
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920
Yeah, well, you should get to it.
I'm just saying.

499
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:46,504
I am.

500
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,160
You could use some of that.

501
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
You could use some "Shut the
hell up." How about that?

502
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,426
You just lack initiative.
It's not that big—

503
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,944
Oh, yeah? You lack a dick.

504
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,160
Boys, please tell us
what's going on here.

505
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,440
Uh, well, it would seem that a
Virgin Mary has appeared...

506
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,160
in the syrup of a
local man's pancake.

507
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,200
No, it has not.

508
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,760
Uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
Just hold on.

509
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,160
Oh, that is definitely some
supernatural shit going on here.

510
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,680
Um, excuse me.
Can you come here real quick?

511
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,240
Um, can you just look at that?

512
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,920
¡Ay, Dios mío!

513
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
Grounder.
Too much pressure.

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,960
Andrew.

515
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,440
Oh, dude. Come on.
Leave her alone.

516
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,040
Oh, seriously?

517
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,800
Dude!

518
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,440
Oh, come on.
That is so messed up.

519
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,080
- She's gonna get fired.
- I didn't know—

520
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,560
- That is disgusting.
- But do you guys share cups on the team?

521
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,840
No, we don't share cups, man.

522
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,680
You see that car though?

523
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,400
- The red one.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,440
All right.
The gum was cool.

525
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,120
All right. You tried.
It was a failed attempt though.

526
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,960
Watch this.

527
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
- What are you doing?
- Watch.

528
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,800
Go, go, go.

529
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,200
What?

530
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,200
No way!

531
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,480
Holy shit!

532
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,480
Dude! Holy crap!

533
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
What? What?

534
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,800
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Did anybody see?

535
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Steve Montgomery for president!

536
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,080
- I'm having, like, a face period.
- Oh, man.

537
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
Pause.

538
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,240
You guys.
You guys, here she comes.

539
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,720
- Here she comes!
- Oh—

540
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,560
Don't look.
Don't look, don't look.

541
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,160
Steve, don't look.

542
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,480
She can't find—
She thinks it's stolen.

543
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,080
- She has no idea.
- Yes, it was the black guy this time.

544
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,480
"I could have sworn I parked it right here.
Where is my car?"

545
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
Ignore us.

546
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,360
We're just... Mormons.

547
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,320
What does that mean?

548
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,520
What does that mean?

549
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,880
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

550
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,320
Garetty's—
Garetty's having a giggle fit.

551
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,360
That was so—
It was amazing.

552
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,720
I know. Just take it easy
with the merchandise.

553
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,480
How did nobody see that?
It was out in the open.

554
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Her face! I cannot get
her face out of my mind!

555
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,080
That was awesome.

556
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,480
Who is this?

557
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,080
So many ideas
of stuff that we can do!

558
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
- Go around.
- That's just some redneck asshole.

559
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,166
- Go around.
- Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.

560
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,664
Take the camera. Take the camera.

561
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,080
All right. Just make sure
it's zoomed out all the way.

562
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,360
- Got ya. I can see you.
- Okay, buddy.

563
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
What you gonna do?

564
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,560
What the hell
is this guy's problem?

565
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,400
What are you doing?

566
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Abracadabra!

567
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Andrew, shit!

568
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,240
What the hell did you just do?
Matt, stop the car! Stop! Stop!

569
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,030
Are you crazy?

570
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:51,064
Pull down the road. We gotta
go down there right now.

571
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
Guys, I'm sorry!

572
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,960
What did you do?
Why did you do that?

573
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,840
I didn't mean to.
I didn't—

574
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,080
Shit! What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at this!

575
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
- Will you just calm down!
- The guy's probably still in there!

576
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,040
I'm sorry, okay?

577
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,360
- Andrew, stop, stop!
- But I can— I can help!

578
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,680
- I can get him out.
- Stop doing things!

579
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,120
Steve! Steve!

580
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,240
Steve, be careful!

581
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,320
Shit! Shit!

582
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,920
Oh, my God, Andrew.
Are you kidding me?

583
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,360
Steve!

584
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,320
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

585
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Goddamn it!

586
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,040
Steve!

587
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,760
Andrew! Oh—

588
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
Shit!

589
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,680
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!

590
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,360
Oh, Matt, he's got him!
He's got him. He's got—

591
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,000
Help me.

592
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll get in back of him.

593
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Get him up.

594
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,040
Hang on. Steve, stay with him.
I'm gonna go get some help.

595
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,360
- Are you calling the cops?
- Yeah, yeah.

596
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,560
- Will you stop? I can't hear them.
- Will you hang up the phone?

597
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,328
Yeah. It's just down past,
uh, White Crescent Bridge.

598
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:13,024
Matt, he's fine.

599
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,800
- Matt, he's fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,520
- Fine, Matt!
- Stop! Stop! I can't hear—

601
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,680
Hey!

602
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,480
Hey! Hey! Over here!

603
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,428
...peeled off the road and went
straight through the guardrail.

604
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:25,424
Hey, is that on?

605
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,241
...This is a
game or something?

606
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,624
I don't understand how
you guys can be so angry.

607
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,160
You don't understand
how we can be angry?

608
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,080
Andrew, you— you put somebody
in the hospital tonight, okay?

609
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Do you understand that?

610
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,480
Andrew, look at me.
You put a guy in the hospital!

611
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,480
How do you feel about that?
You hurt somebody!

612
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,120
- Shit.
- We need rules, okay?

613
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,440
Rule number one:
No using it on living things.

614
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,600
Rule number two: You can't use it
when you're angry. That's it.

615
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,560
Rule number three: I
don't think we should be

616
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,504
using it in public or
telling anybody about it.

617
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
- Look, you can't just declare rules, okay?
- I will declare rules—

618
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,114
You're the one that said
that nothing matters.

619
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,064
I will declare rules.

620
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,080
If we're gonna keep going, and we're
getting stronger, we need rules.

621
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,680
We need rules, right?

622
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
Matt's right. We need rules.

623
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,320
Andrew! Answer the goddamn phone!

624
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,320
Andrew!

625
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,280
Matt, what did he say?

626
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,400
Are you still mad at me?

627
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,800
- No, I'm not mad.
- Well, you seem mad.

628
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm not mad. I just—

629
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,920
I just think that we need to be more
careful now, you know? We can't—

630
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,432
We have to think a little bit more.
We can't just do things.

631
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:49,024
We have to think first, okay?

632
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,520
- I understand.
- Okay.

633
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,360
Why is Steve out in the boonies?

634
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,920
Where are we?

635
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Steve?

636
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
His car's right there.

637
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,240
Yeah. Steve, where you at?

638
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,120
Steve!

639
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,200
"Look up."

640
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,160
Hello, boys.

641
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,840
What?

642
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,680
- What is up?
- No. No.

643
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Wait, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
Check me out. Hear me out.

644
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,480
- You're flying!
- Holy shit!

645
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,712
- Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out.
- No way!

646
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:22,744
- No way!
- Hear me out.

647
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,920
What are you doing?

648
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's much easier than it looks. I swear.
It's much easier than it looks.

649
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
Oh, my God, dude.

650
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,058
- Make sure you catch yourself. Don't try..
- I got it.

651
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,904
- ..and jump, or you'll just flip yourself
- I got it. I got it.

652
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,560
- Come on, Matt. Come on.
- All right.

653
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, shit!

654
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,720
Oh, man!

655
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,360
- Eating dirt, man.
- Why don't you get behind me?

656
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,560
- You were in my way.
- What do you mean?

657
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
Think Harrier jet.
Think Harrier jet.

658
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh, man.

659
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,400
- Goddamn it!
- Are you okay?

660
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,960
- I'm watching.
- Just let me concentrate.

661
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,160
- Focus! Focus!
- Okay! Hold on.

662
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,080
Is that your focus face?

663
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,640
Oh, my God, dude.

664
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
- Whoo!
- Bullshit!

665
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,720
- I'm up! I'm up!
- Are you kidding me?

666
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,600
- Holy crap!
- Hold it! Hold it!

667
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,680
- Oh, my God, dude. I am doing it.
- Holy crap, dude.

668
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,920
- Yeah!
- That's it, man. You're doing it.

669
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Whoo-hoo!

670
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,940
Okay. Okay.

671
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:18,304
Andrew, don't fart. We'll
never find you again.

672
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,200
Steve, stop me.
Stop me, stop me.

673
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,840
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa.

674
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,360
- You are flying now.
- You guys look so cute together.

675
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,450
Whoa!

676
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:28,384
I'm coming up. I'm
bringing the camera, okay?

677
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,120
All right.

678
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,280
All right.
How do we get down?

679
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,240
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

680
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,800
Andrew!
It's freezing up here!

681
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,680
I can't hear you.

682
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,280
Activate hyperdrive!

683
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Whoo!

684
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,840
Where the hell are we?

685
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,480
- Catch up! Let's go!
- What?

686
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,960
Whoo! This is insane!

687
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,600
Whoo-hoo!

688
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,520
- Dude!
- All right, Andrew!

689
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,240
Whoo!

690
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,400
- Tag, you're it!
- Watch out.

691
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,360
- Pump the brakes!
- Whoa! Aah!

692
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,680
Hey, Matt! You're finally
good at something!

693
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,400
It's so easy! Yeah!

694
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,800
- Aah!
- Yeah!

695
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,160
Whoo!

696
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,440
Whoa!

697
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,920
Got it!

698
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,560
Tebow time, baby!

699
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Yeah!

700
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,200
- Oh!
- Nice hands, Steve!

701
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,920
- Touchdown!
- Throw it back to Daddy!

702
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,200
Oh, dude. Nice catch, man! Yes!

703
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,680
- Steve! Go deep!
- Hey, Matt!

704
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,600
Do you hear that?

705
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,640
What is that?

706
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
Whoa! Steve!

707
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,120
Oh, shit. Almost died, dude.
Holy shit. Holy shit.

708
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,000
Almost died, man! Almost—

709
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,200
Andrew, you saved my life!

710
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
Oh, my God.
You saved my life!

711
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,240
Oh, God, you saved my life!

712
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
Oh, my God!

713
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,800
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

714
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,440
Is that the camera?
You saved me and the camera?

715
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,480
Please tell me you got that on tape!
You have to—

716
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,440
Ah, shit.

717
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
What the hell—
We're alive!

718
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,120
- What do you mean? The hell happened?
- You didn't see what happened?

719
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,280
Oh, shit! Andrew!
Andrew! You're a genius!

720
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,280
We got to see this! Holy—

721
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,400
All right. Oh. Holy shit.

722
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,160
Wait. Oh, God!
We're on the ground. Yes!

723
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
Whoo!

724
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,200
We have broken history!

725
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,240
I mean, I'm talking about
since the caveman times.

726
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,040
Uh, the Egyptians,
the Wright brothers.

727
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,520
Come here, Matt. Come here.
Get in here. Get in.

728
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,880
Say it. "I can fly."

729
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,840
- I can fly.
- I can fly!

730
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,280
- Oh, come on.
- Say it with your chest!

731
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,880
- I can fly!
- Say it, Matt.

732
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,200
- Shout it out!
- I can fly!

733
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,120
I can fly! I can fly!

734
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
I tried to save you, man.
Andrew was just quicker.

735
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
How does that go again?

736
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,560
We almost died.

737
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,120
- Oh, please.
- Gestures—

738
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
How does she
not notice though?

739
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,200
Come on.
Let's be serious, guys.

740
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,880
She definitely noticed
that it's gotten better.

741
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,760
- You just gotta be, you know—
- Yeah?

742
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,320
You just gotta be subtle.

743
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,520
That is so cool.

744
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
Dude. And I haven't
had sex since summer.

745
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,320
I haven't had sex since ever.

746
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
- Really?
- Really?

747
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,360
- That is completely unacceptable.
- Well—

748
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,440
How are you guys so cool?
How are you guys so cool, man?

749
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,120
Liquid nitrogen.

750
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,040
Hey, guys?

751
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,880
Guys? You guys up?

752
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,720
Yeah.

753
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,800
Hey, uh—
Today was like—

754
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,160
It was like, I think,
the best day of my life.

755
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,640
Like, I mean—

756
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,960
I'm thinking about it,
and I can't think of any day...

757
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,120
that I liked better
than today, you know?

758
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,920
I really— I think it was.

759
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah.

760
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,600
Unanimous.

761
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,960
Yes.

762
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,480
Okay. Good.

763
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,520
Okay, check this out.
Say what you want,

764
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,480
but I'm thinking about booking it
to Maui for the weekend.

765
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,920
- What's up with that?
- Seriously?

766
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, we could do it. I mean,
I was thinking the same thing,

767
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,720
except I've always
wanted to go to Tibet.

768
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,840
- Why Tibet?
- Tibet?

769
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,400
Yeah. I don't know.

770
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,240
It seems really beautiful,
you know, with all the—

771
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Will you shut up? Shut—

772
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,960
- The monuments and mountains, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

773
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,600
I don't know. And the monks have achieved
such a high level of enlightenment...

774
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
that they can, like,
float and shit, you know?

775
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,689
So we would fit right in.

776
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:06,144
We could really mess
with their heads as well.

777
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,200
Yeah, but, like, seriously,
I think we should go.

778
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,440
It would be really cool.
Peaceful.

779
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,960
No, I think it's a really good idea.
I actually would like to go.

780
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm down.
You down, Steve?

781
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,760
What—
I-I don't know, man.

782
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,000
There's no bikinis in Tibet.
So I don't know if I'm down with that.

783
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,600
- It was brilliant. Oh, it was so amazing.
- She might have lost her job.

784
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,840
Oh, shit, dude.
I got my mom's birthday. I gotta go.

785
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,720
- It's Aunt Deb's birthday today?
- Yeah. I gotta go. I gotta go.

786
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,960
- Tell her I said hi.
- Later, Matt.

787
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,680
All right, what do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go?

788
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,200
I don't know. I mean,
I don't want to go home.

789
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,760
Oh, do you want
to go into the city?

790
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,013
Nah, it's rush hour, bro.
It's gonna be so much traffic.

791
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,664
So what?

792
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,442
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Duh! Let's go.

793
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,840
Oh, hey. Sorry, I just—

794
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,360
Hi.

795
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
Do you mind if I film you?

796
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,400
Uh, a little bit. I don't really
like being on camera actually.

797
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Well, maybe it's,
like, exposure therapy.

798
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Yeah. No, I just came by
to give you something actually.

799
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,720
- You did?
- Yeah.

800
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
What?

801
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
I was watching your, um—

802
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,680
Your-your— you know, your blog?

803
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,320
There's a drought
in the Central African Republic, right?

804
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,520
Yeah. So I saw that and I thought it
seems pretty cool, and it's cheap too,

805
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,120
so I thought why not?

806
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,000
- Totally.
- Yeah.

807
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, I can tell that
you're really global and big picture,

808
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,720
- concerned about that kind of stuff.
- Yeah.

809
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,200
You know, Matt, you can
just mail this yourself.

810
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm not your mom.

811
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,560
Okay. I mean, I just—

812
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,480
What is this?
Is this, like, the new you?

813
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,960
You got too smart to have fun
in eighth grade. So now what?

814
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
No.

815
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,600
Casey, Casey, Casey,
Casey, Casey, Casey.

816
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,200
Listen, listen. Can I
just talk to you for a second?

817
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,240
- Can I just tell you something?
- Mm-hmm.

818
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,080
I just— I-I—

819
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,880
I just want you to know
I'm not, you know, who I was— now.

820
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,800
You know, I'm cool.
I'm just—

821
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,760
You're cool?

822
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,400
High school popularity just seemed
like this weird backward contest,

823
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,360
and I thought since
I knew that, I could just—

824
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,640
That made you better
than everybody else.

825
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,840
No. No, no, no.

826
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,200
- I know what you mean.
- I would separate myself from that.

827
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
- I get it.
- You get it?

828
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,960
Mm-hmm.

829
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,920
I know it sounds weird.
I just wanted you to know that.

830
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
To know that you're cool.

831
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,400
Wow, I really screwed this up.

832
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,960
Not as much
as you might think.

833
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,320
- Really?
- Good-bye.

834
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
- Casey—
- I gotta go. Bye.

835
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,360
Come on.

836
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,400
Dude! When did you
start doing this?

837
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,880
- Like, since when?
- What, with the camera?

838
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
- Yes, with the camera.
- Um—

839
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,320
I don't know. It's been
a little while, I guess.

840
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
See— Oh.
I can't do that.

841
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,440
I can't do stuff
that requires finesse.

842
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,640
I tried to type my name out yesterday,
and I cracked my keyboard in half.

843
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,880
No, dude. It's really easy.
You just— You think that you're holding it.

844
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,940
Mom's, like, never home any more.

845
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,060
I mean, you saw how my dad is.
He's just... quiet.

846
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,500
Sits around.

847
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,780
And it's pointless to talk to him about it
'cause he's got... nothing to say.

848
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,980
See, it's different,
'cause you've always had friends,

849
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,420
and people want to talk to you
and be around you.

850
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,420
I never had any of that.
I mean, before this,

851
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,140
I barely even hung out with
Matt, and he's my cousin.

852
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,060
We were close when
we were little, but—

853
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,300
I don't know. In high
school, everything changed.

854
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,180
Ever been
to the Space Needle?

855
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,940
Yep. When I was, like, five.

856
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,020
It's for tourists.

857
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,340
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I went, um—

858
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,700
I think I was, like, seven—

859
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,660
With my dad one time and—

860
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,260
I don't know. It was
actually a really good day.

861
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,900
You remember that?

862
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,888
Yeah. Actually, I do.

863
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,340
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you.

864
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,820
Winter break is coming up.

865
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,540
You should do the
talent show with me.

866
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,180
No way.

867
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,380
Why not? It'd be good for you
to get out there, you know.

868
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,820
- Meet some people, meet some girls.
- Dude, I'm not— it's just not—

869
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,140
What? Look, I'm just
really shy, okay?

870
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,780
And I don't—
I don't even have any talents, so—

871
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,900
What are you talking about, you
don't have— You have talent.

872
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,460
You've got talent.

873
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,100
Oh, dude, no way.

874
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,660
You look handsome.

875
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,860
Thanks, yes. Steve—

876
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:05,900
Let me borrow some of his clothes
to make me look cool or whatever.

877
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,900
I'm glad you're spending
so much time with your friends.

878
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,260
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

879
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,620
- Hey.
- What?

880
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,060
How are you getting to school?

881
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,580
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't bullshit me, you idiot.

882
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,380
Matt doesn't come.
He doesn't drive up.

883
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,580
You leave the house. Who the
hell's giving you rides to school?

884
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,780
- M-Matt.
- All right. You know what?

885
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,020
You're lying.

886
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,140
You're up to something,
and you can't hide it.

887
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,580
You think
you can just slink, hmm?

888
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,900
Sneak in, sneak around
my house, smiling?

889
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,380
I'm onto your shit.

890
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,500
How do you
even work this stupid thing?

891
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,340
Ah! And we're in business.

892
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,940
La, la, la, la, la!

893
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,020
Boo!

894
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,180
- Hey.
- Hi.

895
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,460
Um, what are you doing here?

896
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,540
I'm filming for the talent show.

897
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,064
Matt Garetty is filming
for the talent show.

898
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:51,144
Yes, I am.

899
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,580
Wow.

900
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,340
What is this, some kind of
newfound school spirit?

901
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,260
How do you like it, huh?
Being on camera?

902
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,300
- I actually don't mind being on camera.
- Oh. Here we go.

903
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,020
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
now coming to the stage—</i>

904
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,220
- Um, hello?
- <i>Steve Montgomery.</i>

905
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,100
You're probably gonna
want to get this on camera.

906
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,980
C.V. High, you guys ready
for a talent show?

907
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,020
All my underclassmen, come on.
Make some noise. That's not loud enough.

908
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,900
How about my upperclassmen?
Come on. Make some noise!

909
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,060
Yeah, Steve!

910
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,940
Let me hear it from my
seniors, class of 2012!

911
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,340
Yeah. Shh.

912
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,260
Now I want you guys to give it up for the
young and very talented Mr. Andrew Detmer.

913
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,133
- And you're on.
- Oh, My God.

914
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,086
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh.

915
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,464
Look at your cousin in his little suit.

916
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,021
Really?

917
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,304
Matt, What's he doing?

918
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,979
Just watch.

919
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,780
Good luck!

920
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,300
Show us some talent!

921
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,540
Fifty-two Pickup!
Pick 'em up!

922
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,900
No way!

923
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,140
Yeah!

924
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,820
Whoo!

925
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,100
Go, Andrew!

926
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,260
What? What?

927
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,980
- Are they gonna walk on that?
- What do you think?

928
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,580
- Whoa.
- He's got it. He's got it.

929
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,940
Easy.

930
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,540
Yeah, you got it.

931
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,820
Holy crap!

932
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,820
Yeah! Cakewalk!

933
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,740
Give it up, give it up, give it up!

934
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,380
Oh, my God. Andrew
is so amazing.

935
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,660
Whoa!

936
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,700
Give it up! Let's go!

937
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,860
- Seriously, how are they doing this?
- I don't know.

938
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,380
Magic.

939
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Whoo!

940
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,860
- That was amazing!
- Yeah!

941
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,500
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Andrew!

942
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,213
Oh, my God. I can
see your head is,

943
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,828
- like, exploding right now.
- What?

944
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,540
This is the beginning of your downfall.
Hubris. Right there.

945
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,500
- What's hubris?
- Ha, ha, ha.

946
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,060
- No, what does hubris mean, Matt?
- Seriously?

947
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,100
- What does "seriously" mean?
- What? I'm—

948
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,020
- Get in there.
- Don't push me, dude. I'm going.

949
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,060
Your fans await.
You're the man of the hour.

950
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,420
- Look at this house!
- Oh, sick!

951
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,780
- Dude, this place looks huge.
- I know.

952
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,060
- It's enormous.
- Dude.

953
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,580
Matt! Andrew!

954
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,300
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Steve! Oh, my God!

955
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,295
Everybody's freaking out.

956
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,124
Come on, man. Everybody's
been waiting for you.

957
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,260
V.I.P. coming through.
Coming through!

958
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Andrew Copperfield
coming through!

959
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,460
Make way, make way.

960
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,780
Matt, come this way.
Drew, over here.

961
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,740
Andrew Detmer's
in the house!

962
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,180
- How are you feeling?
- I'm-I'm— I'm doing good.

963
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,940
- Yeah? Are you sure? Are you sure?
- Hey. Hey.

964
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,940
Hello.
Andrew.

965
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,620
- Magic is so hot.
- Oh, wow. Thanks.

966
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,940
- So, do you not remember me at all?
- Um—

967
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,780
- Monica, right? Monica.
- Yes!

968
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,580
...Setting the camera down.
I'm setting the camera down.

969
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,660
- What—
- Oh.

970
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,740
Oh. Excuse me.

971
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,380
Have you ever played that, over there?

972
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,940
Uh, no. I have never
played that, over there.

973
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,660
- No?
- Never.

974
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,940
- I bet you're good at it.
- Uh—

975
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,950
What, you just throw
the ball into the cups?

976
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,604
Yep.

977
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,257
I actually could be good

978
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,684
- at that right now.
- Yeah?

979
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,100
- Maybe.
- Let's find out.

980
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,420
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on!

981
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,940
- What?
- Come on.

982
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,420
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

983
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,620
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

984
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,460
There you are.

985
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,460
Amazing.

986
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,460
That's what I'm talking about.

987
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,580
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

988
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,220
Hey, where is Andrew anyway?

989
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,020
Oh.

990
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,940
Andrew's upstairs with the girl
with the pink hair.

991
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,700
What, like, they went together?

992
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,020
That's my boy. Of course they went together.
What are you talking 'bout?

993
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,300
Hey, Andrew.
I hope you're seeing this.

994
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,500
Congratulations, sir.

995
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,420
I just wanted you to know, dude—

996
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,180
I was really worried about you
before all this, you know?

997
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,900
But, dude, things are gonna get
so much better for you now.

998
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,540
I really, really feel that.

999
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,500
And I want you to know
I love you, you know?

1000
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,180
I love you, man.
It's you and me.

1001
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,340
It's Detmer and Garetty,
extended family for life.

1002
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,500
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- No, man. Excuse yourself.

1003
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,660
Oh, man.

1004
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,067
When did I become the
one who's out here...

1005
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,624
- Hey, Matt.
- ...filming myself—

1006
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,260
Oh, hey. Hey, Casey.

1007
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,180
So what are you filming?

1008
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,060
Uh, it's just a thing.

1009
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,740
It's not like
eye of the storm or anything.

1010
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,140
Hey, I wanted to—
I wanted to tell you...

1011
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,660
I've really been—
It's been making me think a lot.

1012
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,060
I've been kind of
thinking about it in my—

1013
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,060
No, I have. Like, in my life.

1014
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,660
I've been thinking, if I applied myself,
what I could do.

1015
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,860
I could really—
I could change the world.

1016
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,620
- I mean, it's really been—
- You're drunk.

1017
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,300
What?

1018
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:08,709
Hey, Casey?

1019
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:13,460
I've basically been stalking you
since, like, sophomore year.

1020
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,740
Sorry, use of the word "stalking."
I shouldn't have said—

1021
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,460
You want to get out of here?

1022
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,980
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1023
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,540
Yes. Yes, definitely.

1024
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,820
Uh, I-I have to drop off
the camera first though.

1025
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,540
Okay, you guys are getting ready
to witness history, all right?

1026
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,500
I'm like a proud dad right now
because behind these doors,

1027
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,020
Andrew Detmer becomes a man.

1028
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,300
He's a little boy behind there.
He's scared.

1029
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,940
He's like a butterfly,
getting ready to emerge—

1030
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,380
- Oh, God!
- From a cocoon or some shit like that.

1031
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Disgusting weirdo!

1032
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
- Wait. What happened?
- Ha-ha. Okay—

1033
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,460
- Is that—
- Out of my way now!

1034
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,820
- Oh, man.
- Monica, what happened?

1035
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,900
Drew! Drew! It's okay, man.
Don't worry about it.

1036
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,843
Look, it happens to the

1037
00:52:57,868 --> 00:52:58,804
- best of us, okay?
- Dude!

1038
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,420
You had
a little too much to drink—

1039
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,420
- You—
- Oh. Oh. Whoa, buddy.

1040
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,340
- The hell's going on, dude?
- Why are you laughing?

1041
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,980
- Aw, man.
- All over my jacket.

1042
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,420
- Stop. Stop laughing.
- What are you talking about?

1043
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,540
- It's cool, man.
- No, it's not cool, Steve. Stop.

1044
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,540
- Stop what? It's cool, man.
- Will you just get out of here?

1045
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,260
- Get out! What's your problem?
- Drew, Drew!

1046
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,980
- You think this is funny?
- No, I'm not laughing—

1047
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,020
Get out!

1048
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,260
Dad!

1049
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,140
Andrew! Please!
I need my medicine.

1050
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,860
Mom's in pain, all right?
She needs her pills! Where are you?

1051
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,940
Where are you?

1052
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,540
Dad!

1053
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:23,460
Hoarding a $500 camera while your mom dies
in there? I mean, how selfish can you be?

1054
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,220
I went through your camera.

1055
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,140
What did you see?

1056
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,660
Just you being a loser.

1057
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
You think that those people
are your friends?

1058
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,220
Huh? They're not.

1059
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,020
You're an embarrassment.

1060
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,900
You're running around this town,
spending my money.

1061
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,540
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

1062
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,780
I didn't spend any
of your money, Richard.

1063
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,860
'Cause I don't have
a dime to spend.

1064
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,460
Every last cent—
Look at me!

1065
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,060
- Every last cent goes to school for you
- School?

1066
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,220
- And medication for your mother.
- I go to a public school!

1067
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,009
- I can't even...
- You don't pay...

1068
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:06,033
- ...pay for a goddamn—
- ...for a public school, you idiot!

1069
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,820
What did you call me?

1070
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,580
Did you call me
an idiot, you shit?

1071
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,820
Did you call me an idiot? Huh?

1072
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,460
You piece of shit!

1073
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,700
Get up. I said get up!

1074
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,020
Get up!

1075
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,500
- I could crush you, you know that?
- Stop it!

1076
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,100
- Crush you!
- Get—

1077
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,189
So Matt's been in the bathroom
for, like, 20 minutes...

1078
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,691
after spending the night at my house.

1079
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,527
Yes. It happened.

1080
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:06,113
So we're just gonna sneak
into the bathroom...

1081
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,782
and catch this moment for posterity.

1082
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,127
- Oh, my God, Matt.
- Oh.

1083
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,967
Can we not do the camera thing
right now, please?

1084
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:18,247
What happened?

1085
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:21,647
Uh— It just started
out of nowhere.

1086
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:25,807
My head hurts really bad.

1087
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:29,687
That's probably Steve
calling your cell again.

1088
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:31,247
I'll call him back later.

1089
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:33,167
I think it's time to take—

1090
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,726
- Matt! Matt! Come on!
- Oh, wow. I did not...

1091
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,727
- ...expect this.
- Give me my—

1092
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:37,811
Whoa!

1093
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:47,967
Hey! Hey, asshole!

1094
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:49,407
What are you doing up here?

1095
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:51,167
Just leave me alone, Steve!

1096
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:53,607
You can't be up here, dude.
This isn't safe.

1097
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,327
I don't want to talk to anyone.

1098
00:56:55,407 --> 00:56:57,527
Bro! What are you
doing up here?

1099
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,287
Leave me alone!

1100
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,607
How did you find me?

1101
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:05,127
I don't know, man.
My nose was bleeding.

1102
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:06,767
I heard your voice
or something like—

1103
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:08,687
What the hell
happened to your face?

1104
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:10,607
Nothing, man.
Just leave me alone.

1105
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:13,327
No, dude, that's not nothing.
That— Your dad!

1106
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:16,007
Your dad beat the shit out of you.
He can't do that to you now.

1107
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:18,327
Will you stop acting
like you give a shit?

1108
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:21,887
Dude. Why are you talking to me like this?
I'm your best friend.

1109
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:23,727
I don't have any friends!

1110
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,887
You were never my friend
before any of this.

1111
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,687
I hang out with you and Matt,
like, every day!

1112
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:32,727
We're supposed to fly around the world
together. Don't you— Do you remember that?

1113
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:35,247
- You think I'm—
- Stop! Just stop talking to me!

1114
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,607
- Why won't you just leave me alone?
- Come on, man.

1115
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,047
Steve, I'm telling you, get away from me!

1116
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:43,247
Get away from me now!
Please!

What are you doing?
You filming graves?

1127
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,327
- I don't get it.
- What do you care?

1128
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:44,007
You haven't been returning my calls.
Why aren't you returning my calls?

1129
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:46,287
- I've been busy.
- No, you haven't.

1130
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:47,847
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

1131
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:49,407
I just don't feel like talking.

1132
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,487
- Turn off the camera.
- No.

1133
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,687
Andrew. Andrew, turn off the camera.

1134
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:57,167
Andrew? How did he
get struck by lightning...

1135
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:59,487
during a storm with no
recorded lightning strikes?

1136
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,007
How?

1137
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:04,047
And they found Steve
out in the middle of a field.

1138
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,127
Why would Steve go out in the middle of a
field during a lightning storm, Andrew?

1139
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,447
- I don't know.
- Why? What?

1140
00:59:08,527 --> 00:59:10,167
I don't know
what happened, Matt!

1141
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,847
I don't believe you, okay?
I don't believe you.

1142
00:59:11,967 --> 00:59:13,383
- I want you to turn off the camera...
- No!

1143
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,231
- ...and talk to me.
- Why?

1144
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:15,343
'Cause I want to have a
conversation with you.

1145
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,031
Don't tell me
what to do, Matt.

1146
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:19,287
You can't tell me what to do!
Don't ever tell—

1147
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:21,167
- Give me— Shut it off!
- Get off of me!

1148
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:27,527
Andrew—
Are you joking right now?

1149
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,447
Is this a joke to you? I—

1150
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,087
What did you do, Andrew?

1151
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,847
What did you do?

1152
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,527
Who am I supposed
to tell about this?

1153
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:45,607
Who do I talk to?
Who do I talk to about this?

1154
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:48,687
Why won't you just tell me
what happened, Andrew?

1155
01:00:01,687 --> 01:00:03,927
Please believe me, Steve.

1156
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,127
Please, it's just I—

1157
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:09,087
I don't know what I did. I—

1158
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:11,407
I lost control, and—

1159
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:14,007
And I'm so sorry.

1160
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:18,927
This thing is just becoming
a part of me now,

1161
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:20,687
and I don't—

1162
01:00:21,927 --> 01:00:23,407
I miss you, Steve.

1163
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,327
<i>...all the drills. Good.
We're all pretty good, right?</i>

1164
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:18,847
<i>Get ready. Go!</i>

1165
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:21,047
<i>You guys? Do not hesitate.</i>

1166
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:25,647
Did you hear who worked?

1167
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:34,087
He was like—

1168
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:38,287
Oh! Oh, Andrew!

1169
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,327
Dry off!

1170
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:42,127
Totally.

1171
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,967
Hey, Wayne!

1172
01:01:53,087 --> 01:01:56,527
Okay, so, see this one here?

1173
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,607
This one I got really clean
'cause I did this little, like,

1174
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:02,727
lasso thing around the root,
you know?

1175
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:04,927
But then these two-

1176
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:08,207
these, I did not get as good.

1177
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:10,287
See how they're broken?

1178
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:13,687
I think it's because I got them from the
middle, you know, instead of the root.

1179
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,767
Oh. Oh.

1180
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:19,407
Oh. Sloppy.

1181
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:22,287
I've been doing a lot of reading,
you know, like, online about, like—

1182
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,527
Just like evolution
and, like— and natural selection...

1183
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:27,887
and how, like,
there's this thing, right?

1184
01:02:27,967 --> 01:02:30,647
It is called the apex predator,
right?

1185
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:35,447
And basically what this is is the
strongest animal in the ecosystem, right?

1186
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:37,887
And as human beings,

1187
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,207
we are— we're considered
the apex predator,

1188
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:43,567
but only because, like, smaller
animals can't feed on us...

1189
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:45,407
because of weapons
and stuff, right?

1190
01:02:45,487 --> 01:02:50,167
The lion does not feel guilty
when it kills a gazelle. Right?

1191
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:52,967
You do not feel guilty
when you squash a fly.

1192
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,927
And I think that means something.

1193
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,647
I just think that really means something.

1194
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,607
<i>This one I got really clean
'cause I did this little, like,</i>

1195
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,167
<i>lasso thing.</i>

1196
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:24,487
Andrew, what happened at school? Huh?

1197
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,635
I need to go and pick up my...

1198
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,845
- ...mom's medication!
- Oh, yeah?

1199
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:30,056
You're gonna break the rules again?
We're too strong for that now, Andrew!

1200
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,733
If you did that, you know
what I'd have to do.

1201
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:32,231
You'd have to what?

1202
01:03:32,327 --> 01:03:34,367
- You have to start thinking.
- What would you have to do, Matt?

1203
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:36,229
- There are consequences to what you do!
- You could not do anything...

1204
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:38,967
- ...to me because I am stronger than you.
- Stop that bullshit!

1205
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:40,008
I know what you did. I'm not
gonna let you do it again!

1206
01:03:40,008 --> 01:03:42,531
I am not going to break
your stupid rules!

1207
01:03:42,687 --> 01:03:47,367
Okay? So just screw off
and stay out of my life!

1208
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:21,247
I can't breathe.

1209
01:04:24,647 --> 01:04:26,167
Thank you.

1210
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:31,247
- Karen Detmer.
- Just one moment.

1211
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:35,727
We're gonna need
a next-day delivery.

1212
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:39,727
Co-pay on that is $750.83.

1213
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:43,127
- Well, I don't have all that.
- Son, I told your dad, and I'll tell you.

1214
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:45,967
You can pay up front, and we
can order next-day delivery.

1215
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:48,607
- Other than that, I can't help you.
- Prick.

Hey!

1231
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,927
- Give me all your money.
- Uh, what? Who is that?

1232
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,247
Doesn't matter who it is.
Just give me all your money or else.

1233
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,687
Or else? Shit, man.

1234
01:06:16,687 --> 01:06:18,647
Shit, man. Is that Andrew?

1235
01:06:18,727 --> 01:06:21,127
It sounds kind of like Andrew
under there.

1236
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:24,047
And you got Andrew's
broke-ass backpack on.

1237
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:27,087
- Oh, you got a gat?

01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:40,647
Whoa, dude!

1240
01:07:46,327 --> 01:07:48,407
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

1241
01:07:48,487 --> 01:07:50,287
Come on, come on, come on!

1242
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:00,287
Hey!

1243
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,887
The camera needs to
stay on for our investigation.

1244
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:31,727
Jesus Christ.

1245
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,367
Can I have a moment
alone with my son?

1246
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:36,807
If he regains consciousness,
notify the officer outside.

1247
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:38,087
Yeah, yeah.

1248
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,647
Oh!

1249
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,887
Your mother's dead.

1250
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:36,887
She died last night
while I was out looking for you.

1251
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:44,247
I came home, and, uh,

1252
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:49,207
she was there
in her bed.

1253
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:51,767
If I just could have
been there for her.

1254
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:57,287
I was always there for her when
you were out screwing around.

1255
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,407
And this one time—

1256
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:04,647
This... one time...

1257
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:08,087
that she needed me,
and you took me away!

1258
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,527
I want you
to apologize to me.

1259
01:10:14,407 --> 01:10:18,007
I know you can hear me, so I
want you to sit up right now...

1260
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:19,767
and apologize to me.

1261
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:23,487
You selfish,
selfish asshole!

1262
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:27,167
This is your fault!

1263
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:28,247
You—

1264
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:36,047
Do you hear me?

1265
01:10:36,127 --> 01:10:38,527
Your mother is dead,
and it is your fault!

1266
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:43,687
Happy birthday!

1267
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:46,367
Pound it? Pound it?

1268
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:48,767
Go and get a present.
Go and get a present. Yeah.

1269
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:52,367
- Yes, the big one.
- Oh, my God. Matt.

1270
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:54,447
Your nose. Are you okay?

1271
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:58,713
Oh, shit!

1272
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,337
Matt!

1273
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:01,883
Matt! What's going on?

1274
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:03,092
Matt, what's—

1275
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,596
- Oh, my God. Matt, what—
- Did you hear that?

1276
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,882
- How can you not hear that? It's so—
- I don't hear anything.

1277
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:10,567
- Something's wrong with Andrew.
- Come in here! Casey!

1278
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,927
<i>We apologize for the

<i>...County is headed to Seattle.</i>

1281

Come here. Please. Please.

1284
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,287
- What? No, Matt. Are you seeing this?
- Where are your keys at?

1285
01:11:29,407 --> 01:11:31,287
- What? Matt—
- Just stay here. I'll be back.

1286
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:34,567
- I just have to drive there, okay?
- Please, wait! Matt, please!

1287
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:37,687
- Listen, Andrew's in trouble, okay?
- Andrew's what?

1288
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:40,167
I'm sure that Andrew is fine.

1289
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:43,827
Andrew needs me! I
need to get to the city.

1290
01:11:43,852 --> 01:11:44,471
Slow down.

1291
01:11:44,527 --> 01:11:46,647
Shit. I gotta get—
Is that a roadblock?

1292
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:48,727
Nobody else is driving this way!
Talk to me!

1293
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,087
- Casey, stop, I just need to think, okay?
- <i>Stop!</i>

1294
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:52,887
- I gotta find another way downtown.
- <i>Turn around!</i>

1295
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,375
- <i>The road is closed!</i>
- Shit!

What are we doing here?

1304
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:23,327
Oh, my God!

You gotta put me down!
Please! Stop!

1306

- Matt!
- Casey, we gotta go!

Let's go.

- Andrew's out of control.
- What are you talking about?

1313
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:50,407
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you. I—

- I can't stop it!
- I don't wanna die!

1324

I can't control the car.
I can't control it.

1325

You have to stay here. Okay?

Are you seeing this?

1344

This is really, really bad!

Why did you catch him?

1352
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:59,327
- Listen! Just focus, okay?
- I dropped him!

1353
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:01,487
- Why did you catch him?
- Andrew, this is not a game!

1354
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:04,047
Do you understand?
You're hurting people.

1355

You're weak, Matt! You're all weak!

1356

Andrew, listen to me, okay?
Just-Just— I need you to listen.

1358

I'm here with you!

We can get out of here.

Andrew, look at yourself.

I got someone down here!

1394
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:47,079
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need help! I need help!

1395
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:50,024
- <i>He appears to be held at gunpoint but—</i>
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1396
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,202
- Don't shoot, please!
- Arms up in the air!

1397
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:56,005
He's hurt! I got someone hurt here!

1398
01:17:56,282 --> 01:17:57,882
- Get on the ground!
- Wait! Wait!

1399
01:17:57,932 --> 01:17:59,383
- I need help!
- Get on the ground!

1400
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:02,095
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Do what he says! Now, get down!

1401
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,679
- Do not get up!
- Get on the ground!

1402
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,414
Please! I need help! He's hurt!

1403
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,420
- Please don't shoot!
- We will shoot you!

1404
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,980
I'm not gonna do anything!
Please don't shoot!

1405
01:18:11,004 --> 01:18:12,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa! The glass!

1406
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,600
- Take him out!
- No!

1407
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,960
Leave me alone!

1408
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,041
- Run! Over there!
- Let's just get out of here!

1409
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,501
Oh! Shit! Shit!

1410
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,504
Whoa! Whoa! Wow!

1411
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,480
<i>We have multiple explosions.</i>

1412
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,680
- Get in position!
- We have 'em in our sights!

1413
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,400
We're covered!
Hold it right there!

1414
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,760
No! Stop!

1415
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,268
- <i>We have you surrounded!</i>
- No! Get down!

1416
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,560
- No!
- <i>Hands where we can see 'em!</i>

1417
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,760
Stay down! Stay down!

1418
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,720
- Stay down!
- I repeat, do not move!

1419
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,120
Additional units on the far side!

1420
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,760
Yo, stay down!

1421
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,240
Stay down! Don't move!

1422
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,040
Andrew! Andrew!

1423
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,800
Stop! Don't hurt them!
Andrew!

1424
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,040
Open fire!

1425
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,120
Andrew!

1426
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,000
Andrew! Andrew, stop!

1427
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,680
Please, stop!

1428
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:18,640
Andrew!

1429
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
Don't make me do this!

1430
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,600
Stop!

1431
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,840
<i>...reports of casualties.</i>

1432
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,720
<i>At least two structures
have been destroyed</i>

1433
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,800
I think they're both down!

1434
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,120
<i>Two men out</i>

1435
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,620
<i>Show me right now eastbound on—</i>

1436
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,320
<i>Yes, sir. I'm about two blocks away.
I see it.</i>

1437
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,880
Move up.

1438
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,160
Hey! Oh!
What are you doing?

1439
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,880
Hey, Andrew.

1440
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,520
I just wanted to say that...

1441
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,840
I'm sorry and, uh,

1442
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,640
I— I hope...

1443
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,800
that you know that I did
what I had to do.

1444
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,640
You're not a bad person.
I know that.

1445
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,640
That's all that matters.

1446
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,520
And, uh, I want you to know...

1447
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,720
that I'm gonna be better
from now on.

1448
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,120
I'm gonna help people.

1449
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,560
I'm gonna find out
what happened to us down there.

1450
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,640
I don't care how long it takes.

1451
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,680
I'm gonna get answers.

1452
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,840
I'm gonna do it for you,
and I'm gonna do it for Steve.

1453
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,600
And...

1454
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,280
I just—

1455
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,960
I love you, man.

1456
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,800
I didn't ever
get a chance to tell you,

1457
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,840
but I love you.

1458
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,840
And guess what.

1459
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,400
You made it.

1460
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,640
Whoo-hoo!

1461
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,200
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1462
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,040
Isn't it beautiful?

1463
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,120
Good-bye, Andrew.
