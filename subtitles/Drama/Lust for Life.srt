1
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:17,913
You are now qualified
for evangelical work...

2
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:22,042
under the auspices of the Belgian
Committee of the Messengers of the Faith.

3
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,946
May the Lord guide you
and sustain you in all your ways.

4
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:54,615
Congratulations, Dr. Bosman.
A very creditable group of young men.

5
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,983
Now about this
other young man, Dr. Bosman.

6
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,215
Are you sure he's quite hopeless?

7
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,918
Gentlemen, I've trained a great
many students in evangelical work...

8
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:06,019
...but never in my life
have I come across a case quite like this.

9
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,826
He is completely unable
to speak extemporary.

10
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,527
He prepares long and obscure sermons
which he's unable to memorize...

11
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:16,130
and has to read
like a stumbling and inarticulate child.

12
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,534
Now, gentlemen, can we send
that kind of man out into the field...

13
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,601
to represent our society?

14
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:24,374
Dr. Peeters, I think that's conclusive.

15
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:28,178
Dr. Bosman, ask him to come in, please.

16
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:45,491
Mr. Van Gogh, we have Dr. Bosman's
report on your progress here.

17
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,170
- In view of what he's told us...
- You understand...

18
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,901
if your teacher feels
that you're unqualified...

19
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,409
this committee cannot give you
an appointment.

20
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:55,309
We regret it more than we can say.

21
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,816
Gentlemen, I think that concludes
Committee business for today.

22
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:14,257
Mr. Van Gogh, do you feel that the
Committee were unjust in their decision?

23
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,394
- No, sir.
- We did what we had to do...

24
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,129
in view of your records.

25
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,835
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

26
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,343
Your father is a minister, is he not?

27
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:32,178
I'm not trying to put myself
on a level with my father.

28
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,277
I only hoped in some way
to follow in his footsteps.

29
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:37,753
Yet, until a year ago...

30
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:41,690
you showed no inclination or desire
to follow your father's calling.

31
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,957
Believe me, this is something I have to do.
I want to help the unfortunates.

32
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,294
I want to bring them the word of God.

33
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,502
Even if I'm not qualified,
there must be some way I can serve.

34
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,561
Isn't there any place for me?
Somewhere no one else wants to go?

35
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,369
I'll do anything. Only use me. Use me!

36
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:04,578
Come here.

37
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:11,822
- Do you know this part of the country?
- No.

38
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:14,891
It's a coal-mining region, the Borinage.

39
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:18,587
There exist no more miserable people
on the face of the earth...

40
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,995
than the miners who live there.

41
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:25,325
If you really mean what you said
about wanting to help the unfortunates...

42
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:26,563
here's your chance.

43
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,260
"The heart that seeks God...

44
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:53,825
"has more storms than any others.

45
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:56,364
"Life is a struggle here below.

46
00:05:56,734 --> 00:06:00,192
"Yet out of our sufferings...

47
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,939
"God teaches us higher things.

48
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:04,973
"He wills..."

49
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,908
"He wills that man should live humbly...

50
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:17,021
"and go through life
not reaching after lofty aims...

51
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:21,622
"but fitting himself to the lowly
and learning from the Gospels...

52
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,658
"to be meek, simple of heart."

53
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:41,137
Father, we pray to thee
to keep us from evil and despair.

54
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,516
Feed us with the bread
that does not perish, which is thy word.

55
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:49,977
O Lord, amen.

56
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:05,997
Mister!

57
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,435
- I don't know what your name is, but...
- Ducrucq.

58
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,635
Why did you leave?
Did I say something wrong?

59
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:15,107
I saw you leave.
What did I say that offended you?

60
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,545
Just because it's Sunday...

61
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:19,413
you don't expect us to listen
to the kind of pious bilge...

62
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,783
- you gave us just now.
- Bilge?

63
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:25,813
Look, I worked all week on that sermon.
I meant every word of it.

64
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,985
Listen, mister. Every now and then,
somebody comes here from the outside...

65
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:31,893
and tries to help us.

66
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:36,697
They mean well. So do you, probably,
but that doesn't help us at all, does it?

67
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,997
I want to bring you the word of God.

68
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:44,909
- What can I do? Tell me.
- I don't know.

69
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:48,302
Help me. Help me
to understand you people...

70
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,679
to know you. Take me into your homes
where you live.

71
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,579
We don't live here.

72
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,913
We only come here to sleep.

73
00:07:57,422 --> 00:08:01,518
Down there, 2,000 feet underground,
that's where we live.

74
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:05,763
Can I go down? Take me.

75
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:09,666
- Will you take me down?
- Sure, I can arrange it.

76
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,669
Be here in the morning when I go to work.

77
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,435
At 4:00.

78
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,794
I'm trembling inside of me
just as much as you are.

79
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,926
And I've been going down for 33 years.

80
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:11,527
- How old is that child?
- Eleven.

81
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,865
- How long has she been working here?
- A year.

82
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,630
Her father was killed in the explosion.

83
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,073
<i>Listen, mister. Every now and then,
somebody comes here from the outside...</i>

84
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>and tries to help us.</i>

85
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,752
<i>They mean well. So do you, probably,
but that doesn't help us at all, does it?</i>

86
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,270
Ducrucq.

87
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:36,409
Come down! Somebody...

88
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:39,173
Why don't you come down
and wait with us?

89
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,943
What are you waiting for?

90
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:08,399
I've got a blanket in there
for one of the wounded, and some bread.

91
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,033
What about you?

92
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:12,811
Wait for me.

93
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:18,781
Van Gogh.

94
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:21,445
I see you don't remember us.

95
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,013
From the Committee
of the Messengers of the Faith.

96
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm glad you've come. Did you bring
food and clothes for the families?

97
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,622
- Families?
- Another accident?

98
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,293
- You didn't know?
- I'm sorry to hear it.

99
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,493
- Were there many lost?
- Six.

100
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,996
- Four men, two children, 28 injured.
- Terrible.

101
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,567
I'll see what we can do.

102
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,269
It's unfortunate our visit
should have come at this time.

103
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:44,810
But it was Rev. Peeters' wish.

104
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,039
The purpose of our coming here
is an inspection.

105
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:49,241
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll be right back.

106
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,648
- Just what is the meaning of this?
- You receive an allowance.

107
00:12:56,723 --> 00:13:00,625
Why have you chosen to live in the most
wretched, filthy shack in this village?

108
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,959
Because we have no right to spread
the word of God to these people...

109
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,430
unless we suffer as they do.

110
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:08,730
You yourself are unclean.
Your clothes are ragged and dirty.

111
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,667
There are people here
who have no clothes.

112
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:14,070
Do you mean to tell us
you actually sleep on this dirt and straw...

113
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,406
like a beast of the field? You,
the spiritual leader of the community?

114
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,038
I gave my bed to a sick woman
who needed it more than I.

115
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:22,877
You are new in this work.
I have no doubt you mean well.

116
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,010
But by your behavior, you've degraded
the dignity of the church...

117
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:28,884
- whose representative you are.
- Have you no sense of decency?

118
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,857
Don't you understand
that if the clergy is to be respected...

119
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,120
I don't care to be respected!

120
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,827
I'm trying to live like a true Christian.

121
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,593
I'm not going to worry about how I sleep.

122
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,794
Look at the fresh graves of the children
in the cemetery.

123
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:45,494
Scrub floors and pick coal
with the women.

124
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:49,074
Get those fine clothes dirty
with the blood and sweat of dying miners.

125
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:51,509
Then come here
and lecture me about Christianity!

126
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,047
Hypocrites!

127
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,127
But you must have heard of him.

128
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:17,797
He came here about a year ago
as a preacher. Vincent van Gogh.

129
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,536
Yes, mister.
You'll find him in the little shack.

130
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,978
Vincent.

131
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,390
Who is it?

132
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,526
It's Theo.

133
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:22,500
- Vincent, what have you done to yourself?
- Theo.

134
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,935
What's happened to you?

135
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,371
I was sick for a while,
but I'm all right now.

136
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,102
Doesn't anyone look after you?

137
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:31,634
- I'd better go and get you some food.
- Don't go. Stay and talk.

138
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:35,649
- Where's the nearest place where I can...
- Please don't go, Theo.

139
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,277
It's been such a long time.

140
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,798
What are we going to do about you?

141
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:58,763
Father wrote and asked me
to come and find you.

142
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,567
- For months he's not heard from you.
- There was nothing to tell.

143
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,071
What right have you to decide that?

144
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:08,138
Cut yourself off from everybody,
even from me.

145
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,278
You've become a stranger.
You've changed.

146
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,955
I haven't changed, Theo.

147
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,984
Outwardly, perhaps, but inside me,
I still want the same things.

148
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,426
What things?

149
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:24,261
The things we talked about
in the old days.

150
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:28,633
To be of use, to work,
to bring something to the world.

151
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,004
Do you think this is the answer?

152
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,909
I don't know.

153
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,680
We've grown apart, Theo.

154
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,582
Look, you found what you wanted in Paris
and I'm glad for you.

155
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,514
I've found nothing anywhere.

156
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,725
I've made one bad start after another.
One mess after another.

157
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,458
I thought I was on my way here
by doing God's work.

158
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:57,832
That was the worst failure of all.

159
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,062
But no matter how often I fail,
there is something in me.

160
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:06,267
- That I am good for something.
- But this is not the way to find it.

161
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,937
Hiding away here, wasting your time.

162
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,848
You've become an idler.

163
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,513
An idler? Yes.

164
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:21,288
But there are two kinds of idlers.

165
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:25,593
There's the man who's idle
because he wants to be, out of laziness.

166
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,528
How easy that is. I envy him.

167
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,862
There's the other kind...

168
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,436
the man who's idle in spite of himself.

169
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,530
I want nothing but to work.

170
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,641
Only, I can't.

171
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:46,905
I'm in a cage, a cage of shame
and self-doubt and failure.

172
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,745
Somebody believe me.

173
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:52,152
I'm caged. I'm alone.

174
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,913
I'm frightened.

175
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,655
Vincent, listen to me.

176
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,730
When we were children,
I used to follow you about.

177
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:15,040
If I was frightened, I'd run to look for you.

178
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:20,343
If I got lost, you'd always come to find me.

179
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,985
We're still brothers, we're friends...

180
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,247
we can trust one another.

181
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,056
That's stronger than any cage.

182
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,788
Whatever you do, from now on,
wherever you go...

183
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:43,032
promise me, make me part of it.

184
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:47,439
Don't ever cut yourself off from me again.

185
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,981
- What is it?
- My pipe.

186
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,823
Let me take you home...

187
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,885
where you can live and be cared for.

188
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,555
Until you find your way.

189
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,070
Tell me, if you were me...

190
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,771
which would you want
to have your money in?

191
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:29,674
These are both accredited canvases.

192
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,917
Both were exhibited in last year's salon.

193
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,990
Perhaps you'd prefer to be left alone
for a moment to make your choice.

194
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,222
I shall be in the next room.

195
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,905
<i>Dear Theo...</i>

196
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:54,843
<i>you were right. It's so good to be home.</i>

197
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,439
<i>To live in peace for a time.</i>

198
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,977
<i>Once again, thanks to you,
life seems precious to me.</i>

199
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,985
<i>Something to be valued and loved.</i>

200
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:07,288
<i>Once again I'm working.</i>

201
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,358
<i>You know how for years,
whenever I saw anything that moved me...</i>

202
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,327
<i>I felt the need to draw it.</i>

203
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:16,422
<i>To get it down on paper,
no matter how crudely.</i>

204
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:19,468
<i>Now, for the first time,
I've begun to wonder...</i>

205
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,730
<i>could this be the way for me?</i>

206
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:26,167
<i>A man or a woman at work.
Some furrows in a plowed field.</i>

207
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:29,234
<i>A bit of sand, sea, or sky.</i>

208
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,107
<i>These are subjects so difficult,
and at the same time, so beautiful...</i>

209
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,719
<i>that it's worth spending one's whole life...</i>

210
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:41,621
<i>trying to capture the poetry
that's hidden in them.</i>

211
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:56,536
Vincent, have you lost all track of time?

212
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,664
Father's upset,
we're practically through dinner.

213
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,607
You go ahead. I just want to finish this.

214
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,977
Couldn't you try to be on time
just once in a while?

215
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,141
Especially with Cousin Kay here.
She brought little Jan with her.

216
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:14,779
And, Vincent, try not to argue with Father.
Not today.

217
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,593
I'm sorry I'm late.

218
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,265
Vincent, aren't you going to say hello
to your cousin Kay?

219
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,029
Hello, cousin.

220
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,941
Hello, Kay.

221
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:38,842
You must pardon Vincent.

222
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,147
He's so interested in his new work,
he forgets where he is sometimes.

223
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,551
- Vincent is an artist these days.
- Draws on paper.

224
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,486
Lovely things: Swamps, woods, people...

225
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,355
He's made a drawing of me.
He makes us all pose for him.

226
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,986
If you don't watch out,
he'll make you pose, too, cousin.

227
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,086
And Jan.

228
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,063
You should see the way
he makes people look.

229
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:58,397
Vincent, you're looking at me
as though you've never seen me before.

230
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:01,632
It's been a long time.
Not since before Vos died.

231
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,173
I'm sorry.

232
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,571
I guess I shouldn't have mentioned it.

233
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,308
Even though it's been almost a year.

234
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:13,645
Vincent.

235
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:17,483
One doesn't measure such things
in weeks and months, Vincent.

236
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:20,546
No, of course not. See, I only meant that...

237
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:24,923
I was gonna write to you, Cousin Kay,
but I'm not very good at those things...

238
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,891
and then so much time went by that I...

239
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:31,093
Jan's being very quiet.
I hope he's not getting up to any mischief.

240
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,499
Excuse me.

241
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:40,936
- Vincent, really...
- Couldn't you see how she felt?

242
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,639
You know how it was with her and Vos?

243
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,076
It's not right to grieve that long.

244
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,641
God didn't intend the living
to mourn forever.

245
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,711
I hardly think you're the best judge
of God's intentions.

246
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,849
Do you realize you haven't been to church
once since you got back?

247
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,552
You, the minister's son.

248
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,720
What do you think
they're saying in the village?

249
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:02,391
I act out of my beliefs, Father.
Not because I want to please the village.

250
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,866
I happen not to believe
in the God or the clergymen.

251
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,664
For me, he's as dead as a doornail.

252
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,535
Children, if you've finished,
leave the table, please.

253
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:11,540
Go into the other room.

254
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,014
Vincent, before the children?

255
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,811
Do you realize what you said?

256
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,615
Yes, Mother. But I must say what I feel.

257
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:28,686
I'm not an atheist. I do believe in God.

258
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:32,655
A God of love, Father, and I believe
there are many ways to serve him.

259
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:36,187
One man does it from a pulpit,
another through a book or a painting.

260
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:38,063
Let's not discuss it.

261
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:47,903
I'm sorry, Father,
but I was just telling you my opinion.

262
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,905
Did you have a good morning
in the fields, Vincent?

263
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,540
Like any other.

264
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,611
Do you feel the drawing's going well?

265
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,149
You work so hard and...

266
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,516
I can't help noticing
you go over and over your drawings...

267
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:04,653
and often as not, you throw them away.

268
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:09,029
What Mother means is, we'd hate
to see you keep struggling, Vincent...

269
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,164
only to realize in the end,
it was just another failure.

270
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:16,173
Maybe he could visit Cousin Mauve
in The Hague. He's a successful artist.

271
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:20,575
Ask him his opinion of your drawings.
I'm sure he'd be glad to help you.

272
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:24,706
I'm not ready to show my work to Mauve.
When I am, I'll go to him.

273
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:32,752
I'm sorry, Vincent.

274
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,821
- How's Jan?
- He's all right. Thank you.

275
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,291
I'm glad you're here, Kay.

276
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:47,394
<i>Please, Theo, send more paper
and drawing ink.</i>

277
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:50,635
<i>I'm afraid I quickly used up
what you sent last month.</i>

278
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,506
<i>As I work at my drawings day after day...</i>

279
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:56,279
<i>what seemed unattainable before...</i>

280
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,838
<i>is now gradually becoming possible.</i>

281
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:02,050
<i>Slowly, I'm learning
to observe and measure.</i>

282
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:06,515
<i>I don't stand quite so helpless
before nature any longer.</i>

283
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,920
Come on, Jan, you rascal.

284
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:21,766
<i>I know there's still something
harsh and stiff in my style.</i>

285
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:27,006
<i>Although, to tell the truth, I believe
the presence of Kay here this summer...</i>

286
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:31,281
<i>is beginning to have a softening influence
on my work.</i>

287
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,083
Time for your nap, now.

288
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:41,719
There we go. Cover you up.

289
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,231
He fell asleep almost as soon
as I put him down. Thank you.

290
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:54,203
He's getting to be such a boy.

291
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:57,105
It's been a wonderful summer
for him here.

292
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:59,336
It's been a wonderful summer.

293
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:03,438
- How did it go today? Well?
- When you're with me, it always goes well.

294
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:05,209
I'm glad, Vincent.

295
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,211
You work so hard.

296
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,152
I see your light on often,
halfway through the night.

297
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:15,090
There's so much to learn,
not only about drawing, but people.

298
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,719
How they feel and think,
the world they live in.

299
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,320
Before you can paint them,
you have to know that, too.

300
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:22,366
So I read everything
I can get my hands on.

301
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,401
Dickens, Zola, Michelet.

302
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:27,364
You know what Michelet says?

303
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:30,574
"Blessed is the man
who's found his worth...

304
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:32,633
"and one woman to love."

305
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:38,245
- I need love, Kay.
- Of course you do.

306
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:41,914
I need it to be myself,
to be able to breathe it.

307
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:45,483
I want a home. I want children.

308
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,792
Vos felt the same way. He made
Jan and me the center of his existence.

309
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:56,096
- Nothing else counted for him...
- Stop talking about Vos. He's dead.

310
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:59,399
And we're alive, Kay. In the present.
The present.

311
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,297
- I love you, Kay.
- No.

312
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:03,307
Listen to me,
we're both alone in the world.

313
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,502
We need each other.
Look, we'll have a home.

314
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:07,807
We'll be happy. I promise you.

315
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,272
No.

316
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:16,084
In God's name, don't be frightened.
I'm only saying I want to marry you.

317
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:18,919
To be your husband, and a father to Jan.

318
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,583
No. Never!

319
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,492
<i>No. Never.</i>

320
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,664
<i>I tell you, Theo, this thing threatens me.</i>

321
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:32,269
<i>Love is something so strong, so real...</i>

322
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:35,533
<i>that it's as impossible to quench it...</i>

323
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:38,371
<i>as it is for a man to take his own life.</i>

324
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:43,112
<i>I must see her face again
and speak to her once more.</i>

325
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:47,812
- I'd like to see Miss Kay.
- I'm afraid she's out, sir.

326
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:51,344
No, you can't go in there, sir.
The family's at dinner.

327
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:54,749
He pushed his way in, sir.

328
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:58,319
I see now what people mean when
they complain about your bad manners.

329
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:00,058
- Where's Kay?
- She's not here.

330
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:01,724
She's visiting friends.

331
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,701
- Vincent, please, sit down.
- She was just sitting here.

332
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,330
Can't you understand
a simple word like "no"?

333
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:10,864
Don't you realize what it meant
when Kay returned your letters unopened?

334
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:13,036
May I speak to Kay, please?

335
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:16,410
My dear, will you leave us alone, please?

336
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:24,221
Must you persist in the face of everything?

337
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:28,659
Try to be reasonable, Vincent.
Even if Kay returned your love...

338
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,163
how could you possibly hope
to provide a home for her?

339
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,096
You haven't earned money in a long time.

340
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,430
- You don't even have...
- If a man loves, he lives.

341
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,697
If he lives, he works.
If he works, he has bread.

342
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:41,239
You think I'm a tramp?
I'll be penniless all my life?

343
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:43,570
- It's not just a question of money...
- Listen to me!

344
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:45,701
All I ask is a chance to show Kay my love.

345
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:48,076
To help her understand
why she must love me.

346
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,344
Surely you've been in love.
You know what agonies a man can suffer...

347
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,282
Agonies? Are you such a weakling...

348
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:56,378
that you can't stand the little pain
of a disappointment in love?

349
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,787
Do you have to whimper about it?

350
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,154
What do you know about pain?

351
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:06,990
I've seen agonies
that you've never dreamed of.

352
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:14,434
Let me talk to Kay for as long as
I can keep my hand in this flame.

353
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:20,908
Vincent!

354
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:27,116
Have you gone out of your mind?

355
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:30,254
- Do you hear me whimpering?
- Listen to me, my boy.

356
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:33,759
I'd let you talk to Kay
to your heart's content, but for one thing.

357
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:36,762
She refuses to see you again, ever.

358
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,963
I don't believe it.

359
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:42,001
She said that your persistence
disgusted her.

360
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:46,497
There are some things
that can't be controlled by wishes.

361
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:48,336
Love is one of them.

362
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:50,768
I'm sorry.

363
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:54,541
But did she say I disgusted her?

364
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,340
Yes.

365
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:03,483
- Did she actually say that?
- Yes.

366
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:13,756
All right, I'm sorry, too.

367
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,764
- I'll be going.
- Where are you staying?

368
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,396
- Would you like to spend the night here?
- No, thank you.

369
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,134
- If Kay leaves the house...
- Let me take care of your hand.

370
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,836
- Take care of yourself, Vincent.
- Our love to your family.

371
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,469
- Good night.
- Good night, boy.

372
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:55,204
Come on. Let's get out of here.

373
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:04,012
Come on. If you want to sit here,
that's all right.

374
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:10,884
More wine?

375
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,515
- On credit?
- No.

376
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:35,136
You all right?

377
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:39,477
I'm sick. I'm tired. Just leave me alone.

378
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:48,085
Everything's rotten. Now I understand
why people drown themselves.

379
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,224
- Don't say things like that.
- Why not?

380
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:56,393
- Suicide's a terrible thing.
- What do you know about it?

381
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:03,999
What are you, anyway? A working man?

382
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,542
- Yes.
- You don't talk like one.

383
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,915
Thanks for the brandy.

384
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:21,023
I'm a laundress,
when I have the strength to scrub.

385
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:25,197
And when I haven't, I look for easier work.

386
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:31,500
I have a baby to feed.
He's at home with my mother.

387
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:34,831
- Where's your husband?
- What husband?

388
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,872
I've been at the tubs all day.

389
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:44,077
They were supposed to pay me tonight
but they put me off till tomorrow.

390
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:47,245
- Can't your mother help you?
- She's helped plenty.

391
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:49,448
She's taught me all I know.

392
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:52,522
Can I have another?

393
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:57,592
Here. Put this in your pocket instead.

394
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,656
- I'm only sorry it isn't more.
- Who bit your hand?

395
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,861
- I burned it.
- Let me see it.

396
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,708
What were you trying to do?
Fry it for dinner?

397
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,880
- I'll get something for it.
- It'll be all right.

398
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,472
Got any oil or butter
in this cockroach trap?

399
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,541
We sell drinks, not food.

400
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:21,453
It's a bad burn. Come home with me.

401
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:24,719
- I'll dress it for you before it gets worse.
- Thank you. It'll heal.

402
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:28,592
What's the matter with you?
You're afraid to be seen with me?

403
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:56,245
<i>This is a woman, Theo,
who is far from young, far from pretty...</i>

404
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,256
<i>but she was good to me, and kind.</i>

405
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,523
<i>She's evidently had a great deal of trouble
and a hard life...</i>

406
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:07,465
<i>and there's nothing at all
distinguished or unusual about her.</i>

407
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:09,729
<i>We talked about all sorts of things;</i>

408
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:12,431
<i>her life, her troubles, her poverty...</i>

409
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:15,266
<i>her health, her loneliness.</i>

410
00:34:18,512 --> 00:34:21,949
If you had nothing at all,
it'd make no difference.

411
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:28,078
Since you came over and talked to me,
I don't feel alone anymore.

412
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,684
I don't know how to say it.

413
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,385
<i>The clergymen would call us sinners.</i>

414
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:39,289
<i>Is it a sin to love, Theo,
to be in need of love?</i>

415
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,993
<i>Not to be able to live without love?</i>

416
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,447
Cousin Mauve.

417
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:57,713
Vincent. I'm sorry to put off seeing you...

418
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:00,118
but we artists have to be selfish,
you know.

419
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:01,849
We have to save ourselves.

420
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,824
After all, with each painting,
we die a little.

421
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:06,690
What have you there?

422
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:08,960
I'm trying to draw.

423
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,362
I was wondering if you'd be willing
to help me.

424
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:15,027
I wouldn't ask much. Just let me
watch you work now and then.

425
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,594
And sometimes, when you're resting...

426
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:21,130
if you would look at my things
and tell me my mistakes.

427
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,344
You think that's not asking much?

428
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:31,108
But these are just copying exercises.
Don't you have anything of your own?

429
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,489
You've been out at the beach
at Scheveningen.

430
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,756
Don't be in such a hurry,
seascapes are difficult.

431
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,129
Yes, indeed.

432
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:56,443
You know,
I expected to find you a dullard.

433
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,878
I was wrong.

434
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:06,551
They're clumsy, most of them,
but I can see what you're getting at.

435
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,956
And that you've worked.

436
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,496
Yes, that...

437
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,527
Tell me something.

438
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:22,734
What kind of an artist do you want to be?

439
00:36:23,204 --> 00:36:25,798
I want to create
things that touch people.

440
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,867
I want to move them so they say,
"He feels deeply and tenderly."

441
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:36,108
That's fine.
But before you can move people...

442
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:40,751
you first have to learn your business.
It needs skill as well as heart.

443
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,020
Tell me something.

444
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:45,423
- Have you ever worked in color?
- No.

445
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:48,360
You better start working right away
in watercolors and oil.

446
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:49,453
It'll help your drawing.

447
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,590
- I don't know anything about color.
- I will teach you.

448
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,260
We'll work together here.

449
00:36:54,336 --> 00:36:55,894
- Cousin Mauve...
- No.

450
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:57,734
When I'm less tired.

451
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,976
Now, you'll need some watercolors.
Here they are.

452
00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:05,875
Some brushes, some oil...

453
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:09,918
and... No. This is an incomplete set...

454
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:11,350
but it'll do for now.

455
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,789
There's a palette, palette knife,
oil, turpentine.

456
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:18,252
Better have a couple of these.

457
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,419
Now, to improve your drawing,
you'll need to use casts.

458
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:24,895
Now let me see. Yes.

459
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:28,136
Take these home with you
and see that you work from them...

460
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:30,797
not less than
three hours each day, faithfully.

461
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,603
- Have you a place to work?
- I found a flat near the market...

462
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,610
- Has it got good light?
- I usually work out...

463
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:38,442
- How are you fixed for money?
- Theo's been sending me money.

464
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:40,675
The first few months
are always the hardest.

465
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:43,912
I don't suppose
a little extra will be unwelcome?

466
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:47,583
- Cousin Mauve...
- That will help you set yourself up.

467
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,487
- I can't tell you how...
- Not at all.

468
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,026
Now, come back next week,
let me see what you've done.

469
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:54,528
Please forgive me for barging in
when you're so tired.

470
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:55,824
Don't. That's all right.

471
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,162
- Just take these with you.
- Yeah.

472
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,030
- I can't tell you how grateful I am.
- That's all right.

473
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:02,593
Now take that.

474
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:11,776
How much longer do you need us?

475
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:15,842
I can't get supper ready
sitting in this chair, you know.

476
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,917
I'm sorry. You can get up now.

477
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:22,223
I'm going to the market.

478
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:29,596
Next time, will you keep
some money for food?

479
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:35,796
If we could eat drawings,
it might be different.

480
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:38,804
I saved some money.
You dropped it on the beach.

481
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,842
I didn't give it back to you.

482
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:46,373
My mother was right, getting myself
hooked up with a crazy painter.

483
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,378
Keep an eye on him.

484
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:07,897
<i>Dear Brother, I think of you so often,
so very, very often these days.</i>

485
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:13,202
<i>If only you could be here
and see for yourself how it is with us;</i>

486
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,801
<i>that this is a real home, rooted in life...</i>

487
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:21,307
<i>with a woman and a cradle,
and a child's high chair.</i>

488
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:26,078
<i>The feeling I have
for Christine is real, too.</i>

489
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:47,641
I'm tired.

490
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,277
I'm going in to feed the baby.

491
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:59,453
Not yet. Christine, come back!

492
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,562
I'm fed up.
Month after month, it's the same thing.

493
00:40:08,932 --> 00:40:12,595
- What's the matter now?
- I'm fed up with living on bread and coffee.

494
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:16,598
You take every penny you're given
and throw it away on paints and canvases.

495
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:18,903
- Don't start that again.
- Look at these.

496
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:22,138
How much do they cost?
You haven't even used up the old ones yet.

497
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,510
Shut up. Don't interfere with things
you don't know.

498
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,982
I won't. I have to pick up after you,
mend those rags you call clothes...

499
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,246
pose for you for hours,
on top of everything else.

500
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,585
- What do you think I am? Your slave?
- Stop nagging!

501
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:39,753
Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't better off
the way I was.

502
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:44,830
Don't you dare. Do you hear me?

503
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:49,162
If only we could have a piece of meat
once in a while, or an egg.

504
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,868
I'm sick of worrying every night
how we'll get money to eat the next day.

505
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:54,933
You call that a life?

506
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,371
Couldn't you write to your brother?

507
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:00,575
I can't ask him again.
He's helping all he can.

508
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,709
What about the man
who wanted to meet you?

509
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,083
- Tersteeg.
- Maybe he could sell some of your stuff.

510
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:08,283
I went to see him. Offered me
a hand-down like I was a beggar.

511
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:09,950
Didn't you take it?

512
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:13,757
He said I had no talent.
Even if I did, I started too late.

513
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,697
That leaves only your cousin Mauve.
Couldn't he help?

514
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,400
Or did you have a fight with him, too?

515
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,466
Did you?

516
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:30,945
Mauve can go to hell.
He helps me when he's in the mood.

517
00:41:31,014 --> 00:41:33,983
The rest of the time,
he doesn't care whether I'm dead or alive.

518
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,019
"Oh, I'm sorry, my boy.
Go home. I can't see you now.

519
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:38,610
"Go home and work with those casts."

520
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:41,054
I'm sick of working
with those idiotic casts!

521
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,354
Don't look down your nose
at those casts of his.

522
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,417
He sells what he paints!

523
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:50,062
I don't want to hear about those casts
from you or from anybody else!

524
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:06,808
Cien?

525
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:13,119
Where've you been?
I asked you where you've been.

526
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,590
- At my mother's.
- For two days?

527
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:18,827
- You said you wouldn't go back.
- There was something to eat.

528
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,830
You promised
not to get into that life again.

529
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:23,059
And some jokes for a change.

530
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:29,197
- Where are you going?
- My father's ill. I have to go back.

531
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:38,245
- How long will you be gone?
- Depends on what happens.

532
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,381
- Vincent, I...
- Yes?

533
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,088
What is it?

534
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:50,555
Nothing.

535
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:57,062
There's some painting muslin
left in the cupboard.

536
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,362
Make some shirts for the boy.

537
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:00,369
I won't be there when you get back.

538
00:43:00,437 --> 00:43:02,405
- Don't say that.
- I didn't want to tell you.

539
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:05,772
I've been feeling restless.
Besides, my mother's right, what she said.

540
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:07,811
You don't earn enough
for me and the baby.

541
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:09,903
- It's a bad life.
- This is no time for...

542
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,677
You'll forget about us once you get home.
It won't be hard.

543
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:19,923
- Where will you go? How will you live?
- It'll be the old life, I suppose.

544
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:22,751
Vincent, it's not your fault.
You've been good.

545
00:43:22,826 --> 00:43:26,592
You're the only person
who's ever been good to me and the baby.

546
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,154
Just as if he was your own.

547
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:29,597
All aboard.

548
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,583
What is it
that came between Father and me?

549
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,655
Why couldn't I have shown him
a little more consideration?

550
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:54,884
Given him some pleasure
while he was alive?

551
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,893
It wouldn't have hurt me
to come to his church once in a while.

552
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:00,293
We always assume there's time...

553
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:03,596
and that we can give love
on our own terms.

554
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:08,036
Then one day we wake up and find
it's too late to give it on any terms.

555
00:44:12,376 --> 00:44:15,277
Will you go back to your life in The Hague?

556
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:19,074
That's over.
It was wrong from the beginning.

557
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:24,113
Come to Paris, Vincent.
We could live together.

558
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:28,016
You're not the only one that's lonely.

559
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,686
Not yet, Theo. Some day, but not now.

560
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,695
You could meet other painters.
See what they're doing.

561
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:37,496
If I'm to be anything as a painter,
I've got to break through the iron wall...

562
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,402
between what I feel
and what I can express.

563
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,067
And my best chance of doing it is here...

564
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,872
where my roots are, the people I know...

565
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,606
the earth I know.

566
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,622
<i>Dear Theo, thank you for the money,
the paints, and canvas.</i>

567
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:06,589
<i>With your help, I go forward.</i>

568
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:09,994
<i>I feel the force to work
growing daily within me.</i>

569
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:13,765
<i>Do your realize, Theo,
that what I'm doing is new?</i>

570
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:17,464
<i>In the paintings of the old masters...</i>

571
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,602
<i>did you ever see
a single man or woman at work?</i>

572
00:45:20,812 --> 00:45:24,270
<i>Did they ever try to paint a laborer,
or a man digging?</i>

573
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:25,848
<i>They didn't.</i>

574
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:29,318
<i>And for good reason
because work is so hard to draw.</i>

575
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:42,258
Just look at the way he's dressed.
That old sheepskin.

576
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:45,564
Oh, my. I tell you, I'm sorry for the family.

577
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:51,303
<i>To paint these people means to
be with them in the fields day after day...</i>

578
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,375
<i>and by their firesides at night.</i>

579
00:45:57,248 --> 00:46:00,911
<i>Since the rains came,
I've become absorbed in the weavers.</i>

580
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:03,547
<i>They make such good subjects.</i>

581
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:07,021
<i>The old oak wood
darkened by sweating hands...</i>

582
00:46:07,492 --> 00:46:10,757
<i>and the shadows of the looms
on the gray mud walls.</i>

583
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,928
<i>All these months
I've been trying to find a pattern...</i>

584
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:21,870
<i>trying not so much to draw hands,
as gestures...</i>

585
00:46:22,173 --> 00:46:25,301
<i>not so much faces,
as the expressions of people.</i>

586
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:28,676
<i>Men and women
who know the meaning of toil.</i>

587
00:46:31,816 --> 00:46:33,943
<i>I want to make clear that these people...</i>

588
00:46:34,018 --> 00:46:37,146
<i>sitting around a meal of potatoes
in the evening...</i>

589
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:41,055
<i>have turned the soil
with the very hands they put in the dish.</i>

590
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:44,025
<i>That they have honestly earned their food.</i>

591
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:48,063
<i>I want to paint something
that smells of bacon smoke and steam.</i>

592
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:52,360
<i>Something that's the good, dark color
of our Dutch earth.</i>

593
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:56,500
Willemien. Come in.

594
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,034
Here, sit down.

595
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:07,544
What's the matter?

596
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:11,752
- The neighbors been at you again?
- You know how they are.

597
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:13,586
Such a small place.

598
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:16,157
What is it this time?

599
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:21,797
It has to do with
the way you dress, partly, and...

600
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:26,561
I dress this way
because I work in the fields.

601
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:30,868
Because I have nothing else.

602
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,602
And the way you behave, too.
They don't understand it.

603
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,648
It makes trouble for us.

604
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,679
Since Father died, it hasn't been easy.

605
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:44,622
People have stopped coming to the house.
They avoid us.

606
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,090
It isn't very comfortable and...

607
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,954
Is your young man
one of those who's stopped coming?

608
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:52,428
Yes, he is.
But that doesn't matter so much.

609
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:54,658
- Yes, it does.
- It's the rest of the family.

610
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:58,100
Mother pretends she doesn't notice,
but I know it's upset her.

611
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,498
She'll never tell you, so I felt I must.

612
00:48:04,977 --> 00:48:08,208
I'll get out. Take a few days to finish this,
and then I'll leave.

613
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,612
No, Vincent. I didn't mean that.

614
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,646
Of course you did, Willemien.

615
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:17,979
It's all right.

616
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:22,060
I've accomplished
what I stayed here to do...

617
00:48:23,562 --> 00:48:25,928
and maybe it is time to move on.

618
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:31,664
I'm sick and tired of these cheap jokes.
Art is a serious business.

619
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:34,570
And in Paris, at least.
An artist with a new idea should be...

620
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,871
For once I agree with you, Durand-Ruel.
Impressionism is not a joke.

621
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:39,843
It's a cancer and it must be cut out.

622
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,210
Condone anarchism in the arts,
and you seal the doom of France.

623
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:45,181
What would you do?
Padlock the galleries...

624
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,548
- and ship the painters off to Devil's Island?
- No.

625
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:50,918
They don't paint.
They load pistols with tubes of paint...

626
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:52,513
and fire them at the canvas.

627
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:55,025
And then have the audacity
to sign their names...

628
00:48:55,093 --> 00:48:59,757
Cézanne, Signac, Pissarro,
Gauguin, Renoir, Monet.

629
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:02,667
You know these men.
You handled some of them.

630
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,599
Why didn't you tell me about it?

631
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,161
I wrote you in Antwerp.
Don't you read my letters?

632
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,266
But seeing them, the colors,
and what they've done with light.

633
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:15,340
- Is that painting?
- The critics and the public don't think so...

634
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,245
nor do my employers at Goupil's.

635
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:18,782
I can't believe it.

636
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,512
Now, if they're right,
then everything I've done is wrong.

637
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:23,554
Do they really know what they're doing?

638
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:26,386
You've got to meet and talk to them,
see what they think.

639
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,891
That's why I wanted you in Paris.

640
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:30,257
Where can I meet them?
I got so many questions.

641
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:32,728
- At 2:00 in the morning?
- Why not?

642
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:35,995
Listen, take that thing off and settle down.

643
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,492
You live here, you know.

644
00:49:39,404 --> 00:49:42,271
We've got to make a Parisian out of you.

645
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:46,004
You'll have lots of time
to get your answers.

646
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,673
Tomorrow, we'll start with Pissarro.

647
00:49:49,148 --> 00:49:52,675
It's the problem of translating light
into the language of paint.

648
00:49:52,752 --> 00:49:55,619
Those leaves there,
if they were the only thing in sight...

649
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:58,088
they'd have one color, their own.

650
00:49:58,257 --> 00:50:01,021
But the shade and reflection
of everything around...

651
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:04,962
the sky, the earth, the water,
give them more than their own color.

652
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:08,865
That's why, when you paint from nature,
don't fix your eye on any one spot.

653
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:11,062
Take in everything at once.

654
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:13,605
And above all, don't be timid.

655
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:16,100
<i>Trust your first impression.</i>

656
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:37,424
<i>Everything you've been doing,
what we've all been doing; obsolete...</i>

657
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:40,398
<i>the whole lot of us
guessing with every brush stroke...</i>

658
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:44,368
pouring rivers of paint
into haphazard combinations...

659
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:48,271
when actually, everything we're after
can be achieved mathematically.

660
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:50,741
What are you talking about? Seurat again?

661
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,711
Do you really think
a painting can be done by formula?

662
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,977
Can be? Is being done, right here in Paris...

663
00:50:57,517 --> 00:51:00,042
through precise, scientific methods.

664
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:02,246
I don't mix my colors on canvas.

665
00:51:02,321 --> 00:51:05,017
I mix them in the eye of the spectator.

666
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:10,424
Once you accept the phenomenon of
the duration of light in the human retina...

667
00:51:10,496 --> 00:51:12,691
Excuse me. But this is a sunlit exterior.

668
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:14,960
Now, why do you paint it indoors
by gaslight?

669
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:18,197
- I mean, how can you judge your colors?
- Why not?

670
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:21,262
Come on, Seurat,
put him out of his misery.

671
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,242
- I've tried, but he's still in darkness.
- All right, Bernard. Come here.

672
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:30,441
Everything I do is worked out in advance...

673
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:34,412
with mathematical accuracy,
through precise scientific methods.

674
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:36,819
I know exactly
what colors I'm going to use...

675
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,550
before I pick up my brushes.

676
00:51:38,624 --> 00:51:42,355
And my palette is methodically prepared
in the order of the spectrum.

677
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:46,022
As you see, blue, blue-violet,
violet, violet-red...

678
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:47,588
<i>red, red-orange, orange-yellow...</i>

679
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:16,853
Theo.

680
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:24,498
- Can't it wait till morning?
- No, please, I need your help.

681
00:52:24,705 --> 00:52:25,797
Here.

682
00:52:28,175 --> 00:52:30,700
- What is it this time?
- Look at this.

683
00:52:36,116 --> 00:52:37,947
Yes, it's coming along.

684
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,279
It's got a very good sense of light.

685
00:52:42,856 --> 00:52:47,020
- What's the matter? You look terrible.
- Will you be able to sell it?

686
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:50,660
I'll try.

687
00:52:52,332 --> 00:52:56,200
It's hard to sell any of the new painters,
even the ones with some sort of name.

688
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,067
You know how Goupil's begrudges me...

689
00:52:58,138 --> 00:53:00,572
the little space I can get for them
in the back room.

690
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:03,201
Then why don't you leave Goupil's?
Set up for yourself.

691
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:07,509
- Why waste time with idiots like that?
- Vincent, don't tell me how to run my life!

692
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:09,981
It's taken me a long time
to get where I am.

693
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:14,043
It may not be ideal, but, to me,
what I'm doing seems worthwhile.

694
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:17,957
And you don't make it any easier.
I haven't had any sleep for six months.

695
00:53:18,025 --> 00:53:20,084
When people come to the house,
you insult them.

696
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,094
Don't I have a right to express my opinion?

697
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:25,620
This is my home.
You have no right to insult my guests!

698
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,896
Maybe I shouldn't have come to Paris
in the first place.

699
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:44,539
Vincent, all we've got
is what we can give each other.

700
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,847
You know how much joy it would give me
to sell your paintings.

701
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:51,482
I show them whenever I get a chance.

702
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:55,118
But perhaps you should take some
to some other dealer.

703
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,229
The more your work's seen, the better.

704
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,731
Go to Père Tanguy.
I'll talk to him about you.

705
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,700
- Why should...
- See what he can do for you.

706
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:04,635
And show him some of your old work,
not just the new stuff.

707
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:07,196
Is that your way of saying
the new work's no good?

708
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:10,641
Vincent, I'm not going to argue with you
when you're in this mood.

709
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,305
- What mood? All I'm trying...
- Good night.

710
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,041
- Theo!
- Good night!

711
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:26,459
Vincent, it's all good, all of it.

712
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:31,022
The important thing is
that one day it could be sublime.

713
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:37,535
Between then and now,
there's one thing you could do for me.

714
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:40,162
A little thing, that's all I ask.

715
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,736
Let me get a night's sleep.

716
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:52,885
It's still the same. Nothing's changed
since I left here a year ago.

717
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,148
That's right.

718
00:54:54,222 --> 00:54:57,316
You owed us 112 francs then
and you still do!

719
00:54:57,392 --> 00:55:00,259
- Tanguy, remove your wife.
- Get in the back.

720
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:03,024
This man is absolutely correct, Tanguy.

721
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:06,329
You cannot handle painters
and woodpeckers, too.

722
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:10,132
The fact is, my dear friends,
that you are not painters.

723
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,337
You are tattoo artists.

724
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:15,706
You are chemists with little pots of paint.

725
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:18,371
You cover canvases with colored fleas.

726
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:20,846
You are so busy
imitating each other's tricks...

727
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:23,281
you've forgotten what painting is about.

728
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,682
You all make me sick.

729
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:27,812
What doesn't make you sick, Paul,
besides your own work?

730
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:30,881
Would you really like to know? That.

731
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:36,623
Look at that. The clarity, the calm.

732
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:38,961
The Japanese paint
as simply as we breathe.

733
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:41,001
- Maybe they pay for their paints.
- Who is he?

734
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,093
Paul Gauguin.

735
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,333
You have to go halfway around the world
to find something you like?

736
00:55:45,406 --> 00:55:48,933
I don't have to leave this shop.
Look at that. And that.

737
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:53,575
- And that, and that.
- Cézanne.

738
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:56,614
- Yes. Cézanne.
- Yes. Cézanne.

739
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,842
King of the unsaleables.

740
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,445
I suppose you call this painting...

741
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,387
Give me that painting!

742
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,734
Yes. It's direct, it's vigorous.

743
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:16,895
- What's your name?
- Vincent van Gogh.

744
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:19,963
He has a statement to make
and he makes it. Theo's brother?

745
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,305
Glad to know you. It's honest.

746
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:25,908
It owes nothing to anybody. Nothing.

747
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,006
Because it has nothing.
No tone, no values...

748
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,983
- No color relations.
- Sense of space.

749
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:34,681
The little men are at it again.
My friend, will you join me in a drink?

750
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:38,452
- What about the 112 francs?
- Lady, go back to your kitchen.

751
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,322
Get back.

752
00:56:40,928 --> 00:56:45,365
You see, down there the sun invades you,
gets into your blood.

753
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:47,367
Not that Martinique was a paradise.

754
00:56:47,435 --> 00:56:50,893
Between hunger and fever,
I was lucky to get out alive.

755
00:56:51,205 --> 00:56:54,106
But if I could, I'd go back there tomorrow.

756
00:56:55,343 --> 00:56:58,437
- How long you been in Paris?
- Over a year.

757
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:01,311
How can you stand it?
I can't work here. It strangles me.

758
00:57:01,382 --> 00:57:03,350
- Where would you go?
- Brittany.

759
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:07,547
There's a place up there I can stay.
It's just a hole, but it's all I can afford.

760
00:57:07,622 --> 00:57:10,420
Wouldn't you miss your friends in Paris?

761
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:13,289
Friends? A woman or two, maybe.

762
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:16,987
When you start as late as I did,
you find yourself measuring...

763
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:19,555
who and what you give your time to.

764
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:22,132
Friends, comforts, family.

765
00:57:23,437 --> 00:57:27,306
If they interfere with your peace to work,
you cut them off...

766
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:31,873
and you spend the rest of your life
wondering if it was worthwhile.

767
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:37,343
If they're mad enough
to buy Impressionist paintings...

768
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:39,979
it only proves that they're savages.

769
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,382
I haven't seen the place looking so neat
since Vincent came to stay here.

770
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,395
What got into him, cleaning it up like this?

771
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:52,361
I do hope he's out.

772
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:55,369
Never would get any business done
if he's in.

773
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:01,106
What is it?

774
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:04,873
It's from Vincent.

775
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:08,178
"I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you,
and endlessly...

776
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,582
"grateful for all your kindness.

777
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,016
"I've hung a few paintings
to remind you of me."

778
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:16,524
- He's gone?
- He's on his way south to Arles, Provence.

779
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:19,351
"I've thought it over
these past few weeks...

780
00:58:19,428 --> 00:58:22,522
"and decided the time has come
to make a change.

781
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,731
"I want to see nature under a clearer sky.

782
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:29,871
"Have to work by myself for a while."

783
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:34,375
No offense meant, but you'll be better off
without him around your neck.

784
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,307
I think I'm the best judge of that.

785
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:38,744
No, the worst.
You've been pushing his paintings.

786
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:41,180
And every time you do that,
we lose a customer.

787
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,411
As your employer,
I tell you for your own good...

788
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:46,921
your love for Vincent has blinded
your judgment. It's affected your work.

789
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:49,219
Please don't let's wrangle again
about that.

790
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,385
I'll fight for every good painter
who deserves to be recognized...

791
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:55,191
and Vincent is one of them.
He could be the best of them.

792
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:58,028
What? Well, you're his brother.

793
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,363
- You're emotional about him.
- That has nothing to do with it.

794
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:05,167
What is it when you brood about him?
When you agonize over his every failure?

795
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,505
When you support him
to the point of denying yourself?

796
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:12,604
You've saved every letter he wrote
as though it were Holy Scripture.

797
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:16,742
Come now, Theo. Don't you really think
you've done enough for him?

798
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,517
How much is enough...

799
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:24,887
for a man who's struggling with himself
the way Vincent is?

800
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:28,451
I know he's crude, quarrelsome,
and excitable...

801
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,125
but inside that tormented head of his
there's something wonderful.

802
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,658
In those letters, there's a gifted man,
a tender man...

803
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:39,437
and there's far more passionate beauty
and strength in his work...

804
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:43,308
than there is in half the stuff
you see in the museums today.

805
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:46,640
Wonder if there'll ever come
a happy time for him.

806
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:48,910
It seems impossible for him
to have a quiet life.

807
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:52,385
The change may do him good.
Maybe he'll find himself.

808
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:55,582
Or will he only find more loneliness?

809
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,574
This is it.

810
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,310
At that, it's worth
more than you're willing to pay.

811
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,939
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

812
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,611
That'll be 8 francs for the week.

813
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,288
Get these pictures out of here!

814
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,755
- I told you a week ago.
- Don't touch that, you fool!

815
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,349
Can't you see it's still wet?

816
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,623
You're getting paint over everything.
That's why I raised your rent.

817
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,664
You had no right to do it
without telling me.

818
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:17,995
Whoever heard of a storage fee
for using a landing?

819
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,058
- Then get your stuff out of here!
- I will not!

820
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,569
Then pay me!

821
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:43,955
- Allow me.
- No, don't.

822
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,259
With your permission.

823
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:54,694
- Looks like you're moving.
- I'm getting out of that hellhole.

824
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,373
Here. I think you need some help.

825
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,341
That swine of a landlord.

826
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:02,207
Here you are.
I wondered how long you'd stand him.

827
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,946
Where do you think you're going
with all this stuff?

828
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,506
I don't know.

829
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:10,576
You're gonna have to find some place
before night.

830
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,919
I'd ask you to stay with me,
but it's a bit crowded with a wife...

831
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:16,789
- and four kids and one on the way...
- Thanks, anyway.

832
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,760
How'd you like a house?

833
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,029
- Too expensive.
- Perhaps not.

834
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:26,092
Come along, let me do the talking.

835
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:31,440
If there's one thing I hate, it's landlords.

836
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,116
Come along.
You wouldn't want a dump like that.

837
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,950
It should've been pulled down years ago.

838
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,491
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you trying to do to me...

839
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,186
talking like that about my property?

840
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,457
Is that what you're looking for, a house?
This is a fine house.

841
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:57,022
Look, my sister lived in it for 17 years
and then she died. God bless her.

842
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,260
That's what I mean.

843
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,532
Would you want me to show it to you?
How long would you want it for?

844
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,869
He won't want it at all,
not when he's seen it.

845
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,705
Now, look here, mind your own business
or I'll report you.

846
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:10,941
I'll let you have it at a good price, too.
How about 15 francs a month?

847
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,641
You stay out of this.

848
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:16,015
On top of that, I'll let you have
the use of an extra room.

849
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:21,384
<i>A house, Theo. I found a house.</i>

850
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,526
<i>A place of my own
where I can work without a trouble.</i>

851
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,723
<i>And where there's plenty of room.</i>

852
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:36,094
<i>Roulin lent me a mattress to get started,
and I bought some chairs and a bed...</i>

853
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,471
<i>and a few other things
that were necessary.</i>

854
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,000
<i>With this and with what I spent
on paints and canvas...</i>

855
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,775
<i>my money for the month is almost gone.</i>

856
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:46,611
<i>But it was worth it.</i>

857
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,722
<i>Theo, you'd like this house.</i>

858
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:03,429
<i>It's yellow on the outside
and filled with sunshine.</i>

859
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,261
<i>Later, two could live in it.</i>

860
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,530
<i>One day, perhaps, Gauguin will come...</i>

861
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:11,439
<i>and then, who knows,
this might turn into a colony of painters.</i>

862
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:15,269
<i>I'm up at dawn and out on the road.</i>

863
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,782
<i>Now that summer's begun,
it's all very different here...</i>

864
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:27,382
<i>from what it was in the spring.
But I love it even more.</i>

865
01:05:28,026 --> 01:05:31,587
<i>Everywhere is old gold, bronze,
and copper.</i>

866
01:05:50,982 --> 01:05:53,883
<i>I wish you could see
these lovely days here, Theo.</i>

867
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,146
<i>But if not, you shall see pictures of them...</i>

868
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:59,553
<i>for these colors
give me an extraordinary exultation.</i>

869
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:03,656
<i>The whole earth is glowing
under the southern sun.</i>

870
01:06:04,062 --> 01:06:08,556
<i>Lemon yellow, sulfur yellow,
greenish yellow...</i>

871
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,725
<i>all under a sky blanched with heat.</i>

872
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:15,068
<i>What a country it is.</i>

873
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:18,799
<i>It absorbs me so much
that I let myself go...</i>

874
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,742
<i>never thinking of a single rule.</i>

875
01:06:21,813 --> 01:06:24,543
<i>I have no doubts, no limitations.</i>

876
01:06:25,116 --> 01:06:29,553
<i>I'm working like a steam engine,
devouring paints, burning up canvases.</i>

877
01:06:30,088 --> 01:06:33,182
<i>Whole days go by
without my speaking to anyone.</i>

878
01:06:33,624 --> 01:06:37,082
<i>And every day my concentration
becomes more intense...</i>

879
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,822
<i>my hand more sure.</i>

880
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:42,900
<i>I have a power of color in me
that I never had before.</i>

881
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,333
<i>A sense of breadth and strength.</i>

882
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:28,040
<i>The summer has vanished
in a fever of work.</i>

883
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:30,410
<i>And now the mistral is blowing.</i>

884
01:07:30,615 --> 01:07:33,709
<i>Always the wind, restless and unceasing.</i>

885
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:37,885
<i>Sweeping among the dead leaves
in a rage...</i>

886
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,916
<i>so that I'm forced to remain indoors.</i>

887
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:45,585
<i>Now and then,
when the storm inside me gets too loud...</i>

888
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:48,360
<i>I take a glass too much to distract me.</i>

889
01:07:56,308 --> 01:08:00,039
<i>I must watch out for my nerves.
I'm getting haggard, I know.</i>

890
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:02,344
<i>If I go on this way...</i>

891
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:05,412
<i>some day or other there may be a crisis.</i>

892
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,112
<i>Yet I can't stop.</i>

893
01:08:12,624 --> 01:08:15,058
<i>Sometimes I work on into the night.</i>

894
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:18,062
<i>And I'm hardly conscious
of myself anymore...</i>

895
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:23,131
<i>and the pictures come to me
as in a dream, with a terrible lucidity.</i>

896
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:49,852
- What time did he get here?
- About 4:00 this morning.

897
01:09:49,922 --> 01:09:52,584
As usual, two coffees, three absinthes.

898
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:55,126
- Did he eat anything?
- What do you think?

899
01:09:59,097 --> 01:10:01,065
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Roulin.

900
01:10:01,133 --> 01:10:03,260
I brought something for you.
From your brother.

901
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:05,235
What I want to know is,
when do I get paid?

902
01:10:05,304 --> 01:10:09,035
I don't mind carrying him for a day or two,
but this time it's over two weeks.

903
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:11,166
I must be as crazy as he is.

904
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:14,076
What do you think this is, a reading room?

905
01:10:20,353 --> 01:10:22,378
- How much does he owe?
- 13 francs.

906
01:10:22,455 --> 01:10:24,184
Here's 10 francs. Shut up.

907
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:29,891
Now. Here, let me give you a hand.
Come along.

908
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:39,794
Where were you painting last night?

909
01:10:40,106 --> 01:10:44,566
We were looking for you everywhere,
all over the place. Couldn't find you.

910
01:10:45,778 --> 01:10:47,678
- Theo's leaving.
- What?

911
01:10:48,614 --> 01:10:52,175
No, it's good news.
He's getting married.

912
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:55,818
That's wonderful.
Let's go right back and celebrate.

913
01:11:03,663 --> 01:11:05,494
Do you know the girl?

914
01:11:06,265 --> 01:11:08,028
She's a Dutch girl.

915
01:11:08,501 --> 01:11:11,800
He's going to Holland this weekend
to meet her family.

916
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,634
Mother will be happy.

917
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:17,176
She's always wanted
one of us to get married.

918
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,376
When you write your brother,
wish him well from me and my family.

919
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,882
Yes, I will.

920
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,784
Thank you.

921
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:34,618
"But this doesn't mean
that I don't wish you both happiness...

922
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:36,423
"with all my heart.

923
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:40,833
"With your wife,
you won't be Lonely anymore.

924
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,193
"Your house won't be empty."

925
01:11:43,269 --> 01:11:45,601
He must be so alone down there.

926
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:49,273
You two have always been so close.

927
01:11:49,475 --> 01:11:52,535
Is there anything we can do, Theo,
to help him?

928
01:11:52,745 --> 01:11:54,269
I wish I knew.

929
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:58,675
If only I could sell something of his.
Just one, that'd be a help.

930
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:01,209
Heaven knows I've tried.

931
01:12:02,522 --> 01:12:04,888
He asks about Gauguin again, too.

932
01:12:04,957 --> 01:12:07,653
He wants me to persuade him
to go down there.

933
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:09,718
- Gauguin?
- It might work.

934
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,422
When they were here last winter,
they seemed to get on.

935
01:12:14,534 --> 01:12:17,594
Vincent was one of the few people
Paul didn't attack.

936
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,069
Perhaps if they were together...

937
01:12:19,138 --> 01:12:23,472
If Vincent could have someone with him,
to whom he could pour out his heart.

938
01:12:23,543 --> 01:12:25,010
Another painter.

939
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:28,013
- Do you think Gauguin would do it?
- He might.

940
01:12:29,282 --> 01:12:33,275
I'd have to send him some money.
Enough to pay his debts in Brittany...

941
01:12:33,352 --> 01:12:35,377
and get him down to Arles.

942
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,057
It could be the solution for both of them.

943
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:14,451
- Vincent!
- Paul?

944
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:22,460
- You're here. You're really here.
- Yes, I'm here.

945
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:25,266
You're a day early.
Theo told me you wouldn't come till...

946
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:27,739
Here, let me take these things.
Come on up, Paul.

947
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:29,537
Did you have trouble finding the place?

948
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,544
Your painting things are here,
and canvases.

949
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:33,807
They arrived the day before yesterday.

950
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:36,509
I fixed this room up for you.

951
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,322
- It's very nice.
- Thanks.

952
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,314
I painted them for you.

953
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:12,978
That's very friendly of you, Vincent.

954
01:14:21,895 --> 01:14:23,419
That's very friendly.

955
01:14:23,564 --> 01:14:25,031
Have you had anything to eat?

956
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:27,623
Come on downstairs.
I've got something on the stove.

957
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:31,000
I can't wait to see the things
you did in Brittany.

958
01:14:33,974 --> 01:14:37,569
- I think you'll be interested.
- The way you wrote about them.

959
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:41,341
I may have hit something there
I never quite got before.

960
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:42,712
Sounds wonderful.

961
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:45,183
It was all I could do
to keep from opening them up...

962
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:47,015
and looking at them.

963
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:58,030
- Be ready in just a minute.
- Take your time.

964
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:23,780
I see you've been working.

965
01:15:23,858 --> 01:15:26,918
That's not difficult
in this part of the world.

966
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:28,859
- I can't tell you, Paul.
- Yeah.

967
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,591
You'll see for yourself.

968
01:15:30,665 --> 01:15:34,692
In the morning, you open the window,
see, there's the green of the gardens.

969
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:38,705
Wait till you see the yellow fields at noon
under the full sun.

970
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,238
And the light, you wouldn't believe it...

971
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:44,004
but all the time,
these yellows are really here.

972
01:15:44,078 --> 01:15:46,478
Everywhere you look,
there's something to paint.

973
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:50,244
What an artist like you would do out here.
We'll go out this afternoon.

974
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:53,947
Wait a minute. I'm not one of
those painters that gets off the train...

975
01:15:54,022 --> 01:15:57,788
and turns out a sunlight effect
before he's even unpacked his bags.

976
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:00,692
Paul, show me the Brittany paintings.

977
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:04,863
There's plenty of time for that.

978
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,232
- Come on, let's eat.
- All right.

979
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:18,638
A little heavy on the turpentine, isn't it?

980
01:16:18,713 --> 01:16:20,704
What did you do,
boil some old paint tubes?

981
01:16:20,782 --> 01:16:22,306
Smells like it.

982
01:16:22,383 --> 01:16:25,284
Vincent, from now on
you better let me do the cooking.

983
01:16:25,353 --> 01:16:26,411
All right.

984
01:16:26,487 --> 01:16:29,615
Even my worst enemies
won't deny me that talent.

985
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:33,493
Do you really have to live like this?

986
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:35,961
- What do you mean?
- Look at it. How can you stand it?

987
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:39,591
Look at the paint in those brushes.
How can you work this way? It's a mess.

988
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:42,397
If we're going to live together,
might as well start right.

989
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:45,098
- Let's get this place in order.
- Show me the paintings.

990
01:16:45,173 --> 01:16:46,197
That can wait.

991
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:50,438
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's confusion, mental or physical.

992
01:17:03,825 --> 01:17:07,192
There. Now, this'll have to last us
till the first.

993
01:17:07,295 --> 01:17:09,627
After that, everything Theo sends us
every month:

994
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:11,756
Your allowance,
his advance on my paintings...

995
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:14,859
goes into this box.
Anything we spend, we write down.

996
01:17:14,936 --> 01:17:18,428
So much for food, so much for drink,
for tobacco and other relaxation.

997
01:17:18,506 --> 01:17:22,101
That way there'll be no more starving
at the end of each month. Understood?

998
01:17:22,176 --> 01:17:23,575
Understood.

999
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:26,512
I still can't believe you're here.

1000
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:30,278
Before you came here,
I was a little frightened.

1001
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:32,683
I'd been alone so long that...

1002
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,585
I hope you, too, will find
what you want here, Paul.

1003
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:38,784
A chance to create in peace.

1004
01:17:39,127 --> 01:17:42,563
This could be just the beginning.
We could get other painters here.

1005
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:46,623
Make a colony of it. A studio of the south,
with you at its head.

1006
01:17:47,435 --> 01:17:50,302
- A Father Superior?
- As its guiding force.

1007
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:55,432
I thought maybe we'd ask Bernard
and Lautrec, only he'd never leave Paris.

1008
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,544
- And Signac.
- Haven't you heard?

1009
01:17:57,612 --> 01:18:00,980
I've dismissed Mr. Signac
from the legion of my devoted admirers.

1010
01:18:01,049 --> 01:18:02,277
He bores me.

1011
01:18:02,351 --> 01:18:04,216
What about Guillaumin and Seurat?

1012
01:18:04,286 --> 01:18:06,345
- You know what I think of Seurat.
- He's so ill.

1013
01:18:06,422 --> 01:18:08,982
- This place would do him good.
- It wouldn't do me good.

1014
01:18:09,057 --> 01:18:11,184
I don't want that kind of painting
around me.

1015
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,286
Vincent, I've just spent a year
beating my brains out.

1016
01:18:14,363 --> 01:18:16,661
I've sacrificed everything:
Execution, effect...

1017
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:19,895
all the things that come easiest to me,
for a style.

1018
01:18:19,968 --> 01:18:22,766
A style that'll convey the mood
of what I see...

1019
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:26,137
the idea, without regard
for concrete reality.

1020
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:28,141
What do you paint, then?

1021
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:31,805
What's in my head.
Art's an abstraction, not a picture book.

1022
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,043
A painting is a flat surface
covered with lines and colors...

1023
01:18:35,117 --> 01:18:37,142
arranged in certain order.

1024
01:18:37,219 --> 01:18:40,677
Yeah, but what about the arrangements
that exist in nature?

1025
01:18:40,756 --> 01:18:44,590
I choose to disregard nature.
What I'm after are harmonies...

1026
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:49,321
harmonies of pure color, deliberately
composed and carefully calculated...

1027
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:51,866
that move you as music moves you.

1028
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:54,198
But then you deny
the greatest artists of all:

1029
01:18:54,269 --> 01:18:57,238
Rembrandt, Rubens, Delacroix, Millet...

1030
01:18:57,306 --> 01:18:58,534
Millet?

1031
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:03,976
Millet! That calendar artist
with his dun-colored tones...

1032
01:19:04,046 --> 01:19:07,482
- and sentimental insipidities.
- How dare you say that?

1033
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:11,383
Millet's one of the few artists
that ever really captured the human spirit.

1034
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:13,683
Here. In the dignity of toil.

1035
01:19:14,223 --> 01:19:16,521
Millet uses paint
to express the word of God.

1036
01:19:16,592 --> 01:19:18,890
Then he should have been a preacher,
not a painter.

1037
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:22,192
If there's one thing I despise,
it's emotionalism in painting.

1038
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:26,360
- Vincent, painting is for painters.
- Like your friend Degas, I suppose...

1039
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:29,768
who's done nothing but ballet dancers
and racehorses for 10 years.

1040
01:19:29,838 --> 01:19:31,863
You can learn from him.
You can learn control!

1041
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,408
I don't want control!
I'm not afraid of emotion.

1042
01:19:34,476 --> 01:19:37,570
When I paint the sun,
I want the people to feel it revolving...

1043
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:38,874
giving off light and heat.

1044
01:19:38,947 --> 01:19:39,971
When I paint a peasant...

1045
01:19:40,048 --> 01:19:43,245
I want to feel the sun pouring into him
like it does into the corn...

1046
01:19:43,318 --> 01:19:45,479
Is that what you do
when you overload your brush?

1047
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:47,044
When you slap paint on like putty?

1048
01:19:47,122 --> 01:19:49,147
When you make your trees
writhe like snakes...

1049
01:19:49,224 --> 01:19:51,021
and your sun explode all over the canvas?

1050
01:19:51,093 --> 01:19:54,893
What I see when I look at your work
is that you paint too fast!

1051
01:19:54,963 --> 01:19:56,624
You look too fast!

1052
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:02,496
Whatever you say, brigadier.

1053
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,503
Maybe you're right.

1054
01:20:09,578 --> 01:20:11,705
Maybe we need another drink.

1055
01:20:19,588 --> 01:20:21,215
I'm sorry, Paul.

1056
01:20:30,232 --> 01:20:34,329
Look, Paul, when I painted The Night Café,
I tried to show evil.

1057
01:20:34,404 --> 01:20:36,668
The most violent passions of humanity.

1058
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:39,401
I painted it blood red and dark yellow.

1059
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:43,375
And a green billiard table in the middle.

1060
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,611
Four lemon-yellow lamps...

1061
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:49,174
with a glare of orange and green...

1062
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:54,186
in an atmosphere of pale sulfur,
like a furnace.

1063
01:20:54,591 --> 01:20:59,085
I tried to show a place
where a man can ruin himself...

1064
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,227
go mad...

1065
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,024
commit a crime.

1066
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:14,776
What's all of this talk
about Arlesian women?

1067
01:21:15,144 --> 01:21:18,580
- I haven't seen a good one yet.
- They must have heard you were coming...

1068
01:21:18,648 --> 01:21:20,013
- and they locked them up.
- Yeah.

1069
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,643
Wait till you see.
There's something about them...

1070
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,880
the way they carry themselves...

1071
01:21:24,954 --> 01:21:28,685
even the old ones,
a certain classic grace and dignity.

1072
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:31,693
Dignity? I'm talking about women, man.
Women.

1073
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:36,194
I like them fat, vicious, and not too smart.
Nothing spiritual, either.

1074
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:39,862
To have to say "I love you"
would break my teeth.

1075
01:21:41,304 --> 01:21:43,329
I don't want to be loved.

1076
01:21:44,841 --> 01:21:46,968
You really mean that, Paul.

1077
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:52,178
Let's get out of here.
Show me the rest of the town.

1078
01:22:20,743 --> 01:22:22,836
Wait a minute. Here.

1079
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:26,780
You pig! Kill him! Tear him apart!

1080
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:29,084
You pig!

1081
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:32,019
You didn't tell me the ballet was in town.

1082
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:38,388
Wait a minute. You're tired.

1083
01:22:48,071 --> 01:22:50,437
There. That's more like it.

1084
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,570
Now the town's coming to life.

1085
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,640
Come on. Stop it.
Stop that. Get her out of here.

1086
01:23:00,783 --> 01:23:04,275
And you, I don't want any more trouble
in this place. See?

1087
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:06,151
Come on, now get out.

1088
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:18,800
I told the Captain
I wouldn't return until tomorrow.

1089
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,360
- Pierre.
- Hello, Vincent, my friend.

1090
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:28,102
- Hello, redhead. Where have you been?
- Hello, Rachel.

1091
01:23:28,178 --> 01:23:31,636
- I thought you must have gone away.
- I've been working.

1092
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,813
What's the matter?
Don't you like me anymore?

1093
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,079
Hi. Buy me a drink?

1094
01:23:36,153 --> 01:23:39,850
My friend's come to town.
I've been getting the place ready for him.

1095
01:23:40,124 --> 01:23:43,252
- That tough?
- No, he's a painter, like me.

1096
01:23:46,363 --> 01:23:47,762
Thanks, sir.

1097
01:23:48,665 --> 01:23:51,532
- He's not like you, redhead.
- Hey, Vincent.

1098
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:55,238
Look, a masterpiece,
direct from the salons. See?

1099
01:23:55,939 --> 01:23:59,875
Symbolism. Better send it to Theo
before the Louvre grabs it.

1100
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:03,068
Paul, this is Rachel.

1101
01:24:07,518 --> 01:24:09,611
Vincent, why do I do it?

1102
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,787
Here I pride myself
on my sense of logic and order...

1103
01:24:14,191 --> 01:24:16,159
and inside I'm a savage.

1104
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:20,290
I have this attraction to violence.

1105
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:23,963
Violence makes me sick.

1106
01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:26,559
I have too much inside me. I'm afraid of it.

1107
01:24:26,637 --> 01:24:29,504
That's why I let it out before it hurts me.

1108
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,501
Last winter in Martinique...

1109
01:24:32,876 --> 01:24:37,279
I got into a fight with some sailors.
I was in the hospital for a month.

1110
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,178
But it was worth it.
Even that piddling brawl out there...

1111
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:43,082
made me feel better than I have in weeks.

1112
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:44,245
And I know why.

1113
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:46,881
Because suddenly
there's something in front of you...

1114
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,390
something you can hit at.

1115
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:51,325
He stands there, you smash his teeth in,
or he does it to you.

1116
01:24:51,395 --> 01:24:54,489
Either way, it's all right.
There's a decision.

1117
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:57,533
- Two absinthes.
- Right away.

1118
01:24:57,601 --> 01:24:59,193
Three absinthes.

1119
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,318
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, brigadier.

1120
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:27,722
<i>Dear Theo, I'm so happy
to have Gauguin here.</i>

1121
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:30,166
<i>Not to be alone anymore.</i>

1122
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,494
<i>It's of tremendous value to me
to see him work.</i>

1123
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:36,968
<i>He's a very great artist, and a good friend.</i>

1124
01:25:37,474 --> 01:25:38,600
Paul.

1125
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:43,142
It doesn't seem to work. Doesn't work.

1126
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:47,146
Paul, could you come over
and take a look?

1127
01:25:47,218 --> 01:25:49,948
Vincent, I'm trying to catch this light.

1128
01:25:50,388 --> 01:25:54,552
I remember what you said.
I soften my colors, I try to control them.

1129
01:25:55,093 --> 01:25:58,187
- Then I lose everything.
- Go back and try again.

1130
01:25:58,396 --> 01:26:02,526
That's what I mean.
You see how pale and thin that sky is?

1131
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:05,898
You use the same brush strokes all over.

1132
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:10,441
- It's got no texture, no energy. It's all flat.
- That's the way I see it!

1133
01:26:10,608 --> 01:26:11,734
Flat!

1134
01:26:16,681 --> 01:26:19,673
<i>We argue, of course,
mainly about painting.</i>

1135
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,679
<i>And our arguments are so electric...</i>

1136
01:26:23,755 --> 01:26:27,088
<i>that I come out of them often
with my brain tired...</i>

1137
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:29,126
<i>like a run-down battery.</i>

1138
01:26:44,542 --> 01:26:47,375
- What are you nervous about?
- We should be out there working.

1139
01:26:47,445 --> 01:26:49,242
- Look at that sunlight, Gauguin.
- Yeah.

1140
01:26:49,314 --> 01:26:52,806
- Listen to that wind.
- Wind doesn't show in a painting.

1141
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,921
- What about it?
- I'm doing fine right here...

1142
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,990
or I would be if you'd only like some place.

1143
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:02,353
I'm tired of being cooped up here.

1144
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:04,691
It wouldn't hurt you to work inside
for once.

1145
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:08,459
- Use your imagination, invent.
- Why should I invent here...

1146
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:10,831
when nature does it so much better
out there?

1147
01:27:10,902 --> 01:27:13,530
Go out there then, who's stopping you?

1148
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:40,730
This is ridiculous. I can't work like this!

1149
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:43,196
Tie down your easel.

1150
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:47,267
No wonder they call you crazy
around here.

1151
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:50,837
Come on, Vincent, let's get out of here.

1152
01:27:50,908 --> 01:27:53,399
Give it up! You can't paint in this gale.

1153
01:27:53,478 --> 01:27:56,641
- I've done it plenty of times.
- Yes, and I've seen the results.

1154
01:27:56,714 --> 01:27:58,739
I'm going back. I'm sick of all this.

1155
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:03,412
The sun burns the eyes out of your head.
The stinking mistral blows you to pieces.

1156
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:08,050
I'm sick of this whole miserable
countryside. And that house, too.

1157
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,752
I don't know what I'm doing here
or why I ever came.

1158
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:13,228
If that's the way you feel,
then why don't you leave?

1159
01:28:13,297 --> 01:28:16,893
Do you want to know why?
Because I haven't got the money.

1160
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:23,173
Paul!

1161
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:54,899
- Our money from Theo.
- Yeah.

1162
01:29:12,524 --> 01:29:15,721
- Can I pour you a drink, Paul?
- No, thanks.

1163
01:29:26,371 --> 01:29:30,774
Paul, all the way home, I kept thinking...

1164
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:36,105
I wonder, Paul, if only we'd tried a little.

1165
01:29:36,315 --> 01:29:39,148
If we'd made some effort
to remain friends...

1166
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:41,686
if it wouldn't have been better
for both of us.

1167
01:29:41,753 --> 01:29:43,653
I see you finished it.

1168
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:46,723
Yes, because, Paul, when you look back...

1169
01:29:47,593 --> 01:29:50,323
so much of life is wasted in Loneliness.

1170
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:54,160
There's not one of us
that doesn't need friends...

1171
01:29:55,734 --> 01:29:58,828
companionship, attachments.

1172
01:29:58,904 --> 01:30:02,567
I can do without attachments.
I've learned to avoid them.

1173
01:30:03,142 --> 01:30:07,010
How can you say that, Paul?
I mean, even you have your family.

1174
01:30:07,212 --> 01:30:11,239
Do you ever think of them?
Your children, you see them so seldom.

1175
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:13,417
Mind your own business.

1176
01:30:13,752 --> 01:30:15,777
Paul, all I mean is that...

1177
01:30:16,788 --> 01:30:19,985
you, too, must have times
when you have a terrible...

1178
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,059
Why don't you shut up?

1179
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:25,059
If you have to slobber, don't do it over me.

1180
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:27,894
You'll have no trouble finding subjects.

1181
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,330
You mourn over a pair of old shoes.

1182
01:30:30,402 --> 01:30:33,132
<i>You cry when you read Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

1183
01:30:33,205 --> 01:30:36,038
You bleed with Millet
over the nobility of toil.

1184
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:40,044
For weeks I've been listening to that slop,
and I'm tired of it!

1185
01:30:40,379 --> 01:30:42,540
What do you know about toil?

1186
01:30:42,814 --> 01:30:46,079
When have you done
a stroke of manual labor in your life?

1187
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:50,418
I have. I've dug ditches
in the stinking heat of the Tropics.

1188
01:30:50,557 --> 01:30:52,616
I've worked on the docks
in weather so cold...

1189
01:30:52,692 --> 01:30:54,683
my hands froze to the ropes.

1190
01:30:54,761 --> 01:30:58,197
And I can tell you there's nothing noble
or beautiful about it.

1191
01:30:58,298 --> 01:31:00,858
I did it so I could go on painting!

1192
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:03,829
I didn't have a brother to support me!

1193
01:31:15,982 --> 01:31:18,007
Don't ever do that again.

1194
01:31:19,552 --> 01:31:21,577
Paul, where are you going?

1195
01:31:21,654 --> 01:31:23,622
I'm getting out
before one of us gets killed.

1196
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:25,351
- Don't go.
- I'll be back for my things.

1197
01:31:25,425 --> 01:31:28,622
Please don't go. If you only knew
how Lonely I was before you came.

1198
01:31:28,695 --> 01:31:32,324
I know all about Loneliness.
Only, I don't whine about it.

1199
01:34:11,258 --> 01:34:14,421
- What's your name?
- Gauguin.

1200
01:34:24,037 --> 01:34:26,062
Your friend is in there...

1201
01:34:27,975 --> 01:34:29,169
dying.

1202
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,094
- Why haven't you sent for the doctor?
- There's one on the way.

1203
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:54,023
- What happened?
- His ear's been slashed off.

1204
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:01,664
- What went on last night?
- I don't know. I wasn't here.

1205
01:35:02,242 --> 01:35:03,732
You live here.

1206
01:35:04,378 --> 01:35:06,073
Why did you leave?

1207
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,505
- Did you two have a fight?
- Look, I...

1208
01:35:09,783 --> 01:35:11,978
Inspector, the doctor's here.

1209
01:35:13,387 --> 01:35:15,878
- Inspector.
- Right this way, Doctor.

1210
01:35:18,592 --> 01:35:20,787
- When did you find him?
- About an hour ago.

1211
01:35:20,861 --> 01:35:23,728
- Has he been conscious at all?
- Not at all.

1212
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:31,100
It's a wonder he didn't bleed to death.

1213
01:35:31,171 --> 01:35:33,935
- Self-inflicted, Doctor?
- Looks that way.

1214
01:35:34,675 --> 01:35:36,108
What do you think, Doc?

1215
01:35:36,176 --> 01:35:39,111
Don't worry. You won't have
a corpse on your hands.

1216
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:42,205
The thing is to get it cauterized
and cleaned.

1217
01:35:42,516 --> 01:35:46,247
<i>- Gendarme, water and towels, please.
- Right away, sir.</i>

1218
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:50,619
You might as well know
that man's unbalanced.

1219
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:53,660
Don't take my word for it.
Ask anyone around.

1220
01:35:53,727 --> 01:35:55,456
Last night, he got worse.

1221
01:35:55,529 --> 01:35:58,988
Just my being here
seemed to drive him out of his mind.

1222
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:03,561
If I'm here when he comes to,
and he sees me, after all that's happened...

1223
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:05,663
it could be fatal to him.

1224
01:36:06,941 --> 01:36:09,466
Will you need me for anything more?

1225
01:36:10,478 --> 01:36:12,105
No, I guess not.

1226
01:36:13,014 --> 01:36:15,005
I'll notify his brother.

1227
01:36:41,976 --> 01:36:43,876
What do you want here?

1228
01:36:43,945 --> 01:36:47,381
Nothing better to do than hang around
cluttering up the square?

1229
01:36:47,782 --> 01:36:50,307
Why don't you go home
and leave the man alone?

1230
01:36:50,385 --> 01:36:52,546
He's sick and he needs rest!

1231
01:36:53,254 --> 01:36:56,553
This is no sideshow!
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

1232
01:36:56,624 --> 01:36:58,319
Go on home! Go on!

1233
01:37:30,124 --> 01:37:31,682
Leave me alone!

1234
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,591
- Come on, redhead!
- Leave me alone!

1235
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:39,427
What happened to the other ear?

1236
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:25,605
Vincent, I've just been with Dr. Rey.

1237
01:38:25,813 --> 01:38:27,747
You're doing very well.

1238
01:38:28,349 --> 01:38:30,614
Quite soon, now, you'll be able to travel.

1239
01:38:30,686 --> 01:38:33,120
- Johanna and I want you to...
- Theo.

1240
01:38:34,456 --> 01:38:36,822
I want to have myself committed.

1241
01:38:36,992 --> 01:38:39,051
I want to go to an asylum.

1242
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:41,789
I have to, Theo.

1243
01:38:42,331 --> 01:38:44,856
One more of these attacks
could leave me helpless...

1244
01:38:44,933 --> 01:38:46,901
like a crab on its back.

1245
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:50,828
Unable even to do away with myself.

1246
01:38:54,043 --> 01:38:57,809
You could come and live with us
in Paris and have a reasonable life.

1247
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,144
I'll see that none of this
ever happens again.

1248
01:39:00,215 --> 01:39:01,580
How, Theo?

1249
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:04,676
Will you and Johanna
take turns watching me...

1250
01:39:05,187 --> 01:39:08,156
to make sure
the symptoms aren't coming back?

1251
01:39:08,924 --> 01:39:10,949
When your baby's born...

1252
01:39:13,162 --> 01:39:17,258
I'm a danger to others,
I'm a danger to myself.

1253
01:39:18,267 --> 01:39:22,067
Believe me, I'll be better off in an asylum.

1254
01:39:22,538 --> 01:39:25,837
Vincent, don't. You mustn't think like that.

1255
01:39:27,142 --> 01:39:29,610
Find a place for me to go. Please.

1256
01:39:33,882 --> 01:39:37,340
Don't be sad. It won't be for long.

1257
01:39:39,021 --> 01:39:42,684
Just long enough for me
to find a little order in my life.

1258
01:39:43,192 --> 01:39:44,750
A little peace.

1259
01:40:41,183 --> 01:40:44,516
Yes, your brother has stated the case
most clearly...

1260
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:48,613
including the fact that you have
voluntarily committed yourself here.

1261
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:52,353
Now, you know, mental disease
is no different from any other ailment...

1262
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:53,826
you might have contracted.

1263
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:57,024
And these hallucinations you speak of,
once you recognize them...

1264
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:59,932
as the normal accompaniment
of disturbances of this sort...

1265
01:41:00,002 --> 01:41:02,596
whether congenital or acquired...

1266
01:41:02,671 --> 01:41:06,938
once you accept your state for what it is,
half the terror has gone out of it.

1267
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:09,069
- You do see that, don't you?
- Of course.

1268
01:41:10,213 --> 01:41:12,841
Beyond that, peace and rest.

1269
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:16,317
Regular routine in agreeable surroundings.

1270
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:20,020
You know, in this entire institution
at the moment...

1271
01:41:20,089 --> 01:41:22,819
we've no more than11 male patients.

1272
01:41:23,726 --> 01:41:26,991
The food is plain but healthy.

1273
01:41:27,063 --> 01:41:30,191
And above all, it is quiet. Yes.

1274
01:41:31,201 --> 01:41:32,930
Yes, it is quiet.

1275
01:41:35,205 --> 01:41:37,730
Now, here is our superintendent.

1276
01:41:38,141 --> 01:41:41,474
And this is Mr. Vincent van Gogh
from Holland.

1277
01:41:41,544 --> 01:41:44,012
Now, why don't you
take Mr. Van Gogh to his room...

1278
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,378
and let him know
some of our rules and habits.

1279
01:41:46,449 --> 01:41:50,112
No, we'll store those away for you
for a little while...

1280
01:41:50,186 --> 01:41:52,984
until you see what you need. Yes.

1281
01:41:53,957 --> 01:41:56,425
Meanwhile, any time you need me...

1282
01:42:16,246 --> 01:42:18,271
...mutilated his left ear.

1283
01:42:19,549 --> 01:42:21,483
In view of the above...

1284
01:42:22,652 --> 01:42:25,951
and in the light of my examination
of the patient...

1285
01:42:27,123 --> 01:42:29,489
it is my professional opinion...

1286
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:32,661
<i>that it will be necessary
for Mr. Van Gogh...</i>

1287
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:36,593
<i>to undergo extended observation
and treatment...</i>

1288
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:38,896
<i>in this institution.</i>

1289
01:42:38,968 --> 01:42:43,132
<i>Signed, Dr. Peyron,
dated Saint-Rémy, May 9, 1889.</i>

1290
01:42:46,276 --> 01:42:49,939
Van Gogh, Vincent, June 14.

1291
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:53,874
The patient's condition
appears satisfactory...

1292
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,377
with continued improvement.

1293
01:42:58,688 --> 01:43:03,421
Continues to suffer, however,
from a condition of chronic inertia...

1294
01:43:04,127 --> 01:43:07,221
<i>accompanied by symptoms
of extreme terror.</i>

1295
01:43:12,502 --> 01:43:15,130
Would you like me to open the window?

1296
01:43:24,147 --> 01:43:26,377
The view is lovely from here.

1297
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:42,687
General condition of patient: Fair.

1298
01:43:47,104 --> 01:43:48,503
Non-violent.

1299
01:43:51,742 --> 01:43:54,836
<i>He has requested
that his painting equipment...</i>

1300
01:43:55,012 --> 01:43:57,139
<i>and other personal effects...</i>

1301
01:43:57,214 --> 01:43:59,079
<i>be placed in his room.</i>

1302
01:43:59,283 --> 01:44:00,910
<i>Request granted.</i>

1303
01:44:42,626 --> 01:44:44,184
It's beautiful.

1304
01:44:46,497 --> 01:44:50,866
But the mower? Is he imaginary?
There's no one in that field.

1305
01:44:51,301 --> 01:44:55,169
That's just any man struggling in the heat
to finish his work.

1306
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,432
It's the figure of death.

1307
01:45:02,813 --> 01:45:06,681
- It doesn't seem a sad death.
- It's not, Sister.

1308
01:45:07,418 --> 01:45:09,978
It happens in the bright daylight...

1309
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:14,651
with the sun flooding everything
in a light of pure gold.

1310
01:45:26,437 --> 01:45:30,601
It would appear
that painting is beneficial...

1311
01:45:31,675 --> 01:45:34,075
perhaps even necessary...

1312
01:45:35,012 --> 01:45:37,242
<i>for this patient's well-being.</i>

1313
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,477
<i>Provided, of course...</i>

1314
01:45:40,551 --> 01:45:43,111
<i>that he is not permitted to indulge...</i>

1315
01:45:43,187 --> 01:45:46,588
<i>in those excesses of work and emotion...</i>

1316
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:50,351
<i>that induced his former crisis.</i>

1317
01:46:52,457 --> 01:46:56,826
This latest seizure was the most severe...

1318
01:46:58,196 --> 01:46:59,754
and prolonged...

1319
01:47:00,131 --> 01:47:03,100
that your brother has suffered to date.

1320
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:09,670
As a result of constant attention...

1321
01:47:11,009 --> 01:47:12,704
and observation...

1322
01:47:13,011 --> 01:47:16,777
he is today approaching physical recovery.

1323
01:47:17,015 --> 01:47:21,816
He now expresses the desire
to leave this institution...

1324
01:47:23,621 --> 01:47:27,022
with the intention of taking up residence
in the north.

1325
01:47:28,826 --> 01:47:32,353
And since you support him...

1326
01:47:33,064 --> 01:47:34,759
in this request...

1327
01:47:39,003 --> 01:47:40,994
he will be discharged...

1328
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,201
as soon as he is considered fit to travel.

1329
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:02,989
- Vincent.
- Hello, Johanna.

1330
01:48:04,796 --> 01:48:07,492
- It's good to see you.
- It's about time.

1331
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,998
You're just as pretty as I thought you'd be.

1332
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:12,934
Don't you think he looks well, Theo?

1333
01:48:13,004 --> 01:48:15,165
- He looks better than I do.
- Where's that baby?

1334
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,606
- When do I get to see him?
- He's asleep...

1335
01:48:17,675 --> 01:48:20,235
but since he's your namesake,
you can go in.

1336
01:48:20,311 --> 01:48:21,972
You try and keep me out.

1337
01:48:22,046 --> 01:48:25,038
I brought him a little present.
I hope he likes it.

1338
01:48:25,116 --> 01:48:28,210
- There's your nephew.
- He's a real van Gogh.

1339
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:31,777
When Willemien was here, she said
he looked more like Father than anyone.

1340
01:48:31,856 --> 01:48:34,586
No, there's some of Johanna in him.
Look at those hands...

1341
01:48:34,659 --> 01:48:38,652
- and see how well-behaved he is.
- Just wait till he gets hungry.

1342
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:42,392
Vincent! Are you all right?

1343
01:48:43,468 --> 01:48:44,992
Come sit down.

1344
01:48:46,105 --> 01:48:47,902
You'll be all right.

1345
01:48:49,508 --> 01:48:53,274
I'm fine. I was dizzy for a moment.

1346
01:48:54,246 --> 01:48:56,714
- You're tired.
- I'll get you some coffee.

1347
01:48:56,782 --> 01:48:58,409
Thanks, Johanna.

1348
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:02,385
I'm all right, really. It was a long trip.

1349
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:08,555
I left the best news until you got here.

1350
01:49:08,794 --> 01:49:11,661
- Your painting of The Red Vineyard.
- What about it?

1351
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,823
It sold for 400 francs.

1352
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:15,389
Who bought it?

1353
01:49:15,901 --> 01:49:19,359
A painter. Anna Bock.
She lives in Brussels.

1354
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:21,666
That's fine. I'm glad...

1355
01:49:26,312 --> 01:49:29,406
Theo, I had no idea
I'd sent you so much stuff.

1356
01:49:31,684 --> 01:49:33,515
It certainly adds up.

1357
01:49:34,887 --> 01:49:37,515
I've hardly given you room
to move around.

1358
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:40,615
We still have some space
to squeeze a few people in here.

1359
01:49:40,693 --> 01:49:45,027
As a matter of fact, I was thinking of
asking some of your friends over tonight.

1360
01:49:45,297 --> 01:49:47,959
- Where's Paul?
- He's in Brittany.

1361
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:51,169
But Lautrec, Pissarro, Bernard,
they want to see you.

1362
01:49:51,236 --> 01:49:53,761
We ought to celebrate your first sale.

1363
01:49:53,839 --> 01:49:55,966
Or would you rather leave it till later?

1364
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:57,736
No, make it tonight.

1365
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:01,302
I think the sooner I get settled in Auvers,
the better.

1366
01:50:01,413 --> 01:50:04,382
It isn't as if I were going a long ways off.

1367
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:07,544
Why, you can all come out and see me
on Sunday.

1368
01:50:07,986 --> 01:50:11,717
Is everything set there with Dr. Gachet?

1369
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:14,384
- Is he expecting me?
- Pissarro made all the arrangements.

1370
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,087
They were here together last week.

1371
01:50:16,161 --> 01:50:19,494
- Did they see my new things?
- Gachet got so excited.

1372
01:50:19,932 --> 01:50:22,958
He wouldn't leave
until I'd lent him a couple.

1373
01:50:27,172 --> 01:50:31,006
- Did you explain to him about me?
- Yes, Vincent, I did.

1374
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:33,178
He seems very confident.

1375
01:50:33,345 --> 01:50:36,974
Thanks, Johanna. Good Dutch cookies.

1376
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:41,950
I don't understand you, Theo. With such
fine Dutch cooking in the house...

1377
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:46,184
you know it's about time you
put some flesh on those bones of yours.

1378
01:50:46,992 --> 01:50:51,053
I'm really very hopeful, Vincent.
Dr. Gachet's got a very good name...

1379
01:50:51,296 --> 01:50:52,524
<i>and he says that...</i>

1380
01:50:54,199 --> 01:50:56,565
Dr. Gachet, you see,
that's what I have to know.

1381
01:50:56,635 --> 01:50:58,967
Will there be a warning?
Will I have time to...

1382
01:50:59,037 --> 01:51:02,063
About those seizures of yours,
do you want my opinion?

1383
01:51:02,141 --> 01:51:06,077
Forget them, completely.
Tell yourself you're finished with them...

1384
01:51:06,145 --> 01:51:08,739
and work boldly and joyously.

1385
01:51:09,214 --> 01:51:11,774
Vincent, you don't know
how lucky you are.

1386
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:14,683
To have done one painting
like that cypress in there...

1387
01:51:14,753 --> 01:51:17,221
or those sunflowers
that your brother showed me...

1388
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:19,257
I'd give 10 years of my life.

1389
01:51:19,324 --> 01:51:22,954
- Don't you like your wine?
- I don't drink much these days.

1390
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:27,329
Yes, for a painter,
work is the only medicine there is.

1391
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,595
And this is the place for it.

1392
01:51:30,203 --> 01:51:31,431
Come in.

1393
01:51:32,772 --> 01:51:34,967
Cézanne's. Do you recognize it?

1394
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:37,073
He painted it right in this room...

1395
01:51:37,143 --> 01:51:40,010
and that is this house.

1396
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,342
He painted that from across the street.

1397
01:51:43,416 --> 01:51:46,749
Yes, as a matter of fact,
there's hardly a canvas here...

1398
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:50,756
that wasn't done right in this house
or within 100 yards of it.

1399
01:51:50,824 --> 01:51:53,657
Have you seen this Daumier?
It's a wonder.

1400
01:51:56,062 --> 01:51:57,723
Strong, isn't it?

1401
01:51:58,798 --> 01:52:01,460
Yes, he came here many times, Daumier.

1402
01:52:02,068 --> 01:52:03,899
He was a strange one.

1403
01:52:04,204 --> 01:52:06,502
So, you see, when I tell you...

1404
01:52:06,573 --> 01:52:09,565
that I understand
the artistic temperament...

1405
01:52:10,743 --> 01:52:15,077
When Manet was dying,
they called me in for consultation.

1406
01:52:16,149 --> 01:52:18,014
They wanted to amputate.

1407
01:52:18,084 --> 01:52:22,077
I said no. No, not for a man like that.

1408
01:52:22,155 --> 01:52:23,645
But they wouldn't listen.

1409
01:52:23,723 --> 01:52:25,691
- Lunch is served, Doctor.
- Good, Therese.

1410
01:52:25,758 --> 01:52:28,124
You can put it on the table now.
We'll be right out.

1411
01:52:28,194 --> 01:52:29,183
Yes, sir.

1412
01:52:29,262 --> 01:52:31,890
- Guillaumin.
- It's a beauty, isn't it?

1413
01:52:32,031 --> 01:52:35,194
If you like, I'll take you out
and show you where he painted it.

1414
01:52:35,268 --> 01:52:37,702
I wanted him to join us at Arles.

1415
01:52:37,937 --> 01:52:39,632
- Look, it's warped.
- Is it?

1416
01:52:39,706 --> 01:52:41,765
You better have it framed.

1417
01:52:42,575 --> 01:52:46,204
I was meaning to take it in. I will.
I'll do it tomorrow.

1418
01:52:50,884 --> 01:52:53,546
<i>Dear Theo, I've seen Dr. Gachet.</i>

1419
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:57,449
<i>He's a pleasant man.
He has some good paintings in his house.</i>

1420
01:52:57,524 --> 01:52:59,856
<i>He wants me to do his portrait.</i>

1421
01:53:01,027 --> 01:53:03,257
<i>But as for his helping me...</i>

1422
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:06,794
<i>I'm afraid we mustn't hope for too much.</i>

1423
01:53:08,167 --> 01:53:10,533
<i>When the blind lead the blind...</i>

1424
01:53:11,237 --> 01:53:12,966
<i>don't they both fall in the ditch?</i>

1425
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:19,007
Mr. Vincent, at what time would you like
to have your breakfast in the morning?

1426
01:53:19,112 --> 01:53:22,809
Don't worry about that.
I'll be out early, before you get up.

1427
01:53:22,882 --> 01:53:26,648
Just leave some bread
and some cold coffee. That'll be fine.

1428
01:53:28,888 --> 01:53:32,449
<i>Gachet is right about one thing.
This place is beautiful.</i>

1429
01:53:33,192 --> 01:53:35,717
<i>It tempts me to paint
and the work goes well.</i>

1430
01:53:35,795 --> 01:53:39,925
You'd think being a doctor,
seeing so much of pain and suffering...

1431
01:53:39,999 --> 01:53:42,399
that I've got problems enough
for one man.

1432
01:53:42,468 --> 01:53:43,662
But, no.

1433
01:53:43,736 --> 01:53:47,695
I go around founding societies
and joining groups...

1434
01:53:48,308 --> 01:53:50,970
and then this passion of mine for art.

1435
01:53:51,477 --> 01:53:54,743
<i>Besides portraits,
I've been doing some landscapes.</i>

1436
01:53:54,882 --> 01:53:59,546
<i>I have a feeling of being
surer of my brush than ever before.</i>

1437
01:54:00,287 --> 01:54:03,779
<i>So I work in haste from day to day...</i>

1438
01:54:04,525 --> 01:54:07,858
<i>as a miner does
who knows he's facing disaster.</i>

1439
01:55:27,174 --> 01:55:29,199
<i>Vive Monsieur le maire!</i>

1440
01:57:24,759 --> 01:57:26,386
It's impossible.

1441
01:58:50,111 --> 01:58:52,841
I can make a joke
of this whole sorry business...

1442
01:58:52,914 --> 01:58:55,906
if it wasn't for the trouble I've caused you.

1443
01:58:58,786 --> 01:59:03,417
If you'd at least have gotten back
the cost of paint and the canvas.

1444
01:59:05,027 --> 01:59:06,551
Doesn't matter.

1445
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:10,894
- Is the baby really better?
- Yes.

1446
01:59:12,601 --> 01:59:14,228
We were worried about nothing.

1447
01:59:14,303 --> 01:59:17,500
He was just teething.
That was all of his trouble.

1448
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:22,738
I only hope he has a quieter soul
than mine...

1449
01:59:23,746 --> 01:59:25,611
'cause mine's sinking.

1450
01:59:27,917 --> 01:59:29,145
Sinking.

1451
01:59:33,355 --> 01:59:34,982
Theo?

1452
01:59:40,162 --> 01:59:41,959
I'd like to go home.

1453
02:00:02,284 --> 02:00:03,842
My own brother.

1454
02:00:05,187 --> 02:00:07,087
My poor, poor brother.

1455
02:00:11,393 --> 02:00:15,591
<i>- It doesn't seem a sad death.
- It's not, Sister.</i>

1456
02:00:16,398 --> 02:00:18,525
<i>It happens in the bright daylight...</i>

1457
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:22,161
<i>with the sun flooding everything
in a light of pure gold.</i>
