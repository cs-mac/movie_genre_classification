1
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,836
I can't do it.

2
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,271
No, you can.
The question is will you?

3
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:16,408
<i> This is no great illusion </i>

4
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,713
<i> when I'm with you
I'm looking for a ghost </i>

5
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,817
<i> or invisible reasons </i>

6
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:29,321
<i> to fall out of love and run
screaming from our home </i>

7
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,624
<i> 'cause we live
in a house of mirrors </i>

8
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,894
<i> we see our fears
and everything's our songs </i>

9
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,729
<i> faces and
second-hand clothes </i>

10
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,899
<i> but more and more
we're suffering </i>

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,234
<i> not nobody,
not a thousand beers </i>

12
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,905
<i> will keep us
from feeling so all alone </i>

13
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:50,442
<i> but you are what you love </i>

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,513
<i> and not what loves you back </i>

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,216
<i> that's why I'm here
on your doorstep </i>

16
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,331
<i> pleading for you
to take me back </i>

17
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,667
Is that a good one?

18
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,607
What the hell was that?

19
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,276
Flock of these.

20
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,348
Very funny.

21
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,752
<i> You are what you love </i>

22
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:37,823
Look at that guy.
Slut Speedo.

23
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,490
Cold water makes them
shrivel up.

24
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:40,491
How would you know?

25
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,729
We're really going to do this?

26
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,840
You can wuss up
but I'll be 20 bucks richer.

27
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,841
You're just gonna take it off
right here,

28
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,342
with everyone looking?

29
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,413
That was the idea.

30
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,748
Yeah.

31
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,350
I can't do it.

32
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,404
Yeah, you can.
The question is will you?

33
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,032
Oh, no.

34
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,803
You think because your eyes are
closed no one can see you?

35
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,944
Screw you.

36
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,294
Get in.

37
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,963
I can't swim!

38
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,732
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

39
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,404
I don't like waves.
I hate waves.

40
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,806
And you just remembered this?

41
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,443
Oh, no.

42
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,610
You're naked!

43
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,884
I know!

44
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,686
We just came over to tell you

45
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,422
you have the best ass
on this beach.

46
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,826
What means this?

47
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,805
You French?

48
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:25,063
We are Romania.
No English.

49
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,597
Nice.

50
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,800
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Mm-mm.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,734
Mm-mm.

52
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,337
She can use her tongue,
though, right?

53
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:37,576
Mm-mm.
- Where you going? Come on.

54
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,747
I'm doing it.
Look, mom.

55
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,448
You didn't want to stay

56
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,849
and see what your special
prize was going to be?

57
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,883
You mean my really special
gang rape?

58
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,552
Oh...

59
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,522
hey, what's the matter with you?

60
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,958
How about "I'm sorry,"
"excuse me" or something?

61
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,460
You can use your tongue.
Can't you?

62
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,898
Sorry.

63
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,799
You're selling ice cream.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,643
Yeah, amazing powers
of observation.

65
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,037
Can I have one?

66
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,871
Which one?

67
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,974
What's good?

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,378
Uh, they're all shit.

69
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,748
Recycled industrial waste.

70
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,495
The red, white, and blue,
please.

71
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,828
That camera yours?

72
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,631
No.

73
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,066
You don't have to be
such a dick.

74
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,937
She's just trying to be nice.

75
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,571
Let's go.

76
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,848
Thank you.

77
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,827
Your mouth is so blue.

78
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,097
I think someone hurt him.

79
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,362
That makes it okay for him
to be an asshole?

80
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,005
Oh, come on.

81
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,073
You liked him, too.

82
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,477
Hey.

83
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,544
Lilly.

84
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,216
Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,984
Hey, what time is it?

86
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:30,888
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe, like, 6:00?

87
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,624
Shit.

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,525
I hope Norma's still
with a patient.

89
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,963
Good luck. I'm going to take
my award-winning ass home.

90
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,165
Okay.

91
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,939
Please don't do that.

92
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:46,729
Return my bike.

93
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,207
Lillian, where have you been?

94
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,975
I told you this morning,
brighten beach.

95
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,677
You took it all the way
to Rockaway?

96
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,244
All the way to Rockaway.

97
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,713
Okay, if you knew you were
going to be this late,

98
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,948
you could've had
the courtesy to call.

99
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,784
My phone died.

100
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,886
Joy would like to spend some
time with her family, too.

101
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,020
Well, dad's still in the office.

102
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,489
That is beside the point.

103
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,891
You need to eat something
besides noodles.

104
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,994
I don't like fish.
It's disgusting.

105
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,929
- It's your dinner.
- My disgusting dinner.

106
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,131
You know what?
That's enough.

107
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,665
- Joy?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,868
Why don't you go home
to your family,

109
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,703
and the girls will clean up.

110
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,237
Lillian, please go tell
your father

111
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,905
that we are going to be late
for the concert.

112
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,773
He can't still be
with a patient.

113
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,510
You stay there
and eat some protein.

114
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,977
And take your shoes off.

115
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,858
You're tracking sand
all over the house.

116
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,186
Did you tell him?

117
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,079
He was with someone.

118
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,275
What is wrong with you?

119
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,172
Edward, please go get changed.
We're going to be late.

120
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,739
It starts at 8:00.

121
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,363
Okay, I'm going.

122
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,932
Uh...

123
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:55,008
Sorry, I'm...

124
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:03,809
Edward, come on.
We're going to be late.

125
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,318
Coming.

126
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,124
Al Franken.

127
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,292
Al Franken is a God damn comic.

128
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,129
He's good, but what's the
name of that show he was on?

129
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,931
And she's the best civil rights
attorney in New York.

130
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,868
What is she going to do, go to
Wisconsin and work for some guy

131
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,369
who's on comedy central?

132
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,705
NBC. SNL is on NBC.

133
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,907
Jon Stewart's on comedy central.

134
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,710
Thank you so much for that critically
important piece of information.

135
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,711
Hey, get your ta-tas

136
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,147
all sun burnt at the beach?

137
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,115
Ta-tas. Really?
That's cute.

138
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,816
You told him?

139
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,420
No. You know you're
an asshole, right?

140
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,955
How about we change the subject?

141
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,157
Sure, we could talk
about politics again.

142
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,060
Well, we could talk about
your two favorite subjects...

143
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,762
television and body parts.

144
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,296
- Asshole.
- That's a body part.

145
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,931
He's 16.
What's your excuse?

146
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,667
Karl, come on.

147
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,835
So how's that tour-guide
thing going?

148
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,038
My boss is a perv,

149
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,407
and I have to wear a uniform.

150
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,408
Well you have a straight shot

151
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,725
into the masonic lodges
of the United States.

152
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:16,148
That's true political power.

153
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,383
So when do you head out
for school?

154
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,984
Oh, that's right. Yale.

155
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,119
Whiffenpoofs.

156
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,321
An Ivy-covered thing...

157
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,056
lay off her, dad.

158
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,426
Orientation is the first week
in September.

159
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,960
They're not telling you you have
to change your orientation.

160
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,296
I said stop it.

161
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,763
She doesn't come from a family

162
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,166
where you have to train
for dinner.

163
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,834
What's the point of dinner then?

164
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,469
Okay, great,
you guys enjoy your meal.

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,842
Let's go.

166
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,911
You just walked in
on your father

167
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,713
boning some random patient,

168
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,820
and you don't know
what you're upset for?

169
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,320
Does your mom know?

170
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,725
- Are you going to tell her?
- Are you crazy?

171
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,791
Everybody okay out here?

172
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,836
Dad, go away.

173
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,205
Your parents screw around.

174
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,375
I think they just talk
about it a lot.

175
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,257
I can't believe that you were
talking about sex.

176
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:32,190
Well, apparently in my house

177
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,524
you don't really talk about it.

178
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,500
You just do it.

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,066
We're the last ones.

180
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,802
On earth?

181
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,504
At Erasmus,
at St. Anne's.

182
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,876
That's basically the same thing.

183
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,911
We're going to fucking college,

184
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,481
and we're still virgins.

185
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,450
We've got to get over this hump.

186
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,418
You didn't say that.

187
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,355
Persons of the male gender
are required.

188
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,489
Out the windows
to your right and left

189
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,090
are the air ducts
to the Holland tunnel,

190
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,776
and if you smell
roasting coffee,

191
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,327
that's because general foods

192
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,896
built their coffee
processing plant

193
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,098
in Hoboken in 1846.

194
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,266
There are some people who say

195
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,600
you can still smell the coffee

196
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,881
from the other side of the river

197
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,404
even though the plant closed
in 1992.

198
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,041
You're probably ready for an
iced coffee right about now.

199
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,142
This is the end of our tour.

200
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,576
Gratuities are appreciated.

201
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,144
Please be careful getting
of the boat,

202
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,379
and enjoy the rest of your visit

203
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,514
to the big apple.

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,322
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

205
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,330
Norma? Don't you ever
have to call home?

206
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,999
Only when I need bail money.

207
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,339
Uh...
- shit, I forgot to tell you what happened last night.

208
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,075
So I... God, I went out to
dinner with Danny and Kate.

209
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:42,113
This, like, obscure Italian
place in the village,

210
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:47,087
and the waiter
turned out to be him.

211
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,189
Who's that?

212
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,027
Um, the ice-cream guy
on the beach.

213
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,393
His name's David,

214
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,297
David Avery.

215
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,432
You just ran into him?

216
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,638
Not exactly.

217
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,571
What do you mean?

218
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,441
He had a book of matches

219
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,210
from Grotta Azzurra next to his
camera at the beach that day.

220
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,046
I can't believe you dragged
your parents to a restaurant

221
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,681
because you saw
a book of matches.

222
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,450
Okay, you don't have to make
me feel bad about it.

223
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:22,220
I'm not. I'm just...
it's like...

224
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,695
Didn't you have something
you wanted to tell me?

225
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,159
Uh, Fitzsimmons.

226
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,396
He came on to you again?

227
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,200
No, he... he just wants me
to give a tour

228
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,201
to a boat load of FBI agents.

229
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,372
Danny's going to love that.

230
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,637
I'm starving.
Do you want to split a burger?

231
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,320
Who said you could come in?

232
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,154
Mom's crying.

233
00:15:57,155 --> 00:16:00,057
She's actually crying?

234
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,426
Where's dad?

235
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,228
I don't know.

236
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,399
- Where is she?
- In her room.

237
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,767
What happened?
Did they have a fight?

238
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,503
No, they were just
standing there.

239
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,642
And mom went to her bedroom.

240
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,079
What are you going to do?

241
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,870
Nothing.
It's none of our business.

242
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,117
I'm scared.

243
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,752
What are you scared of?

244
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,056
I don't know.
I'm just scared.

245
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,624
Come on.
I'll paint your nails.

246
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,091
- Red?
- Yeah.

247
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,757
- Really?
- Sure.

248
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,358
<i> I feel like walking </i>

249
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,695
<i> do you feel like coming? </i>

250
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,399
<i> I feel like talking </i>

251
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,384
<i> 'cause it's been a long time </i>

252
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,720
<i> now your hair is long </i>

253
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,856
<i> and you look so thin </i>

254
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,659
<i> you're always so pale </i>

255
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,862
<i> but something has changed </i>

256
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,865
<i> you're almost a man </i>

257
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,271
Hungry?

258
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,909
- You made that?
- Maybe.

259
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,545
No one buys ice creams
on Tuesdays.

260
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,547
What are you doing?

261
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,449
No one takes boat tours
on Tuesdays.

262
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,151
What?

263
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,618
Are you the one who says
how many rivets there are

264
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,886
in the George Washington bridge?

265
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,891
Yeah.

266
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,258
What's your name?

267
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,728
Lilly.

268
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm David.

269
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,642
I'm going to grab a shirt.

270
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,377
You ever been to the cyclone?

271
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,448
Yeah.

272
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,952
You wanna go?

273
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,318
Got my bike.

274
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,214
Come back for it.

275
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,828
I don't think I should.

276
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,240
Sure. Suit yourself.

277
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,252
682 rugby.

278
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:19,958
 It still hurts

279
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,626
 It hurts

280
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:28,432
 It still hurts

281
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,934
 It hurts

282
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,007
 It still hurts

283
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,009
 la la la la

284
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,548
 la la la la

285
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,316
That's all I got.

286
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,750
It's not very good.
It's kind of shitty...

287
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,990
will you stop it?
I think it's great.

288
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,662
Why do you do that?
You're good.

289
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,863
I called him at the restaurant.

290
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,731
He wasn't there.

291
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,267
He's never anywhere
when you want to reach him.

292
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,735
I know you think I'm an idiot.

293
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,000
You barely know the guy.

294
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,976
I know.

295
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,845
So how come Norma
hasn't called you yet?

296
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,445
She's m.I.A.

297
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,448
Hasn't left her room in a week,

298
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,584
but I better go check
the battlefield

299
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,985
in case there are casualties.

300
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,623
Keep the faith.

301
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,757
Call me tomorrow.

302
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,658
Okay.

303
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,939
People have affairs.

304
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,574
This is the 21st century.

305
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,043
It's not the fucking
end of the world.

306
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,778
Lillian, I would appreciate it

307
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,779
if you wouldn't speak to me
that way.

308
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,516
Mom, there is
a whole family here.

309
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,052
He said he was sorry.
I heard him.

310
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,987
She's probably just
some random person.

311
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,622
He only did it to get
your attention.

312
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,356
This doesn't concern you.

313
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:00,624
It doesn't concern me?
He's my father.

314
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,059
I want him to stay.

315
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,364
Well, we all know
how you feel about him.

316
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,767
I can't believe
you just said that.

317
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,102
You're a God damn shrink.

318
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,504
You know what, Lillian?

319
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,873
If you can't find a way
to control yourself,

320
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,041
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the room.

321
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,779
Thank God,
I can't control myself.

322
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,775
You live in a porno movie.

323
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,411
It's a photographer's studio.

324
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,015
Frank Mayo.
You heard of him?

325
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,647
Lets me sleep here in exchange for
kinda acting like a security guard.

326
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,999
- Weird place to sleep.
- Oh, I'm up there.

327
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,731
Want a beer?

328
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:52,537
Think they did, like, a lipstick
commercial here today, so...

329
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,938
He's got a dark room, too.

330
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,539
He doesn't use it anymore,

331
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,477
so kind of teaching myself
to print.

332
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,647
All the good stuff
was shot on film.

333
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,700
Where's your family?

334
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:10,220
Now? Eastern parkway.

335
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,824
I grew up on Staten island,
though.

336
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,141
I moved there from Tennessee
when I was five.

337
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,596
Staten island?

338
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:19,697
Yeah.

339
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,865
People actually live there.

340
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,182
Moved out, though,
when I was in high school.

341
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,570
How come?

342
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,739
It was just safer
for everyone that way.

343
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,661
You think your mom's trouble.

344
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,504
These all yours?

345
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,635
Yeah.

346
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,057
You really want to do this.

347
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,438
I don't want to do anything
except get out of here.

348
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,211
Where you want to go?

349
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,980
Rome, Paris,

350
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,583
I don't know.

351
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,286
Why?

352
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,755
Smell it.

353
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,257
Breathe it.

354
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,252
Tired of seeing it
in photographs.

355
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:23,090
Sylvia Plath.
Do you know this?

356
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,709
Would you read it to me?

357
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,344
"Daddy,

358
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,947
"you do not do, you do not do

359
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,683
"any more, black shoe

360
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:56,720
"in which I have lived
like a foot

361
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,854
"for thirty years

362
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,890
"poor and white

363
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,759
barely daring to breathe
or achoo"

364
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,771
I think you better get home.

365
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,942
You told Gerry you were going
to see her on Friday.

366
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,380
So.

367
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,755
Are you?

368
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,422
It was weird.

369
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,057
We met at the restaurant,
and then we just walked around.

370
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,893
And it was pretty obvious
that I was down to hook up,

371
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,362
and he didn't even touch me.

372
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,064
Maybe I should've come on
to him?

373
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,265
I mean, aren't guys
supposed to like it

374
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,101
when you make the first move?

375
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:53,738
I even wore my purple sweater
that's so low cut

376
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,529
my tits practically
hang out of it.

377
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,442
Shit.

378
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:01,249
Maybe that was too much.

379
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,083
- Oh, my God.
- What?

380
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,751
There he is.

381
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,320
I told him I was meeting you
here for open mic.

382
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,637
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

383
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:13,390
What do you mean nothing?
The song is about him.

384
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,326
It's fine.

385
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:16,794
Hey, you remember my friend
Lilly Berger?

386
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,828
David Avery.

387
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,798
I'm so happy you're here.

388
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,299
All right, okay.
I'm going to...

389
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,969
I'm going to go set up.
I'm really nervous.

390
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,971
So don't laugh at me.

391
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,442
I'm going to trip.

392
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:35,912
 If you wanna find yourself
by traveling out west

393
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:43,321
 Or if you wanna find somebody
else that's better, go ahead

394
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:47,461
 Go ahead

395
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,931
 If you wanna buy a band new
fancy automobile

396
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,133
 Or if you wanna build
a place

397
00:28:56,134 --> 00:29:02,405
 Down in east Hampton,
go ahead

398
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,975
 Go ahead

399
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,243
 Go ahead

400
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,913
 Be my guest

401
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:15,118
 Go ahead

402
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,355
 If you wanna have your cake
and eat it, too

403
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:21,858
 Or if you wanna have
other people

404
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,360
 Watch you while you eat it

405
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,032
 Go ahead

406
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,204
 Go ahead

407
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,139
 If you wanna hold on

408
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,908
 To the first girl
that you meet

409
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,752
 Or if you wanna settle down

410
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,578
 And plant roses at my feet

411
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,451
 Go ahead

412
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,153
 Go ahead

413
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,488
 Go ahead

414
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,591
 I wish you would

415
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:57,997
 Just go ahead

416
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,266
- You're really good.
- Thanks.

417
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,467
This is a great jacket.

418
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:08,173
It's my dad's.

419
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,587
I gotta go.

420
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:25,422
What was that?

421
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:31,127
I mean, count on me to
find someone certifiable.

422
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,430
I can't imagine your dad
in that jacket.

423
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,666
I actually just can't
imagine him without a tie.

424
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,371
Have you seen him?

425
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,606
He uses the office, but she
won't let him come upstairs.

426
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,375
Well, maybe she's right,
you know?

427
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,677
You should be able
to trust the people

428
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,680
that mean something to you.

429
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,547
What?

430
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,517
Nothing.

431
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,486
Well, do you wanna
get something to eat?

432
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,122
Think I'm gonna go home.

433
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,089
Well, I can't sleep.

434
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,592
The guys who went on before me

435
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,393
said that there's a producer
in the audience

436
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,829
and that they're meeting up
with him at Wally's,

437
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,463
so I think I might
just go meet up with them.

438
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,467
Okay, wish me luck.

439
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,303
Luck.

440
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,504
Ow.

441
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,373
Sorry.
That was hard.

442
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,983
Good job, Lil.
Sit down?

443
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,317
No, thanks.

444
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,153
Hot as shit in that uniform.

445
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,354
I'm fine.

446
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,391
Yeah?

447
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,093
All right.

448
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,194
That trip was worth two tours.

449
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,597
You want more like that?
Specials?

450
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:15,498
Hmm?

451
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,201
Night cruises are triple time.

452
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,375
I take classes.

453
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,647
You're a real pistol.

454
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,421
Mm.

455
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,621
Won't bite ya.

456
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,589
I'm late.

457
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,790
All right.
Some other time then.

458
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,030
Yeah.

459
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,564
You know what you should do.

460
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,566
You should call the ACLU.

461
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,802
She wasn't exactly molested.

462
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,507
Well, verbally she was molested.

463
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,708
What?

464
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,076
That's disgusting.

465
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,612
It's gluten-free.

466
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,313
You know, I'd rather not have

467
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,614
a lecture about my intestines.

468
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,217
I would just like
some normal bread.

469
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,429
Such a pain in the ass.

470
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:17,528
I mean,
what is wrong with white?

471
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,595
Come to my house.
Everything's white.

472
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,164
Anyway, this is
kind of a big deal,

473
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,732
because you do
have an obligation

474
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,102
to the women who are gonna
work for this guy in the future

475
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,336
to make it clear that
what he said was inappropriate.

476
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,838
It's not okay.

477
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,307
It was more how he said it
than what he said.

478
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:34,111
No, I know exactly
what you're saying.

479
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:38,214
Can we please just have,
like, a little bit of privacy?

480
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:40,288
Little bit.

481
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,664
Just think about it, Lilly.

482
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,499
Were you scared?

483
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,604
Yeah.

484
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,271
But it must feel kinda good

485
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:04,708
to have a guy want your body.

486
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,322
Mm, no.

487
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,892
He makin' a house call?

488
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,861
What are you doing here?

489
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,129
I just came to watch your
parents scream at each other.

490
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,402
You just turn up
whenever you want to?

491
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:34,270
Yeah.

492
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:37,241
Yeah, I'm out of here.

493
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,632
I just feel like
I don't understand you.

494
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:04,219
I believe you want me to tell
you things you already know.

495
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,969
Where can we go?

496
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,669
Wait.

497
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,504
Wait.

498
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,573
I've got something.
It's all right.

499
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:22,578
I'm scared.

500
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,985
You haven't done it before?

501
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,988
Do you want it to be me?

502
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,025
Yeah, but I'm really scared.

503
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,672
Okay.

504
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,913
 He's got you
where he wants you

505
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:06,716
 And he'll have you
when he wants to

506
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,886
 But you'll want him too

507
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:16,126
 Yeah you'll want him too

508
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,511
 He's got you
where he wants you

509
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,482
 And he'll have you
when he wants to

510
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,128
 But you'll want him too

511
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:59,069
You're going to be
very late for work.

512
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,138
She didn't come home
until 2:00 last night.

513
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,607
How do you know?
You were sleeping.

514
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,975
She woke me.
She took a shower.

515
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,710
I was hot.

516
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:11,080
Would you like to tell me
where you were so late?

517
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,749
Gerry's.

518
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,750
I don't know how late
they let her stay out,

519
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,053
but in this house,
your curfew is midnight.

520
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,687
Is that understood?

521
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,156
I'm going to college.
There is no curfew.

522
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,591
You're not there yet.

523
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:25,085
Can I play at Jackie's
after my swimming lesson?

524
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,120
You're like a stalker.
What do you want?

525
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,522
I'm gonna be late.

526
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,025
Listen, Lil,
this thing that happened

527
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:31,495
between your mother and I,

528
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,995
it's not your problem.

529
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:35,064
- It's not?
- No.

530
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,866
You just walk away
and leave me to deal with her

531
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,552
and then say
it's not my problem.

532
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,537
I'm sorry.

533
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,937
This is all bullshit.

534
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm supposed to be
leaving for college,

535
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,977
not dealing with you guys.

536
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,578
Just have dinner with me.

537
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,614
Are you kidding?
No.

538
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:54,551
Okay. All righty.

539
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,585
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

540
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,288
can we have
a little attention please?

541
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,156
Can we have your attention?

542
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,993
Uh, we're about to commence
the cooking ritual,

543
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,830
as they used to say in the
international workers of the world,

544
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:11,667
by any means necessary.

545
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:15,638
And so I think
we need a sacrifice.

546
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,077
So is there a virgin here?

547
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,279
Oh, my God.

548
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,747
You know, there are some people

549
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,214
who are virgins

550
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:26,883
who don't want to be
perceived as virgins,

551
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,886
and there are some people who...

552
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,687
time to cook the hamburgers.

553
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,055
Time to cook
the hamburgers. Yes.

554
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,558
Yes. Okay.

555
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,825
You actually like him,
don't you?

556
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,192
We should just swap families.

557
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,663
Any time.

558
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,297
No one laughs at my house.

559
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:46,169
No one shuts up here.

560
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,772
I talked to David yesterday.

561
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:49,872
You did?

562
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,707
I mean, if you can call it that.

563
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:53,944
He's not much of a talker.

564
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,812
He called you?

565
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,781
No, I called him
to invite him to this,

566
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,618
but he said he couldn't come.

567
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,988
You think I shouldn't
have called?

568
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,099
I don't know.

569
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,941
What are you doing?

570
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,678
This is my room.

571
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,379
Excuse me.

572
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,644
The last time I checked,

573
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,216
I still paid the mortgage
on this house.

574
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,884
So I don't get any privacy?

575
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:11,388
Your sisters
are already up and out.

576
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:15,392
- Let's get going.
- Thank God for small things.

577
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,393
I sure hope
the inside of your head

578
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,196
doesn't look like this room.

579
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,440
Can you just leave that?

580
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,409
Come on.
Get going.

581
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:45,120
- Lilly.
- I'm in the shower!

582
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,756
Do you have my
cream rinse in there?

583
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,290
- No!
- Are you sure?

584
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,694
I can't find it.

585
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,328
Yeah, it's not in here.

586
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,832
Your father called.

587
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,100
He wants you to let him know

588
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,834
if you're going
to have dinner with him.

589
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:00,770
Okay!

590
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,073
I'm going downstairs.
I have a patient.

591
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:05,445
We have 15 minutes.

592
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,993
 I'm lost in the light

593
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:27,032
 I pray for the night

594
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:34,236
 Take me to take you too

595
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:37,172
 After so many words

596
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:40,442
 Still nothing's heard

597
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:45,848
 Don't know what we should do

598
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,317
 So someone could see me now

599
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,126
 Let them see you

600
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,361
 Was my greatest thrill

601
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:02,499
 When we just stood still

602
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,805
 Let me hold your hand
till I had my fill

603
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,875
 Even countin' sheep

604
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,944
 Don't help me sleep

605
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:20,350
 I just toss and turn
right there beside you

606
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,951
 So if someone could
help me now

607
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:27,489
-  They'd help you too
- How'd you find this?

608
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,225
My cousins used to live here.

609
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,294
 They'd help you too

610
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:35,931
 See you through

611
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:38,535
 All the hard things

612
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:41,837
 We've all got to do

613
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,874
 'Cause this life is long

614
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,377
 And so you wouldn't be wrong

615
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:51,281
 Bein' free with me

616
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:56,378
 On my own

617
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,067
 And I held my own

618
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,935
 Still I rattled your bones

619
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:53,276
 I said some awful things
and I take them back

620
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,546
 If we would try again

621
00:46:56,547 --> 00:47:00,049
 Just remember when

622
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,984
 Before we were lovers

623
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,021
 I swear we were friends

624
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:07,556
 So if someone
could see me now

625
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:14,230
 Let them see you

626
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,332
 Let them see you

627
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,669
 See you through

628
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,473
 All the hard things

629
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:26,642
 We've all got to do

630
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,946
 'Cause this life is long

631
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:33,649
 So you wouldn't be wrong

632
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,486
 Bein' free with me

633
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:41,404
 On my own

634
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,443
Really like that one.

635
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,109
That one?

636
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,680
That one's my mom.

637
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:08,451
Sometimes I wish
she would just die.

638
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,958
Your mom?
Why?

639
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,699
She makes you very miserable.

640
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:24,472
I'm afraid of dying.

641
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,480
I'm afraid of not doing anything

642
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,518
while I'm still here.

643
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:45,005
I don't think there's
much chance of that.

644
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,291
What time is it?

645
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,561
9:30.

646
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,371
I told my mom I'd call
if I wasn't back my ten.

647
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:37,443
Where's your phone?

648
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,679
Aw, come on, don't go.

649
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,214
It's in the kitchen.

650
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:48,418
Well, mine's dead.

651
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,093
<i>- Mom?
- Oh, thank God.</i>

652
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,493
<i>- Where are you?
- At a friend's.</i>

653
00:49:58,494 --> 00:50:00,268
<i>Gerry's been trying to find you.</i>

654
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,768
<i>...Subway...</i>

655
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:09,675
<i>...emergency.
Her father died...</i>

656
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,509
<i>when are you coming home?</i>

657
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,184
Right now.

658
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,489
What is it?

659
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,558
- Hey...
- don't.

660
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,859
I have to go.

661
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,830
What...
what's goin' on?

662
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,165
- Gerry's father died.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me go...

663
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,534
no.

664
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,871
I'm so sorry.

665
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:51,708
I'm so sorry.

666
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,245
I don't feel anything.

667
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:58,814
You know, I know that...

668
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,716
that my life has
changed forever,

669
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,560
and all I want to do
is go to sleep.

670
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:07,622
Because I'm the same,
but I'll never be the same,

671
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,259
you know?

672
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,632
Like he'll never
slap me on the butt again.

673
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:16,966
He'll never see me graduate,

674
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,868
and he won't...

675
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,268
see me get married,

676
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:22,905
and he'll never know my kids.

677
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:33,632
I want my daddy.

678
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,600
How is she?

679
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,669
Okay.

680
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,305
How are you?

681
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,610
I'm fine.

682
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,846
You can't let this happen, mom.

683
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,032
You've got to let him come back.

684
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,767
I was very sorry to hear
about Gerry's father.

685
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,003
Yeah.

686
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,738
I'll go to the funeral
with you, if you like.

687
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,371
There isn't gonna be a funeral.

688
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,509
Just a memorial service.

689
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,979
Then they'll scatter his ashes.

690
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,547
That's how they do it.

691
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:41,350
Did mom talk to you
about coming back?

692
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,953
Yeah.

693
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,754
Are you?

694
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,290
I don't know.

695
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,996
You could just die,
and none of this would matter.

696
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,696
Just talk to her.
Explain it.

697
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:57,332
- Say you're sorry.
- I have.

698
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,801
She won't let you.

699
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,770
Try and understand it
from her side.

700
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,872
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.

701
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,741
That's exactly what I'm doing.

702
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:09,712
Now...

703
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,814
I love you, but I gotta go.

704
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,722
Okay?

705
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,734
God, I can't go back in there

706
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:35,471
and look at all that food again.

707
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,105
It's like we're having a party,

708
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:39,079
and he's just late.

709
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,779
God, I gotta get out of here.

710
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,750
I want to go to work,
but Kate won't let me.

711
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,618
You should take a few days.

712
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,721
It's really weird.

713
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,989
All I can think about is David.

714
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,792
I keep imagining
that he's gonna walk

715
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,072
through the door.

716
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,109
Hello?

717
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,879
Oh, David?
Yes, hold on a second.

718
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,482
It's for you.

719
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,956
David Applebee or something.

720
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,922
Tell him I'm not here.

721
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:29,591
Why?
You are here.

722
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,730
Just tell him.

723
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,934
You're weird.

724
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,401
She's actually not here.

725
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:43,138
Can I take a message?

726
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,490
Okay.

727
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,692
Did you get my message?

728
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,462
- No.
- I talked to your sister.

729
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,863
- She didn't tell me.
- She said she'd write it down.

730
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:10,801
I've been trying to get ahold of
you for, like, three days now.

731
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,468
- I was with Gerry.
- How is she?

732
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:15,171
Okay.

733
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,172
I have a trip in 15 minutes.

734
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,674
All right.
I'll come back after work.

735
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,576
No, I'm gonna see Gerry
after work.

736
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,910
Okay.
I'll come with you.

737
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,712
No.

738
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,881
You should go this afternoon
if you're not working.

739
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,618
There's a lot of people
at night.

740
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,189
So, is that what you want?
For me to see her alone?

741
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,723
Yeah.

742
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:38,860
All right. I'll let you know
how that goes.

743
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,861
Hey.

744
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,126
Sorry about your father.

745
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:22,705
Well, thank...
thanks for... for coming.

746
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,573
Do you want anything
to eat or...

747
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:27,686
no, I'm f...
fine.

748
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,153
Wanna get out of here?

749
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,195
Yeah. Yeah.

750
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:48,766
Everything tastes...
sort of smells in here.

751
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:53,935
It's for the blind.

752
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,571
He used to take me
when I was a kid.

753
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:58,277
I mean, my...
my dad.

754
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:05,180
He was always so quiet.

755
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,049
It's like now.

756
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,655
Even he was quiet here.

757
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,328
Once I came by myself
on my bike.

758
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:23,698
And it started to rain.
I was like, uh...

759
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:26,100
Seven-years-old,

760
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:29,305
terrified, soaking wet.

761
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,875
And I, um...

762
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,813
I looked up and he was there.

763
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,814
I didn't tell anyone
where I was going, you know?

764
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,987
He just...

765
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:47,989
he knew.

766
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,326
I'm sorry.
Could you please hold me?

767
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,606
Could you hold me?

768
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,949
That was dad.

769
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:17,218
Would you make love to me?

770
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:19,187
And I'm asking you...

771
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,156
you don't need to feel
responsible or anything.

772
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,958
You know, I just, um...

773
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:29,797
I just feel like you understand.

774
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:32,039
Please.

775
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,018
Please.

776
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,935
All right, folks.
We all know Danny was

777
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,339
a man of, for the people.

778
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,107
He was also a sexy
son of a bitch.

779
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,010
I can't listen to this.

780
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,080
And he loved his Kate.

781
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,881
Anybody who spent
five minutes with him

782
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,084
could see that.

783
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:25,421
He came over yesterday.

784
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:27,427
David?

785
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:32,996
I did it, Lilly.

786
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,401
Okay, so you're thinking
about my father...

787
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:43,105
that this is crazy.

788
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,073
But it...

789
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,176
it just felt right.

790
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,777
You know, I needed to do it.

791
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:55,718
I understand.

792
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,252
You know, underneath
all that tough guy stuff,

793
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,453
he's really... he's...

794
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:02,156
he's so gentle and...

795
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,727
I'm glad it was him.
So...

796
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,227
I don't feel
any different, you know?

797
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:07,830
I mean, I...
I'm not sore.

798
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,397
I didn't bleed.

799
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:11,200
My mom always said I, uh...

800
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,368
I lost it to a swing
when I was four.

801
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,205
So...

802
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,741
Don't worry.

803
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,241
I'm okay.

804
01:01:20,242 --> 01:01:23,078
<i> If </i>

805
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,814

Can I have the brown?

812
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,892
Jackie's sleeping over.

813
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,160
Who said you could use that?

814
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,796
It's just an eraser.

815
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,397
It was on your dresser.
What's the big deal?

816
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,036
Stay out of my room
and away from my things!

817
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:31,152

<i> Or just relax </i>

826
01:03:18,994 --> 01:03:25,005
<i> and drift away </i>

827
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:34,614
<i> and if you find </i>

828
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,480
Hey.

829
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,884
I'll take that drink.

830
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,925
Um...

831
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:56,598
you want, like, a...
a drink?

832
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,267
Oh, shit.
I haven't got any ice.

833
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,244
- It's fine.
- Okay.

834
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:12,152
Okay.

835
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:19,692
Ooh, I need a haircut.

836
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,456
Oh.

837
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:56,626
Oh, boy.

838
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,218
Okay.

839
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:27,089
I really like you.

840
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,558
You're smart.

841
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,194
I wanna give you
a chance to walk away.

842
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,062
I don't want to hurt you.

843
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,034
I'm a big girl.

844
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:41,005
All right.
Let's have some fun.

845
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,072
Come on.
Come on.

846
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,674
Hey, you on the pill?

847
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,475
- You on the pill?
- No.

848
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:23,078
- No?
- No.

849
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:26,647
Okay.

850
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,450
Stay right here.
I gotta get some protection.

851
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,288
Okay?

852
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,605
Hey!

853
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:55,109
Hey!
Where you goin'?

854
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,130
Where you goin'?

855
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:25,485
Come in.

856
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,518
You okay?

857
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:39,888
Why'd you do it?

858
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,223
Do what?

859
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,695
Gerry.

860
01:07:46,669 --> 01:07:49,196
Don't tell me what happened
didn't mean anything.

861
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,566
Yeah, it meant something.

862
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,267
You asked me to go see her.

863
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:55,537
I didn't ask you
to sleep with her.

864
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,305
No. She did.

865
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,308
So you did.

866
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,609
Is that what you think happened?

867
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,877
I don't have to think
it happened.

868
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,385
She told me it did.

869
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,157
She said that?

870
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:16,247
I just fucked fizsimmons.

871
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,849
Dad's back. He brought
his clothes and stuff.

872
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,218
He got you that?

873
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,885
- You had one.
- We did not.

874
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:46,688
Dad said
they were too dangerous.

875
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,797
Apparently, guilt will
corrupt people's principles.

876
01:08:55,797 --> 01:08:58,899
You're cooking?

877
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,635
Hi.

878
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,304
That's it?
Hi?

879
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,737
You're just back?
No one talks about it?

880
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:05,306
You haven't given us a chance

881
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,474
to say anything yet, Lilly.

882
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,711
Here's your chance.

883
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,546
Your father and I decided
that it would be better

884
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:15,282
for everybody if he...
if he came back home.

885
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:16,917
Why?

886
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:18,553
What are we?
The wallpaper?

887
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:19,754
We're just supposed
to sit back and watch

888
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,288
while you move in and move out

889
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:22,523
and move in and move out again

890
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:23,724
like it makes
no difference to us?

891
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:25,260
This is what you wanted.

892
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,894
I don't understand
what's different

893
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:28,729
I've been asking you
to come back for weeks.

894
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,668
And now, suddenly,
you just do it.

895
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:37,640
This time, I asked him.

896
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,616
Are you crazy?

897
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,756
Do you want him to leave again?

898
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,991
What am I gonna do
when you leave?

899
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:58,864
- Transfer.
- Yeah, right.

900
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:05,703
Well, these could
be cute, right?

901
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,372
Mmm.

902
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:12,840
You didn't buy anything.

903
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:16,514
Saving all your money
for those designer drugs?

904
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,462
And I can't believe you're
gonna be in fucking old haven.

905
01:10:21,747 --> 01:10:23,484
Like, what are you
gonna do there?

906
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,588
It's so boring.

907
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:34,862
Do you think I should call him?

908
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,764
No.

909
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,767
No, I don't think
you should call him.

910
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,868
I'm so tired
of hearing about him.

911
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,469
You're making
a fool of yourself.

912
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,371
Leave the guy alone.

913
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:47,608
If he wants to see you,
he'll call you.

914
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,377
Okay.

915
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:51,912
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go home.

916
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:54,770
Great.
No one's stopping you.

917
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,906
Lilly!
I gotta talk to you.

918
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:19,741
Lil!

919
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,943
Lil, would you talk to me?
What the fuck?

920
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:24,978
Lil!

921
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:27,353
Lilly!

922
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,719
You gotta straighten
this out, Lil.

923
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,587
- Me?
- I didn't sleep with her!

924
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:35,590
- She told me!
- You fucking better ask her again.

925
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,492
I don't have to.
She's not a liar, David.

926
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,560
- I want you to tell Gerry.
- Tell Gerry what?

927
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,862
- How this all started!
- I don't know how it started.

928
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:43,997
I wasn't there.

929
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:45,801
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do.

930
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,836
Then tell her why
I came to the house that day.

931
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:49,136
Tell her how it happened!

932
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,081
We already know what happened.

933
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,764
I didn't call him.

934
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,933
He called me.

935
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,803
We're hanging out on Sunday.

936
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,138
What for?

937
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,639
What do you mean,
"what for?"

938
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,742
He wants to take a walk
in the gardens,

939
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,510
where we went before.

940
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,779
Okay.

941
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,121
Well, thanks for making me
act like a person.

942
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,596
I like yours better.

943
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,631
Go away.

944
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:27,577
It's me.

945
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,717
He's leaving.

946
01:13:42,717 --> 01:13:43,612
Where's he going?

947
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,687
Paris.

948
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,889
Tomorrow at four.

949
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:52,794
That's it?
That's all he said?

950
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,034
Isn't that enough?

951
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:02,005
I think I should
go say good-bye.

952
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,086
David?

953
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,952
Why didn't you tell me?

954
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:22,624
You're really somethin' else.

955
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,224
- Why now?
- I'm gonna go do my work.

956
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:27,828
I can't deal with this anymore.

957
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:29,831
I really want you to stay.

958
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,634
- Then tell Gerry the truth.
- I can't!

959
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:33,934
Do you know
how hurt she would be?

960
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:35,769
What kind of friend
would I be then?

961
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:39,040
I don't know. What kind
of friend are you now?

962
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,114
I didn't sleep with Fitzsimmons.

963
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,920
I'm trying to tell you
the truth.

964
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,688
You hurt me.

965
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,658
So you had
to hurt me back, right?

966
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,597
You know, you really
are fully of shit.

967
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,197
You keep this up,
and there won't be anyone left

968
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:06,009
to play with, you understand?

969
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,823
I gotta go.

970
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,625
What was that?

971
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:05,393
He just kissed you!

972
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,260
I've been seeing him.

973
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:10,063
Since when?

974
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:12,233
All summer.

975
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,403
Until your dad died.

976
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,904
Wow.

977
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:20,942
What happened when my dad died?

978
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:24,645
I stopped seeing him.

979
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,787
He started seeing you.

980
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,957
You told him to see me?

981
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,660
Yeah, but I didn't ask him
to sleep with you.

982
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:40,260
Oh, my God.

983
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:41,962
You're such a conceited bitch!

984
01:16:41,963 --> 01:16:44,297
What the fuck is wrong with you?

985
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:45,767
Oh, my God!

986
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:48,102
I just wanted
to make you feel better.

987
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,937
You liked him so much.

988
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,773
So you decided
to play God, right?

989
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,808
To throw him at me
like some sort of booby prize?

990
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:56,877
Because my father dropped dead
on a subway?

991
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,281
God, you're sick!

992
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,183
I was just trying
to do something good!

993
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,687
Yeah, like, sure,
you actually believed that!

994
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:09,691
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I!

995
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,768
I'm so sorry.

996
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:28,301
What are you doin' in here?

997
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:29,976
Nothing.

998
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,886
I had sex with someone.

999
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:48,456
You tryin' to shock me?

1000
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,195
I don't know.

1001
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,233
You all right?

1002
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,239
It was with someone
Gerry really liked.

1003
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:08,341
And she's upset?

1004
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:11,550
She'll never talk to me again.

1005
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,483
Well...

1006
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:19,021
People aren't perfect, kiddo.

1007
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:23,291
They make mistakes.

1008
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:26,928
Sometimes, it's harder
to forgive yourself

1009
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,569
than to get
somebody else to do it.

1010
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:37,371
But...

1011
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,180
People will surprise you.

1012
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:49,286
Well, thank you for tellin' me.

1013
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,506
I didn't know I could.

1014
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,711
I'm here to turn this in
and pick up my last check.

1015
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:41,969
There you go.

1016
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,971
I didn't expect to, uh...

1017
01:20:44,972 --> 01:20:46,645
Give a shit.

1018
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:51,430
Get out of here.

1019
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,381
I guess I never really thought
this day would come.

1020
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,153
It's your turn, babe.

1021
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:33,554
At least, I gave you
some stellar examples

1022
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,962
of how not to do it.

1023
01:21:43,998 --> 01:21:46,632
Okay. Let's go.

1024
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,367
I think this is for you.

1025
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,789
You were there, weren't you,
when he took that?

1026
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,808
Yes.

1027
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:36,710
I got it in the mail yesterday,
so I guess that was his...

1028
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:39,150
his way of making sure
that you'd see it.

1029
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:46,754
No.

1030
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,598
It was his way of making sure
that we'd see each other.

1031
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:04,640
I'm so sorry, Ger.

1032
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,341
What are you doin'?

1033
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:10,577
You don't know how sorry I am.

1034
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,182
Okay, I bet.
You...

1035
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:16,450
what are you doin'?

1036
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,885
This guy was smiling.
Happy.

1037
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:20,621
You need to put your clothes on.

1038
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,491
Because this is crazy.

1039
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:26,395
Yeah? You have
to forgive me.

1040
01:24:28,395 --> 01:24:30,733
I can't lose you.

1041
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,304
Um, okay.
I, um...

1042
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,171
I didn't do it.

1043
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:39,506
I didn't do what?

1044
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:41,709
I didn't sleep with him.

1045
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,678
Um...

1046
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,147
I asked...
I begged...

1047
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:48,448
and uh, he kissed me on the head

1048
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:50,818
and told me that he was in love

1049
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:53,356
with someone else.

1050
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,657
I'm really sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1051
01:24:57,658 --> 01:24:59,894
I'm... I'm never gonna
lie to you again,

1052
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:01,862
I... I swear.

1053
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:04,167
I was just...
I was really confused.

1054
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,768
- Angry?
- Yeah.

1055
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,237
At Danny, you know, for just...

1056
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:11,907
fucking dying.

1057
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,175
Ooh. Love you.

1058
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,577
Me too.

1059
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:19,547
I'm gonna visit you
a lot, a lot, a lot!

1060
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,850
- Uh-oh. Oh, my God!
- Uh-oh.

1061
01:25:23,851 --> 01:25:25,486
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God!

1062
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:27,688
What's goin' on here?

1063
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,956
What's happening?

1064
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:31,759
Lilly's naked.

1065
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,929
Shut up.

1066
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,309
 If you want to find yourself

1067
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,678
 By travelin' out west

1068
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,715
 Or if you wanna
find somebody else

1069
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:31,921
 That's better go ahead

1070
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:36,394
 Go ahead

1071
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:43,697
 If you wanna buy
a brand new fancy automobile

1072
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,300
 Or if you wanna
build a place

1073
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:48,501
 Up in cold water canyon

1074
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:50,375
 Go ahead

1075
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,746
 Go ahead

1076
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:00,313
 Go ahead

1077
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,549
 I wish you would

1078
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,822
 Go ahead

1079
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:12,459
 If you wanna have
your cake and eat it too

1080
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,618
 And if you wanna
have other people

1081
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,964
 Watch you while you eat it

1082
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:21,769
 Go ahead

1083
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,573
 Go ahead

1084
01:27:26,573 --> 01:27:28,876
 Go ahead

1085
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,411
 Be my guest

1086
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:34,818
 Go ahead

1087
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:41,889
 If you want

1088
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:46,827
 Better things

1089
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:54,970
 I want you to have them

1090
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:01,407
 If you

1091
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:06,813
 Want better things

1092
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:11,518
 Then I want you

1093
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:14,091
 To have them

1094
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:20,794
 Go ahead

1095
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:25,799
 Go ahead

1096
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,002
 Go ahead

1097
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:30,737
 I wish you would

1098
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:33,510
 Go ahead

1099
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,644
 Go ahead

1100
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:40,747
 I wish you would

1101
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:44,655
 Go ahead

1102
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:55,696
 la la la la

1103
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:59,001
 I fell asleep
in my parents' room

1104
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:03,670
 I awoke to the cable news

1105
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,177
 There was a fire
at Brooklyn school

1106
01:29:10,177 --> 01:29:14,081
 I melted down like Fukushima

1107
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:15,816
 Don't you wanna know

1108
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,951
 How I'm feelin'

1109
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:23,590
 I just want to talk to you

1110
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,960
 'Cause it burns

1111
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:31,864
 It still burns

1112
01:29:31,865 --> 01:29:34,067
 It burns

1113
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:39,139
 It still burns

1114
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,175
 It burns

1115
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:43,515
 It still hurts

1116
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:49,483
 la la la la

1117
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:54,720
 Ooh

1118
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,989
 la la la la

1119
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:59,693
 Hold up I'm comin'

1120
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:04,197
 In the glow
of the rising sun

1121
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:06,800
 I found my calling

1122
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,969
 In the lows and the feeling

1123
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:13,239
 Of when you're gone

1124
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,209
 It burns

1125
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:20,179
 It still burns

1126
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,483
 It burns

1127
01:30:22,484 --> 01:30:27,821
 It still burns

1128
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:29,656
 It burns

1129
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:32,796
 It still hurts

1130
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:38,871
 la la la la

1131
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:44,837
 la la la la

1132
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:46,139
I can't do it.

1133
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,088
No, you can.
The question is will you.
