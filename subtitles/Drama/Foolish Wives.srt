00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,490
The taste is amazing, right?

163
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,590
Here.

164
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,590
-Cheers.<br>-Cheers.

165
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,270
What the?!

166
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,210
Stay still you bastard!

167
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,860
Go Bok Tae!

168
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,290
I'll make sure to pop your cover today.

169
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,800
Ladies, can you please momentarily leave your seats?

170
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,810
You sure are a persistent ass.

171
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,710
What have you got against me from the past life <br>to continue tightening your grip like this?

172
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,040
Stop talking crap

173
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,910
and let's put on your cuffs.

174
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,620
Did you bring a warrant?

175
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,290
It's an exigent circumstance arrest.

176
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,960
We don't need a warrant for a guy like you.

177
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,730
Exigent circumstance arrest?

178
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,630
You've been going at it for so long so now it's an "exigent circumstance" arrest?

179
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,900
What is it?

180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,310
For suspicion of instigation of the murder of Donghae company president Yoo Jung Man.

181
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,160
Hey, you bastard, that's not going to do a thing. If you don't want to get humiliated again

182
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
then go bring other evidence.

183
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,010
Shut up and come out now!

184
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,310
Okay.

185
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,680
Let's go as far as you can.

186
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,420
Chairman.

187
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,030
There's no reason to be flustered.

188
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,900
Just call Lawyer Han.

189
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,830
Hey, hurry up and get him. What are you doing?!

190
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,930
If you don't want your head to have a hole in it then hurry up and get rid of those bastards!

191
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,170
Hey, wait! Wait!

192
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,080
Stop, stop!

193
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,290
-What is it?<br>-Stay here.

194
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,170
You're Jeong Hee, aren't you?

195
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,210
I'm right, Oh Jeong Hee!

196
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,250
Hey, since when have you been working here?

197
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,400
For...about a month.

198
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,230
Don't linger around and get out.

199
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,820
Oh...o...okay.

200
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,780
Hey...

201
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,720
Wow, you finally got a career going for you.

202
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,240
Go quickly!

203
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,350
Okay...

204
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,010
Who was it?

205
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,740
Ah, her name's Oh Jeong Hee. My hoobae from Hanjoogong.

206
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,170
A girl that went to an all boy's school?

207
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,650
It was a coed school, you didn't know?

208
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,680
Wow, during her school days she used to be last place out of the whole school.

209
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,680
Even if she was stupid she had a lot of popularity because of her face.

210
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Out of all the male classmates,

211
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,190
you can count with your finger <br>the number of guys who didn't date that wench Jeong Hee.

212
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,790
What about you?

213
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,650
That wench is nice to everyone else, but just all tight lipped with me.

214
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,620
Idiot.

215
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,570
You got screwed.

216
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,990
I'm like that I guess.

217
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,430
Heo Yeong Dal you have been banned for 3 months.

218
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,280
What?

219
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,660
Why? -It's the security teams decision, so I'm not sure either.

220
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,870
Maybe it's because of that drinking incident.

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,060
Ah, that bastard really is going too far.

222
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,160
Hey,

223
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,550
Ah, just because of that it's not a week but three months of probation? So what do you want me to do about it?

224
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,080
Call the Team Leader.

225
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,540
Go on, call the Team Leader!

226
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,140
Quickly call him! Quickly!

227
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,180
What is the problem?

228
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,400
How can you treat a regular guest like this?

229
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,820
Are you guys really going to come out like this?

230
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,860
Are you going to look down on me like this when I've spent so much money here?

231
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,360
Ahjussi!

232
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,140
Ahjussi, don't you know who I am?

233
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm asking if you don't know Heo Yeong Dal you bastards?

234
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,190
If you keep making disturbances we'll ban you permanently.

235
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,270
What? What about permanent?!

236
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,730
- Permanent?!<br>- Calm down, Yeong Dal!

237
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,660
Hey Yeong Dal! Calm down!

238
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,520
- You keep this up, then~<br>- Just wait a second!

239
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,350
Yeong Dal, you really can't do this!

240
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,310
Hey Yeong Dal! Please, don't make a scene.

241
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,330
Wait a moment. What are you looking at?

242
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,110
What are you looking at? Is there a show?

243
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,650
There's no movie, you bastards!

244
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,340
So embarrassing!

245
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,630
Let's just consider we saved money, and go have a drink.

246
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,070
Save what did we save?

247
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,610
I need to go play one.

248
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,950
Where are you going to do that?

249
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,140
Let's just go to Cheulgun.

250
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,850
What do you mean Cheulgun?

251
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,040
<i>LoveDramasAsia</i>

252
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,000
Why is the quality of customers so bad?

253
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,650
Madam Jang, isn't that Yeong Dal?

254
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,660
Should I get rid of him? -What do we need to face

255
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,980
again after we try to get rid of him?

256
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,300
Let them in.

257
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,020
Aigoo, this bastard.

258
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,250
Hello, Hyungnim.

259
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,310
Hey, do you have money?

260
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,850
Ah, so embarrassing. Why are you being like this?

261
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,350
Here, enough?

262
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,480
Hey, buy the chips first.

263
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,520
Okay, let me put that, hey.

264
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,600
How much did you say the max bet was here?

265
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,250
With that piddly $5k, you're looking for the maximim bet?

266
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,660
Just do whatever you feel like because I'll accept it all.

267
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,620
Don't say something different later.

268
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,630
Don't make a scene after losing all of your money.

269
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,990
If you act up again I'm going to bury you.

270
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,970
The picture today is so-so.

271
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,980
Did we ever look at the picture? We just went with the feel.

272
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,500
Right, let's go.

273
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,660
Over there?

274
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,190
Hello, Hyungnim.

275
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,100
Yeong Dal, what are you doing right now?

276
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,470
-Why do you ask?<br>-Why?

277
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,800
Can't you see we're all bankers?

278
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,610
If you go the opposite, are you telling us to all lose?

279
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,360
My gut feeling is saying to play, Hyungnim.

280
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,940
If you want why don't you switch?

281
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,080
Give out the cards.

282
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,070
Card for player, card for bankers, players, bankers.

283
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,300
Come out, come out.

284
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,690
Okay.

285
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,380
<br>

286
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,720
Here.

287
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,980
My luck is back, it's back I tell you.

288
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,330
Good, there we go!

289
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,010
Yeah!

290
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,180
Good, good.

291
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,090
Got it!

292
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,330
You got it!

293
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,700
Oh, really...

294
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,480
Hyungnim, what did I say?

295
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,260
I've totally got the Player feel.

296
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,530
Wow.

297
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,300
Player natural 9, Banker natural 8.

298
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,950
Player win.

299
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,530
Yeong Dal, you

300
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,870
can get beaten up by me if you play like this.

301
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,800
-Move seats.<br>-Yes, Hyungnim.

302
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,210
Aigoo.

303
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,520
Let's eat it.

304
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,010
-Hey, Yeong Dal let's take that out. <br>-Aigoo, you're being so unlucky.

305
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,680
Yes, let's go.

306
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,670
Card for player, card for banker, player, banker.

307
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,930
Let's go.

308
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,950
Now...

309
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,970
We got it.

310
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,740
Good.

311
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,220
Good, good.

312
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,420
That's it, let's do that.

313
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,650
It's okay.

314
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,000
It's okay. You can make a connection.

315
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,380
Yes, let's go Dal.

316
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,110
Dal! Dal! Dal!

317
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,920
Open it.

318
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,610
Player 1, Banker 0.

319
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,990
Oh! Oh!

320
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,090
Solo winner dude.

321
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,310
You're doing amazing today!

322
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,800
Be quiet all the luck will fall out.

323
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,070
Okay.

324
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,540
Okay!

325
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,140
You open first.

326
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,970
Yeah! It's going to pay!

327
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,970
Hey, we get it unless it's 9!

328
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,670
If it's not 9, we win. $20,000, 20k!

329
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,500
Flip it. Just flip it!

330
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,530
$20,000, $20k! It's done!

331
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,050
9!

332
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,540
Player 0, Banker 1. Banker wins.

333
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,620
He lost?

334
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,230
They lost.

335
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,120
That was bad.

336
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,240
Hey.

337
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,050
That's why I told you to take out some chips. Why did you have to go all at once?!

338
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,110
I said be quiet.

339
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,840
He will make a mess soon.

340
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,210
Ah, the aftereffects of this one are going to last a while.

341
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,410
Ah, if it weren't for that 9... But how could that 9 pop up and screw us over?

342
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,420
Ah, really!

343
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,650
The feeling that you were talking about wasn't "that" feeling but the feeling to lose.

344
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,940
If we got that and it's $20k, once more then it's $40k...

345
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Another one, it would have been $80k! Dang... <br>I feel the loss, really.

346
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,540
Jang Soo, let's take out some of Gi Chan hyungnim's money.

347
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,670
What?

348
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,120
-Did you make up your mind to die? <br>-Whether I die like this or like that I'll still die.

349
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,150
I mean...Hey.

350
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,310
Why die? Just fill it back up is all.

351
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,130
Ki Chan hyungnim has a long way to go before coming out of the can.

352
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,880
If only you and I keep quiet,

353
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
no one will know.

354
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,610
I can't do it.

355
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,310
I don't want to bet my life.

356
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,260
Quickly dig up here.

357
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,510
Yeong Dal, I really don't think this is right.

358
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,590
You bastard, I said dig.

359
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,160
Aish, really...

360
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,790
Wait!

361
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,710
It's done.

362
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,410
Move over.

363
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,070
We can use some of this, and if we just <br>fill it back up without anyone knowing...

364
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,870
What if we can't fill it up?

365
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,300
Just trust me.

366
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:23,330
Aish, my dad said I can trust a stray dog but not you.

367
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,960
Then drop out now.

368
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,350
Hey, are you kidding.

369
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,520
I came this far, how can I drop out now?

370
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,070
You bastard, are you in your right mind, huh?!

371
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,730
Without a report how can you take care of things on your own?!

372
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,280
I know.

373
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,080
I'm sorry.

374
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,250
Sorry?

375
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,060
You jerk, do you think this will be solved with a simple sorry? Huh?!

376
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,210
We can't even touch that guy and let him off, why did you go and arrest him?

377
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,330
I was sure I could get the warrant.

378
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,400
All the circumstantial evidence confirms murder instigation!

379
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,820
Shut up!

380
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,390
The results tell everything. What else do you need to say?

381
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,100
Dong Soo,

382
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,470
you should now let go of Go Bok Tae.

383
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,530
Why are you being like this, too? Really?!

384
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:38,390
Then, what's the reason for not letting go even when you always lose?

385
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,830
I heard the provincial Internal audit team <br>have begun investigating you, so

386
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,980
prepare yourself.

387
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,830
Do you take the medicine I gave you?

388
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,990
No.

389
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,290
Why not?

390
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,070
Just because. After I eat them I feel weird.

391
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,150
That's what it's for.

392
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,570
Anyway, it make me feel horrid.

393
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,290
If you're not going to listen to me, then there's no need for us to meet.

394
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,820
Do you want me to honestly tell you what your condition is?

395
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,820
It's fear.

396
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,350
Fear of what?

397
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,180
Even if I don't say, you know that better.

398
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,490
It's me.

399
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,750
No, I'll go.

400
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,070
Yes.

401
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,130
If you can't get rid of that you'll stay at the same spot.

402
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,370
I have an appointment so I'll be leaving first.

403
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,660
Hello.

404
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,440
Wow. I didn't know you were still in the audit team.

405
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,310
Yes, I'm also sick of looking for the wrongdoings <br>of people I work with.

406
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,690
Please help us with your power, Chief.

407
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Hey, where do I have that kind of power?

408
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,540
Greet each other.

409
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,830
Here is my friend who is a crime scene profiler.

410
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm Hwang Shin Hye.

411
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,210
I'm Lee Young Do in audit team.

412
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,540
I'm No Sang Neh.

413
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,030
I'll go, so talk to each other.

414
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,550
Yes.

415
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,490
Take a seat.

416
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,500
Chief is your father, right?

417
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,230
Yes.

418
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,470
I worked for him when I was in Jongno station.

419
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,060
Even then, he boasted so much about his daughter.

420
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,040
She's great enough to be bragged about.

421
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,960
She graduated from a reputable Medical University, and even received a doctorate in psychiatry.

422
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,510
But, for what reason did you ask to see me?

423
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,430
Ah, yes.

424
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,630
I have something to consult with you as a psychiatrist.

425
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,750
<i>Police Officer Personnel Record</i>

426
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,120
It's a man named Jang Dong Soo, that we're looking into.

427
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,120
He's a part of the metropolitan area investigative unit.

428
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,940
What's the reason for me making an evaluation?

429
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,240
We think that he has some issues with his head.

430
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,170
What should I say? Anger management?

431
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,470
<i>He's already caused two incidents involving firearms.</i>

432
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,820
<i>On site, there's many times he committed disturbances for being over the top.</i>

433
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:19,480
<i>Please interview him as a psychiatrist and <br>give us your professional opinion.</i>

434
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:27,660
First of all, an act of anger is not a mental disorder.

435
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,090
We call the symptom similar to that 'Intermittent Explosive Disorder'.

436
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,900
Intermittent explosive disorder.

437
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,860
Well, then we leave it in your care.

438
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,360
May I ask you something?

439
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,180
You have a picture of him, right?

440
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,880
The clothes that he's wearing are designer from head to toe.

441
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,730
As you already know

442
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,780
he's wearing those clothes from the money he makes as a detective.

443
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,670
What kind of mindset is that?

444
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,910
What do you mean what?

445
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,700
He's crazy.

446
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,870
<i>Come in.</i>

447
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,600
<i>Oh? Dad!</i>

448
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,170
<i> Yes.</i>

449
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,510
<i>Who is this?</i>

450
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,740
<i>Ah...</i>

451
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,880
<i>A friend who will be living with us.</i>

452
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,690
<i>Let me introduce you. This is Jang Dong Soo,</i>

453
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,290
<i>and this is Hwang Sin Hye.</i>

454
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,710
<i>My one and only daughter as well as the maiden that takes care of all the chores.</i>

455
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,030
<i>Wait, because he's two years older than you,</i>

456
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,170
<i>call him Oppa.</i>

457
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,820
<i>Dong Soo is going to take the GED so you help him out.</i>

458
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,190
<i>My Sin Hye never lost first place so</i>

459
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,820
<i>Treat her as your teacher.</i>

460
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,960
<i>In these cases you have to apply the FOIL method.</i>

461
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,630
<i>You don't know the FOIL method?</i>

462
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,190
<i>This won't do.</i>

463
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,620
<i>I think you're going to have to leave high school work,</i>

464
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,760
<i>and start right from middle school.</i>

465
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,810
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

466
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,230
<i>I'm your oppa, so why do you keep speaking informally?</i>

467
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,100
<i>Beacause I want to.</i>

468
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,080
<i>Hey.</i>

469
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,860
<i>You...</i>

470
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,960
<i>You like me, right?</i>

471
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,710
<i>Shall I</i>

472
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,160
<i>show you my bare skin?</i>

473
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,490
<i>No.</i>

474
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,820
<i>If you want to see it,</i>

475
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,600
<i>close your eyes.</i>

476
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,200
<i>That...</i>

477
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,940
<i>You don't want to?</i>

478
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,130
<i>If not, forget it.</i>

479
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,690
<i>O...okay.</i>

480
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,860
<i>I'm ready. Open your eyes.</i>

481
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,410
<i>I said open your eyes.</i>

482
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,120
<i>What do you think?</i>

483
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,660
<i>You're totally dirty minded.</i>

484
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,400
There's an eyewitness who witnessed it all.

485
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,880
Yes.

486
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,550
Yes.

487
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,750
Excuse me,

488
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,840
can I help you?

489
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,970
I'm here to see Detective Jang Dong Soo.

490
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,930
Ah, how do you know Jang Dong Soo..?

491
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,470
What are you doing?

492
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,220
Hurry up and wake him up.

493
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,510
A moment please.

494
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,690
Chief.

495
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,110
Chief!

496
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,730
You've got a guest.

497
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,560
What?

498
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,830
You've got a guest.

499
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,410
Without even a call, what is it?

500
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,280
I just wanted to see you working.

501
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,810
How about you?

502
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,360
How is it being a criminal profiler?

503
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,280
It's just the beginning.

504
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,830
But,

505
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,190
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

506
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,760
I've been a detective for way more than a decade, but

507
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,680
I don't know what a Profiler does.

508
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,290
What do you do?

509
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,560
I'm not too sure either

510
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,700
Is your husband well?

511
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,280
It's been a long time since I've seen Father.

512
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,960
He always makes the excuse that he's busy.

513
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,030
Why am I living so pathetically?

514
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,540
I...

515
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,610
I've met with people from the audit team today.

516
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,490
Why would you?

517
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,090
I've been asked to evaluate your mental state.

518
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,470
Ah, these bastards!

519
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,720
Now they're making me out to be crazy?

520
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,570
I'm sorry.

521
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,420
From my judgment you need treatment.

522
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,520
Why are you being like this too?

523
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,770
Listen to me.

524
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,110
You already lost your timing to get treated. If you refuse it'll get worse.

525
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,710
-Now isn't too late...<br>-Stop.

526
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,140
Tell those audit team bastards

527
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,470
that I'm completely normal.

528
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,210
I'll be going first.

529
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:43,110
<i>I've met with people from the audit team today.</i>

530
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,790
<i>I've been asked to evaluate your mental state.</i>

531
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,080
What's with this emotional mood?

532
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,850
What is?

533
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,410
That's why,

534
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,770
when I was telling you I would find a woman for you, <br>you weren't too keen on it, but

535
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,230
now you're lonely?

536
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,430
Is there anyone who is not lonely in life?

537
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,350
That's true.

538
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,320
♪ Lonely

539
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,280
♪ So lonely

540
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,130
♪ I cannot live

541
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,200
Aigoo, you must really be lonely.

542
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,700
♪ Between the sky and the earth

543
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,410
♪ I'm all alone

544
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,710
♪ Because of the love

545
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,770
♪ I can't forget

546
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,690
♪ My heart yearns

547
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,440
♪ No answer

548
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,810
♪ Echoes

549
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,420
♪ Fall in mid air

550
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,700
It's not enough to be sad, now he is in sickly pain.

551
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,930
Hello, Aunt.

552
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,310
Hey, your boss is about to die from loneliness.

553
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,370
It seems you should be his drinking buddy a little.

554
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,570
Aigoo.

555
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm lonely, too.

556
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,030
Shall we date?

557
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,370
Get lost you rascal.

558
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,550
You're here.

559
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,750
I've not seen you around lately. Where have you been hiding?

560
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,870
I've been resting.

561
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,010
Huh, bastard.

562
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,230
It must be nice you can talk like that.

563
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,650
Should I order you one? -I'm fine.

564
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,950
Hey, make some collections today.

565
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,850
I don't do things like that anymore.

566
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:34,600
What?

567
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,160
Doing things like that to make money

568
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,110
I'm really sick of it now.

569
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,410
Find someone else.

570
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,100
Yeong Dal!

571
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,860
You, Officer Gook was looking for you.

572
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,550
I was going there anyway.

573
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,970
Hey, what's up with him?

574
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,210
Did he eat something wrong?

575
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,420
Why aren't you saying anything when your father is talking to you?

576
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,080
I'm eating what's wrong with you?!

577
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,300
You go out in his place and make the collections, jack ass!

578
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,430
Hello.

579
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,810
Sunbaenim!

580
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,790
I heard you were looking for me.

581
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,820
What is this?

582
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,030
How can I come empty-handed when I'm coming to see you?

583
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,860
(Drink it) fast.

584
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,080
Okay.

585
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,900
But, rumors about you are quite strange.

586
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,950
Rumors?

587
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,660
You spend money so much, that it doesn't fit your status.

588
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,140
Did you cause trouble again?

589
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,970
Am I at an age to cause trouble?

590
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,950
I.. after seeing you, Detective Gook,

591
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,100
am living everyday diligently.

592
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,740
You little bastard and your tricks.

593
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,600
I'm sorry.

594
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,550
You can just take him.

595
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,540
Come here.

596
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,310
Come here.

597
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,650
Hey, Oh Byeong Tae. How many times is this? How many times are you going in and out of this place?

598
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,570
Noona, who are you to say? Just stop caring

599
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,410
Hey, I am your noona and take place of Mom and Dad.

600
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,510
Ugh, so annoying.

601
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,220
What? Hey, you.

602
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,510
Why are you being so annoying?

603
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,290
This little...

604
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,780
What are you doing?

605
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,910
Stop caring and go on your way.

606
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,940
Stop caring and just go?

607
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,010
This rude, little kid.

608
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,940
Why are you hitting me?

609
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,850
I am hitting you because you deserve it.

610
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,470
Because you deserve it.

611
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,510
What are you?

612
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,800
Who are you to hit my little brother?

613
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,000
Well because, he was so rude.

614
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,630
Why do you care if my brother is rude or not rude?

615
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,710
Let's go.

616
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,650
<i>In my judgment, you need some treatment.</i>

617
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,740
<i>Why are you being like this also?</i>

618
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,730
<i>Don't get excited, and just listen.</i>

619
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,280
<i>You lost your opportunity to get treated already, and if you just let it be, it will only get worse.</i>

620
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,940
Ok, I got it.

621
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,480
Detective.

622
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,150
Why?

623
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,260
I found the line for money laundering for Go Bok Tae.

624
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:31,820
What is it?

625
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,910
I was told Go Bok Tae is the biggest hand <br>in the VIP room of the casino in Sabuk.

626
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,730
Money laundering line is there?

627
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,730
No. Loan sharks who lend money there.

628
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,720
Let's go. <br>-Right now?

629
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,080
Come out quickly.

630
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,290
Well, I heard Sabuk is your home town.

631
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,710
Yes.

632
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,450
Does anyone live there?

633
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,990
No, nobody is there.

634
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,630
The last time I went was 15 or 16 years ago.

635
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,410
Why?

636
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,940
Is there any reason for that?

637
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,940
Ay, it didn't go in.

638
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,320
Let's go to Cheulgun today and play.

639
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,350
Hey, there's rumors around that you're using loads of money.

640
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,300
Is it okay?

641
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,170
If I'm scared of rumors when am I going to win?

642
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Don't worry and get ready.

643
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,740
Hey, I need to stop by somewhere so I'll meet you there.

644
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,890
They where are you going in the middle of playing billiards?

645
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,560
Hey, hey what about the game fee?

646
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,100
You're working hard.

647
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,270
What brings you here?

648
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,400
Yes, I'm the one who called. Jang Dong Soo from the metropolitan area unit.

649
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,560
Oh, yes. I'm Detective Gook.

650
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,640
Yes.

651
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,140
I'm Detective Gook.

652

00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,200
Slowly.

655
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,230
Let's do it softly.

656
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,100
You acted as if you wouldn't see me again.

657
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,250
What's up?

658
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,650
I also want to kill myself.

659
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,710
Hurry up and shower.

660
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,190
Should we do it together?

661
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,140
You know those loan sharks that lend money around the casino?

662
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,790
Someone who knows all about the loan sharks,

663
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,030
we need an informant like that.

664
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,560
If that's what you need

665
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,570
I have someone that I know.

666
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,630
Who's that?

667
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,580
Hey, open the door.

668
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,310
Hey, open the door you bastard!

669
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,390
Who is it?

670
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,570
Hurry up and open the door you bastard!

671
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,070
Who are you, you bastard?

672
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,900
Aren't you going to open up? Open up.

673
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,880
This little...

674

Hey, aren't you going to open the door!

675
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,890
Hey, open the door!

676
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,410
Oh.

677
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,940
Seriously.

678
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,750
Oh. He's over there.

679
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,090
Over there. It's that guy.

680
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,770
What is that guy doing wearing only underwear in the middle of the day?

681

682
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,540
I'm about to go crazy.

683
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,400
Hey, don't come. Don't come.

684
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,250
Oh.

685
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,830
Come on, stop. What's this? <br>- Stop already! Why are you doing this?

686
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,190
Don't follow me!

687
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,760
Wait. Okay, okay.

688
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,400
What?!

689
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,040
Who are you to follow me?

690
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,630
Hey! I'm about to go crazy.

691
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,320
Don't follow me please!

692
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,640
Okay.
