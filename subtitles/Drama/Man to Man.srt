1
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,298
Hey, Man, stop! Wait!

2
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,894
Wait! Stop! We have
to re-tie the cords.

3
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,971
We have to get out of here!

4
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,649
He's bleeding.
The female is unconscious.

5
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,219
I insist!

6
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,213
Come on, let's go!

7
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,651
Move!

8
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,132
Hello, my little beauty.

9
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,217
The whole world's been looking
for you and I found you.

10
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,052
I'm going to call you "America".

11
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,654
You are my America
and by God...

12
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,458
I'm your Christopher Columbus.

13
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,255
Leave him!

14
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,529
Let him go!

15
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,374
Don't shoot!

16
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,572
My dear friends...

17
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,090
I can relate great news.

18
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,776
We have two of the savages:
A male and a female.

19
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,497
The male has tried
to kill me...

20
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,937
and he's the most ferocious
fighter, by I've survived.

21
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,411
The other africans recoil
from our savages in fear.

22
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,135
They called them
"Spirits of the forest"...

23
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,099
and believe they can wreak
much evil magic.

24
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,172
- Why you leaving us?
- My work here is finished.

25
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,055
But this is your country.
You live here.

26
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,455
- My home is across the sea, sir.
- Your lord is here. He die here.

27
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,410
That is true and I'll carry
his memory in my heart. Always.

28
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,859
Why is it you want
with small men?.

29
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,817
- I'll take them to my country.
- Why not take me?.

30
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,857
Your wives would miss you
too much, sir.

31
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,540
You must take my men.
They big men.

32
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,211
I need to take pygmies.
I will study them, sir.

33
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,254
For why?.

34
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,809
Because... all men on earth,
I believe, come from them.

35
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,813
But you're a white man.
These are black.

36
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,132
That is what the Doctor believes
if he's right he'll be famous.

37
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,774
What is famous?.

38
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,770
Everybody in the whole
world will know who he is.

39
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,888
You want to be a king?.
You take one little man...

40
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,178
one little woman to your
country and you king also!

41
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,853
- Is this why you go with him?.
- No, sir.

42
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,898
So he give you plenty money.

43
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,691
Go to forest, take two little
people. Two of my men die.

44
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,208
You pay me!

45
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,612
Shall I have this loaded, Madam?.

46
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,739
They don't belong to me anymore.
I'd given them to the King!

47
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,417
I think we should get the
birds on the next. Thank you.

48
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,452
We make sail in a few days. Our
ship awaits its precious cargo.

49
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,848
The two pygmies are safe and
well and I am healing fast.

50
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,811
The prospect of what lies before
us fills me with an excitement.

51
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,088
Our dreams are close
to being realised.

52
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,254
I don't understand!
What is he saying?.

53
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,898
The pygmies would put
a curse on you.

54
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,538
They won't survive
outside their world.

55
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,459
At least we'll have their
bodies to study.

56
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,292
Aren't you gonna tell him
what I said?.

57
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,459
Move yourselves!

58
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,972
Don't just lie there!
Move your legs!

59
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,569
Move! Get up!
Exercise!

60
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,692
Doctor! Leave them alone!

61
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,137
Stand up! Move your arms!

62
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,376
You'd be better talking
to the monkeys!

63
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,612
I'd be better off without you.

64
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,776
Come on, eat!
Amd you my lovely, you to eat.

65
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,368
Calm down.

66
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,695
Stop now!

67
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,411
Hey, back away! Now!

68
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,448
I've listed the pygmies as
a kind of anthropodial monkey.

69
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,459
We don't want to be taken
for slave traders.

70
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,338
I don't want to take any risks
but you're becoming the risk.

71
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,615
Let Zachary deal with,
he knows what is doing.

72
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,210
Thery are my responsibility.

73
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,539
They're my responsibility and
I don't want you going down.

74
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,369
I don't take orders!
Especially not from you!

75
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,332
Call it a "suggestion". I've
made this journey many times.

76
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,737
This is just a business venture
for you but for me...

77
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,970
it's probable these creatures
existed on earth before man.

78
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,809
At as other species were
becoming extinct, they survived.

79
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,055
There could be more at stake
than just the origin of man.

80
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,570
We could be talking
about the origin of all life!

81
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,458
I won't let a trader in wild
animals divert me.

82
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,610
You're forbidden to get down
to the hold.

83
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,930
My dear friends, a fever
has laid me low.

84
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,209
I suspect malaria so have kept
myself away from the pygmies.

85
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,690
I worry for them, in my absence,
but I dare not risk contagion.

86
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,730
We pass through ever
stormier seas.

87
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,370
Doctor! Come quick!

88
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,969
I see... yes.

89
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,453
I understand.

90
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,693
It's me you wanted.

91
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,013
Well here I am.

92
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,132
My name is Jamie.

93
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,537
We're friends now.

94
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,174
Friends.

95
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,895
Don't!

96
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,848
Back away!

97
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,978
When are you going to learn?.
You're who captured them!

98
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,178
They'll never forget. Never!

99
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,657
It's from Jamie.
Posted from Lisbon.

100
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,177
The ship docks
in a matter of days.

101
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,900
"My friends, there have been
serious problems...

102
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,411
difficulties, constraints...
I advise caution.

103
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,939
My fever enforces brevity.

104
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,170
We must struggle to... "
He doesn't even sign it.

105
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,893
- Look at his handwriting.
- He must be very ill.

106
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,208
It's not like him.

107
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,652
As if he deranged.

108
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,379
- Let me stay.
- That's impossible, my darling.

109
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,049
- I should be by your side.
- Abigail, you promised.

110
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,817
Why?. I'll stay in our bedroom.

111
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,096
- I am not leaving.
- Yes you are!

112
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,094
My sweet, dear,
very obstinate little sister.

113
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,328
Fraser won't do a stroke of
a work if you're here.

114
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,619
We have two months to present
our paper to Academy.

115
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,213
A coach will take you
to Edinburgh at noon.

116
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,293
You send Jamie on this adventure
cause he's got nothing to lose.

117
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,018
You can't treat me like that.
I'm staying with my husband!

118
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,768
I'm frightened.

119
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,730
I have a bad feeling.

120
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,335
I always thought your idea
was insane.

121
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,178
Our research will be a huge
significance to the world.

122
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,133
If only you knew how I prayed
that Jamie would fail.

123
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,009
I just keep thinking...
What if they're dead?.

124
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,691
Here is our eagle how
quite she is a lioness.

125
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,772
Some parrots, the monkeys.

126
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,290
Don't go too close to the
apes, they can be vicious.

127
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,537
The Cheetah and
the sweet litlle wart hog.

128
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,694
- Very good, madam.
- When should I get the document?.

129
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,255
We'll have to go through
a regulation.

130
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,537
- The zoo is expecting them.
- I do my best.

131
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,456
Now the real work begins.
my little fellow.

132
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,010
Don't worry,
I'll keeping my distance.

133
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,655
- Jamie!
- Alexander! Fraser!

134
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,972
- You look well traveled, Jamie.
- That I... certainly am!

135
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,539
My friends, if you had any idea
how much I've thought of you.

136
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,808
There were days when I thought
I'd never see you again.

137
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,853
Is everything all right?.

138
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,939
They're still alive?.

139
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,891
Thank God
they are still alive!

140
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,816
I can't believe it.
Are they in good condition?.

141
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,891
Please tell me how I can sell
something which I don't own?.

142
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,132
These pygmies belong
to King Mateke Seko...

143
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,215
who has given me the concession
for the whole of Europe.

144
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,936
I am prepared to place them
at your disposal for 3 months.

145
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,493
As if they were for hire?.

146
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,489
The fee for the expedition
included delivery of savages.

147
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,499
They belong to us!

148
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,289
No one outside Africa
can "own" these pygmies.

149
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,448
This is called slavery.

150
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,253
Do you think we can trust
Madame Van den Ende?.

151
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,214
As long as we're all working
for our mutual benefit, we can.

152
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,137
Then we are agreed.

153
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,492
I'll have the papers drawn up.
I congratulate Dr Dodd.

154
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,897
Without him this expedition
would never have succeeded.

155
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,097
Let us through!

156
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,891
I never dreamt I'd live
to see this. Incredible.

157
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,334
You're right, Jamie.
It is our America.

158
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,814
Our "guests" are savages
from the jungles of Africa.

159
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,818
Very dangerous.
They are also cannibals.

160
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,013
We don't know what strange
diseases they may be carrying.

161
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,457
So keep away
and you'll be perfectly safe.

162
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,376
Bring provisions and water to
the mill, and we'd distribute.

163
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,336
Mr McBride,Dr Dodd and I, will
be the only people they'll see.

164
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,379
No one must know about them
till we present them to Academy.

165
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,331
But what about you
and the others, sir?.

166
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,848
The pursuit of knowledge
entails certain risks.

167
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,694
But don't you worry, we'll
be taking every precaution.

168
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,695
- Is everything all right?.
- All well sir.

169
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,856
- Did they sleep at all?.
- One at time.

170
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,256
- Did you see them fornicate?.
- Fornicate?. Why?.

171
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,410
Curiosity.
Scientific curiosity.

172
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,410
- Is the female the mate of male?.
- Not as far as I'm aware.

173
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,978
I haven't the faintest idea
what they are to each other.

174
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,693
They probably think we'll
attack them if they both sleep.

175
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,935
Or they're waiting
for a chance to attack us.

176
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,419
- What are they doing?.
- They're exercising.

177
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,459
Fascinating!

178
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,459
America! Stop!

179
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,856
Stop, America!

180
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,175
Fraser, on you go.

181
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,019
That's it!

182
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,652
Fraser, get out!

183
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,932
Back! America stop!

184
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,936
Open the door!
Fraser get to the door! Out!

185
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,579
Breathe! Breathe!

186
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,092
I'm not finished with you...
not by a long way.

187
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,888
Heaven breathe!

188
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,611
Something you need me for,
Mr Duncan?.

189
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,299
I was worried. We heard
shots coming from the mill.

190
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,531
Yes, we did fire some shots.
And you know why, Mr Duncan?.

191
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,569
We're studying the degree of
emotion our little savages...

192
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,017
might display. It's most
instructive. Good day.

193
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,008
Jamie...

194
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,934
Toko...

195
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,649
Come on, there is
nothing to lose.

196
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,218
"Thre blind mice,
see how they run...

197
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,258
Run after the farmer's wife and
cut off the tails with a knife

198
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,652
QA to AB, 83 degrees.

199
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:25,618
Facial line 9 and
one quarter inches.

200
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,532
QA to AB, 62 degrees.

201
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:41,738
Facial line,
7 and 2/5.

202
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,091
Facial projection, 108.

203
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,131
Cerebral projection, 87...

204
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,135
No it's right.
62 degrees!

205
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,012
The great apes are almost
always below 50 degrees.

206
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,009
Negroes, usualy above 70.
Mongols between 73 and 77...

207
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,529
and you Jamie, the perfect
caucasian at 83.

208
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,449
Which would seem to place our
pygmies right in the middle.

209
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,976
Between the most evolved apes
and the least developed humans.

210
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,656
You know what this implies?.

211
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,859
How certain are you?.

212
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,368
- Results point in one direction.
- We can't afford to be wrong.

213
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,010
I've checked and checked again.

214
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,459
My God!

215
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:28,177
It looks like the world is gonna
have to come to terms with...

216
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,769
the fact that Adam and Eve were
a little black man and woman.

217
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,693
They're gonna have to
repaint the Sistine Chapel.

218
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,690
When you left them alone they
didn't seem troubled in any way?.

219
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,210
No, they weren't "troubled".
Wrong vocabulary, my fellow.

220
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,495
That would require intelligence
and a capacity for reflection.

221
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,934
Our couple are thousands
of years away from all that.

222
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,329
Pull up there!

223
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,698
Who gave you the permission
to come in here?.

224
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,454
No one! But I assumed you're
not going to turn me away.

225
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,529
If you succeed, then
you'll be forgiven...

226
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,415
until then we'll have to ensure
we have the proper documents.

227
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,493
I understand.

228
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,978
Toko "Ambaka" for the man.
What do you think?.

229
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,410
And do you know the name
of the girl?.

230
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,936
You... just invent something.

231
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,011
Wouli Djem. And the age is?.

232
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,290
Say 20 for him
18 for her.

233
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,178
You'd better fill in the rest.

234
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,178
So, our guests are Toko Ambaka
and Wouli Djem.

235
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,298
In the province of Oubangui in
the territory of King Mateke.

236
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,934
They have come to Scotland at
the ivitation or Royal Academy.

237
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,250
I need a letter of confirmation
from the Academy.

238
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,179
Consider it done.

239
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,530
I hereby certify that both
of the said individuals...

240
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,489
are placed under my authority
for a period of three months.

241
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,292
Please sign.

242
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,933
May I see them?.

243
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,690
Madame... would you join me?.
It's safe now.

244
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,133
We don't have much time.

245
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,616
Madame, considering you're here,
it'd be most helpful...

246
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,892
I don't think any of us should...

247
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,977
I see. What shall I say?.
It's very delicate.

248
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,816
- It would seem something of...
- Of a violation?.

249
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,419
Very well.

250
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,779
I think you should leave!

251
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,098
She's most definitely a woman.

252
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,333
What are these for?.

253
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,010
Fill this with lead shot and we
can tell exactly the volume...

254
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,935
of the cranium. We can measure
the size of their brains.

255
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,053
She's waking.

256
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,768
Good, yes, I have it.

257
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,339
Careful.

258
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,379
Be calm.

259
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,929
Hold her!

260
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,458
- What are you doing?.
- She sees her own death!

261
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,655
She thinks her soul is being
taken from her.

262
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,451
She would have killed herself.

263
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,333
Have you seen them?.

264
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,772
No, but I could hear the most
awful cries. Not human cries.

265
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,333
And it wasn't the first time.
We got to get them out of here.

266
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,328
They bring evil.
They got evil powers.

267
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,730
This is nonesense. What evil
have they done to you?.

268
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,092
My child has raging fever,
three days now.

269
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,810
My cattle are maddened, they
don't sleep at night.

270
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,212
That's the moon... everyone
knows that. You can't...

271
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,178
Mr Auchinleck's not the same.
He's like a man possessed...

272
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,619
and we should deliver him
from his possession!

273
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,773
Go up and get Mr Auchinleck.
Douglas, you come with me.

274
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,972
It's an asthma attack.
He could die...

275
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,859
Quickly!

276
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,418
Bring me the lamp and
hold his head up!

277
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,819
Hold his head!

278
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,459
Bastard!

279
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,456
You give that here,
black buggers.

280
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,972
Too late, sir. And so were we.

281
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,173
Clear the way!

282
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,212
Move aside, I say!

283
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,569
Douglas is dead, sir.
The savages killed him.

284
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,138
God bless his soul.

285
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,860
Spread out... you go
in small groups.

286
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,257
Do not hurt them on any
account. I want them alive.

287
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,738
Any man who harms them
will answer to me.

288
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,732
- If they're seen as animals...
- But if they're human being?.

289
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,289
Then, they are murderers.
Our work is over.

290
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,378
- We must find them first.
- Follow the trail fast.

291
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,297
Madame, We'll go
around the forest.

292
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,653
Come on lads. Let's get
these savages!

293
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,053
Are you following?.

294
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,654
I'll be there!

295
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,054
Fine, I have him.

296
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,369
Best leave it to us, Dr Dodd.
We know what to do.

297
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,619
Damn you!

298
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:29,332
The dogs are gone at six.
They must be close!

299
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,298
Oh Jesus Christ!

300
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,617
Put your weapons down!
Keep back the dogs!

301
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,731
We can take them in charge!

302
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,210
They killed Douglas!
The attacked Mr McBride!

303
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,411
It was an accident.
It was nobody fault.

304
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,538
It was a terrible accident.

305
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,130
Take them back to
the police, sir.

306
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,134
- I will kill him!
- Stay there man!

307
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,810
Jamie, stop!

308
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,295
Shut up! Shut up!

309
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,696
Shut up! Shut up!

310
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,659
You did it.

311
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,219
Did what?.

312
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,213
In the struggle,
you had the gun.

313
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,899
It went off by accident.
Douglas hit it.

314
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,658
Alexander, what are you saying?.

315
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,092
It was a tragic accident.
Manslaughter.

316
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,650
- Are you out of your mind?.
- No one will blame you.

317
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,859
But the pygmies
have to be innocent.

318
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,938
You want me to confess
to a crime I didn't commit?.

319
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,614
Yes! It was your stupidity
that landed us here.

320
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,617
I might go to prison.

321
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,970
Not for an accident.

322
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,736
The inquest will be a formality.

323
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,898
Just think,
think what's take here.

324
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,976
Please, Fraser,
this is our only solution.

325
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,939
We're losing time.

326
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,451
With these we need some
more of those. A lot of more.

327
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,259
You two!
Go into the fare side.

328
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,214
We're losing time, come on!

329
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,980
You have to surend the campment
but be on your guard!

330
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,979
You know what happened
to Douglas?.

331
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,859
Move aside! No!

332
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,455
No wait! He's worring of
the evil spirit.

333
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,173
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- We're taking no chances.

334
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,572
Watch him men!

335
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,292
What are you doing?. Tie them up!

336
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,852
They have to be in the forest.
Otherwise they'll die on us.

337
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,419
This is madness!

338
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,095
After last night they know
we're their only protection.

339
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,530
They're not going to run away
not with that mob and dogs out.

340
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,089
Take them back to the mill.

341
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,493
And then you can present two
fresh little corpses! Do it!

342
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,176
Keep watching men.

343
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,533
Nothing means more to me
than our complete success.

344
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,698
Trust me, Alexander.
