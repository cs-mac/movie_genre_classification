1
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:54,884
This is your captain speaking. We will
shortly be approaching Timmins Airport.

2
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,791
Local time is 6:30.
It's a beautiful spring morning

3
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:02,457
and the temperature is seven degrees
with occasional light snow flurries.

4
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:08,472
I hope you've had a pleasant flight and will
enjoy your stay here in Northern Ontario.

5
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,527
(woman) Can I get you some more coffee?

6
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,478
(woman) Do you want more coffee?

7
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,446
Yes, thank you,

8
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:04,414
Do you mind if I sit here?

9
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,285
No,

10
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,653
(woman) Can I take your order?

11
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,391
Yes, please,

12
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,727
I'll have a Coke, please,

13
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,257
Diet?

14
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:22,863
Yeah, I've tried, it's just the no-eating part
that I struggle with,

15
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,941
I'm kidding,

16
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:30,479
I'll have a Diet Coke, yes,
Thanks,

17
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,686
What you reading?

18
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,359
Wipe The Slate, Light The Candle,

19
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:49,794
- Is that a novel?
- Well,,,

20
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,494
It's fiction,

21
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,400
Hmm,

22
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:59,233
I've been thinking of writing one of those,
You can make tons of money,

23
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:03,609
All the gullible people out there,
searching for answers,

24
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,114
I have the best title:

25
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:09,050
The Bleeding Child Within,

26
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,146
What do you think?

27
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,549
It's very good,

28
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:22,859
I don't know what particular area of human
pain or misery I'm gonna focus it on yet,

29
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,026
I just like the title,
Thanks,

30
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,832
I don't wanna waste it,

31
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:34,233
(slurps)

32
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:38,512
You're English, right?

33
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:42,882
Look, you seem like a really chatty
kind of person and I don't want to be rude,

34
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:45,444
but I'm not,,, chatty

35
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:50,653
so perhaps you'd be better off
sitting somewhere else,

36
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,991
Have you seen
some of these people?

37
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:56,999
Well, there's a few
empty tables around,

38
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,661
Do you wanna know
why I sat here?

39
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:02,830
Because you look like a man
who needs to talk,

40
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:07,104
You look like a guy
who hasn't talked in a really long time,

41
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:12,014
- That's why you sat here?
- That is why I sat here,

42
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:16,344
And because I need a lift,

43
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,355
and you were the cleanest option,

44
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:22,915
I'm sorry,

45
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,452
Good luck,

46
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,305
(alarm chirps)

47
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,164
Change of heart?

48
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:12,868
No, I just tried to change gear,
It's automatic,

49
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:16,003
OK, Well, good luck,

50
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm driving to Winnipeg,
You'd better get out when I've had enough,

51
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,925
Yes, Absolutely,
No problem,

52
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,261
Bit of a drive, Winnipeg,

53
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:43,300
- I'm Vivienne, by the way,
- Alex,

54
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:47,174
I have to tell you,
I just got out of prison,

55
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:50,410
Oh,

56
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,038
Fraud?

57
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,652
I killed someone,

58
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:59,015
OK,

59
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,438
About this person you killed,,,

60
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:26,312
I don't want to talk about it, I mentioned it
because I wanted you to be aware

61
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:30,046
that ordinary-looking people
are often the ones you need to avoid,

62
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,918
OK, Gotcha,

63
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,719
Look out for the ordinary ones,

64
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,521
So, are you feeling uneasy now?

65
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,624
No,

66
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,363
Sure?

67
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,928
Well, maybe a little,

68
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,236
Uneasy,
I tend not to visit scared,

69
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:57,076
My mom's scared of everything and I've
made a conscious decision not to go there,

70
00:07:57,147 --> 00:08:01,447
If I hadn't been starving, I wouldn't have
stopped at that diner, That's frightening,

71
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:05,682
You can't be afraid of tattoos and bad teeth,
It's part of their appeal,

72
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:10,624
- I don't really think they'd hurt anyone,
- I was talking about the food,

73
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,089
Oh,

74
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,172
Have you got kids?

75
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:35,809
- No,
- Really? At your age, no kids?

76
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:40,386
Low sperm count?

77
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:42,755
More of a low partner count,

78
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,123
Ah,

79
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:46,628
I know the feeling,

80
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,164
Guys my age just don't like me,

81
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:55,867
Mind you, you're quite an attractive-looking
guy, What's your excuse?

82
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,430
I don't want to talk about it,

83
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,976
There's a surprise,

84
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:14,680
(man on radio) A lot of weather today
- variable conditions right across the area

85
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,818
and I'm not sure if any of
the weather’s gonna be welcome.

86
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:20,488
The one consolation is,
down in the southwest...

87
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:35,639
(Vivienne) So, we're here,
sharing a meal,

88
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:39,615
You know, if I was a few years older,
this would be a date,

89
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:42,208
- A few? You're very generous,
- Mm-hmm,

90
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:47,313
I know how the world works, I give a little
something, you give a little something,

91
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,486
All right, all right, Both my parents are dead
and I have one brother,

92
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,688
That wasn't so hard,

93
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,527
He hates me,

94
00:09:56,599 --> 00:10:00,433
Whoa, there!
Nothing, and then the floodgates open,

95
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,063
Go, Alex, Go, Alex,

96
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,769
We're completely different,

97
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,837
He's handsome and very fit,

98
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:15,648
He works at the stock exchange,
He's what you might call "a hotshot,"

99
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,710
(English accent) Hotshot,

100
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:21,245
Well, you know what they say,
Behind every successful man

101
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:24,316
is a truly astonished woman,

102
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:28,160
- Is that what they say?
- Yep, that's what they say,

103
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,926
He's gay,

104
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,093
That's my point exactly,

105
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:38,336
(both chuckle)

106
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:32,725
Oh! I did good,

107
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,962
And look at these,

108
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,897
Flashing balls that play music,

109
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:46,101
- Just what she's always wanted,
- You don't know my mother, Mr. Sarcastic,

110
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:50,408
She's gonna be beside herself
when she sees these,

111
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,513
I can't wait to see her face,

112
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:57,745
Oh, I love this song,

113
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,289
([music] "All Right Now" by Free)

114
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,347
[Music]... or hesitate

115
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,758
[music] Let's move before they
raise the fucking rent

116
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:06,989
[music] O www

117
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,725
[music] All right now,

118
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,826
[music] Baby, it’s all right now

119
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:17,668
[music] All right now,

120
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,406
[music] Baby, it’s all right now oh

121
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,646
(musical balls play tune)

122
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,425
Are you OK?

123
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,361
Vivienne,,,

124
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,304
Oh, fuck, fuck!

125
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:31,178
- Are you OK? OK, just stay,,,
- (sirens approach)

126
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:35,411
- Someone's in the car,
- Don't get upset, OK, just,,,

127
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,679
There is somebody still in the car,

128
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,884
You have to get her out of the car,

129
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,925
(man) Let's sit you down,
What's your name? Relax,

130
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,325
I'm sorry,

131
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:57,866
- (man) Let's go,
- She's locked inside the car,

132
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,876
You have to get her out of there!

133
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,218
Mr. Hughes?

134
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:49,548
I'm gonna have to ask you to hang around
for a while, A couple of days, tops,

135
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,923
Just till we get all the statements in,

136
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:55,089
- Procedure, You understand,
- (knock on door)

137
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:58,827
Clyde, that urgent stuff has just arrived,
Do you want me to,,,

138
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:01,495
Oh, OK, Meryl,

139
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:07,208
Uh,,, I'm sorry, Mr, Hughes,
I'm just gonna have to, uh,,,

140
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:12,211
My officer managed to retrieve
some of your things,

141
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:15,580
We can get the rest to you
once they've been released,

142
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:21,655
Anyway, just check there's nothing of Miss
Freeman's there and I'll see you out front,

143
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,921
I'd like to speak to her mother,

144
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:26,928
I'm sorry?

145
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,987
Vivienne's mother,

146
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:33,026
It's always a difficult time
for the family,

147
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:37,436
- I realize that,
- With respect, sir, I don't think you do,

148
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:41,341
If your daughter was killed in an accident,
would you speak to the driver?

149
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,971
I didn't kill Vivienne,
The driver of the truck killed Vivienne,

150
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:50,043
Yes, but it wouldn't be very professional
of me to go giving out personal information,

151
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,610
Would it?

152
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,277
(woman) Goodbye, Florence,

153
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,241
(ding dong)

154
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,277
(woman) Yes?

155
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:10,792
I'd like to talk to Mrs, Freeman,

156
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,851
Why?

157
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,394
Mrs, Freeman,

158
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:18,660
may I come in?

159
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,970
- Do I know you?
- No,

160
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:31,303
My name is Alex Hughes,

161
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,181
Just wanted to talk to you
for a couple of minutes,

162
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:40,916
About what?
I'm very busy and I don't do social,

163
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,088
(music stops)

164
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,924
The police have been,
haven't they?

165
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:50,955
Yes, The police were here
two hours and 20 minutes ago,

166
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,024
So you know what's happened,

167
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:55,263
Yes, I know Vivienne is dead,

168
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:01,701
Is that it?

169
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:05,178
Well, I just wanted to explain that,,,

170
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,313
I gave your daughter a lift,

171
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:13,711
It was an accident,

172
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,191
I'm so sorry,

173
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:19,922
OK,

174
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:22,658
(locks door)

175
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:29,071
It's just,
Vivienne bought you something,

176
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:31,606
She said you'd like them,

177
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:36,640
Sparklies,
She got me sparklies,

178
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,942
Um, yes,

179
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:41,575
(musical balls play tune)

180
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,852
Are you OK?

181
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:33,665
Take off your outdoor shoes
and put them in the row,

182
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,705
Don't move any of the others,

183
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:49,712
I'm to offer you something, Would you
like an herbal tea? I have 17 varieties,

184
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:53,744
- Yes, let me,,,
- No! Don't come in my kitchen,

185
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:56,291
That's off-limits,

186
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:04,430
I'm gonna give you
the licorice one,

187
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,665
I can't stomach the licorice one,
It tastes like cat pee,

188
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,340
Are you alone here?

189
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,139
Yes,

190
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,682
Do you have anybody who can
stay with you for a couple of days?

191
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:31,022
I have two parents,

192
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:33,653
They're hiking in Algonquin,

193
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,993
No one can get a signal,

194
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:40,968
Maybe the police could put you
in touch with someone to talk to,

195
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,869
- Someone qualified,
- About what?

196
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:47,340
- About what's happened,
- OK,

197
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,106
I just came to explain,,,

198
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:55,274
I don't handle
this sort of thing well at all,

199
00:21:57,486 --> 00:22:00,011
Oh! Give me your clothes,

200
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,148
I'm sorry?

201
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:04,215
Take off your clothes,

202
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,226
Give them to me,
I'll give them back,

203
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,593
I,,,

204
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:12,395
I don't want the wet
contaminating my carpet,

205
00:22:13,436 --> 00:22:16,837
Take off your clothes,
I'm getting you dry ones,

206
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,346
By the way, that's my third favorite sweater
so you can't keep it,

207
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:38,126
Don't look at me,
I'm doing my checking,

208
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:43,530
I check the kitchen every time I use it
and every time I don't use it,

209
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,829
That must take up a lot of time,

210
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:48,267
Yes, it does,

211
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:49,804
(dog barks)

212
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:53,670
That's Marilyn, Vivienne's dog,

213
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:56,506
I can't stand her,

214
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,254
So, did Vivienne live here with you
all the time?

215
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:11,316
Yes, Vivienne came on a short stay
three years ago and didn't leave,

216
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:15,161
She lived with my parents until then,

217
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:17,995
That's who she was visiting,

218
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,058
Why was she hitchhiking?

219
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:22,626
Vivienne wanted to be a writer,

220
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:26,732
She said she would always
try and get a ride

221
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,869
with the most lonely looking characters

222
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:34,041
because they had the best stories,

223
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:43,182
Mrs, Freeman,

224
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,060
this is all a bit difficult for me,

225
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:54,166
I came here to apologize
because your daughter died

226
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,900
and it was my car,

227
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:03,509
Did you do it on purpose?

228
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:07,640
- Of course not, We just stopped at the,,,
- Sit down, then,

229
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:12,710
And I'm not a missus, I'm Linda,
I haven't got a problem with you,

230
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:18,784
You must be all right - you gave Vivienne
a lift and you brought me my sparklies,

231
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,727
(sobs)

232
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,814
Is there a problem with the tea?

233
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,515
No, No, it's not the tea,

234
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:50,258
Are you sad
because someone you didn't know died?

235
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,351
This is guilt, Linda,

236
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:54,794
I feel guilty, OK?

237
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:58,424
Right, because you were driving,

238
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:02,901
- Yes, because I was driving,
- But he ran into you,

239
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,907
Yes, he ran into me,

240
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,502
- Right,
- (doorbell)

241
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,410
(woman) Linda,

242
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,411
What is she doing here again?

243
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,420
She's already been once today,
I'm not letting her in,

244
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:21,956
- (knock at door)
- (woman) Linda,

245
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:25,983
Go away, Florence,
Nobody wants you here, Get lost,

246
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:30,259
- Linda,,,
- Whatever it is, I don't need it, Go away,

247
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:33,130
Alex, tell her to go away,

248
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:35,102
Tell her,

249
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,066
Oh,

250
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:43,475
- Hello,
- Hello,

251
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,809
I think Linda
needs someone to stay with her,

252
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:50,978
- No, I don't, You're stupid,
- It's all right, Linda, I'm only here to help,

253
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:54,318
Whatever it is, I don't need it,
Leave me alone,

254
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,349
I really don't think
she wants to talk about it any more tonight,

255
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:01,191
And you are,,,?

256
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,599
- Alex Hughes,
- Goodbye, Florence,

257
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,225
Oh,,,

258
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,165
Are you staying?

259
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,868
- No, No, I,,,
- Yes, he's staying,

260
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:19,380
Alex Hughes is staying, and if you
come back, I'm calling the police,

261
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,078
OK, You have my number,

262
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,246
Linda, I can't stay,

263
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:31,192
- You'll have to give my sweater back then,
- I should call a taxi,

264
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,559
They won't pick up from this house,
not after last time,

265
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,190
- Well, what about a bus?
- It's too late,

266
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,992
- Is there a hotel?
- Yes,

267
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,764
- Where is it?
- It's four miles up the highway,

268
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:52,875
- I should get my clothes,
- They haven't finished their cycle,

269
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:55,246
Do you want tea?

270
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:56,614
No,

271
00:26:56,685 --> 00:27:01,281
Would you like to go out and play?
I have a trampoline,

272
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:08,658
- I'll just get my things,
- I think you should stay until Tuesday,

273
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:12,091
- I'm sorry,
- They collect garbage on Tuesday,

274
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:16,536
- I don't do garbage,
- Linda, I appreciate the offer, but I,,,

275
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:22,475
It was Vivienne's job, I can't touch garbage,
so you'll have to take the bags out now,

276
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:27,938
- Do you want food?
- Linda, I'm sorry, but I can't do this,

277
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:30,746
I'll just get my clothes
and then I have to leave,

278
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:33,219
Well, you can't,,,
Don't go in my kitchen!

279
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:35,688
(screams)

280
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:38,625
I'll get your stupid clothes!

281
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:49,453
(sighs)

282
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:58,405
- Now what are you doing?
- Fuck! I didn't know this was your room,

283
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,941
Where are you going?
Stay still,

284
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,170
I saw the bunk beds
and I thought,,,

285
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:07,614
Vivienne says I'm probably the only adult
in the entire world who has a bunk bed,

286
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:11,585
I've tried other beds, I don't like them,
I've slept in this since I was three,

287
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:14,679
- I'll find somewhere else,
- No, no, Get back under here,

288
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:20,524
I need to know where you are, I don't
want you pounding around my house,

289
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,996
Do you snore?

290
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,697
I don't know,

291
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:29,294
Well, lie down and go to sleep,
I need my rest,

292
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:32,898
And if you try and touch me, I'll shoot you,
I have a gun,

293
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:52,751
Can you see the stars?

294
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:57,026
[Music] The stars at night are shining bright

295
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,091
[music] Deep in the heart of Wawa

296
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:05,406
Linda, I hope you don't mind,
I ate a cracker,

297
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:07,942
You what?
You went in my kitchen?

298
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,773
Yes,

299
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:12,075
I'm sorry,
I was a bit hungry,

300
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:14,138
I don't care,

301
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:18,016
I cleaned up afterwards,

302
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:51,282
(phone rings)

303
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:57,118
(phone continues to ring)

304
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:04,492
(answering machine beeps)

305
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,727
(Vivienne) Hi, this is the madhouse.

306
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:10,067
Leave us a message
and we’ll probably get back to you.

307
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:13,835
- Please speak slowly and be precise.
- (beep)

308
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:20,178
Linda,

309
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,307
The phone,

310
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:31,148
Linda?

311
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:35,359
Are you all right?

312
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,758
I'm fine, If you get your mouth
completely full of snow,

313
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:45,295
it all dissolves
and you can drink it,

314
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:49,206
Um, it's your p,,,
Aren't you cold?

315
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:53,145
I have an unusual
body-temperature control,

316
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,240
It feels just right,

317
00:31:56,318 --> 00:32:00,414
- Have you ever had an orgasm, Alex?
- It has been known,

318
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:03,652
Vivienne once described
an orgasm to me,

319
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:09,721
It sounds like an inferior version of
what I feel when I have a mouthful of snow,

320
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,292
You should try it,

321
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:30,551
Hi,

322
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:37,053
I heard about Vivienne,
I'm so sorry, I really liked her,

323
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,722
- Is she all right?
- (gurgles)

324
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:47,062
I don't know,

325
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:50,696
- What exactly is it?
- Autism,

326
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:53,070
But she's very verbal,

327
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:56,978
I had noticed,

328
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:59,775
Are you all right?

329
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:02,513
I don't know,

330
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:07,487
I'm Maggie, And everybody's
been saying that it wasn't your fault,

331
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:10,081
- Alex,
- I know,

332
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,388
It's a very small town,

333
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,022
So has anyone
been feeding that dog?

334
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:18,293
(Alex) In a manner of speaking,

335
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:22,132
Well, if she needs anything,
I'm right here,

336
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:25,002
Not that she'll talk to me,

337
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:26,938
Bye,

338
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,635
(Linda) Alex,

339
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,646
- Alex, we have to make a snowman,
- Do we?

340
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:37,117
Vivienne came to visit me every year, We
always made a crazy-creature snowman,

341
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:40,052
We kept on doing it,
We haven't made one this year,

342
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:42,647
Linda, there's a message
from your parents,

343
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,022
Let's make a chipmunk,

344
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,428
We never made a chipmunk,
I love chipmunks,

345
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:53,663
From now on,
every time I miss Vivienne,

346
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:57,603
I'm going to make
a crazy-creature snowman,

347
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:04,835
(answering machine beeps)

348
00:34:06,314 --> 00:34:09,340
(woman) Oh, hi, folks.
It's only Mom and Dad.

349
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:13,285
- Just ringing to let you know we’re fine.
- (man) Hello.

350
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:17,348
(woman) Your dad got an icicle
embedded in his privates yesterday.

351
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:21,225
- (man) Don't ask.
- But apart from that, we’re A-OK.

352
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:24,788
We hope everything's fine with you
and that Vivvy got back all right.

353
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:29,166
We'll ring you again when we get to the
next pit stop. We're miles from anywhere.

354
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:33,401
- (man) Come on. It's just a message.
- Sorry. OK, keep warm. Love you both.

355
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:35,909
Bye. Bye.

356
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:40,076
You should really try to get hold of them,
They'd want to be here,

357
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,549
I have to go identify
Vivienne's body today,

358
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:47,315
and tomorrow is work
and Tuesday they collect the garbage,

359
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,449
- Work?
- I work part-time at the valu-mart,

360
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:53,392
I stack shelves,
Will you come with me?

361
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:56,289
I don't think they'll expect you at work,

362
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:59,094
No, to see Vivienne's body,
Will you come with me?

363
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,762
I have to work or I won't get paid,

364
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,768
Well, uh,,,

365
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:11,801
If you want me to, I have to go into the
police station anyway to pick up my stuff,

366
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,577
- Then I should be on my way,
- I don't know why I have to go,

367
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,676
Everyone knows it's her,

368
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:22,211
- It's just procedure,
- I've seen it on TV,

369
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,557
They always let two people in the room
with them, Will you come in with me?

370
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,158
Yes,

371
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:36,170
If you want me to,

372
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:50,144
- Do people like you, Alex?
- Not much, no,

373
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:54,746
I'm not surprised, It's because
those glasses don't look right on your face,

374
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:58,759
You have a long face
and those glasses make you look shifty,

375
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,761
- Really?
- Yes,

376
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:04,925
- You need some new frames,
- I think it will take more than that,

377
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,131
I know how you neurotypical people
are obsessed with having friends,

378
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,196
I'm only trying to help you get some,

379
00:36:12,274 --> 00:36:17,576
Well, I appreciate your efforts, but
in my experience, friends can be overrated,

380
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,919
There,

381
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,652
Now you look almost nice,

382
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,554
(man) Mrs, Freeman,
is this your daughter?

383
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:09,461
- Miss Freeman,
- Sorry,

384
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,522
Miss Freeman,

385
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:15,626
Miss Freeman,
is this your daughter?

386
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,381
Linda, is this Vivienne?

387
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:35,151
She looks different,

388
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,691
I'm sorry, Linda,

389
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:42,423
I need verbal identification,
Is this Vivienne Freeman?

390
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:51,036
Yes, Yes, it is,

391
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:11,588
Come on,
Let's get you home,

392
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:14,628
Don't talk to me now
until I say so,

393
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:15,754
OK,

394
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:05,336
Linda!

395
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:08,814
Linda, oh, I was so sorry
to hear about Marianne,

396
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,579
- Vivienne,
- Vivienne?

397
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:15,316
Vivienne!
Oh, she was such a personality,

398
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:17,882
Diane,

399
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:23,591
Diane Wooton, Why I keep that name,
I'll never know, Been divorced two years,

400
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:26,099
Alex, Alex Hughes,

401
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,568
Oh! Now I know you're not a native,

402
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:32,128
not with that delectable accent,

403
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:34,368
No,

404
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:38,970
Linda, if there's anything I can do for you,
anything at all,,,

405
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:41,709
- Like what?
- Well, like,,,

406
00:39:41,783 --> 00:39:43,717
like anything,

407
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:47,778
Oh, it must be so awful
losing a child like that,

408
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:51,587
- I didn't lose her, She's dead,
- Linda,

409
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,253
- What?
- It's all right, I know all about autism,

410
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:56,695
I've seen that film,

411
00:39:57,332 --> 00:40:01,666
OK, well, you take care of yourself, Linda,
I'll be keeping my eye on you,

412
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:05,228
Nice meeting you, Alex,
Sure it won't be the last time,

413
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:11,300
(Alex) Have you made up your mind
about the funeral, Linda?

414
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:15,645
You have to decide what to do -
the service, the flowers, the people,

415
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:18,743
- It's not a wedding,
- No, but it takes a lot of sorting out,

416
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,221
It's important to get it right,

417
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:30,796
If we have the funeral on Monday,
would you stay until Tuesday?

418
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:33,299
- To put the bins out?
- The garbage cans, yes,

419
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:35,598
I don't do garbage,

420
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:42,242
OK, here's what I'll do,
I'll stay and help organize the funeral,

421
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,074
- And then you'll,,,
- Then I'll put the garbage out,

422
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:47,376
- On Tuesday,
- Yes,

423
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:51,214
- Perfectamundo!
- But then I have to go,

424
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:58,721
You'd better tell me about
what you think Vivienne would want,

425
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:03,230
I know what Vivienne would want,
She'd want to be alive,

426
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,964
What was she pestering you about?

427
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:15,101
- Who?
- This morning,

428
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:18,441
That Maggie from next door,

429
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:23,547
I think she just wanted
to pay her respects,

430
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:29,056
She's a prostitute, Alex,
I don't think she has much respect to give,

431
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:42,264
"I don't remember when
I noticed my eyebrows,

432
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:45,795
"but I know
that's when it all started,"

433
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,285
"What is the moment worth?"

434
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:09,563
"The past is only a memory,

435
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:12,429
"the future, a fantasy,

436
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,230
"It's only in the present

437
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:18,101
"that we truly live,"

438
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,910
OK, Vivienne,

439
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:34,321
(Maggie) See you later,
Have a good one,

440
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:42,119
(Alex) Hello, again,

441
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,096
(Maggie) Hello,

442
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:49,068
I just came round - it's a bit of a cliché
really - to borrow some tea, Normal tea,

443
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:52,573
- That would be to drink with the fruitcake,
- She's not mad,

444
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,268
No, I know,
Vivienne explained it all to me,

445
00:42:55,343 --> 00:43:00,337
High functioning, can talk a glass eye
to sleep, but can't tie her shoelaces,

446
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:04,909
- Don't you like her?
- She doesn't like me, for some reason,

447
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,048
- So did you really come around for tea?
- Have you got any?

448
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:22,696
- Assam, Darjeeling,
- There is a god,

449
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,163
No, there is FedEx,

450
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,902
An English friend of mine
sends it over,

451
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:32,742
Don't go inventing a deity
to thank for the small miracles,

452
00:43:32,814 --> 00:43:35,749
- They just happen,
- So you're a nonbeliever,

453
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:40,379
I am, which makes me
a bit of a novelty around here,

454
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:42,685
Then again, so is Linda,

455
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:46,591
It's a judgmental town, this,
The emphasis being on the "mental,"

456
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:50,153
- (Alex) I assume you're new to the area,
- Oh, no, No,

457
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,529
I've lived here for 12 years,

458
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:59,264
So how are you holding up?

459
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,968
I keep seeing her face,

460
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:07,704
She was singing,

461
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:14,918
She had all this energy,
and I walked away without a scratch,

462
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:22,454
- Are you planning on staying here a while?
- Apparently, Till after the funeral,

463
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,828
That's very sweet of you,

464
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,328
Listen, I,,,

465
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,269
I don't know what kind of plans
you have with my neighbor,

466
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,538
but I'm free tonight
and, I don't know, I could cook something,

467
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:38,943
We could have dinner, maybe?

468
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,780
Thank you,

469
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:49,452
([music] "Just Looking" by Stereophonics)

470
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:58,429
(sings along)

471
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,153
What are you listening to?

472
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:26,217
Just trying to find something for Vivienne,
Stereophonics, They're not bad,

473
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:32,426
I prefer tinnitus,

474
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:44,309
Linda, can I ask, if you don't like people,
how did you manage with Vivienne?

475
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:47,472
I don't like normal people,
I like useful people,

476
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:51,245
and people who like doing
the things I like doing,

477
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:55,153
Vivienne was very helpful to me,
We had a lot of fun,

478
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:59,254
I know how you must be feeling,
I had a son,,,

479
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:03,093
You don't know how I'm feeling
because you're not me,

480
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:06,395
- ,,, who died,
- Nobody knows how I'm feeling

481
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:11,063
because half the time,
I don't have a clue,

482
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:14,574
Well, I know how that feels, too,
When I found out about,,,

483
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:18,305
You want to go out
and play on the trampoline?

484
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,574
No,

485
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,416
- No, thank you,
- We could make a snowman,

486
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:33,417
I was gonna tell you about my son, but now
I think I'll just sit here, if it's OK with you,

487
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,270
Did your son like the snow?

488
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:49,072
No,

489
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:55,142
Nope, that was one of the few things
he didn't like,

490
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,014
Oh,

491
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:05,525
Did you know
that no two snowflakes are alike?

492
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:09,723
Wilson Bentley
photographed 2,354 snowflakes,

493
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:15,963
His best snowstorm was on his birthday,
on February 14, 1928, when he was 63,

494
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:19,336
He called it a gift
from "kind winter,"

495
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,837
Is it OK if I take the dog out in a bit?

496
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:32,719
Don't let her pee on my snow,

497
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,078
Hi,

498
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:00,871
Hi,

499
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:04,106
Right on time,

500
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:07,814
I didn't know, uh,,,
I'm sure this isn't the norm, but, uh,,,

501
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:10,755
I brought you some tea bags,

502
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:12,554
Ginseng and fennel,

503
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:16,528
I find the norm usually involves chocolate
or, if I'm really lucky, perfume,

504
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:19,225
but ginseng and fennel, wow,

505
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,325
Come in,

506
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:25,002
And the dog comes too,

507
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,137
So, Mr, Snowdrifter,
what's your story?

508
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:33,273
Me? Oh,
there's nothing much to say, really,

509
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:37,875
Come on, I can tell by looking at your face
that you have some interesting baggage,

510
00:48:37,952 --> 00:48:40,648
I don't have baggage,
I have haulage,

511
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:43,519
See? I told you,
You just look so,,,

512
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:46,526
- Shifty?
- Mm-mmm,

513
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,018
Sad,

514
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:58,160
I hope you like shrimp cocktail, It's what
I normally serve my gentlemen callers,

515
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:03,506
I'm afraid it's not very original,
but,,, I really hate to cook,

516
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:07,172
After Linda's specialized diet,
believe me, I'd eat grit,

517
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,244
Everything's gluten free,

518
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,912
She has leaky gut syndrome,

519
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:17,516
as well as a ringing in her ears,

520
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,456
Wow,

521
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,029
- So, what about you?
- What? Disease wise?

522
00:49:24,098 --> 00:49:25,793
No,

523
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:28,928
You, generally,

524
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:31,403
Oh, me,

525
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:35,465
No, I like to, uh,,,
I like to keep an air of mystery about me,

526
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:39,243
At least on the,,,

527
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,440
first date,

528
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:44,877
- Really?
- Mm-hm,

529
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:19,785
So,

530
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:22,687
how long are you planning on staying?

531
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,518
You are very beautiful,

532
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,855
I'm leaving after the funeral,

533
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,503
I like you,

534
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,039
I really like you,

535
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:48,506
I hate having sex on a full stomach so shall
we skip the main course and go next door?

536
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,542
Oh, shit, I forgot about
the English-reserve thing, OK,

537
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,646
I'm sorry,
I've embarrassed you, Let's just eat,

538
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:58,248
No, No, it's fine,

539
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,529
If I'm honest,
it's what I came round for,

540
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:06,630
Well, good,
I'm glad we cleared that up,

541
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:47,004
It's been a while,

542
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:51,244
Sorry if it was a bit quick,

543
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:56,045
- I think the dog might've put me off,
- (chuckles)

544
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:59,375
It's OK,

545
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:02,953
We have all night,

546
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,824
So why are you going to Winnipeg?

547
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,097
You ask a lot of questions,

548
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,162
Do I?

549
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:25,938
I'm going to meet an old friend,

550
00:52:26,947 --> 00:52:28,778
Hm,

551
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:36,549
A friend friend or a friend friend?

552
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,620
I should go,

553
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:47,091
I won't mention her again,
I promise,

554
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:55,303
Why didn't you just fly straight there
like a normal person?

555
00:52:55,376 --> 00:53:01,372
Well, I thought I'd drive, take in some of
the lakes, It didn't look far on the map,

556
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:13,186
Would you even consider
driving from London to Moscow?

557
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:17,796
Well, actually,
I was looking on a globe,

558
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:20,333
The scale was a bit off,

559
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:34,372
(whispers) I think you're ready to try again,

560
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:18,549
(murmurs)

561
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,616
I should go,

562
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:24,363
Um,,,

563
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:28,824
I haven't done
this kind of thing before,

564
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:32,360
I'm sorry,
How much do I owe you?

565
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,175
What?

566
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:40,140
For last night,
What do I,,,?

567
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,251
You want to pay me?

568
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:48,186
Well, I thought,,,

569
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:52,585
Oh, God!
You're not, are you?

570
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:59,059
- It's just that Linda,,,
- I have a few male callers now and again,

571
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,897
And, yes, I like sex,

572
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,630
but,,,

573
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:07,631
- No, I am not a hooker,
- Oh, shit!

574
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,871
I feel dreadful,

575
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:13,879
Oh, it's OK, It's OK,

576
00:55:18,886 --> 00:55:21,150
I have to say,
I'm more than relieved,

577
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:24,657
What? You're not a big fan
of ladies of the night?

578
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:32,291
I don't think I'd have enough money
to see you as much as I want to,

579
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,230
(Maggie laughs)

580
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,733
Oh, my God!

581
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:56,582
I booked the cars for 12 o'clock,
Is that all right?

582
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:58,716
I'm going to work,

583
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:02,760
What do you think?

584
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,661
OK,

585
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:08,267
(Linda wails and dog barks)

586
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:13,171
What's the matter, Linda?
What is it?

587
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,973
- It's on the rug, It's disgusting!
- It's OK, Linda, Just calm,,,

588
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:22,379
It's dog throw-up!
From inside the dog's stomach,

589
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,646
- It will make an unbelievably bad stain,
- Linda, it's OK,

590
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:30,179
It's not OK, It's not OK,
I can't do this, I can't do this!

591
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:32,418
I need Vivienne!
I need Vivienne!

592
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:35,394
Well, uh,,, I'll sort it,

593
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:38,363
Please,
please don't let it leave a stain,

594
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:42,698
- If it leaves a stain, I have to move,
- Linda,

595
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:45,704
I said, I'll sort it,

596
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:48,570
Oh, please don't let it leave a stain!

597
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,670
And don't go in my kitchen!

598
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:59,008
(Linda sobs)

599
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,030
(water spills)

600
00:58:32,112 --> 00:58:34,945
- Oh, Alex,
- Oh, Hello,

601
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,176
- Nice to see you,
- Nice to see you,

602
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:46,989
What's she been eating?

603
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,393
- I don't know, Linda gives her bananas,
- Bananas?

604
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:52,591
She's not a monkey,

605
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:59,000
- I don't know much about dogs,
- You know about dog vomit, right?

606
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:00,664
Yeah,

607
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:05,838
Keep her off the bananas, I've heard
you can get this stuff in cans - dog food,

608
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:09,040
- Controversial, I know,
- Yeah,

609
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:20,458
Actually,
this isn't a social call today,

610
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:22,461
Really?

611
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,661
I just came to warn you
about Alex Hughes,

612
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:30,499
Several little birds have told me
you and he are getting social,

613
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,131
I don't think that's any of your business,
Clyde, Or anyone else's,

614
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:38,507
This town is getting so you can't cough
without someone alerting the authorities,

615
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:42,912
Yeah,
I looked him up on our system,

616
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:47,046
He killed someone,

617
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:52,492
- Did you know?
- No, He was driving, but it wasn't his fault,

618
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,823
I'm not talking about Vivienne,

619
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,886
He killed a guy,

620
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:59,090
He just got out,

621
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:07,168
- I didn't know that,
- I thought you should,

622
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,003
Now I do,

623
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:14,509
And,,,

624
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:17,709
to top it all, he hit a cop,

625
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,854
Just ask yourself this, Maggie,
Is that normal? Eh?

626
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:28,918
Picking up young girls,

627
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:33,694
staying with a mentally challenged lady,
killing people,

628
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:36,099
Hitting cops,

629
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:43,905
Well,

630
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,473
Oh, uh,,,

631
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:54,543
I have a spare ticket for a magician
up at the Legion on Wednesday,

632
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:57,021
if you're interested,

633
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,423
What's he gonna do, Clyde?
Make you disappear?

634
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,930
- (Linda) "B-a-a-n-g,"
- (Alex) You can't have two "a's" in "bang,"

635
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:15,270
(Linda) In comic-book-word Scrabble, you
can, You can have three as if you want,

636
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:20,245
With a double-letter score,
that makes 22 points,

637
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:22,440
- This game is ridiculous,
- It isn't,

638
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:25,713
It isn't, You get to say words
like "kerrang" and "boing"

639
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:29,984
- and "cowabunga" and "buttocks,"
- What comic book did that come out of?

640
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:33,423
I don't know, I just like
saying "buttocks," Buttocks,

641
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:35,654
OK, What's your word?

642
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:40,431
- I can make it up, right?
- Yes, That's the best bit,

643
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:45,598
OK, "Y-a-a,,,

644
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:49,939
"m-o-o-I,"

645
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,672
That's four, five, six,,,

646
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:55,772
That's 24 points,

647
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,044
"Yaamoo!,"

648
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:01,417
"Yaamoo!,"
I like that, "Yaamoo!,"

649
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:04,286
OK, now you have to
give an example of it in a sentence,

650
01:02:04,357 --> 01:02:08,384
Like I said, if you make up a word,
you have to give an example,

651
01:02:08,461 --> 01:02:10,588
All right, Um,,,

652
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:15,263
- Spider-Man,,,
- Spider-Man?

653
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:19,294
- What's wrong with Spider-Man?
- Well, it's a bit obvious,

654
01:02:19,372 --> 01:02:22,364
Oh, all right, Spider-Man,

655
01:02:23,276 --> 01:02:25,836
Spider-Man,,,

656
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:30,178
is about to save the universe,,,

657
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,185
from an evil,,, thing,

658
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:37,620
So he hits him with a jet of web,
Yaamoo!,

659
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:40,159
And it stops him -

660
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,821
it - in its tracks,

661
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:48,163
- You are terrible at this game,
- I've got two more points than you,

662
01:02:53,506 --> 01:02:56,873
"D-a-zed,,,

663
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:03,077
"l-i-o-u-s, Dazlious,"

664
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:06,050
- I'm assuming that's a made-up word,
- It is,

665
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:10,681
It's also 38 points for the word

666
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:14,557
and another 50
for using up all my letters,

667
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:20,292
- That makes 88 points,
- And your example?

668
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:29,101
Mister Fantastic
from the Fantastic Four,,,

669
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:35,114
He's got arms made of elastic so they
can stretch for 200, maybe 300 miles,

670
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:38,480
He's been imprisoned in a cave
for seven days

671
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:41,987
with no food
and no water and no light,

672
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:45,513
And on the eighth day,
he manages to loosen a rock

673
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:48,117
and push his way up through the top,,,

674
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:50,185
With his stretchy arms,

675
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:55,098
,,, and up into the daylight, just as the sun
is coming up over the mountains

676
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:59,161
and filling the sky
with this white-yellow light,

677
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,673
And there's a stillness,

678
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:07,543
and in the few minutes he's got before
his captor, the evil Doctor Doom, returns,

679
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:09,878
he stops for one second

680
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:14,512
and all he can hear
is his own breathing,

681
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:18,353
And he's totally overwhelmed
by how big the world is

682
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:21,986
and how small
and unimportant he is,

683
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:24,121
And as he turns around,

684
01:04:24,197 --> 01:04:27,462
we see his face look to the sky,

685
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:29,798
And he says, very quietly,

686
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:32,633
so that no one can hear him,

687
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,300
he says,

688
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,639
"Dazlious,"

689
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,285
I'm gonna make some tea,

690
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:56,853
If I'm going to have any chance of winning
this game, I'm going to really need to focus,

691
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:03,725
You know where to find me,

692
01:05:14,848 --> 01:05:18,614
- (Maggie) I've had a bit of a shady past,
- (Alex) Oh, really?

693
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:22,018
(Maggie) I was married for 15 years,

694
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:24,283
Arrest this woman now,

695
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:28,021
He was a very nice man,

696
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:34,057
But I had affairs,
I like the candies and the flowers -

697
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:37,001
the tea-bags bit,

698
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:41,404
I'm just not good
at the day-to-day stuff, you know?

699
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:45,102
I'm a selfish woman,

700
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,512
and I broke his heart,

701
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:51,916
Made a real mess of it, actually,

702
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:58,188
So, someone said
you can drink this water,

703
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:03,294
Yeah, it's supposed to have healing
properties, Why don't you take a sip?

704
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:06,332
- I don't think so,
- What? You don't want to be healed?

705
01:06:06,399 --> 01:06:08,594
Set free of your demons,

706
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:11,535
- They keep me company,
- (dog barks)

707
01:06:11,604 --> 01:06:15,506
- I think we should be getting Marilyn back,
- You know, Alex,,,

708
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:21,343
I think maybe your dog's been getting
a little too much exercise lately,

709
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:25,373
Perhaps you could try
walking it at home,

710
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:28,353
in the privacy
of your own bathroom,

711
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:35,452
What exactly is it
that you want to know?

712
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:37,959
Everything,

713
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:47,706
(Alex) That's Ryan, my son,

714
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:51,967
(Maggie) What?
You said you didn't have any kids,

715
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:56,513
I got a letter from Ryan,

716
01:06:56,583 --> 01:07:01,418
His mum had allowed him to see his birth
certificate and I was on it, under "Father,"

717
01:07:01,488 --> 01:07:04,082
And are you his real dad?

718
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:07,222
Yes,

719
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:13,528
His mum's name's Rebecca, She's the
woman that I'm going to see in Winnipeg,

720
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:20,130
We had a short fling, I suppose she
thought I was never that serious, so she,,,

721
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:22,674
It was 22 years ago,

722
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:26,167
What did he say to you?

723
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:32,014
He wrote me a list of all the things he liked
and all the things he hated,

724
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:34,144
I mean, when you saw him,

725
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:40,757
We arranged to meet in a restaurant,

726
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:46,662
I sat in the restaurant
until closing time and,,,

727
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,135
he never showed up,

728
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:56,342
He was in an accident
on the way to meet me,

729
01:07:57,343 --> 01:08:00,710
Got hit by a drunk driver,
and he died instantly,

730
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,114
Oh, my God!
That is terrible,

731
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:07,517
I never even met him,

732
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:10,579
- So all I lost really was a fantasy,
- Oh, my God!

733
01:08:10,657 --> 01:08:13,319
A fucking fantasy,

734
01:08:15,962 --> 01:08:19,125
I spent the last four years
grieving over someone I never knew,

735
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:23,135
and now I'm doing it all over again
with Vivienne,

736
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:37,579
Come here, Come here,

737
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:48,058
(radio) Good morning. I'm Martin Scott
and I'm here every morning with you,

738
01:08:48,127 --> 01:08:52,655
and we’ll be up all night, too,
with the Wawwa Rotary Club...

739
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:09,305
(boy) No, not those, dude,
Those are serial killer,

740
01:09:18,057 --> 01:09:20,651
Getting warmer,

741
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:22,854
Oh, you know what, though?

742
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:26,931
Yeah, I think these
are the guys for you,

743
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,069
Oh, yeah,
Am I good or what?

744
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,134
Actually, I think I'll just stick to my old ones,
I was just browsing, really,

745
01:09:39,212 --> 01:09:41,840
Eyebrowsing,

746
01:09:43,249 --> 01:09:45,809
- Right?
- Uh,,,

747
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:49,920
- Thanks for your time,
- It's cool,

748
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:55,752
- I love that accent, by the way,
- Thank you,

749
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:04,626
(knocking at door)

750
01:10:07,974 --> 01:10:10,499
I,,, I came to talk to Linda,

751
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:13,036
She won't open the door,

752
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:17,277
I wanted to say sorry,

753
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:23,116
So did I, and I'm still here,

754
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:28,994
Mind you, I wasn't the one
ramming a 40-ton truck into her daughter,

755
01:10:29,996 --> 01:10:32,328
Look, man,

756
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:34,832
I'm not a killer,
It was an accident,

757
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:37,870
- I lost my job,,,
- My heart bleeds,

758
01:10:40,206 --> 01:10:43,767
What? Haven't you ever
made a fucking mistake?

759
01:10:43,843 --> 01:10:46,641
- I think you should go,
- I can't go, Not until I've,,,

760
01:10:46,713 --> 01:10:48,704
Until you've what?

761
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:55,709
You lost your job? She lost her daughter,
And not just any daughter,

762
01:10:55,788 --> 01:11:00,316
the one who helped her
to make some sense of all this shit,

763
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:09,391
You bought flowers,
you thick bastard?

764
01:11:16,242 --> 01:11:18,733
Come on, then,

765
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:23,043
- Just get out of here,
- Look, come on, then,

766
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:26,210
Let me have it,
Let me have it! Come on! Come on!

767
01:11:27,153 --> 01:11:29,553
Just don't push me,

768
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:32,147
What's the matter?
Can't finish the job? Come on!

769
01:11:32,225 --> 01:11:38,289
Don't you know you can't hurt me?
Don't you know I'm fucking indestructible?

770
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:48,867
(sobs)

771
01:12:34,387 --> 01:12:36,787
(Linda giggles)

772
01:12:53,139 --> 01:12:55,403
What are you doing?

773
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:57,909
What does it look like I'm doing?

774
01:12:57,977 --> 01:13:00,969
- I'm trampolining,
- Linda,

775
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:06,109
Could you stop bouncing
for a minute?

776
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:12,256
I want to tell you about
what happened with my son,

777
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:14,452
I went to prison,

778
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:17,519
- I went to prison because,,,
- I want you to bounce me up,

779
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,428
Not now, Linda,

780
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:23,731
Is it because
you had a fight with the truck driver?

781
01:13:27,373 --> 01:13:29,068
Yes,

782
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,135
I won't see Vivienne again,

783
01:13:32,211 --> 01:13:34,475
you won't see Vivienne again

784
01:13:34,547 --> 01:13:36,981
and he won't see Vivienne again,

785
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:39,813
We all have to get over it,

786
01:13:40,853 --> 01:13:44,414
OK, Now, bounce me up,

787
01:13:45,157 --> 01:13:48,092
I'm not moving
until you play with me,

788
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,492
I'm gonna stay out here
all night long,

789
01:13:50,563 --> 01:13:55,159
Please, Please, Alex,
Please, please, please, bounce me,

790
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:02,767
Promise to let everyone
come back tomorrow after the funeral,

791
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:06,471
Yippee! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

792
01:14:06,546 --> 01:14:09,481
Bounce, bounce, bounce,
bounce, bounce, bounce!

793
01:14:09,549 --> 01:14:12,416
(Linda laughs)

794
01:14:48,621 --> 01:14:50,953
You worried about tomorrow?

795
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:55,724
No, I think it's done,
I'm worried about Linda,

796
01:14:58,264 --> 01:15:03,201
Must be weird,
not wanting to be with other people,

797
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:08,832
not needing anyone to,
you know, plug into,

798
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:13,140
Don't worry on that account, She's got
quite enough going on in that head of hers,

799
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:17,706
She needs other people to do things
for her, if not necessarily with her,

800
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:20,411
Vivienne did the boring stuff,
What's she gonna do now?

801
01:15:20,486 --> 01:15:23,421
You offering?

802
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:25,821
Wouldn't get past the door,

803
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:39,802
- I'm beginning to like this,
- What's that?

804
01:15:39,872 --> 01:15:42,432
Being with you,

805
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,567
Being with Linda,

806
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:49,708
Being with myself, Again,

807
01:15:51,751 --> 01:15:56,484
Hey, and I'm having sex and these muffins
are great, That sort of thing,

808
01:15:56,555 --> 01:15:58,955
You be careful, Mr, Shifty,

809
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:34,290
(doorbell)

810
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,091
Sorry to call so early,
it's just, we had a collection,

811
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:43,727
We got a wreath for the church, but I also
wanted to bring something else I had done,

812
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:46,237
Oh, that's very kind,

813
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:48,466
- Is she in?
- Oh, yes,

814
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:50,566
Linda,

815
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:52,975
Linda!

816
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:57,442
I like your robe,

817
01:16:59,752 --> 01:17:02,016
Diane's brought you something,

818
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:12,963
- What is it?
- It's a bereavement cookie,

819
01:17:13,032 --> 01:17:15,432
- I can't eat that,
- Oh?

820
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,594
She's gluten free,

821
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,661
Oh!

822
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:21,900
Right,

823
01:17:21,974 --> 01:17:25,410
Well, waste not, want not,
I'll take it back,

824
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:29,574
It's my nephew's
fifth birthday tomorrow so,,,

825
01:17:29,648 --> 01:17:31,912
I'll scrape the icing off,

826
01:17:31,984 --> 01:17:34,612
put some new numbers on,

827
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:37,713
- A nice new number five,
- I'll scrape it,

828
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:44,920
(Marilyn barking)

829
01:17:54,106 --> 01:17:56,267
There,

830
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:05,014
Well,

831
01:18:05,084 --> 01:18:07,985
I'll see you both in church later,

832
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:10,452
(Alex) Um,,,

833
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:27,261
- Thanks, Diane,
- Bye,

834
01:18:44,623 --> 01:18:49,822
Despite both our faults, I actually think
we work quite well together, don't you?

835
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:53,763
Yes, I do,
Can you please take the dog out now?

836
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,393
I don't want to talk to you anymore,

837
01:19:00,339 --> 01:19:06,300
- Shall I come back in about half an hour?
- I don't know, I only know how I feel now,

838
01:19:16,922 --> 01:19:18,913
(woman sobs)

839
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:24,089
(muffled speech)

840
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:34,167
Hello,
You must be Alex,

841
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,231
I'm Dirk,

842
01:19:38,844 --> 01:19:41,506
And this is Ellen,

843
01:19:42,481 --> 01:19:44,540
How do you do?

844
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:47,882
I'm sorry,
I told myself I wasn't gonna cry,

845
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:52,856
Every time we go away, it's always Linda
we're worried about, isn't it, Dirk?

846
01:19:52,925 --> 01:19:57,862
We never even gave Vivienne
a second thought, We ne,,, we never,,,

847
01:19:59,431 --> 01:20:01,558
Ellen's a bit upset,

848
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:06,037
We've been hiking,
We came straight here, Is Linda inside?

849
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:08,266
I'm half inside, half outside,

850
01:20:17,082 --> 01:20:19,312
Hi, sweetie,

851
01:20:19,385 --> 01:20:21,216
Hi,

852
01:20:21,287 --> 01:20:24,222
We've just been meeting Alex, Linda,

853
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:28,753
Your eyes are red,

854
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:31,295
Yes, they are,

855
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:40,327
- Mommy, cheek,
- Yeah, That's my girl, That's my,,,

856
01:20:42,574 --> 01:20:45,668
- I'll let you have some time,
- Yes,

857
01:20:45,744 --> 01:20:47,803
Thank you, Alex,

858
01:21:29,922 --> 01:21:35,019
I thought Vivienne would appreciate
something a bit unconventional,

859
01:21:35,094 --> 01:21:37,688
Perfectamundo,

860
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:42,266
Is it compulsory to cry at funerals?

861
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:47,631
No, It's not compulsory,

862
01:21:47,706 --> 01:21:51,039
Good, because I don't know
if I will or not,

863
01:21:57,249 --> 01:22:00,844
Wilson Bentley,
the man who photographed snowflakes,

864
01:22:00,919 --> 01:22:04,047
died after walking in a snowstorm,

865
01:22:09,962 --> 01:22:12,453
Is there anything you need?

866
01:22:15,701 --> 01:22:17,532
Yes,

867
01:22:24,877 --> 01:22:29,746
I'd like you to put your arms around me
and squeeze me really hard,

868
01:22:29,815 --> 01:22:32,784
but don't touch me
with your hands,

869
01:22:50,736 --> 01:22:53,102
Say when,

870
01:22:53,172 --> 01:22:56,073
(Linda sighs)

871
01:23:04,716 --> 01:23:08,413
(organ plays "Just Looking"
by Stereophonics)

872
01:23:49,461 --> 01:23:51,952
(Ellen) Linda, Linda,

873
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,760
- Please sit down,
- Linda,

874
01:24:03,408 --> 01:24:05,239
(door shuts)

875
01:24:07,646 --> 01:24:09,045
(music stops)

876
01:24:50,022 --> 01:24:52,547
For those who don't know,

877
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:55,891
I'm Vivienne's granddad,

878
01:24:56,929 --> 01:25:00,160
But as our daughter Linda
was unable to look after her,

879
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:05,397
my wife Ellen and I
raised Vivienne as our own for 16 years,

880
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:12,143
Vivienne was a real one-off,

881
01:25:12,211 --> 01:25:17,979
and the most gentle
and generous person I've ever met,

882
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,143
She had an amazing ability -

883
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,519
accepting people for what they are,
embracing their differences,

884
01:25:25,591 --> 01:25:28,526
Most of you
are probably aware that, um,,,

885
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:32,960
Vivienne wanted to be a writer,

886
01:25:33,966 --> 01:25:37,265
On her last visit to us
only a week or so ago,

887
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:43,537
she gave me a children's picture book
that she was working on,

888
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,210
I'd like to read it to you

889
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:52,376
because it says more about Vivienne
than anything I could put into words,

890
01:25:57,556 --> 01:25:59,888
"My Little Brother,"

891
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,426
"My little brother James is special,

892
01:26:03,428 --> 01:26:07,626
"My little brother is four
and he can't talk yet,

893
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,991
"He doesn't always understand
what I say to him,

894
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:14,436
"and he's not a bit interested
in my wrestling toys,

895
01:26:14,506 --> 01:26:20,001
"Dad plays games with him and tries to
get him interested in rockets and football,

896
01:26:20,078 --> 01:26:23,980
"but my little brother
really only likes the alphabet,

897
01:26:24,049 --> 01:26:27,883
"He's very happy when we have
alphabet spaghetti for lunch,

898
01:26:27,953 --> 01:26:30,114
"but then, so am I,

899
01:26:38,397 --> 01:26:42,299
"Yesterday, he took my hands
and danced with me,

900
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:46,929
"Every time he does something new,
however small,

901
01:26:48,774 --> 01:26:51,470
"it's a brilliant feeling,

902
01:26:51,543 --> 01:26:55,479
"I wish everyone could get to know
someone like my little brother,

903
01:26:55,547 --> 01:26:59,313
"He makes you look at things
in a brand-new way,

904
01:27:00,986 --> 01:27:06,686
"Some people say that James won't ever
do the things I do, but it doesn't matter,

905
01:27:06,758 --> 01:27:09,158
"He'll just do different things,

906
01:27:11,563 --> 01:27:17,968
"I love my little brother so much and, one
day, I know he'll tell me he loves me too,

907
01:27:19,504 --> 01:27:24,806
"Although he'll probably
spell it out in spaghetti first,"

908
01:27:30,882 --> 01:27:33,578
Thank you, Dirk,

909
01:27:33,652 --> 01:27:37,986
Please stand while we take a moment to
listen to one of Vivienne's favorite records,

910
01:27:38,056 --> 01:27:40,820
by the, uh,,,
(clears throat)

911
01:27:40,892 --> 01:27:43,884
Super Furry Animals,

912
01:27:43,962 --> 01:27:46,863
([music] "Hello Sunshine"
by Super Furry Animals)

913
01:28:37,649 --> 01:28:39,640
(people chatter)

914
01:28:57,669 --> 01:28:59,159
(doorbell)

915
01:29:00,906 --> 01:29:03,875
Oh, hi,
Thank you so much,

916
01:29:03,942 --> 01:29:07,241
Please take your shoes off
before entering,

917
01:29:10,148 --> 01:29:12,139
Excuse me,

918
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:15,782
Why is that man still here?

919
01:29:15,854 --> 01:29:20,655
- Go on, Linda, hand these around,
- All these people doing social,

920
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:24,923
- It's OK, Linda,
- It's not OK, When are they gonna go?

921
01:29:24,996 --> 01:29:29,023
Well, they'll have a sandwich
and then they'll go,

922
01:29:39,544 --> 01:29:42,069
So what do you see in him, Maggie?

923
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:47,484
You know, Clyde,
you have a superior air about you,

924
01:29:47,552 --> 01:29:50,043
Whoever told you
you were so special?

925
01:29:50,121 --> 01:29:52,521
Whoever told you
you weren't?

926
01:29:57,229 --> 01:30:01,063
- It's surprisingly clean, eh?
- That's autism, They're neat freaks,

927
01:30:01,132 --> 01:30:04,124
Yeah? You should take notes,
You could learn something,

928
01:30:04,202 --> 01:30:07,399
- Why do you have to do that?
- What? It was a joke,

929
01:30:07,472 --> 01:30:09,997
Try one of these,
They're gluten free,

930
01:30:14,913 --> 01:30:20,351
You know, Alex is very fond of you,
He talks about you all the time,

931
01:30:21,353 --> 01:30:24,413
Maybe when he's gone,
I could come over and,,,

932
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:27,083
Why would I want you
to come over?

933
01:30:29,728 --> 01:30:32,697
They've had sandwiches,
Why are they hanging around?

934
01:30:33,732 --> 01:30:38,499
Oh, thank you so much for coming,
It's very nice of you,

935
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:47,571
(gasps)

936
01:31:16,274 --> 01:31:18,799
It's a funny place, this,

937
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:21,141
Never felt at home here,

938
01:31:23,648 --> 01:31:29,712
But Linda always liked it, We bought it
because she wanted to be independent,

939
01:31:29,788 --> 01:31:32,655
especially after Vivienne was born,

940
01:31:37,295 --> 01:31:40,093
How did that happen?

941
01:31:41,099 --> 01:31:42,760
Um,,,

942
01:31:43,935 --> 01:31:46,529
We still don't know,

943
01:31:46,605 --> 01:31:48,596
She was very close -

944
01:31:48,673 --> 01:31:53,133
well, relatively close -
to a boy who went to the center,

945
01:31:54,546 --> 01:31:57,310
We all assumed
it was an experiment,

946
01:31:57,382 --> 01:32:01,751
She didn't seem remotely upset at first,
but she might have been forced,

947
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,345
We asked and we asked,

948
01:32:05,357 --> 01:32:10,852
Anyhow, she was six months gone
before anyone noticed,

949
01:32:14,032 --> 01:32:16,296
It's like everything with Linda,

950
01:32:17,335 --> 01:32:19,929
You have to accept her totally,

951
01:32:21,072 --> 01:32:25,805
And somehow, Vivienne understood that
from very early on,

952
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:29,803
Oh, she would've loved the service,

953
01:32:29,881 --> 01:32:32,315
And this, too,
She loved a party,

954
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:36,684
I don't think there's ever been
more than five people in this house,

955
01:32:36,755 --> 01:32:39,588
I don't know
how you persuaded her,

956
01:32:40,592 --> 01:32:43,152
But, anyway,
I just wanted to say thanks,

957
01:32:43,228 --> 01:32:45,788
For staying,
You didn't have to,

958
01:32:45,864 --> 01:32:49,766
To be honest, the elements were
against me, I didn't have an alternative,

959
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:52,359
There's always an alternative, Alex,

960
01:32:54,939 --> 01:32:59,376
This house is getting
nasty, nasty, nasty!

961
01:33:01,212 --> 01:33:04,875
("Notteru Ondo" by The Drifters
plays very loudly)

962
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:07,076
It's all right, honey,

963
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:27,638
(Linda sings along to music)

964
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,638
Linda,

965
01:33:36,715 --> 01:33:39,013
I think you should stop now,

966
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:41,314
No, it's all right, just,,,

967
01:33:41,386 --> 01:33:44,048
- Can't somebody turn this off?
- Leave her alone,

968
01:33:44,122 --> 01:33:46,989
- Linda, come on,
- She's OK,

969
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,818
(turns off music)

970
01:33:49,894 --> 01:33:51,987
- She's fine,
- But this is a wake,

971
01:33:52,063 --> 01:33:55,590
She's fine,
Just let her dance,

972
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:58,727
- Please!
- (music starts again)

973
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:10,279
(sings along to music)

974
01:36:16,307 --> 01:36:20,767
It's like getting back on your bike,
You'll be fine,

975
01:36:20,845 --> 01:36:24,303
There's no point worrying
it'll happen again, Nothing you can do,

976
01:36:24,382 --> 01:36:29,410
- If it's coming, it's coming,
- Thank you, Clyde, That's very reassuring,

977
01:36:30,722 --> 01:36:33,384
I can't say I'm sad to see you go,

978
01:36:37,328 --> 01:36:39,489
Don't tell me,

979
01:36:39,564 --> 01:36:41,088
Maggie,

980
01:36:41,165 --> 01:36:42,564
Yep,

981
01:36:43,735 --> 01:36:46,226
- Do you think she'll ever,,,
- No,

982
01:36:49,474 --> 01:36:51,533
Drive safely, then,

983
01:37:01,586 --> 01:37:06,250
- Hi,
- I'm never having that many people here,

984
01:37:06,324 --> 01:37:09,157
- Where are your parents?
- I told them to go,

985
01:37:09,227 --> 01:37:12,219
I had to clean the house,
They'll be back tomorrow,

986
01:37:12,297 --> 01:37:14,925
Oh, right,

987
01:37:14,999 --> 01:37:18,127
I would've liked
to have said goodbye,

988
01:37:18,202 --> 01:37:21,069
- I'm gonna take Marilyn for a walk,
- Don't forget the,,,

989
01:37:21,139 --> 01:37:24,506
Garbage,
I know, 12 o'clock,

990
01:37:27,879 --> 01:37:29,540
(Maggie) Hi,

991
01:37:29,614 --> 01:37:32,105
We've just come to say goodbye,

992
01:37:32,183 --> 01:37:34,777
"We"?

993
01:37:34,852 --> 01:37:38,948
Any chance you'd keep an eye on her?
She'll be dead in a week otherwise,

994
01:37:39,023 --> 01:37:41,116
Who? Linda or the dog?

995
01:37:44,462 --> 01:37:47,431
She didn't take long to settle in,

996
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:51,996
Maybe I should do the same,

997
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:57,804
I saw this house in the real-estate window
in town, It's by the lake,

998
01:37:57,875 --> 01:38:00,002
Kind of tempting,

999
01:38:06,017 --> 01:38:09,043
No, Stupid idea,

1000
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,850
I told you I was selfish,

1001
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:14,849
You did,

1002
01:38:19,197 --> 01:38:22,394
I hope you find what you're looking for
in Winnipeg,

1003
01:38:22,467 --> 01:38:23,866
Mm,

1004
01:38:23,935 --> 01:38:26,904
I wonder what that is,
Good luck to me,

1005
01:38:37,415 --> 01:38:39,849
Maggie, I killed a man,

1006
01:38:41,919 --> 01:38:44,649
The driver who ran into my son,

1007
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:50,794
I found out his name,
where he lived,

1008
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:54,590
I went there and I hit him,

1009
01:38:57,035 --> 01:38:59,469
Hard,

1010
01:38:59,537 --> 01:39:01,528
He fell,

1011
01:39:02,607 --> 01:39:05,701
He fell onto this stone floor

1012
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:11,209
and he cracked his head open,

1013
01:39:12,216 --> 01:39:14,275
I know,

1014
01:39:14,352 --> 01:39:16,445
Clyde told me,

1015
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:23,386
- Why didn't you,,,
- I was waiting for you to mention it,

1016
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:26,191
I'm glad you did,

1017
01:39:26,264 --> 01:39:29,961
You know,
mostly he's upset that you hit a cop,

1018
01:39:32,003 --> 01:39:33,994
Thanks,

1019
01:39:35,106 --> 01:39:39,065
I think you're gonna find peace
when you get there,

1020
01:39:40,344 --> 01:39:42,574
You'll probably end up staying,

1021
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:47,640
But if you're ever
passing through here again, I,,,

1022
01:39:47,718 --> 01:39:49,948
I've had a really nice time,

1023
01:39:51,556 --> 01:39:53,786
Gotta do the garbage,
Gotta do the garbage, Garbage,

1024
01:39:53,858 --> 01:39:57,419
Gotta do the garbage, Gotta do
the garbage, Gotta do the garbage,

1025
01:39:57,495 --> 01:40:00,487
They're two hours late,
Maybe they're not coming today,

1026
01:40:00,565 --> 01:40:04,262
What if we do what everybody in
the street - everybody in the world - does?

1027
01:40:04,335 --> 01:40:08,669
Put the bags out, then if they don't turn up
today, you can leave them out until they do,

1028
01:40:08,739 --> 01:40:13,233
No, we're not gonna do that, The bags
will split and that's when raccoons come,

1029
01:40:13,311 --> 01:40:16,371
Raccoons have rabies
and they mess up the snow,

1030
01:40:16,447 --> 01:40:19,211
I'm sorry, Linda,
I just don't know what else I can do,

1031
01:40:19,283 --> 01:40:22,081
- I've made arrangements,
- You are a very selfish man,

1032
01:40:22,153 --> 01:40:25,316
- No, I'm not, You're just unreasonable,
- I'm autistic,

1033
01:40:25,389 --> 01:40:28,187
Well, it's the same thing,

1034
01:40:28,259 --> 01:40:32,889
Apart from today, you have been very
helpful, Alex, and I want to say thank you,

1035
01:40:32,964 --> 01:40:37,663
You're not as interesting as Vivienne, but
you have some quite good characteristics,

1036
01:40:37,735 --> 01:40:39,600
Whoo-hoo,

1037
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:43,606
Don't go overboard
with the praise there, Linda,

1038
01:40:52,984 --> 01:40:55,578
So, Linda,

1039
01:40:57,421 --> 01:41:00,515
I'm really going to have to go,

1040
01:41:02,426 --> 01:41:04,758
Very soon,

1041
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:15,899
You have been very annoying,

1042
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:21,641
But you've also been a friend
and I'm going to miss you,

1043
01:41:27,251 --> 01:41:29,048
Hm,

1044
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:33,384
I didn't think
it'd be so hard to say goodbye,

1045
01:41:35,593 --> 01:41:38,926
It's been a real pleasure,

1046
01:41:40,831 --> 01:41:45,495
You are the only person
I have ever met

1047
01:41:46,637 --> 01:41:52,041
who I didn't have to explain
or even justify myself to,

1048
01:41:53,344 --> 01:41:55,869
Perfectamundo,

1049
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:02,510
- Sorry about the trash,
- Mm,

1050
01:42:09,594 --> 01:42:13,052
- Can I send you a postcard?
- What for?

1051
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:19,735
- I'll give you a ring, I've got your number,
- When will you ring me?

1052
01:42:19,804 --> 01:42:22,500
You know,
I think Vivienne would've liked our story,

1053
01:42:22,573 --> 01:42:25,770
Well, she's not here to see it, is she?

1054
01:42:29,146 --> 01:42:31,137
Right, then,

1055
01:42:35,186 --> 01:42:38,451
I'm so sorry
about your daughter,

1056
01:42:46,297 --> 01:42:48,993
I'm off,

1057
01:42:52,436 --> 01:42:54,927
I left something for you,

1058
01:42:56,107 --> 01:42:58,439
It's in the freezer,

1059
01:43:15,626 --> 01:43:17,617
(car starts)

1060
01:43:30,007 --> 01:43:31,941
(Linda sighs)

1061
01:43:44,955 --> 01:43:47,116
Snow cake,

1062
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:50,616
Now, that is interesting,

1063
01:44:18,556 --> 01:44:20,547
(dog barks outside)

1064
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:23,917
Oh, no!

1065
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:29,199
(door slams)

1066
01:45:07,638 --> 01:45:10,038
(Linda) He stops for one second.

1067
01:45:10,107 --> 01:45:13,565
And he's totally overwhelmed
by how big the world is

1068
01:45:13,644 --> 01:45:16,545
and how small
and unimportant he is.

1069
01:45:16,614 --> 01:45:18,673
And as he turns around,

1070
01:45:18,749 --> 01:45:21,479
we see his face look to the sky.

1071
01:45:21,552 --> 01:45:23,850
And he says, very quietly,

1072
01:45:23,921 --> 01:45:26,651
so that no one can hear him:

1073
01:45:26,724 --> 01:45:28,783
"Dazlious."

1074
01:45:30,327 --> 01:45:33,660
