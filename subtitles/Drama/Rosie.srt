00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:47,915
No.

9
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:53,201
Why?
Why did you do it?

10
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,564
Just because. For a lark.
ls that all?

11
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:59,325
I'm tired. Can I sleep now?

12
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:02,206
I'm not finished.
Answer the question.

13
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:08,646
I used to tell everything.
I'm not so dumb any more.

14
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,679
I'm not saying a thing.

15
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:16,122
No matter what.
-You could try telling the truth.

16
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,119
The truth?

17
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:21,522
You'd never believe it.

18
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,127
Secure institution:
1st day in your room.

19
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:34,559
You'll get some food in an hour.
Then it’s your medical.

20
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,642
19 March 1980.
My very dearest Jimi,

21
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:54,004
I feel bad. I can't stop
thinking about you, about us.

22
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,678
You're my friend.
The only one I have.

23
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:03,039
Even now when you're so far away
I feel you are near me.

24
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:05,836
As though you were at my side.

25
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,044
Nobody will come
between us. Nobody.

26
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,358
No matter what happens.

27
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:15,004
I want to forget the past
as soon as possible.

28
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:19,680
I’ll erase it from my mind.
I’ll forget it.

29
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:23,522
I don't care, as long as
I have you.

30
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:29,079
One thing is certain,; I’ll never
go back home again.

31
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:33,760
Write as soon as you can.
I miss you.

32
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,922
Yours forever...
ROSIE.

33
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:43,963
ROSIE, a devil in my head

34
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,555
Hello, Leo!
- Hello, Rosie!

35
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:41,646
Irene?

36
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,560
Irene?

37
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,761
It’s me.
Let me in.

38
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,366
I'm safe here.

39
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,284
If I don't dare,
I'm a coward.

40
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:20,360
And if I don't cross it,
I'm worth nothing.

41
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,805
And if I give up,
I'm lost...

42
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,919
And if I fall...
I'm dead.

43
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:35,643
Fly! Take off! Soar!
Fly! Take off! Soar!

44
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,126
Fly! Take off! Soar!

45
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,642
Fly! Take off! Soar!

46
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:46,162
Fly! Take off! Soar!

47
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,603
Fly! Take off! Soar!
Fly! Take off! Soar!

48
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:55,966
Fly! Take off! Soar!
Fly! Take off! Soar!

49
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,519
What have you been up to?

50
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:16,922
I flew. Really flew, Mummy.
- Don't call me that.

51
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,040
He's back?
You chucked the jerk out.

52
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,085
You'd had enough ofhim
- Be quiet and eat.

53
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,765
It’s true, isn't it, Mummy?
- I'm not your mummy.

54
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,041
I'm on night duty.
Don't wait up for me.

55
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:49,240
Okay, pumpkin.
- I'm going now.

56
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,558
You're always going.

57
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:51,880
Turn that off!
Turn it off!

58
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,521
Please, Irene.
It’s cold.

59
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:01,043
Let me back in and we'll
settle it together.

60
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:04,207
Let me in, please.
It’s cold.

61
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,278
This is embarrassing.
Let me in.

62
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:12,318
What's with you?
You think it's funny?

63
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,320
Get inside, little monster!
Get inside!

64
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,399
There's nothing to laugh at!

65
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,640
The tsarina trembled under
his gentle caresses...

66
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,924
Roaring like a tiger,
the knight took her.

67
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,726
He plunged his lance
into her sheath

68
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:33,596
and her whole body was
overwhelmed by a charge

69
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:37,397
that pierced her like
a lightening bolt...

70
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:41,882
She remembered the day
of their first encounter.

71
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:49,959
He stood there like a whinnying
horse, like a young god.

72
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,005
Dearest Sister...

73
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,921
Thank you for the 15,000 francs
you sent me by cheque.

74
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,526
I have to ask
one last favour.

75
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:40,396
I'm under threat of eviction
at the end of the month.

76
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:44,676
10,000 would help me
out of my difficulties.

77
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,442
Greetings to Rosie.
Many kisses, Michel.

78
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,161
My God!

79
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:07,236
All right, child? Don't move,
and don't panic.

80
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,602
Damn! All the blood.

81
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:12,323
Okay?

82
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,805
Hello, handsome.

83
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:18,240
How do you feel?

84
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,325
Blissful.

85
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,642
Seeing you makes me
feel blissful.

86
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,441
Are you okay, child?
Hey there...hello?

87
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,402
Stay still.
Don't move.

88
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,798
I'm all right.
I want to go home.

89
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,919
All that food.
- Shall I take you home?

90
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:47,318
I'm already late.
Mummy will kill me.

91
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,247
Should I call someone?
-Are you okay?

92
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:08,443
Dear Brother, I can't do
any more for you.

93
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,762
Your continual debts
are causing me problems.

94
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,685
Mummy?
Will you look at this? It hurts.

95
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,397
Okay, I'll be right with you.
I'm busy.

96
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,918
If it's really necessary,
you can stay with us for a bit.

97
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:31,959
You can sleep in Rosie's room.

98
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm Stella. And you?
- Rosie.

99
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,638
You're new too?

100
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,562
I bashed my mum's
head in.

101
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,686
Why are you here?

102
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,559
None of your business.

103
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,115
Everyone here is either crazy

104
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,044
or has killed someone.

105
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,202
Where’s your mummy?

106
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,405
Or don't you have a
mummy either?

107
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,756
Hello, mouse.
- Hello, you.

108
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:50,045
Don't you have to play?
Have you hurt yourself?

109
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,879
Did you have a row at home?

110
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:55,244
Why are you limping?
- Do you want to know?

111
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:59,958
They raped me.
- Liar.

112
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,200
There were 3 strong Moroccans.
- I don't believe you.

113
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:08,406
One even had a switch blade.
He put it to my throat.

114
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:11,400
A switch blade? Impossible.
They're illegal.

115
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,795
Rape too.

116
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:16,243
What's it like to be raped?
What did they do?

117
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:19,638
Two held me to the ground
and the third…

118
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,002
...plunged his hot lance in me.

119
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,876
On the ground?
They can't do it in the air.

120
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:27,196
Horrible!

121
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:31,246
He stuck his willie in your thing?
- From behind.

122
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,365
It was as big as this.
It was enormous.

123
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,166
You'll get pregnant.
- That's not possible.

124
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:39,726
Did it hurt?

125
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:43,124
No, it was the nicest thing
I ever felt.

126
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,436
And then?

127
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:48,444
Then I must have fainted.
And they ran off...

128
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:53,044
...towards Falcon Square.
Isn't that where you live?

129
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,158
Get up, Rosie.

130
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:08,645
Michel's coming to stay with
us. He'll sleep in your room.

131
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:16,360
Where will I sleep?
With me.

132
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,523
Both of us in one bed?

133
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:24,646
If you keep still, don't
take up too much room...

134
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:28,243
...don't snore and keep
Your hands outside the covers.

135
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,125
And if you want to
sleep with a bloke?

136
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:39,206
I don't want any more blokes
in my bed.

137
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:44,246
I don't believe it. You
can't do without them.

138
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,085
Swear?
- I swear.

139
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,841
On what?
- On your sweet little soul.

140
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,323
Do I have that?

141
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,883
My sweet child.
My sweet little child.

142
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,283
You're all that I have.

143
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:05,842
Mummy!
- Sister.

144
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:09,201
Mummy!
- Sister. I'm your sister.

145
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,722
You're my mother.
-You're to call me sister.

146
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,959
Why can't I call you mummy?

147
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,760
Because.

148
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,002
Why not?

149
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:34,722
I wasn't even 14 when I had you.
Not much older than you are now.

150
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,085
That's why.

151
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,598
Why can't anyone know?

152
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,962
It’s nobody's business.

153
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,998
It’s a secret. Something
between you and me.

154
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,079
Our secret!

155
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:53,963
Mummy!

156
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,366
Looking for a girlfriend?

157
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,683
I'm free.

158
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,443
I'll be all yours.

159
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,165
God, nobody...

160
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,925
Do you want to do it with me?
Please?

161
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,280
Do you want to do it with me?
Please.

162
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,159
I want you.

163
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,446
You're my prince.

164
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,676
Do you want to do it with me?

165
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,485
What?

166
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,084
I want you.

167
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,843
What are you saying?

168
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,123
Do you want to marry me?

169
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,245
Jesus, girl.
How old are you?

170
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,205
Sixteen and a few months.

171
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:57,122
Tell me your name first.
- Rosie. And you?

172
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,755
Jimi... Do you want one?

173
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,395
Look, I have to go. Bye!

174
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,043
Will I see you again?

175
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,763
Lovely. Very lovely.

176
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:21,806
Thank you.

177
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:37,716
With whom do I have the honour...?
- Rosita, the lovely tsarina.

178
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:39,683
And you?

179
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,482
Michel. At your service.

180
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:48,281
A kiss, noble tsarina?
-As you wish.

181
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,245
But I don't understand you.
I speak Russian.

182
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:55,079
Russian? Russki?
No problem.

183
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,157
Doesn’t your brother get a kiss?

184
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,196
Hello, Michel.
- Hello, Rosie.

185
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,401
Where's Irene?
- She's working.

186
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,917
Inhale and don't move.

187
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:20,275
Name?
- Bernard Vermarke.

188
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,196
Your personal details
have not changed?

189
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,996
Address: 4 Manchester Street
Civil status: married.

190
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,725
Widower.

191
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:33,280
Children?
- No, thank goodness.

192
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,560
Which department?
- Chemistry.

193
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,285
Any particular complaints?
- No.

194
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:45,006
Results in one week.
Please send in the next one.

195
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:14,198
One day he showed up unexpectedly
at the palace courtyard.

196
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,441
The tsarina jumped up
and rushed downstairs.

197
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,121
And stroked blindly stroked
each others bodies.

198
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,566
Lingering on the warmest
curves. His hands…

199
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:30,279
...tasted her full shoulders,
Her firm breasts, her slender waist.

200
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,283
Guess...
Who am I?

201
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,000
Who are you?

202
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,483
I am yours and you are mine.
Who am I?

203
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,641
Jimi!

204
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,563
What's it about?

205
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,763
Real heroes.

206
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,797
Real, manly heroes.

207
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:07,003
Beautiful girls in
gorgeous ball gowns.

208
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:11,721
Good people always
win and bad people die.

209
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:17,201
It always ends well
and everyone is happy.

210
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:20,481
And you, are you happy?

211
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,960
Not like in the book.
That's not possible. It's not real.

212
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:28,162
Sure it is.

213
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,999
It is possible.
-What do you have to do?

214
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:36,844
Follow the dictates
of your heart.

215
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,518
Do what you truly want to do.

216
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,005
Do what you want
most in the whole world.

217
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,686
You know what that is?

218
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,243
Look at the clouds

219
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,724
and close your eyes.
Make a wish.

220
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,766
I wish...

221
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,395
I wish...for my mummy
to be happy.

222
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,963
No... You have to wish
something for yourself.

223
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,644
Wishing for another
brings unhappiness.

224
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,159
Do you understand?

225
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,441
I'm happy if she's happy.

226
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:43,681
'Goldenboy' and 'Geraldo' are
in lead, but not by much.

227
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:47,681
We still have a lap to go
and it's anyone's guess.

228
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,762
How do I look?

229
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:55,399
Great...fantastic.
-You've put on some weight?

230
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,639
No, really. I'm serious.

231
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:11,156
I've got my papers.
- No problems then.

232
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:13,645
Take off your jacket.

233
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:20,876
That's Rosie, my little sister.
This is Bernard.

234
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:22,806
Hello, Rosie.

235
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,355
Hello.

236
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:30,757
That's my brother, Michel.

237
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:32,602
Hello.

238
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,045
Take a seat.

239
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:39,726
There?

240
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,966
Martini?

241
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:59,479
Mr. Bernard, what do you
do for a living?

242
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:02,962
I'm a chemist.

243
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,684
Do you earn a lot?
- Rosie, that's enough.

244
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:10,683
Do you mean am I rich?
-Yes.

245
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:13,763
Why do you want to know?

246
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:18,201
Because we're up to our
ears in the shit, sir.

247
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:35,363
And what's your line of work?

248
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,563
Things are quiet at the moment.

249
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:41,919
They need people...
- I'm not looking.

250
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:46,683
Work is important,
just to stay sane.

251
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,076
I'm in business.

252
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,367
Dinner must be ready.
I'll see to it.

253
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:02,524
Mr Bernard, are you a good man?

254
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:06,877
Meaning?

255
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,123
Are you a good man?
A decent chap?

256
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:25,241
That's someone who doesn't drink,
doesn't chase other women.

257
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:29,878
He doesn't hit his wife,
not every day. Do you drink a lot?

258
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:36,280
Do you hit your wife?
- No.

259
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,006
Do you like it?

260
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:52,359
I haven't eaten so well in years.

261
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:57,040
I've had to cook for myself
since my wife died and...

262
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,359
...you should taste it.
This is delicious.

263
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:03,482
Really. Delicious.

264
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:16,921
Here.

265
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,997
It’s Saturday evening.
Go out and have some fun.

266
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:26,081
You could go to the theme park...
Go with that boy.

267
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:30,437
Go on...
Go ahead...

268
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,082
And stay out for several hours.

269
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,357
And stay out for several hours.

270
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,603
Come on, Bernard...

271
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,361
No really, I trip
over my own feet.

272
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,324
I'm too clumsy.

273
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,523
Michel...dance with me.

274
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:05,041
Go on... I'd love to
if I was any good at it.

275
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:58,407
Mummy, are you asleep already?

276
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,206
Are you dreaming...

277
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,203
...or are you in love?

278
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,319
Me too.

279
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,082
I have a boyfriend. Jimi.

280
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,124
A boyfriend? What's that?

281
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:42,125
A boyfriend is someone you
can trust and who trusts you.

282
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:45,757
You do things together.
Have things in common.

283
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:50,278
I can't explain it, but
it's a fantastic feeling.

284
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:57,277
One's coming... five,
four, three... Go!

285
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,960
Idiot... You could have been killed.

286
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,283
Your turn.
-What do I have to do?

287
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:14,360
You're my robot.
You have to do whatever I say.

288
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:18,757
See that man?
Go give him a punch on the nose.

289
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,679
No, that's too cruel.

290
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:25,802
An order is an order.
- Something else. Okay? For...

291
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:29,598
Go annoy him then.
Get some money from him.

292
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:32,045
That's easy.

293
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,680
Hello, sir.
- Hello, child.

294
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:46,320
Can I have some money for the bus?
- For cigarettes?

295
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,397
No, my child.
Go along home.

296
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,320
But then I'll have to hitch home.

297
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:56,640
And if I'm kidnapped,
you'll never forgive yourself.

298
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:04,764
How much is it? 25 Francs?
- Miser. Give me 200.

299
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:10,677
Are you mad! Not a cent.
Now be off with you.

300
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:17,084
Give me something or I'll tell
those people you're a dirty old man.

301
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:20,557
Keep your hands to yourself.
Dirty paedophile.

302
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:22,885
Hey... Hey...

303
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:29,323
Do you have everything you want?

304
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:34,202
I'd love to have some
shoes with high heels.

305
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,077
Do you like them?
They're yours.

306
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,440
Run...

307
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:17,963
Rosie.

308
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,604
Just look at yourself.
- Nice, huh?

309
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:29,561
What's that?
- Lacquer. It smells nice too.

310
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:32,197
Take that stuff out of
yourhair and wash yourface.

311
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,839
Where did you get the boots?
- They were a gift.

312
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:42,478
From who?
-A friend. His name is Jimi.

313
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:48,277
Don't you like them?
-You look like a whore.

314
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,522
So what?

315
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,438
Upstairs...now... Understand?

316
00:33:56,847 --> 00:34:01,125
And invite that friend to dinner...
I want a look at him.

317
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,716
The next race. Number 7.

318
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,285
'Goldenboy' bearing number 7
is at the front.

319
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:47,117
'Goldenboy' is overtaken
on the outside.

320
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:52,282
It must have happened fast, because
number 8 is still leading and will win.

321
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:59,045
Where are you?

322
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:04,522
Come on, Jimi. Come.

323
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:09,242
Come to dinner, Rosie.
We've waited long enough.

324
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,967
Hurry, Jimi. Please.

325
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,602
He'll be along later.
- He's not coming now.

326
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,880
He will come. He'll come.

327
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:32,926
Nice manners, making us wait
for dinner. He's not serious.

328
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,360
Patience, he'll come.

329
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,278
Yes... He let you down.

330
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:43,122
Something could have
happened, couldn't it?

331
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,084
Is he handsome?
-Yes.

332
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:53,718
How old is he?

333
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:57,646
You won't say?
Then he's too old.

334
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:01,124
Take it easy.
She's in love.

335
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,358
What do you know about him?

336
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,366
Does he live nearby?

337
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:12,526
Who are his parents?
What does he do?

338
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:20,005
You won't see him again.
He's got another.

339
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:25,316
That's not true. He loves me.
We're going to get married.

340
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:30,604
Congratulations. When?
- Soon. Because we have to.

341
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,401
Are you okay, little one?

342
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,604
I'll tell you something.

343
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:56,079
When I was your age I was
head over heels in love too.

344
00:36:57,287 --> 00:37:02,839
I would have done anything for
him. He was my hero, my prince.

345
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:07,717
If he had asked me to go away
with him, I would have.

346
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:13,365
Really. And in the end...
We didn't understand why

347
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:19,244
we could live in the same house
but not sleep in the same bed.

348
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:25,478
But we did it anyway,
secretly and it all came out.

349
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:31,403
He was sent away.
And I waited for him at the window.

350
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,365
For months.

351
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,247
And then you came along.

352
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:49,080
Rosie, that prince on a white
horse. He doesn't exist.

353
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:57,086
Clear off. I don't want to see
you any more. Find someone else.

354
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,325
What did I do?
-You deceived me.

355
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,604
I'd never do that.
-You don't love me.

356
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,122
But of course I do.

357
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,357
Where were you yesterday?

358
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,323
You don't take us serious, do you?

359
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,844
Very serious.

360
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:21,166
Really? Very serious?

361
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,206
Close your eyes.
I have a surprise.

362
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:32,280
What a chic car! It's yours?
-What do you think?

363
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:37,682
Can you drive?
- Get in, we'll go for a spin.

364
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:43,799
Where are we going?

365
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,323
Trust me. I'm your friend.
You have to trust me.

366
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,595
You do trust me?
- Of course.

367
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,481
Prove it.
- I trust you.

368
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:55,605
Blindly?

369
00:38:57,607 --> 00:39:01,646
I've got a game: you cover
my eyes and tell me what to do.

370
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,764
Far out. Far out. Okay.
We'll do it.

371
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,044
Ready?
-Wait.

372
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:15,040
Now!
- It's exciting.

373
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:19,843
Okay. Straight ahead.

374
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:21,679
Go a bit right.
- Right?

375
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:23,075
Okay?
- Fine.

376
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,124
Can I go a bit faster?

377
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:28,359
Cool. There's a cyclist,
but it's okay.

378
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:31,200
I'll flatten him.
- Perfect.

379
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:34,917
I'm going to speed up...
- Okay. Go right... right!

380
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:39,319
Faster...faster!
- Shit, a crossing!

381
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,000
A crossing!
-Where?

382
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:43,317
It’s now or never!
-Where?

383
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:45,125
In front of us.
-Where's the crossing?

384
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:49,519
Go right! Right! Stop!
Go right, Jimi. Go right!

385
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:55,560
Stop, Jimi, l've had enough.
It’s enough.

386
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't feel a thing.
We're not dead. We're alive.

387
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:01,562
That's enough. I warn you.

388
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:03,763
Fantastic.

389
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:10,361
Frightening.
- Madness. Pure madness.

390
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:14,402
I hope this will never end.

391
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:52,683
Is there anything for me?

392
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:24,796
Can I have my book?
- But it's so exciting.

393
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:27,356
Give it to me.

394
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:31,037
Roaring like a tiger
the knight took her.

395
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:33,721
He plunged his lance
into her sheath.

396
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:37,163
My love, my tsarina...

397
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:41,957
and her whole body was
overwhelmed by a charge...

398
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:47,365
Do you read this trash?

399
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:50,565
Yes.

400
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:53,242
You should be ashamed.

401
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:57,277
I think it's lovely, romantic.
- Romantic?

402
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:00,004
It’s not for little girls.

403
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:06,321
Damn it!
- Bastard!

404
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:14,763
I want my room back, now. I'd rather
have a cockroach in it than Michel.

405
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:16,076
That's enough.

406
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:19,364
I mean it. He can drop dead.
I don't care a damn.

407
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,401
I won't lie any more and I won't
spit at the neighbour any more.

408
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:29,001
We're family.
We help each other.

409
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,078
Anything I can do?

410
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:51,124
Let her sleep.
- I'll put her in the living room.

411
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:53,437
I won't wake herup.

412
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:56,196
Be careful...
- Come along...

413
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,038
Gently...Gently!

414
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,845
Careful, careful.
-Yes, yes.

415
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,723
Come on...
-Yes.

416
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,477
I know what you're up to.
-You don't know a thing.

417
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:52,957
You can't stay here.
-You think I like being here?

418
00:43:57,527 --> 00:43:59,836
I'll be off as soon as I can.

419
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:18,239
What's that?
- It's my mother.

420
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:22,036
Pretty child.
- She's beautiful.

421
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:26,041
I wish I looked like her,
but I'm small and ugly.

422
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:27,956
Can I see it?

423
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,196
A young mummy.

424
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:39,726
Where is she now?
- Dead. After a long illness.

425
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:43,477
How terrible.
- I never knew her.

426
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,036
She died when I was born.

427
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,967
What’s wrong with
you all of a sudden?

428
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,486
Rosie, come down.

429
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:08,156
What's wrong?
-You and me. You promised me.

430
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:12,605
You're not going to ruin this.
Understand? I like Bernard.

431
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:16,760
So why not tell him I'm your
daughter? Why do I have to lie?

432
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,519
I won't lie any more.

433
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:25,359
Are you coming down?

434
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:29,916
No, I'm not. I won't do
anything you say any more.

435
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:44,004
Are you ashamed?
Are you ashamed of me?

436
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:48,877
You wouldn't care
if I wasn't here any more.

437
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:52,965
You don't love me.

438
00:47:03,327 --> 00:47:04,646
What's that?

439
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:10,006
He was crying.
I couldn't just leave him there.

440
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:15,486
He's a sweetie.

441
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:19,882
He's a filthy baby.
- He smells a bit, that's all.

442
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:22,038
He's ugly.

443
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:27,958
Look at his eyes.
And he's got a dent in his head.

444
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:32,757
So? I think he's a real sweetie.

445
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,560
They shit, they cry and they shit.

446
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:44,005
Babies are nothing but trouble.
- Don't take any notice ofhim.

447
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:49,798
What are you going to do with him?
Take him back.

448
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:53,119
Idiot. I'm keeping him.
He's mine.

449
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:57,155
My little baby.
My little angel.

450
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:07,237
Do what you want with him.
But I'm not going to feed him.

451
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:15,120
Look at him.
He's smiling at you, Papa.

452
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:17,806
Papa!

453
00:48:22,647 --> 00:48:24,842
We have to give him a name.

454
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,205
Jimi Junior.

455
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:35,356
Or Kojak.
- Kojak? That old fart?

456
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:39,006
Elvis? I think Elvis
is a lovely name.

457
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,558
We christen you 'Elvis'.

458
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:49,726
Elvis.

459
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,803
Look, he has your eyes.

460
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:00,565
Make him stop crying.
-You do it.

461
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,479
It’s giving me a headache.

462
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:07,115
Here, take him.
- But he's yourbaby.

463
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,727
Maybe he had a shit.

464
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,279
It stinks.

465
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:37,440
Maybe he's hungry.
He could be.

466
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,196
Give him a beer.
It'll shut him up.

467
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,961
Yes, why not.
-Yes, why not?

468
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:47,765
I'll go buy some food.
It can't go on like this...

469
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:51,957
Look after him.
Don't let anything happen to him.

470
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:56,165
I'll be back.

471
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,926
Sit...
Don't move.

472
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,326
Elvis?

473
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:28,000
Jimi?

474
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,598
Elvis?

475
00:51:11,687 --> 00:51:14,247
Don't be afraid.
It’s me. Your mummy.

476
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,484
Your mummy is back.

477
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:23,399
Yes, I'm here.

478
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:35,762
Some father.
You were going to look after her.

479
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:40,844
And you forgot all about her.
- I fell asleep.

480
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:42,998
So I see.

481
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:49,723
Where are you going?
- I'm leaving, for good.

482
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,758
Go on, say: Mummy.
Say: Mummy.

483
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,564
Mum-my, Mummy.

484
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:09,484
Come on say it: Mummy,
Mummy...

485
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,321
I'm your mummy.
Now say: mummy.

486
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:21,243
Mummy! Mummy. Say: Mummy!

487
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:27,044
Call me Mummy.

488
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,759
That's okay.

489
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:17,035
Rosie? Rosie? Where are you?
- Jimi? Jimi.

490
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:20,399
There you are.

491
00:54:24,247 --> 00:54:26,238
I'm glad I have you.

492
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:31,397
You're a friend, a true friend.

493
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,196
You'll never leave me.

494
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:04,083
She'll come back, Irene.

495
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:17,956
They'll be worried by now.
-Who?

496
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,280
Hermummy. Herreal mummy.

497
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:27,601
Regrets?

498
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:31,563
You think God will punish you?

499
00:55:33,647 --> 00:55:37,686
God understands everything.
It’s a young chap.

500
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:42,560
Like me. Maybe he looks like me.

501
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:48,042
Do you want to be a god?
-Yes. With you as my goddess.

502
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:51,800
You have to learn to wash
yourself properly first.

503
00:55:55,607 --> 00:55:57,199
We're gods!

504
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:00,766
Gods!

505
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:10,239
You have to eat.

506
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:13,606
Look...

507
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,441
Delicious...

508
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:27,325
You have to eat.
I don't want you to get ill.

509
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:37,239
Come on, Rosie.

510
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:44,440
Wait, we have to do something.

511
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:49,564
He's not eating.
We have to do something.

512
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:55,005
Dammit, Rosie. l've been
on this shit road all day.

513
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:11,561
Yes?
- Hello, ma'am.

514
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:13,076
What is it?

515
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,443
We're lost and I think she's ill.

516
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:22,282
No wonder. It's too cold out
for such a little one.

517
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:28,441
Could you have a look at her?
She hasn't eaten or anything.

518
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,598
Here, give her to me.

519
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:35,722
Is it your little sister?
- No, my daughter.

520
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,036
What's hername?
- Elvis.

521
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,767
Elvis? That's an odd name.

522
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,958
Come on in then.

523
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:56,402
Will you take good care of her?
-Yes...

524
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,761
Hey... Come back!

525
00:59:27,327 --> 00:59:28,885
Don't be angry.

526
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,161
Don't be angry.

527
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:35,366
I'm not angry.

528
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:43,763
Hold me tight.

529
00:59:45,527 --> 00:59:49,486
Never leave again...
Promise you'll never leave again.

530
00:59:51,127 --> 00:59:55,040
Never run away again.
Promise you'll never do it again.

531
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:59,318
Come, let's go in.

532
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:16,679
You go to sleep now, okay?

533
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:26,041
Will you stay when I'm asleep?
-Yes, my sweetie.

534
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,245
My lovely child.

535
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:35,677
You're all that I have.
- Do you mean that?

536
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:42,600
Mummy?

537
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:46,282
Mummy.

538
01:00:47,927 --> 01:00:49,804
I'm your mummy.

539
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,920
She's sleeping?

540
01:01:21,607 --> 01:01:23,518
I'm worried about her.

541
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:29,165
I'm her mother.

542
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:35,718
But that's not all...

543
01:01:37,687 --> 01:01:38,597
I know.

544
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:47,078
You're not leaving now?

545
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,758
You can, if you want.

546
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:56,756
No, I love you.

547
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:02,755
I love you so much.
The rest doesn't matter.

548
01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:08,925
I want to take care of you.
Of you and of Rosie.

549
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,725
Rosie, wake up.

550
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:19,602
Good morning. It's been six weeks
now, are you doing all right?

551
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:21,596
Yes, ma'am.

552
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:25,601
What you did was very bad.
Do you understand that now?

553
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:27,920
Yes, ma'am.

554
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:30,078
Are you sorry you did it?

555
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:33,359
Yes, ma'am. I am now.

556
01:02:33,527 --> 01:02:38,078
Then I've got some good news for
you. We're very pleased with you.

557
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:42,039
You've behaved very well.
You've made some friends.

558
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:44,926
You can go home
for a weekend soon.

559
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:49,476
As a trial.
Are you pleased?

560
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,766
You can't stay, Michel.
Rosie needs her room.

561
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:46,199
You have to eat...

562
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:49,766
...or do you want to stay
as skinny as a rail?

563
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,718
Give me one more week.

564
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,035
What's next, Rosie?

565
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,478
Will you see that boy again?

566
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,719
Answer my question.

567
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:49,882
Yes.

568
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:55,123
Are you doing it with him?
- He's my friend.

569
01:04:58,007 --> 01:05:01,443
I forbid you to see him again.
I want yourword.

570
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,796
Do you hear?
- I don't listen to you.

571
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:10,444
Did you sleep with him?

572
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,562
He kissed me. That's all.

573
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:17,719
You're like your mother.
Just like her.

574
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:25,125
I'm going out.
- Really? l'll have to lock you up then.

575
01:05:27,647 --> 01:05:31,083
Hit me. Go ahead.
I'll go out anyway...

576
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:33,522
You're going nowhere.
Nowhere.

577
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:04,487
Bastard, open the door.
I hate you, Michel.

578
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:08,722
Mummy, Mummy.
-You locked herin?

579
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:20,725
It just was a game, Irene.
-A game?

580
01:06:20,887 --> 01:06:24,641
This is just a game too.
There.

581
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:27,037
And this.
-Are you finished?

582
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:30,165
I can break what I want.
Understand?

583
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:33,877
Everything here is mine.
You have nothing here.

584
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:37,080
This is mine. And this as well.

585
01:06:37,287 --> 01:06:40,006
And I'll break it all,
For nothing here is yours.

586
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:41,925
Everything is mine.

587
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:48,363
Get out. I've had enough.
You're ruining my whole life.

588
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:52,282
And my daughter's too.
I've had enough. Go! Leave!

589
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:56,677
Fine. I'm out of here.
- Good.

590
01:07:02,847 --> 01:07:06,317
Please, Michel.
Get out of here...

591
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:11,601
I want you to leave.
It’s not working out.

592
01:07:13,127 --> 01:07:14,845
Go away.

593
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:39,596
Give me a 1000 Francs.

594
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:45,080
I don't have it.
- 500, then.

595
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:48,324
Michel, I don't have it.

596
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:52,836
Here.

597
01:08:00,887 --> 01:08:02,923
You can go to hell.

598
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:11,486
Mummy...

599
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,599
Okay, Mummy?
-Yes...

600
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:32,998
I'll be okay.

601
01:08:48,127 --> 01:08:51,199
I'll tell you yourfuture.

602
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,117
Everything will be fine.

603
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:01,405
And there'll be some nice things.

604
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,798
We're going to be happy,
very happy.

605
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:11,877
Look, this line tells if you're
going to be happy ornot.

606
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:18,559
And this means there's going
to be a man in your life.

607
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,727
My dearest Jimi...

608
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:12,564
I think of you always.
Especially at night if I can't sleep.

609
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:16,275
What are you doing?
Where are you?

610
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:19,723
I get frightened sometimes.

611
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:22,641
Then I think you deceive me.

612
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,037
Don't leave me for another...

613
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:30,361
Forgive me for my doubts

614
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:35,000
but this is my 10th letter
and I haven't had one from you.

615
01:10:37,287 --> 01:10:41,485
Forgive me, please.
I know you love me...

616
01:10:42,887 --> 01:10:44,605
I hope you do.

617
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:47,435
Your despairing Rosie.

618
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,802
That's where my boyfriend lived.

619
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:57,320
It was our secret place.
Jimi and I lived there.

620
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,043
It was our villa.

621
01:11:03,247 --> 01:11:04,885
A fine villa.

622
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,398
This is the living room.

623
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:14,640
Good grief...

624
01:11:16,807 --> 01:11:19,401
And your boyfriend?
I'd like to meet him.

625
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:24,880
He doesn't come here any more.
It’s over between us.

626
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:32,040
Rosie, would you be
upset if I married Irene?

627
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:36,166
I love her. We'd be a family.
What do you think?

628
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:39,280
You should have a daddy.
-A daddy?

629
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,678
I've never had a daddy.

630
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:47,444
The last 400 metres; a major surprise,
because 'Goldenboy' is at front.

631
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:52,317
Started as an outsider, 12 to 1.
That's logical after losing so often.

632
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:55,923
It may be too early,
but number 10 is waiting.

633
01:11:56,087 --> 01:11:59,284
If 'Goldenboy' doesn't run faster...

634
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,717
That doesn't happen 'Goldenboy'...

635
01:12:01,887 --> 01:12:05,482
...alone in the lead and what
a lead. A winner, 12 to 1.

636
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:12,086
At last it's bingo for those
who bet on 'Goldenboy' so often.

637
01:13:34,287 --> 01:13:35,959
I don't want it.

638
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:41,519
I'm leaving, Irene.

639
01:13:46,087 --> 01:13:47,725
I won’t bother you again.

640
01:14:39,527 --> 01:14:41,358
Go on, go to your room.

641
01:14:42,927 --> 01:14:44,440
Leave us be, please.

642
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,642
Can't I talk to my sister?

643
01:14:47,887 --> 01:14:49,479
Sure. Keep it short.

644
01:14:49,687 --> 01:14:51,757
What’s your problem?
- Michel, calm down.

645
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:55,684
You'd better leave.
- Or you'll throw me out?

646
01:14:55,847 --> 01:14:59,760
You'll throw me out?
You'll throw me out...you?

647
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:04,399
Michel, stop!
- It’s better for everyone!

648
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,680
Help me, Jimi.
Please, help me.

649
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,400
Okay?

650
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:22,200
You have to choose, Irene.
Do you still love him? Yes.

651
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:25,156
So, help him.
- He's my brother.

652
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,726
He's more than that, Irene.
Much more.

653
01:15:32,447 --> 01:15:34,881
I don't think you need me any more.

654
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:45,118
Bernard, don't go.

655
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:47,798
Come back, Bernard!

656
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:54,763
Tell me what to do.

657
01:15:58,127 --> 01:15:59,765
Do something.

658
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:04,445
You have to.

659
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:10,599
The decision is up to you.

660
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,365
I'll do it.

661
01:16:17,207 --> 01:16:19,038
I have to help Mummy.

662
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:23,318
It’s up to me.

663
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,560
I know what to do.

664
01:16:30,527 --> 01:16:31,960
Michel...

665
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:36,005
Are you asleep?

666
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:14,041
21, 22...

667
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:16,520
23...

668
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:19,804
Nine more steps and
the house will vanish.

669
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:22,162
25... Gone!

670
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:25,000
27... Destroyed by the fire.

671
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,562
28... Vanished.

672
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:30,076
29... Never existed.

673
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:33,404
30, 31...

674
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:37,363
32, 33...

675
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:41,239
34, 35...

676
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:45,198
36, 37...

677
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:49,596
38, 39...

678
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:51,965
40.

679
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:35,637
I know you're there, Rosie.

680
01:18:37,727 --> 01:18:39,922
Come down from there. Come.

681
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:45,279
Come down from those pipes.

682
01:18:48,647 --> 01:18:51,366
Come down, I said.
- Never in my life!

683
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:56,639
Okay. As you wish.
You'll come down eventually.

684
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:10,686
How long still?

685
01:19:12,407 --> 01:19:14,238
As long as I have to.

686
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:22,204
Rosie, that's dangerous.

687
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:24,562
Come down.

688
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:30,717
I'm going to jump.
I'll fall down and die.

689
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,118
Okay, l'll come and get you.
Don't move.

690
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:42,955
Wait.

691
01:19:46,887 --> 01:19:50,084
Rosie, stay where you are.
It’s dangerous.

692
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:01,719
Don't touch me.
- Come on down. Now.

693
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:03,522
Come on.

694
01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:09,757
Don't touch me.
-Wait.

695
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:11,883
No!
- Give me your hand.

696
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:16,083
I'm going to fall!
- No, you won't fall.

697
01:20:16,607 --> 01:20:17,835
I'm going to fall!

698
01:20:27,007 --> 01:20:29,760
Michel? Did you break anything?

699
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:32,960
Michel?

700
01:20:37,847 --> 01:20:42,967
Jimi, help me. What am I to do.
Help me, please.

701
01:20:44,687 --> 01:20:47,997
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

702
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:51,159
Leave him be.

703
01:20:53,887 --> 01:20:56,606
He deserved it.
Let him die.

704
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,523
Just leave him be.

705
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:21,406
Okay?

706
01:22:30,207 --> 01:22:32,038
Shall I go home with you?

707
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:36,803
Later.
Let's wait a while.

708
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:49,965
Sleep for a bit.

709
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:02,679
You can close your eyes.
I stay here...

710
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,000
Sleep...

711
01:23:29,887 --> 01:23:31,878
ls it a love letter?

712
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:36,599
To Jimi?

713
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:42,156
Is he handsome?
- Really handsome.

714
01:23:44,407 --> 01:23:48,002
Do you have a photo ofhim?
- Do you want to see it?

715
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:55,206
Handsome, isn't he?

716
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:04,644
But he plays...
He plays with 'The Police'.

717
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:15,797
Idiot, he's the guitarist
for'The Police'.

718
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:18,245
You're strange.

719
01:25:23,687 --> 01:25:27,885
Hug me, please.
Hug me tight.

720
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:29,924
My baby.

721
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:34,123
What's wrong?

722
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:39,645
Nothing. I just wanted to take a walk
with you. The two of us in the sun.

723
01:25:43,727 --> 01:25:47,083
It’s going to be a nice day.
Nice weather.

724
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:55,085
Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

725
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:02,879
The good ones win,
the bad die...

726
01:26:03,047 --> 01:26:06,164
...the good ones win,
the bad die...

727
01:26:06,447 --> 01:26:09,405
...the good ones win,
the bad die...

728
01:26:09,727 --> 01:26:11,957
...the good ones win, the bad...

729
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,044
...die.

730
01:26:16,247 --> 01:26:17,236
Help me.

731
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:22,841
Help me, please.

732
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:27,886
I'm your father.

733
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:33,317
Worthless.
But I'm your father.

734
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:36,804
Yes, good.
But die soon now...

735
01:26:39,647 --> 01:26:41,205
...and hurry up.

736
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:02,725
Rosie!

737
01:27:08,767 --> 01:27:09,756
Michel?

738
01:27:16,767 --> 01:27:18,758
Michel, what happened?

739
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:20,243
Michel?

740
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:24,685
Fly. Take off. Soar.
Fly. Take off. Soar.

741
01:27:25,207 --> 01:27:30,804
Fly. Take off. Soar.
Fly. Take off. Soar.

742
01:27:42,407 --> 01:27:45,922
Go away. What are you doing here?
There's nothing to see.

743
01:27:48,527 --> 01:27:50,483
Why didn't you leave him there?

744
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,084
He was fine there.

745
01:27:58,327 --> 01:28:00,795
I did it for you, Mummy.

746
01:28:04,767 --> 01:28:06,359
You're not glad?

747
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:29,560
He's here. Jimi's here.
He came to get me.

748
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:39,325
Rosie, until Sunday before 8.

749
01:29:23,847 --> 01:29:27,237
I knew you'd come.
You're my friend.

750
01:29:27,407 --> 01:29:31,958
The only one I have.
You'll never let me down.
