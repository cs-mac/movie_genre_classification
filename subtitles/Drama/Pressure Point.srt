00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:10,485
I told you two months ago. I told
you I was finished with this case.

3
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:14,063
I meant it then, and I
mean it now! I'm finished!

4
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:18,498
Come in, doctor. Come in, come
in, come in, come in, come in.

5
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,770
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,206
But I'm off the case.

7
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,945
And I don't want to argue about it.

8
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:32,446
I've heard everything you had to
say. I don't wanna talk about it.

9
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:35,916
- I just wanna tell you that I'm finished.
- What happened now?

10
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,919
- Nothing's happened.
- Obviously something has.

11
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,255
<i>Nothing's happened now that hasn't
been happening for the past 71/2 months.</i>

12
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm not sure why I'm so calm
this morning, but at any rate...

13
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,564
If I go on with this kid, he's
gonna have me running up walls.

14
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,296
I tell you, time and time and time again...

15
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,203
...I bring him to the point where I
think I can do something with him...

16
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,844
...and every single time
I run into this hatred.

17
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,775
Now, the boy hates me.

18
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,643
You don't understand how deeply he hates.

19
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,985
I understand. That's his problem.

20
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:13,385
Oh, I know it's his problem.
Believe me. I know that.

21
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:17,221
But you've got 14 psychiatrists on
this staff, and two are Negroes...

22
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,660
...and one of them should be down
there with that boy and not me.

23
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:23,164
The boy is 13 years old.

24
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,098
His mother was a prostitute
who brought home white men.

25
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,297
His father was hanged by white men for
killing a white man his mom brought home.

26
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,170
God only knows I respect you.

27
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,835
And I respect your experience.
But, doctor, in this case...

28
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,573
...your reasoning is wrong. Dead wrong.

29
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,618
It's not wrong. I spoke
with the patient last week.

30
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:46,279
In my judgment, it is essential,
having undertaken this case...

31
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:49,324
...that you see it through.
- Don't you think I know that?

32
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:53,294
<i>What do you think has been keeping me
going on this case for 71/2 months...</i>

33
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,329
...without getting anywhere?!
- Easy.

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,939
But this boy's got me over
a barrel in a way that...

36
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:03,971
I don't eat.

37
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:08,602
I just don't eat. And I don't remember
the last time I've been able to sleep.

38
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,010
And I feel like hell. I...

39
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:15,209
You have a job to do. I never heard
anyone describe it as an easy one.

40
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:19,152
No! No, if failing with that boy
means that I've failed on this job...

41
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:22,258
...then I've failed. But
you're taking me off as of now.

42
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:25,328
And suppose I don't remove you from the case?

43
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,431
Well, then, I'm through. And I mean that.

44
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,033
And I don't care.

45
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:40,802
You're really serious, aren't you?

46
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,344
I'm sorry, doctor, that
I've gotten excited...

47
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,210
...but I just can't handle it.

48
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:48,447
I'm serious.

49
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:54,056
I thought for quite a while about
putting Smith or Harris on this case...

50
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:58,093
...because they are Negroes,
but I didn't for just one reason:

51
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:01,231
I have more confidence in you
than in either one of them.

52
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,699
They're good, but they're
not quite as good as you are.

53
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:09,998
And I do understand how you feel.

54
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,766
I do understand how you feel.

55
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,971
I quit my job one time...

56
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:21,050
...and it was the first
really good job I ever had.

57
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,053
Prison psychiatrist in
a federal penitentiary.

58
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,367
Sit down.

59
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:51,915
<i>The case that had me over
a barrel came in in 1942.</i>

60
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:56,517
<i>Twenty-nine years old, Caucasian...</i>

61
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,316
<i>...and sentenced to three years for sedition.</i>

62
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,086
Okay, whatever you say,
doc. See you tomorrow.

63
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:11,793
<i>I was working on 40 or 50 cases at
the time, and it was 20 years ago.</i>

64
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,596
<i>- All right.
- But I remember.</i>

65
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:18,435
<i>I remember the time he
walked into my office...</i>

66
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,009
<i>...as if it were yesterday.</i>

67
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,318
Sit down.

68
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,495
No, on second thought, keep laughing.

69
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,157
Just stand there and keep laughing.

70
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:01,380
They told me you don't
like answering questions.

71
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,946
You got a job to do. Go ahead and do it.

72
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:09,416
- Exactly what do you think my job is?
- What do you think I think?

73
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,688
I'm not insane, if that's
what you're trying to find out.

74
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:16,663
According to this information you've
done some mighty strange things.

75
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,667
That's your opinion.

76
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:22,703
Do you really believe all those
things you've been doing and saying?

77
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,239
You really do, don't you?

78
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,174
Enough to go to jail for it.

79
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,645
If a man won't take some risk
for what he believes in...

80
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,342
...either his opinions are
no good or he's no good.

81
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,248
Which is it with you?

82
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:43,255
Look, let's not get personal.
Are you a doctor, or aren't you?

83
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,661
- My job is to find out exactly...
- I don't care what your job is.

84
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,596
- I don't even care what you think.
- Why not?

85
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,826
Because you're a Negro.

86
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,168
So finish asking your questions
and let me get out of here.

87
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,144
You can go anytime you like.

88
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:06,716
But before you go...

89
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,988
...tell me, what have you
got against us Negroes?

90
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,716
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

91
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,591
What do you got against us whites?

92
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,507
There's your answer.

93
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:38,106
Now that Jews put that cripple in the White
House, you people think you got it made.

94
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,550
I suppose so.

95
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,187
Okay.

96
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,424
You got me in here. There's
nothing I can do about that.

97
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:55,759
You can ask me all the questions you want,
you can even write down that I'm crazy.

98
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,595
But you can't keep me in here forever.

99
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,574
I don't know about that. Shouldn't be
too difficult to get you committed...

100
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:10,544
...when your sentence expires.
After all, I've got it made.

101
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,513
And since they've got that
cripple in the White House...

102
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,346
...should be easy to get
a couple of my colleagues...

103
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,012
...a couple of Jew psychiatrists,
to certify you insane.

104
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,801
You're trying to needle me, huh?

105
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:37,238
Just trying to get to know you.

106
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:42,737
Tell me, do you really feel what you believe?

107
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:45,108
- What do you mean?
- Well...

108
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:49,651
...what you say about the
government and Jews and Negroes.

109
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,087
Most of it.

110
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,422
And the rest?

111
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,420
Politics.

112
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:02,589
And you really expect to win like
that? Look what it's gotten you so far.

113
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:07,195
Oh, that was a predictable setback,
I'd say. After all, Hitler had his.

114
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,430
<i>He wrote Mein Kampf in prison, you know.</i>

115
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,910
Do you intend to write your memoirs?

116
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:19,304
Maybe.

117
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,008
What do you expect to do when you get out?

118
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,113
Same thing I did before.

119
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,517
Advocate the violent
overthrow of the government.

120
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:32,729
Not necessarily violent.

121
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:35,525
It'll depend on the American people.

122
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:40,934
In the meantime, I plan to read
and prepare myself for the future.

123
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:43,869
I understand you have a
marvelous library here.

124
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:49,003
<i>I was somewhat ashamed of the way I
had conducted that first interview.</i>

125
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,007
<i>I certainly did not feel
I had been objective.</i>

126
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,708
<i>I had to admit to myself
that I was disappointed...</i>

127
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:58,150
<i>...when I found that he was to
be confined for a short time.</i>

128
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,014
<i>For everything about the man,
everything he believed and stood for...</i>

129
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,957
<i>...alienated me, repelled me.</i>

130
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,394
<i>Curious, I thought, how detached
and even tolerant I could be...</i>

131
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:12,195
<i>...with the murderers and thieves
I treated every day. But with him...</i>

132
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,132
Well, any more questions?

133
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,472
Oh, I see. You're studying me.

134
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:22,305
Well, go ahead. How about a closer look?

135
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,979
You want me to take my clothes off?

136
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,846
<i>More on the basis of his
history than the interview...</i>

137
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,385
<i>...I decided he was a
psychopathic personality.</i>

138
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,955
<i>He was paranoid, aggressive, antisocial.</i>

139
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:37,457
<i>And because he was a leader type,
he might become a focal point...</i>

140
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:41,428
<i>...for the impressionable inmates. I
recommended that he be quartered alone...</i>

141
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:45,467
<i>...under maximum security precautions
to prevent him from spreading his ideas.</i>

142
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:01,970
Okay, let's have it. 'Round and 'round we go.

143
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:23,920
Let him go! Let him go. I'll give
you a good reason for not liking Jews.

144
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,561
Break it up! Break it up!

145
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,425
- Break it up!
- What happened?

146
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,002
This big man's been picking
on this little man...

147
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:38,107
- Who started it?!
- I did! And don't you forget that, big man!

148
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,174
He's been making trouble since he got here.

149
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:49,183
I'm not surprised. I just had a brief
talk with him, and that was enough.

150
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,184
How would you like a longer talk?

151
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:54,221
I wouldn't. I don't think I
could be of help right now.

152
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,585
<i>Why not?</i>

153
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,196
There's little I can do without cooperation,
and he didn't seem very cooperative to me.

154
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,197
- What do you expect us to do with him?
- I don't know.

155
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,231
Look, let's just wait a
while and see what happens.

156
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,928
But if there's more trouble,
you're stuck with him.

157
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:11,438
<i>- How's that?
- Thanks a lot.</i>

158
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:15,237
That's the spirit. Keep
smiling, I always say.

159
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,778
Yeah, well, whatever you always say.

160
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,950
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

161
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,248
Where were we?

162
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,850
There doesn't seem to be
anything physically wrong.

163
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,962
I can't sleep. For the past week I've...

164
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,223
Keep breathing deeply.

165
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,834
Can't you give me some sleeping pills?

166
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,905
Not unless I find some reason for it.

167
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,003
All right, you can put your shirt back on.

168
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,317
What am I gonna do, then?

169
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:05,986
If you can't sleep, there must
be some reason for it. Right?

170
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,495
I suppose so.

171
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,695
Well, that's what we're going to find out.

172
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,931
Take your time.

173
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:22,941
What can I do for you?

174
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,411
I didn't ask to come here,
so let's not play any games.

175
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,642
Your answers are probably on those cards.

176
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,915
What I've learned from this is that there's
nothing organically wrong with you...

177
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,059
...that you have occasional
blackout spells...

178
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:38,820
...and that you find it
difficult to fall asleep.

179
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:42,625
That's enough, isn't it? What's
that "what can I do for you" routine?

180
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,892
I didn't ask you what was wrong with you.

181
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:49,061
I wanted to know if you thought I could
help you, if you'd let me help you.

182
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:54,401
Help me, huh? Look who's
calling the kettle black.

183
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,375
Who ever heard of a Negro
psychiatrist, anyway?

184
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,176
Don't you people have enough troubles?

185
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,709
Boy, you must be a real masochist.

186
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,218
Why can't a Negro be a psychiatrist?

187
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,484
He can. Yeah, he can.

188
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,357
But where is he gonna get his patients
outside of a federal penitentiary?

189
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,466
Psychiatry is an expensive thing, and
your people can't afford it, you know.

190
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:22,094
So the best you can be is a prison
psychiatrist in the worst office they've got.

191
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:23,864
You want to help me?

192
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:27,841
- Why don't you just help yourself.
- What do you mean?

193
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,470
This isn't the place for you.

194
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:34,811
All you people are trying
to be white and respectable.

195
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,716
Want to be doctors, psychiatrists.

196
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,219
Why don't you wise up?

197
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,283
How would I do that?

198
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,127
Go back to Africa.

199
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,761
- What about those blackout spells?
- What about them?

200
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,302
- Can you describe them?
- I just wanna sleep.

201
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,133
Can't you give me some pill?

202
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:01,107
You were sent to me because the
physicians don't think you need medicine.

203
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,274
Really?

204
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,971
What do they think you can do?

205
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:07,582
That depends on how willing
you are to cooperate.

206
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:12,085
When I ask you something, I don't do it
to pry. I need the information to help you.

207
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:15,157
Thank you. Thank you. I
know what psychiatry is.

208
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,590
Then you should let me try to help you sleep.

209
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,703
Okay, doctor...

210
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:35,436
...you go ahead and you make me sleep.

211
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,917
Can you describe those blackout spells?

212
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,612
- I suppose I can try.
- Well, try.

213
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,725
Well, at first, I get a
little sick to my stomach.

214
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:57,828
Then I feel like something's coming
down at me, and I can't breathe or see.

215
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,593
- Then it's over.
- What?

216
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,432
What is that "something"?

217
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,874
I don't know.

218
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:11,446
- Do you have nightmares when you sleep?
- Look, I just wanna sleep.

219
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,175
During these spells, do
you feel like you'll fall?

220
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,945
- No.
- Have you ever fainted in your life?

221
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,653
- Once.
- When?

222
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,983
When I was a kid.

223
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:30,865
Oh, no. I ain't answering
none of your spooky questions.

224
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,351
Hold your head down. Down.

225
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:22,113
Do you feel unusually
good or unusually bad...

226
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,685
...a day or so before an attack?

227
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:28,888
During an attack, do you feel
strange sensations in your body...

228
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,493
...accompanied by flashes
of light or color...

229
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,590
...with strange sounds?

230
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,225
Do you feel your legs and body stiffen?

231
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:42,596
Do you feel as if your breathing has stopped?

232
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,433
You see, I had the same thing once.

233
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,610
Can you help me?

234
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:02,083
I don't know. I'll have
to know more about you.

235
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:16,402
<i>After several extremely slow and
difficult months of analysis...</i>

236
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:18,837
<i>...there finally came a knowledge...</i>

237
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,909
<i>...a beginning.</i>

238
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,174
<i>He was an only child.</i>

239
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:28,476
<i>And his conception, he soon
found out, was the only cause...</i>

240
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:31,348
<i>...for the sudden and bitter
marriage that followed.</i>

241
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,352
<i>His father was a butcher.</i>

242
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:39,120
<i>He was quick to anger and hard to please.</i>

243
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,366
<i>His vigor, it seemed, was
constantly replenished by drink...</i>

244
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:52,838
<i>...and by a vengeful resentment
he felt toward his son.</i>

245
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,445
I wouldn't cry.

246
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,813
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

247
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,920
Why not?

248
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,022
Because I didn't wanna be like her.

249
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:46,154
<i>His mother was a weak and sickly woman.</i>

250
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:50,663
<i>Soon after the birth of her son, unable to
take the strain of her husband's abuse...</i>

251
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:53,428
<i>...she began to spend
most of her time in bed...</i>

252
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:57,539
<i>...from where she would fill the
house with her groans and complaints.</i>

253
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:15,481
<i>As far back as he could remember,
he had reluctantly been...</i>

254
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,150
<i>...the sole object of her affections.</i>

255
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:20,256
<i>How long is this gonna take?</i>

256
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,962
I just wanna sleep. All I wanna do is sleep.

257
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,500
You may leave anytime you like.

258
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:33,069
<i>Within a few years after his parents moved
into a new middle-class neighborhood...</i>

259
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,837
<i>...He had learned to play by himself.</i>

260
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:39,413
<i>The neighborhood mothers cautioned
their kids not to play with him.</i>

261
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:44,145
<i>And he, in turn, as a defense, pretended
that his loneliness was something special...</i>

262
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:47,449
<i>...and of his own making. It wasn't.</i>

263
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:50,616
<i>It was due to his father,
who had by then become...</i>

264
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:52,921
<i>...something of a legend in the district.</i>

265
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:57,055
<i>His drunken ritual was known to all
who were within hearing distance...</i>

266
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,530
<i>...as he came home late.</i>

267
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:01,569
<i>Singing raucously and swearing obscenities.</i>

268
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,603
What's the matter?!

269
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,638
Just made the butcher mad!

270
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,111
Do you hear me?!

271
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:14,648
Can you hear me?!

272
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,715
Oh, stop! Please, stop!

273
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:28,347
"Stop it! Stop it!" What's the matter?

274
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:32,052
Can't you stand a little fun?

275
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,722
<i>I always seemed to know what to do.</i>

276
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:39,189
<i>But the funny part of it was...</i>

277
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:41,956
<i>...I never really felt sorry for her.</i>

278
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:45,965
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

279
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:49,128
- Don't you feel sorry for weak people?
- Guess I don't.

280
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:52,172
- Why not?
- Why should I?

281
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,742
They're the first ones to resent pity anyway.

282
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:58,547
As a matter of fact, I admire
a weak man who competes.

283
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:01,240
A weak man who competes becomes a strong man.

284
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:05,380
Stronger, in fact, because he has
to overcome all the odds against him.

285
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:08,683
- Do you really believe that?
- Don't you?

286
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:11,418
That's a funny question coming from a Negro.

287
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:14,456
Why do you say that?

288
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:18,260
Do you think of Negroes as weak
men competing against all odds?

289
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:22,666
Well, do you?

290
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,208
- I don't think of them as inferior.
- You don't?

291
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,504
Not where they belong. Not in Africa.

292
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,206
I see. But here you think they are inferior.

293
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,574
- That's right.
- But you admire them...

294
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:39,517
...for competing. You just said so.

295
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:43,849
Okay, if you wanna look at it that way, yes.

296
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:47,224
I suppose you feel the same way about Jews.

297
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,825
- Yeah, in a more subtle way.
- What do you mean?

298
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:53,193
Well, they're more dangerous.

299
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,166
Why?

300
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,299
Because they pass for
white and they're smarter.

301
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:08,579
You used the word "dangerous. ' '

302
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:10,981
Exactly what is endangered?

303
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:16,321
The purity of the white Christian stock.

304
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:23,431
Tell me, when you were a child...

305
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,365
...did you know any Negroes or Jews?

306
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,872
Well, I didn't know any
Negroes. I'm sure of that.

307
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:35,636
I'm not so sure about the Jews, though.

308
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:39,339
But I didn't have many friends
when I was a kid, anyway.

309
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,943
Didn't you have any friends?

310
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,454
Sure I did.

311
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:56,922
<i>Cut off from ordinary social contacts and
forced in upon himself at an early age...</i>

312
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,036
<i>...he subsequently developed
an imaginary playmate.</i>

313
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:07,068
<i>With this creature of his own
making, he strove to achieve...</i>

314
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:10,406
<i>...some of the satisfactions
which were denied him in reality.</i>

315
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:16,519
<i>Satisfactions that weren't always
proper, yet sharply revealing.</i>

316
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:27,295
Clean my shoes.

317
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:36,505
Clean my shoes!

318
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:44,001
I said, clean my shoes!

319
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:54,184
Let's play.

320
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,253
One, two, three!

321
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:16,809
Are you my friend?

322
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:39,966
You gonna listen to me?

323
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,232
No matter what I tell you to
do, are you gonna listen to me?

324
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:50,540
More than your father?

325
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:56,315
If I tell you something and your father
does too, who will you listen to first?

326
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,012
I don't believe you, you're lying!

327
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:18,297
Come here.

328
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:25,671
Come over here by me.

329
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:28,743
Right here.

330
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:07,483
<i>Soon after he began
school, his playmate died.</i>

331
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:10,926
<i>Not all at once, of course,
but slowly dissolving...</i>

332
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:15,087
<i>...into the fog of memory where
forgotten things disappear.</i>

333
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,667
<i>In school, he drew attention to himself
as a leader of daring recklessness...</i>

334
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:24,068
<i>...followed by new playmates
from the undisciplined element...</i>

335
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,371
<i>...to wage the small, anarchistic war he
conducted against the school authorities.</i>

336
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:38,381
<i>And yet, despite his attitude,
he progressed in his schoolwork.</i>

337
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:42,046
<i>He had an alert and facile mind,
nourished by a surprising gift...</i>

338
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:46,252
<i>...for immediate concentration. And,
had his conduct been closer to average...</i>

339
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,559
<i>...he probably would have been
his school's prize scholar.</i>

340
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:58,333
"It just dropped out of my
hands. I shouldn't have gotten up.

341
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,767
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

342
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,107
<i>Help me back. "</i>

343
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:15,953
<i>I'd help her, then she'd start
in again with her complaints.</i>

344
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,218
<i>"I'm shivering, I'm really cold.</i>

345
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,958
<i>It isn't cold in here, is
it? Why do I feel so cold?"</i>

346
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:27,159
<i>I wouldn't answer her most of the time.</i>

347
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,097
I wanna go pick up the cherries.

348
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:33,834
<i>But she'd wanna... "Kiss me first.</i>

349
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:39,704
<i>You're the only one.</i>

350
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:42,083
<i>The only one. "</i>

351
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,387
<i>Then, of course, she'd
have it again, her "cramp. "</i>

352
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,928
<i>Always the "same place. "</i>

353
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,964
<i>And she'd start to beg again. "Please.</i>

354
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:01,695
<i>Please help me. Please?</i>

355
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:20,049
<i>Oh, yes. That's it. "</i>

356
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:24,489
<i>And then it would be all
right. "That's better.</i>

357
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:30,364
<i>You're such a strong little boy.
And you have such strong hands. "</i>

358
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,933
<i>And she'd go on and on.</i>

359
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,004
<i>"I don't know how you do it.</i>

360
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,470
<i>Yes.</i>

361
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,039
<i>You're the only one. "</i>

362
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,681
<i>The only one.</i>

363
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:50,018
<i>The only one.</i>

364
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:54,282
<i>Eventually, he began to spend most
of his time in vengeful daydreaming.</i>

365
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:58,052
<i>Out of voracious and romantic reading,
he constructed gory fantasies...</i>

366
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,752
<i>...in which he got even with everybody.</i>

367
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:13,464
<i>His favorite daydream was the one in which
he fancied himself an Eastern potentate.</i>

368
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:47,104
<i>In this particular fantasy, two
features are most interesting/</i>

369
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:50,177
<i>First, it set the pattern
for his sexual life...</i>

370
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:54,149
<i>...through the aggressiveness with
which he fulfilled his desires...</i>

371
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:57,946
<i>...and imposed his will on others,
irrespective of their wishes.</i>

372
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:03,786
<i>The second was paradoxical, for in reality
he could not stand the sight of blood...</i>

373
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,120
<i>...with which his fantasies were filled.</i>

374
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,287
<i>It meant his father and his father's trade.</i>

375
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:13,902
<i>During vacations, he sometimes
would have to help out in the shop...</i>

376
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,166
<i>...where he was put in charge of the
cash register, since he was dexterous...</i>

377
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,536
<i>...and quick with figures.</i>

378
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,409
<i>But he was filled with apprehension if
he had to touch or even look at the meat.</i>

379
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:29,574
<i>And to watch his father prepare it
was literally unbearable for him.</i>

380
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,653
<i>His father would occasionally
taunt him about it...</i>

381
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:35,347
<i>...until, on a particularly busy day...</i>

382
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:39,323
<i>...he asked him to cut up a piece of liver.</i>

383
00:37:40,189 --> 00:37:46,651
<i>By the time he was 15, he had
left home, never to return again.</i>

384
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:54,259
I didn't say goodbye. I didn't take any
clothes, except for what I was wearing.

385
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,234
Just took off.

386
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:58,373
Where did you go?

387
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,873
Here, there, everywhere, I guess.

388
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:04,240
Just roamed around working
at all sorts of odd jobs.

389
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:06,677
Anything I could get, I took.

390
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:14,815
- Sounds pretty rough for a boy that age.
- Believe me, it was.

391
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,289
Some of the things I had to
do weren't fit for a white man.

392
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:23,024
- Sorry, what I meant to say was that...
- It's all right, go on.

393
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,200
Look, I said I was sorry.

394
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,036
What do you expect me to do, smile?
Let's not make a thing out of it.

395
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,470
You can appreciate that I apologized.

396
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:38,971
I do, I do. But you make it
sound like an achievement.

397
00:38:39,348 --> 00:38:40,542
It is for me.

398
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:44,014
Look, you wanna go on with this?

399
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,551
Sure.

400
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:51,249
Why not? It's a great pastime.

401
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:59,992
It is obvious you think I'm
hypersensitive about my color.

402
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:04,266
It is also obvious you
think you can hurt me by it.

403
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,839
Let me fill you in. I'm a
doctor. I'm here to help you.

404
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:12,344
You want help, fine. You
don't want help, take off.

405
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,845
Those are the rules. You
take them or leave them.

406
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:27,886
All right.

407
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,634
Now, where were we?

408
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:45,680
I've worked with guys who were sadistic
killers who were more human than this guy.

409
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:49,909
- Now, take it easy.
- You can afford to be objective.

410
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:53,111
It's easy to become personally
involved in a case like this.

411
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,951
That's right, that's why I
say I shouldn't handle it.

412
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,685
Believe me, I have tried to be objective.

413
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,056
I don't think you have.

414
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,994
For instance, you can't take his needling,
although it's one of his symptoms.

415
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:14,171
Maybe I just can't handle it.

416
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:22,207
Look, ever since you've started
here, you've proved me right.

417
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:27,449
I grant you, I felt I was fighting a
noble cause when I insisted on hiring you.

418
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:30,858
You were a good man.

419
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:32,994
You had a good record.

420
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:35,794
I liked the way you spoke.

421
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:38,627
But underneath I wasn't so sure.

422
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:44,065
Apart from taking the responsibility
of giving the job to a Negro...

423
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,198
...I couldn't dismiss the possibility
that I could've been wrong.

424
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,775
That you might not live
up to my expectations...

425
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,980
...which could've been
unpleasant for both of us.

426
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,248
But you did.

427
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,588
Not only did you justify my
expectations, but you surpassed them.

428
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:07,720
Yes, you did. The staff feels the same way.

429
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,403
Now, don't tell me you're
going to let me down.

430
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,474
<i>"Just because you're a
Negro" is what he didn't say.</i>

431
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:25,213
Just before the Depression...

432
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:28,782
...I got a job as a hod carrier
with a traveling construction crew.

433
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:33,081
It was rough, but it was
the best job I ever had.

434
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,450
- How old were you then?
- Old enough.

435
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:41,892
But none of them knew how young I
really was. They just knew I was smarter.

436
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:46,125
After a while, they started listening to
me, and eventually they even obeyed me.

437
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:49,033
We were a hell of a crew.

438
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:53,436
We had some fights, yeah, but sometimes
some very funny things happened.

439
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,577
Like what?

440
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:57,837
Oh, funny things.

441
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:02,675
- Do you know what tic-tac-toe
is? - It's a game, isn't it?

442
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:06,082
- Did you ever play it?
- When I was a kid.

443
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:08,052
We played it once.

444
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:09,485
But I mean really played.

445
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:12,460
What do you mean, "really" played it?

446
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:15,222
Well, you'd have to understand how it was.

447
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:20,164
We'd been in this one town for two weeks,
and this particular night was our last night.

448
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:24,669
Anyway, we were working until our backs
were broken and our arms were falling off.

449
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,948
<i>It was a crummy little speakeasy outside
a nothing town full of nothing people.</i>

450
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,142
<i>It was run by a little guy and his wife.</i>

451
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,686
<i>He said it was his wife, but she
was making more money than he was.</i>

452
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:43,848
<i>They were nothing. You know
what I mean, nothing people.</i>

453
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,455
<i>Anyway, we started drinking early,
knowing we'd never see the place again.</i>

454
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:55,961
Hey, quit that. That's a bar.

455
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,699
Here, you wanna play?
I'll give you some paper.

456
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:15,280
Come on, play with me.

457
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:20,587
You're getting soft.

458
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:23,697
What you need is some exercise.

459
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:27,358
That's it, I'm gonna give
everybody some exercises.

460
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,898
I'm gonna give your husband some exercises.

461
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:37,345
You wanna play, Pete?

462
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:44,181
Are you crazy? You're ruining that
bar. You know how much that bar cost me?

463
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,854
You just stand there and be quiet
and make sure Pete don't cheat.

464
00:43:49,024 --> 00:43:51,219
You're the umpire.

465
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:53,988
And you...

466
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:56,828
...you're the umpire's wife.

467
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:21,785
Are you crazy? What are you gonna do?

468
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:29,294
I'm gonna play
tic-tac-toe.

469
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:54,246
It's your turn.

470
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:58,423
It's your turn.

471
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:00,757
It's your turn.

472
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:02,521
It's your turn.

473
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:03,858
It's your turn.

474
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:44,604
Can't play in here
anymore. Ain't no more room.

475
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:46,870
- Hey, let's go outside.
- Yeah.

476
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:50,534
- Lots of room to play outside.
- That's a good idea.

477
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:56,207
- Come on. Everybody outside, everybody.
- Sounds like a good idea.

478
00:45:56,385 --> 00:46:00,344
- Lots of room out here.
- Yeah, let's go.

479
00:46:01,456 --> 00:46:04,892
You'll pay for this. I swear
to God, you'll pay for this.

480
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,234
Come here. I'm gonna tell
you what I want you to do.

481
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:24,572
I want you to go behind that bar...

482
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:27,681
...and lie down and go to sleep.

483
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,908
Don't make a sound.

484
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:44,761
Close your eyes.

485
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:48,664
Everybody closes his eyes
when he goes to sleep.

486
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:59,280
And you can thank your smart
lady for my being so nice.

487
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,289
Turn around a minute.

488
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:52,056
<i>In all those many months...</i>

489
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:56,320
<i>...there'd been times when I was
uneasy, times when I was repelled...</i>

490
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:59,695
<i>...but that was the point
at which I became frightened.</i>

491
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:06,273
<i>And the really frightening thing was that
I wasn't sure just what I was frightened of.</i>

492
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:13,971
We tic-tac-toed
everything.

493
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,696
Have you ever had a girl?

494
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,663
Are you kidding?

495
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:37,430
- I mean a steady girl.
- Not for long.

496
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:42,668
What I mean is, have you ever had
a meaningful emotional experience...

497
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:46,177
...with a woman that
wasn't entirely physical?

498
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:53,446
- Yeah, once, kind of.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

499
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:56,352
Around the time of the
Depression, I met someone.

500
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:59,592
- Were you working then?
- No.

501
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:02,821
No, the whole crew had to
break up. There was no work.

502
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,761
No construction, no nothing.

503
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,595
Anyway, I wound up in the city...

504
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:09,703
...and that was no improvement.

505
00:50:10,772 --> 00:50:12,899
How'd you manage there?

506
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,070
Guess.

507
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:19,476
<i>- Not selling apples?
- Yeah, I was selling, all right.</i>

508
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,617
<i>But they weren't buying. Not much, anyway.</i>

509
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:25,651
<i>- What about the girl?
- That's where I met her.</i>

510
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,483
<i>- Right there in the street?
- Yeah.</i>

511
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:31,420
<i>She wanted some apples.</i>

512
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,926
<i>But, you know, I think she felt
sorry for me or something...</i>

513
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:44,068
<i>...because after I filled up
one bag, she asked for another.</i>

514
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,505
<i>And then another.</i>

515
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:51,578
<i>She bought all I had, just
like that, without hesitation.</i>

516
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:55,907
<i>I didn't have a large bag, so I had to
put the whole thing in four smaller ones.</i>

517
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:59,485
<i>She was awful nice, very polite.</i>

518
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:04,222
<i>It looked like she was gonna need
some help, so I offered her some.</i>

519
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:13,526
<i>She didn't live very far.</i>

520
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:21,699
<i>On the way, we talked about apples and
how good they are for you and all that.</i>

521
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:27,848
<i>She seemed really interested
in what I was talking about.</i>

522
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:30,883
<i>As if everything I said
was something important.</i>

523
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:34,413
<i>And, you know, I even made her laugh.</i>

524
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:41,295
<i>Suddenly we were there,
in front of her house.</i>

525
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,096
<i>I carried the apples in for her.</i>

526
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:49,035
<i>It was one of those brownstones, you know.</i>

527
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:52,071
<i>But this one was all clean and painted white.</i>

528
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:06,580
<i>Her father was in the living room.</i>

529
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:09,189
<i>She introduced me from the hallway.</i>

530
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:15,890
<i>And then she asked me to wait while
she took the apples into the kitchen.</i>

531
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:29,168
<i>I just stood there looking
around, enjoying the warmth.</i>

532
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:36,279
<i>You should've seen the place.</i>

533
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:38,713
<i>Paintings.</i>

534
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:40,711
<i>Chandeliers.</i>

535
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:43,289
<i>Carved wood furnishings.</i>

536
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:48,092
<i>It looked just like a picture out
of one of those high-class magazines.</i>

537
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:52,298
<i>You'd never know there
was a depression outside.</i>

538
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:56,900
<i>Anyway, she came back from the
kitchen looking into her bag.</i>

539
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:02,236
<i>I suddenly realized she asked me to
wait because she wanted to tip me.</i>

540
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,945
<i>I just couldn't take it.</i>

541
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:13,277
<i>I'd never met anybody that kind before.</i>

542
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:16,484
<i>Or since.</i>

543
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:22,223
<i>The next day was freezing, and the man
selling roasted chestnuts was in business.</i>

544
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:26,295
<i>Suddenly I saw her in the
small crowd surrounding him.</i>

545
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:28,902
<i>She'd just bought a large
cone when she saw me.</i>

546
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,561
<i>She saw me and smiled.</i>

547
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,903
<i>She didn't just smile, she came
over and offered me some chestnuts.</i>

548
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,938
<i>We just stood there behind my apples,
eating chestnuts and smiling...</i>

549
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:43,880
<i>...looking at each other.</i>

550
00:53:46,888 --> 00:53:50,016
<i>All of a sudden, she saw
something across the street.</i>

551
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:53,319
<i>It was her father. He
must have been passing by.</i>

552
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:57,498
<i>He sure looked mad. He called
out to her, but she didn't move.</i>

553
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,690
<i>She stood right by my side.</i>

554
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:03,429
<i>Her father then turned and walked
away, furious, down the street.</i>

555
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:06,300
<i>She didn't seem to care.</i>

556
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:08,772
<i>She kept on looking right into my eyes.</i>

557
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:11,468
<i>But I mean right into them. And then...</i>

558
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:16,276
<i>...she simply asked me if I liked her.
I didn't know what to say. I just nodded.</i>

559
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:19,284
<i>She said if I would shave
and look as neat as I could...</i>

560
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:22,753
<i>...she'd be happy if I would
call on her that evening at 8/00.</i>

561
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:24,482
<i>That is, if I cared to.</i>

562
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,687
<i>I just couldn't believe it.</i>

563
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:33,794
<i>I wanted to thank her, but before I
realized it, she was gone down the street.</i>

564
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:44,800
<i>I couldn't understand why she would
be interested in a bum like me.</i>

565
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:47,777
<i>But I shaved, and I tried
to look as neat as I could.</i>

566
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:50,918
<i>And at 8 that evening, I
was knocking at her door.</i>

567
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,580
<i>I waited for some time.</i>

568
00:54:56,758 --> 00:54:57,918
He's very nice.

569
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:00,287
<i>And then I heard some voices arguing inside.</i>

570
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:02,930
- He's not a tramp!
- I tell you that he's a tramp.

571
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:05,531
- I can...
- He's not, and I'm going out with him!

572
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,224
<i>Suddenly the door opened.</i>

573
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:12,669
<i>Her father appeared between us and made
it clear that I wasn't good enough for her.</i>

574
00:55:13,475 --> 00:55:15,136
<i>Very clear.</i>

575
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:27,080
<i>When did you join the Nazi party?</i>

576
00:55:27,255 --> 00:55:29,985
<i>I never joined the Nazi party.</i>

577
00:55:30,158 --> 00:55:32,956
<i>Well, the Bund or whatever you call it.</i>

578
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:35,721
<i>It's called the German-American Bund.</i>

579
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:39,060
<i>Look, what does this have to do
with my being unable to sleep?</i>

580
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,157
<i>I don't know.</i>

581
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:44,271
Why? The Depression?

582
00:55:44,873 --> 00:55:46,465
For who?

583
00:55:46,774 --> 00:55:50,210
For the oppressed? For you? For me?

584
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:53,745
For millions of other good, white, Christian
- Americans? Yes.

585
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,314
But...

586
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:58,481
But is it depressing for everybody?

587
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:01,053
Is it depressing for them?

588
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,930
With their money, they feel
they're the chosen ones.

589
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:18,733
You can see it when they drive in their long
cars on their way to the international bank.

590
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:21,705
They think they're the
chosen ones, all right.

591
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,902
With their fat wives in fur coats.

592
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,637
Fur coats.

593
00:56:26,814 --> 00:56:29,408
Well, they have to keep warm, don't they?

594
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:31,415
It's been a cold winter.

595
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:34,077
They don't have to tell us that.

596
00:56:34,422 --> 00:56:36,617
What do they have to tell us?

597
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,089
What do they try to tell us?

598
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:43,085
They're trying to tell us to crucify him.

599
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:48,731
They're telling us to take
the nails and crucify him.

600
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:52,667
By the power and the glory,
haven't they done enough?

601
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,705
Crucify him?

602
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:56,904
Why?

603
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,604
Because they're afraid of him.

604
00:56:59,781 --> 00:57:01,715
They're afraid of us.

605
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:04,317
Crucify him?

606
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:05,975
I say salute him.

607
00:57:06,788 --> 00:57:08,517
Salute him!

608
00:57:09,157 --> 00:57:12,251
He's the one who'll save us
from those who own the banks...

609
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:14,418
...who own the newspapers...

610
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:16,928
...who own the White House.

611
00:57:17,932 --> 00:57:20,765
Because I am not one of the chosen...

612
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:25,235
...I say salute Adolf Hitler!

613
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:15,852
<i>At that point, I knew my primary concern
was not with the welfare of my patient...</i>

614
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:19,425
<i>...but with the question of
whether he was making any sense...</i>

615
00:58:19,594 --> 00:58:24,190
<i>...and how many people there were in
this world to whom he would make sense.</i>

616
00:58:24,832 --> 00:58:28,598
<i>For, although psychopaths are a small
minority, it seems significant...</i>

617
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:34,333
<i>...that whenever militant and organized
hate exists, a psychopath is the leader.</i>

618
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:38,878
<i>And if, for instance, 100 disgruntled
and frustrated individuals...</i>

619
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:41,106
<i>...fall in line behind one psychopath...</i>

620
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:47,744
<i>...then, in essence, we are concerned
with the actions of 101 psychopaths.</i>

621
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:53,287
Assuming that it has no direct
bearing on your problem...

622
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:58,161
...are you embarrassed talking
about your subversive activities?

623
00:59:00,763 --> 00:59:03,425
First, I've never done
anything I've been ashamed of.

624
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,125
Second, I've only done
what I believe was right.

625
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:08,733
That, in my book, can't be called subversive.

626
00:59:08,905 --> 00:59:12,773
It's a cause, just like any other.
I don't expect you to understand.

627
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,409
Being a Negro, you're biased.

628
00:59:14,577 --> 00:59:16,704
But you take the ordinary man...

629
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:19,109
...now, he's lost.

630
00:59:19,282 --> 00:59:21,944
He has no real leader. He wants a leader.

631
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:25,576
He wants a lot of things he doesn't
have and doesn't know how to get.

632
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:29,213
But most of all, he wants
an excuse to get them.

633
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:30,586
A cause.

634
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,822
And that's where you come in.

635
00:59:33,763 --> 00:59:35,492
No.

636
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:37,723
No, that's where you come in.

637
00:59:44,274 --> 00:59:47,801
No offense intended. You see, we need you.

638
00:59:48,645 --> 00:59:51,239
Where there's no definite
enemy, why, we create one.

639
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:54,247
People need one to blame things on.

640
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,187
So you see, you're the secret weapon.
You're the cause to unite against.

641
01:00:00,356 --> 01:00:04,292
You and the Jews, more than anybody
else, will be responsible for our triumph.

642
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:14,494
And just how do you intend
to bring about this triumph?

643
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:18,199
With people.

644
01:00:18,374 --> 01:00:20,467
<i>Take 10 people who believe in your cause.</i>

645
01:00:20,643 --> 01:00:24,079
<i>Five of those bring a
friend. Now there are 15.</i>

646
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:27,705
<i>They chip in, get a little hall,
do a little public speaking.</i>

647
01:00:32,255 --> 01:00:35,520
<i>Now, out of, say, 100 people,
20 come over and ask questions.</i>

648
01:00:35,692 --> 01:00:37,284
<i>Suddenly, you're 35.</i>

649
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,190
<i>Thirty-five
dues-paying people.</i>

650
01:00:40,363 --> 01:00:43,594
<i>Now those 35 dues-paying
people bring friends.</i>

651
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:46,997
<i>And their friends bring friends.
Some don't have any jobs...</i>

652
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,765
<i>...so you tell them why they don't
have jobs and their kids are hungry.</i>

653
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,909
<i>Then they bring their kids.
And their kids are beautiful.</i>

654
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:57,012
<i>And you love their kids, and
you hate those few who don't.</i>

655
01:00:57,213 --> 01:00:59,704
<i>Soon you create interest.
Interest draws people...</i>

656
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:03,943
<i>...people bring money, and money means
a little organization. There you are.</i>

657
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,281
<i>It gives you power.</i>

658
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:09,084
<i>And power creates fear.</i>

659
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,150
<i>Fear creates hate.</i>

660
01:01:12,328 --> 01:01:15,627
<i>And hate creates the enemy,
and the enemy fights back.</i>

661
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:21,062
<i>Fighting back creates more interest.</i>

662
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:24,468
Right here, ladies and gentlemen.
Right here. Get it right here.

663
01:01:26,442 --> 01:01:30,776
Believe me, if it wasn't for the
war, we'd be running things right now.

664
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:35,175
You make it sound so easy.

665
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,846
Go ahead and laugh.

666
01:01:41,023 --> 01:01:43,048
Laugh, and you won't hear us coming.

667
01:01:53,302 --> 01:01:56,237
<i>And you found many who
believed in your cause?</i>

668
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:59,269
<i>With the help of a syndicated
columnist, among others.</i>

669
01:01:59,442 --> 01:02:01,706
<i>He won us the support of industrialists...</i>

670
01:02:01,878 --> 01:02:05,974
<i>...ranging from Detroit manufacturers
to giant oil corporations.</i>

671
01:02:06,149 --> 01:02:09,380
<i>We even got some movie people
from Hollywood on our side.</i>

672
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:11,918
<i>Before you knew it, we
were buying radio time.</i>

673
01:02:15,558 --> 01:02:19,153
<i>We had camps teaching American
boys and girls of German descent...</i>

674
01:02:19,328 --> 01:02:20,886
<i>...the qualities of leadership.</i>

675
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,721
<i>We sent some of them to
Germany to get acquainted.</i>

676
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,664
<i>Mein Kampf was required
reading in every camp.</i>

677
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:31,863
<i>I thought it interesting that the man who
could not stand blood now screamed for it.</i>

678
01:03:32,034 --> 01:03:36,403
<i>Effective screams too, for his standards
of hate and glorification of the brutal...</i>

679
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:41,737
<i>...drew economic, social and
psychological frustrates by the score.</i>

680
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,137
I tell you, we're moving.
This thing is going.

681
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:18,740
Well, you're not moving anywhere
right now in particular, are you?

682
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:21,679
Are you kidding? So they stick me in here.

683
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:25,480
There were 18,000 people in Madison
Square Garden the night I told you about.

684
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:27,953
Okay, they grabbed 100
and threw them in jail.

685
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:31,560
What do you think the other
17,900 are doing right this minute?

686
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:34,992
And you think this thing can be
stopped? That we can be stopped?

687
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:37,860
- Yes.
- Well, how? How are you gonna stop us?

688
01:04:38,301 --> 01:04:40,030
Well, you're stopped, aren't you?

689
01:04:40,202 --> 01:04:42,636
At least temporarily.

690
01:04:42,805 --> 01:04:46,935
They will be stopped. Because everything
you're driving for is founded on a lie.

691
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,845
A lie, huh?

692
01:04:55,685 --> 01:04:57,778
Look, can you be objective for a minute?

693
01:04:57,954 --> 01:05:01,651
I know you're handicapped, but are
you capable of being really objective?

694
01:05:01,824 --> 01:05:04,486
- Sometimes.
- Good. I want to tell you something.

695
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,185
No, in fact, I'm gonna show you something.

696
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:13,599
You say we won't get anywhere because
what we're doing is founded on a lie.

697
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:17,796
Everybody talks about Hitler and the big
lie as if it was a brand-new invention.

698
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:19,498
Well, tell me something.

699
01:05:19,675 --> 01:05:22,906
Where will you find a bigger lie than
the one this country's founded on?

700
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:24,740
"All men are created equal. ' '

701
01:05:24,914 --> 01:05:27,576
Everything this country's
supposed to live by, right?

702
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:32,016
As far as you're concerned, Joe Miller
could've written the Bill of Rights.

703
01:05:32,254 --> 01:05:33,414
It's even funnier.

704
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:36,490
What do you got? What can you do?

705
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:38,957
Can you walk on a bus or a streetcar...

706
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:42,393
...and sit down with dignity like
a free human being, a free man?

707
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:45,090
You wanna see a movie, can
you walk in any theater?

708
01:05:45,267 --> 01:05:48,361
Flapjacks in a window, can you
say, "I'll have some of those"?

709
01:05:48,537 --> 01:05:52,200
You're a Negro with some brains,
you could use a little education.

710
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:54,707
Can you go to the school
where you get it best?

711
01:05:54,877 --> 01:05:57,243
You see a house you like
and you've got money.

712
01:05:57,413 --> 01:05:59,813
Can you live there, huh?
You live in a ghetto.

713
01:05:59,982 --> 01:06:04,214
North, East, South or West, you live
where they let you live. In Harlem, U.S.A.

714
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,851
Maybe you're good at some job.
Can you make something out of it?

715
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:12,620
Can you do any of those things, doctor?
Are your kids gonna do those things?

716
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:13,887
Maybe.

717
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,289
Maybe, huh? Sure, they will.

718
01:06:16,465 --> 01:06:20,401
Oh, yeah. In about 5500 years.

719
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:24,835
Have they got you so beat that you
don't know when somebody's making sense?

720
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:28,943
You'd have been in Madison Square
Garden if you weren't black.

721
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:32,171
Now, you hypnotized me, huh?
Well, they got you hypnotized.

722
01:06:32,348 --> 01:06:34,543
They've got you so mixed up, you're singing:

723
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:38,151
While they walk all over you.

724
01:06:40,756 --> 01:06:43,725
<i>Right then and there...</i>

725
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:45,918
<i>...I knew...</i>

726
01:06:46,095 --> 01:06:48,962
<i>...what I was frightened of.</i>

727
01:06:55,371 --> 01:06:58,772
<i>Fortunately, soon after the start
of the war, he, among others...</i>

728
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:03,901
<i>...was arrested for advocating the violent
overthrow of the United States government.</i>

729
01:07:27,203 --> 01:07:31,139
When you're about to go under, something
happens. Suddenly, you're wide awake.

730
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:34,003
Can you tell me what stops you? What happens?

731
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:37,612
It's like the feeling I get when
I'm gonna have one of those spells.

732
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,614
I get drowsy and sleepy,
and then I get so frightened.

733
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:44,878
- Why are you frightened?
- I feel like I'm gonna die.

734
01:07:45,054 --> 01:07:48,319
- Why do you feel you're going to die?
- I don't know.

735
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:49,924
Is there a mental picture?

736
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:51,957
<i>- Is it the body in the sink?
- Yes.</i>

737
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:55,063
<i>- Whose body is it? Whose could it be?
- I don't know.</i>

738
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:56,425
<i>- You must know.
- I don't!</i>

739
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:58,658
<i>You mean it has no face?</i>

740
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:01,894
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

741
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:33,365
Exactly what happened?

742
01:08:35,037 --> 01:08:38,302
- Just like the other times.
- This was not like the other times.

743
01:08:38,574 --> 01:08:42,408
- You never had any attacks, did you?
- You're trying to avoid my question.

744
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:44,102
- You lied.
- You know who it is.

745
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,111
- Who?
- The body in the sink.

746
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:48,011
Who is it? Who is it?

747
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,381
My father.

748
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:10,299
Was the image of your father in every attack?

749
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:12,303
No.

750
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:15,034
No. Before, I saw myself in the sink.

751
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:17,372
Why didn't you tell me that?

752
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,941
I don't know.

753
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:29,884
Did you ever want to kill your father?

754
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:36,128
When I was a kid, I used to lie
awake at night praying he would die.

755
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,734
And when he didn't, I'd
think up ways to do it myself.

756
01:09:41,003 --> 01:09:43,335
Pick him up and put him on the counter...

757
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:47,669
...and chop him up and
chop him up and chop him up!

758
01:09:52,514 --> 01:09:55,176
The way he used to treat my mama...

759
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:19,296
<i>I couldn't help thinking there must
be a million people in the world...</i>

760
01:10:19,475 --> 01:10:21,568
<i>...with a similar background.</i>

761
01:10:21,744 --> 01:10:24,235
<i>With just as bad, or
worse, early childhood...</i>

762
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:28,577
<i>...who managed, in spite of it,
to become a normal part of society.</i>

763
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:30,514
<i>He hadn't.</i>

764
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:40,552
Do you know why your
father's image replaced yours?

765
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:47,729
His image and yours are interchangeable.
One was the desire to kill your father...

766
01:10:47,903 --> 01:10:51,805
...the other was punishment for the
killing carried out in your fantasies.

767
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:53,407
You were punishing yourself.

768
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:57,909
In other words, you were both
the killer and the victim.

769
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:06,411
<i>Once he understood the
fantasy that haunted him...</i>

770
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:09,421
<i>...and he openly recognized
his hatred of his father...</i>

771
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:13,288
<i>...the blackout spells that brought
him to treatment quickly disappeared.</i>

772
01:11:13,696 --> 01:11:16,164
<i>I knew that he needed further treatment.</i>

773
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:19,927
<i>I might have ordered him
to submit to it. I didn't.</i>

774
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:23,503
<i>The truth is, I had had all I could stand.</i>

775
01:11:23,672 --> 01:11:26,835
<i>He was able to sleep and stopped coming.</i>

776
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:31,837
<i>It took him just one month.</i>

777
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:36,612
Slowly but surely you've
done wonders with him.

778
01:11:37,186 --> 01:11:39,279
Ever since you started with him...

779
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:41,980
...he's shown the fastest
improvement I've seen.

780
01:11:42,524 --> 01:11:45,789
- Doesn't seem like the same man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

781
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:47,724
But I can't accept your praise.

782
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:51,354
His conduct has probably improved.
He has no more blackout spells.

783
01:11:51,533 --> 01:11:53,296
Otherwise, I don't see much change.

784
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:55,334
What do you mean?

785
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:58,965
Well, he's still a Nazi, for instance.

786
01:11:59,141 --> 01:12:00,665
Really?

787
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:03,038
He hasn't shown evidence of that for months.

788
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:05,578
That's right. You should take credit for it.

789
01:12:06,715 --> 01:12:08,876
Believe me, he still is.

790
01:12:10,019 --> 01:12:13,113
Is that why you haven't given
him a recommendation for parole?

791
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:14,880
That's right.

792
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,255
You're the only one that hasn't, you know.

793
01:12:21,663 --> 01:12:24,826
- That hasn't what?
- Given him a recommendation for parole.

794
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:28,992
Really?

795
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:33,835
He's become a model prisoner, according
to the guards and his supervisors at work.

796
01:12:35,444 --> 01:12:37,071
Really?

797
01:12:37,713 --> 01:12:40,375
Well, they are entitled to their opinion.

798
01:12:40,549 --> 01:12:43,780
I'm asked for an opinion from
a psychological point of view...

799
01:12:43,952 --> 01:12:46,079
...and according to me
he's not ready for parole.

800
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:47,813
Okay.

801
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:51,084
Assuming that we can't
judge him by his behavior...

802
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,592
...to what extent then can we judge his mind?

803
01:12:55,597 --> 01:12:57,963
Well, that's for me to decide, isn't it?

804
01:12:58,133 --> 01:13:02,627
All right. But let me remind you,
we're not running a mental institution.

805
01:13:02,805 --> 01:13:08,107
For instance, what if his personality
remained unchanged, according to you...

806
01:13:08,277 --> 01:13:10,142
...until his sentence expired?

807
01:13:10,646 --> 01:13:13,171
Would you expect us to keep him here forever?

808
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,283
Even then, it would still
be my business, wouldn't it?

809
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:20,950
- Look here, with all due respect to you...
- You don't understand.

810
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22,283
This man is dangerous.

811
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:26,656
You don't know him like
I do. He is dangerous.

812
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:28,922
There's no recent evidence of that.

813
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:41,967
All right.

814
01:13:43,078 --> 01:13:45,308
Go ahead, release him.

815
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:49,077
But don't ask me to share the responsibility.

816
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:50,411
Now take it easy.

817
01:13:50,586 --> 01:13:53,248
Take it easy. Take it easy.

818
01:13:53,422 --> 01:13:56,448
That's what they did in
Germany. They took it easy.

819
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:02,654
Aren't you taking this
a little too personally?

820
01:14:02,831 --> 01:14:04,696
How do you mean that?

821
01:14:07,102 --> 01:14:08,831
Never mind.

822
01:14:17,045 --> 01:14:20,708
Hey, doc, there's a good chance
I might get parole this month.

823
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,848
I wouldn't put too much hope on your chances.

824
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,951
- Why?
- Well, there's a war on.

825
01:14:28,957 --> 01:14:30,185
So?

826
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:32,452
You are an internal enemy.

827
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:35,453
You're gonna be asked
for a recommendation soon.

828
01:14:35,631 --> 01:14:38,862
- What are you gonna say?
- What I think.

829
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:42,460
- Well, what do you think?
- That you're not ready for it.

830
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,837
- You mean you're going to turn me down?
- I have very little to do with it.

831
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:50,945
All I'm asked for is a statement about
you from a psychological point of view.

832
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,410
And?

833
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:55,414
I'll have to tell them that
I don't think you're ready.

834
01:14:55,717 --> 01:14:57,048
But why? I'm all right.

835
01:14:57,219 --> 01:15:00,655
Sure, you don't have any more
nightmares, and you sleep rather well.

836
01:15:00,822 --> 01:15:03,484
But your personality is the
same as when you came in.

837
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:05,183
What's that got to do with it?

838
01:15:06,562 --> 01:15:07,688
Everything.

839
01:15:07,863 --> 01:15:09,990
Look, please. I've got to get out of here.

840
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:14,026
All I can do is help you to remake yourself.

841
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:33,618
Why don't you remake yourself?

842
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:37,152
I won't interfere with your
parole. But when I'm asked...

843
01:15:37,326 --> 01:15:41,820
...I'll tell them that, in my opinion,
your personality remains unchanged.

844
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:45,761
You still have the same rotten ideas
and notions you had 18 months ago.

845
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:51,732
Those same ideas and notions are believed
in a lot of places, by a lot of people.

846
01:15:51,907 --> 01:15:53,772
I grant you, none of them are Negroes.

847
01:15:53,942 --> 01:15:56,911
Still, you probably want to
remake them all, don't you?

848
01:15:59,414 --> 01:16:01,814
You still have the
mentality of a storm trooper.

849
01:16:02,718 --> 01:16:05,414
Thank you. I take that as a compliment.

850
01:16:05,587 --> 01:16:08,852
They must be pretty smart, those
storm troopers. They own Europe.

851
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:10,924
They took it over, just like that.

852
01:16:11,093 --> 01:16:15,689
You know, the first thing they did was to
remake Europe. And how did they do that?

853
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,991
By getting rid of certain people.

854
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,192
Now over here it's going
to be a little different.

855
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:26,730
You know it won't only be the
Jews we get rid of, don't you?

856
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,169
You're gonna make it easier for us.

857
01:16:29,344 --> 01:16:32,245
You won't have to wear any armband.

858
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:35,308
We're gonna spot you a mile away.

859
01:16:36,184 --> 01:16:38,152
Wait a minute.

860
01:16:39,955 --> 01:16:41,923
I want an apology.

861
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:46,993
- You what?
- You heard me.

862
01:16:47,162 --> 01:16:48,527
You don't want to get hurt.

863
01:16:52,668 --> 01:16:55,330
I said, I want you to apologize.

864
01:16:56,305 --> 01:16:59,103
What are you going to do
if I don't? Call the hacks?

865
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,977
You wouldn't be so brave
on the outside, doctor.

866
01:17:04,646 --> 01:17:06,876
I won't call the guards.

867
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:14,280
It's just the two of us.

868
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:21,553
Now, are you going to apologize?

869
01:17:34,309 --> 01:17:35,742
All right.

870
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:39,011
I apologize.

871
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:53,187
Do you know why you apologized?

872
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:56,721
Do you want to know?

873
01:17:59,401 --> 01:18:04,065
I refused to recommend you for parole.
You took it as a personal rejection.

874
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,299
You felt persecuted as you
did when you were a child.

875
01:18:07,476 --> 01:18:10,934
And I, like anyone who rejects you,
represented your hated father...

876
01:18:11,113 --> 01:18:13,081
...the person who really rejected you.

877
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:16,046
You wanted to strike back.

878
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:18,277
But I represent an authority.

879
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:20,387
So you were afraid to strike.

880
01:18:20,555 --> 01:18:24,753
You decided to hurt me in a different
way, by attacking me as a Negro.

881
01:18:24,926 --> 01:18:30,125
You felt free from any retaliation on my
part, as I had put up with it in the past.

882
01:18:30,532 --> 01:18:32,864
But when I took off my coat...

883
01:18:34,302 --> 01:18:37,567
...I was no longer a symbol of
authority, or even of a Negro.

884
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:38,933
Just one person.

885
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:43,238
One man stripped of
everything but what he is.

886
01:18:43,412 --> 01:18:47,644
And to one man it's easy
to apologize, isn't it?

887
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:55,220
We could go over this again
tomorrow, in detail, if you'd like.

888
01:18:57,626 --> 01:18:59,958
Sure, doc, whatever you say.

889
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:06,058
Hey, where do you think you're going?

890
01:19:06,234 --> 01:19:08,498
It's all right. It's over.

891
01:19:08,737 --> 01:19:10,534
That right, doc?

892
01:19:11,573 --> 01:19:13,200
All right.

893
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,774
Next.

894
01:19:24,586 --> 01:19:27,851
- How's it going?
- Lousy.

895
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:33,426
Now, look, considering the unusual
character of the situation...

896
01:19:33,595 --> 01:19:36,291
...and the possibility
of a personality clash...

897
01:19:36,631 --> 01:19:40,260
...don't you think we should have
a discreet talk with the patient?

898
01:19:40,969 --> 01:19:43,870
It would clear up any doubts we might have.

899
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,404
Doubts?

900
01:19:45,574 --> 01:19:48,338
- Speak for yourselves, gentlemen. I don't...
- Now, wait.

901
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,603
You didn't seem to feel that way at lunch.

902
01:19:50,779 --> 01:19:54,271
Though you have taken a personal
interest in him from the beginning.

903
01:19:56,051 --> 01:19:59,145
All right. You leave me no choice.

904
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:07,217
Hello.

905
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:09,352
Hi.

906
01:20:10,031 --> 01:20:11,464
I don't understand you.

907
01:20:11,633 --> 01:20:15,069
You know I didn't want to handle
this case. But, no, you insisted.

908
01:20:15,237 --> 01:20:19,674
You practically framed me into it with
your faith in me. Where's your faith now?

909
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:23,005
- Well, it's still there.
- Really?

910
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:28,272
I'm calling you to enlist your support
for my recommendation to deny parole.

911
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:32,819
I'm staking my professional integrity on it.

912
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,153
Really, you don't have to...

913
01:20:35,323 --> 01:20:38,258
You don't understand. I'm
putting my job on the line.

914
01:20:40,362 --> 01:20:41,488
Well, I...

915
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,922
I don't know what to say.

916
01:20:44,099 --> 01:20:46,567
Don't say anything. Just think about it.

917
01:20:49,204 --> 01:20:50,432
All right.

918
01:20:53,275 --> 01:20:55,937
Now, what about the Jews and the Negroes?

919
01:20:56,111 --> 01:20:57,442
Well, what about them?

920
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:00,639
How do you feel about them?

921
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:04,280
- Do you mean now or when I first got here?
- Now.

922
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:09,180
I feel I owe them an apology.

923
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:13,521
In other words, you once
were prejudiced against them.

924
01:21:13,862 --> 01:21:15,227
That's right.

925
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:18,856
How do you account for that?

926
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:21,433
Well, I've changed. Thanks to the doctor.

927
01:21:21,603 --> 01:21:24,868
How do you account for him not
recommending you for parole?

928
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,034
I don't know. When I asked if he would, he
flatly refused me. I couldn't believe it.

929
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:32,076
What did he say?

930
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:36,581
Well, when he refused, I asked him
if he didn't think I'd improved.

931
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:39,777
He admitted to that but said
I still need further treatment.

932
01:21:41,256 --> 01:21:44,555
Was he specific about why
you needed further treatment?

933
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:46,057
No, sir.

934
01:21:46,628 --> 01:21:49,893
Some time ago you stopped
going to him. Isn't that right?

935
01:21:50,065 --> 01:21:51,430
That's right.

936
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,160
Was he the one who ended the sessions?

937
01:21:54,336 --> 01:21:58,363
No, I guess I'm the one that stopped
coming. You see, he helped me a great deal.

938
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,064
He explained things to me.

939
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:03,506
He made me understand a dream I
was having before every attack.

940
01:22:03,678 --> 01:22:06,476
Soon after, I stopped having
the dream and the attacks.

941
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:10,584
Yet you say he wasn't specific about
why he wanted you to continue with him?

942
01:22:11,286 --> 01:22:12,275
No.

943
01:22:12,454 --> 01:22:16,618
He just said I should be patient. He
couldn't tell me what he was working towards.

944
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:19,089
But I should put myself
entirely in his hands.

945
01:22:21,196 --> 01:22:23,187
Yes?

946
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:28,158
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Oh, come in. This should interest you.

947
01:22:28,737 --> 01:22:32,833
I've been asking your patient here a few
questions. I think you should hear this.

948
01:22:33,842 --> 01:22:35,309
Sit down.

949
01:22:45,954 --> 01:22:48,684
He tells us that although
you feel he's improved...

950
01:22:48,857 --> 01:22:52,816
...you want him to continue with analysis.
- That's right.

951
01:22:52,994 --> 01:22:54,291
Why?

952
01:22:55,363 --> 01:22:57,160
We've been over this before.

953
01:22:58,033 --> 01:23:01,628
Your patient has only praise for
you and what you've done for him.

954
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:04,235
But he also said that you did not...

955
01:23:04,406 --> 01:23:07,637
...say specifically why you want
him to have further treatment.

956
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:11,442
He's lying.

957
01:23:12,514 --> 01:23:14,311
Because he has something to hide.

958
01:23:14,716 --> 01:23:16,684
I am not lying!

959
01:23:17,886 --> 01:23:19,751
I tell you, he's lying.

960
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:24,085
I'm not saying he's not clever. He's
about the most clever liar I've ever seen.

961
01:23:35,804 --> 01:23:36,828
Well?

962
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:41,708
It's true.

963
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:44,140
I did insult him in the beginning.

964
01:23:44,312 --> 01:23:46,974
But that was more than a year ago.

965
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:50,242
I never thought you'd
hold that against me now.

966
01:23:54,456 --> 01:23:57,550
But I understand now why you
don't want me to get out of here.

967
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:00,654
When I first came in here
I had lots of problems.

968
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:03,730
I think the doctor's got
some problems of his own.

969
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:08,225
I'm not just one person to you, am I?

970
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:10,098
I'm a symbol.

971
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:13,434
A symbol of everything
you fear will destroy you.

972
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:15,776
You think I'm your enemy.

973
01:24:15,944 --> 01:24:18,344
I've changed, but no
matter how much I change...

974
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,481
...you'll never want me to get out.

975
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:23,415
It doesn't matter that I've changed, does it?

976
01:24:23,585 --> 01:24:26,281
It's all something purely personal now.

977
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:29,784
Between him and me.

978
01:24:45,673 --> 01:24:48,233
What is this? A trial?

979
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:06,818
Come in.

980
01:25:10,265 --> 01:25:12,460
- Doctor.
- What do you want?

981
01:25:12,634 --> 01:25:15,899
I'm on my way out, and I asked
to see you this morning because...

982
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,970
...I heard you're leaving too.

983
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:19,868
What do you want?

984
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,767
Guess I came by to say no hard feelings.

985
01:25:22,944 --> 01:25:25,606
I had to do it, but I wasn't
trying to get you fired.

986
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,248
- I didn't mean to cost you your job.
- You didn't.

987
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,407
No? Well, then how come you're leaving?

988
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:33,645
- Look, you wouldn't understand and...
- All right. You're sore.

989
01:25:33,822 --> 01:25:35,949
You know, I don't blame you for being sore.

990
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:38,558
But you do see how things
worked out, don't you?

991
01:25:38,726 --> 01:25:41,217
It's just about how I
said it would be, isn't it?

992
01:25:41,396 --> 01:25:44,627
All those people you've been
working with, who did they believe?

993
01:25:44,799 --> 01:25:47,734
The big black boy who's supposed
to be running this place?

994
01:25:47,902 --> 01:25:51,497
- Or the white
Christian-American? - You crud!

995
01:25:51,673 --> 01:25:55,871
You vicious, slimy, rotten little crud.

996
01:25:56,044 --> 01:25:57,568
Let me tell you something!

997
01:25:57,745 --> 01:25:59,474
Do you know what I wanted most?

998
01:25:59,647 --> 01:26:03,105
Despite what you are and despite
what you were, I wanted to help you.

999
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:07,152
I wanted to kill you. I would enjoy to
kill you right now with my bare hands.

1000
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:10,189
But more than I wanted to
kill you, I wanted to help you.

1001
01:26:10,358 --> 01:26:15,261
Know what that makes me? More than
just a good man. That makes me a doctor!

1002
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:16,920
Okay.

1003
01:26:17,098 --> 01:26:18,963
You come in here, day after day...

1004
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,125
...and you spout that stuff
about white Christian America.

1005
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:26,797
And I took it, because that was my
job. Now let me tell you something!

1006
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:31,244
This is my country.

1007
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:33,740
This is where I've done what I've done!

1008
01:26:33,915 --> 01:26:37,407
If there were a million cruds like
you, all sick like you are sick...

1009
01:26:37,585 --> 01:26:39,849
...all shouting, "Down! Destroy! Degrade!"...

1010
01:26:40,021 --> 01:26:43,081
...and if there were 20 million
more sick enough to listen...

1011
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:44,850
...you are still gonna lose.

1012
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:48,223
You're gonna lose because there
is something in this country.

1013
01:26:48,396 --> 01:26:52,730
Something so big, so strong
that you don't even know.

1014
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:55,665
Something big enough to take
it from people like you...

1015
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,601
...and come back and
nail you into the ground!

1016
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:01,867
You're walking out of
here? You are going nowhere!

1017
01:27:02,043 --> 01:27:04,068
Now get out!

1018
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,741
Get out!

1019
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,343
What happened to him? Do you know?

1020
01:27:44,519 --> 01:27:45,816
Yes.

1021
01:27:45,987 --> 01:27:48,148
He was hanged about 10 years later...

1022
01:27:48,323 --> 01:27:51,952
...for beating an old man to death
in the streets, a complete stranger.

1023
01:27:52,126 --> 01:27:55,721
I'm not saying that was as difficult
as the case you're dealing with.

1024
01:27:55,897 --> 01:28:00,061
But I am saying that it put me under as
much pressure as you're under right now.

1025
01:28:03,805 --> 01:28:06,296
And I didn't quit.

1026
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,962
I know how I'm gonna whip this case.

1027
01:28:35,636 --> 01:28:37,467
I'm getting some burned cork...

1028
01:28:37,638 --> 01:28:40,072
...and I'm going into the
next session blackface.

1029
01:28:41,476 --> 01:28:42,773
Good idea.

1030
01:28:43,644 --> 01:28:46,408
Only don't let me down
because you're a white man.

1031
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,116
