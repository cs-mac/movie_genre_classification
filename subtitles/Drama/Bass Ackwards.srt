1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:03,370
Because you know I'm all about that bass

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,547
Bout that bass, no treble

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,122

4
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,082

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,094
Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two

9
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,010
But I can shake it, shake it 

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,995
Like I'm supposed to do

11
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,157

14
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,612
I see the magazines 

15
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:34,305
Working that Photoshop

16
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:36,553

18
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:41,201
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up

19
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:43,015
'Cause every inch of you is perfect

20
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,008
From the bottom to the top

21
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:46,793

22
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:50,007
Don't worry about your size

23
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,003
She says, boys they like a little

24
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,823
More booty to hold at night

25
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,101
You know I won't be no stick-figure

26
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:04,991
Silicone Barbie doll

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
