1
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:51,032
<i>And when all of life is over
and our work on earth is done,</i>

2
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:55,607
<i>and the roll is called
up yonder, I'll be there.</i>

3
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,165
<i>When the roll,</i>

4
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,546
<i>when the roll is called
up yonder, I'll be there,</i>

5
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:01,797
<i>when the roll,</i>

6
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:05,301
<i>when the roll is called
up yonder, I'll be there,</i>

7
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:06,529
<i>when the roll,</i>

8
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,849
<i>when the roll is
called up yonder,</i>

9
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,754
<i>when the roll is called
up yonder, I'll be there.</i>

10
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,834
"And he spake this parable
unto them saying,

11
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,802
"What man of you having a hundred sheep,

12
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,437
"if you lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety-nine, and..."

13
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,774
"Doth not leave the ninety-nine
in the wilderness,

14
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,776
"and go after that which was lost, until..."

15
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,012
"Until he find it."

16
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,180
"And when he hath found it, he layeth it,

17
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,248
"on his shoulder and rejoiceth.

18
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,116
"And when he cometh..."

19
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,618
All right, Zeke, sit yourself down.

20
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,453
"And when he cometh home
he calleth together his friends

21
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,121
"and neighbors saying..."

22
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:16,090
"He calleth to his friends and neighbors,

23
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,524
"saying unto them, 'Rejoice with me,

24
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:21,593
"'for I have found my sheep
which were lost."'

25
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:27,829
I recollect the time Sam Harkness
lost his old sow.

26
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,363
He come out one morning,

27
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,198
The pen be busted down,
the sow was gone.

28
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,766
Sam lit out after it to find it.

29
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,535
He had six or seven other pigs
that didn't run off.

30
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:43,302
But did Sam get down
on his marrowbones,

31
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,837
And thank the good Lord for that?

32
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,339
No, siree, not Sam.

33
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,006
He hunted high and low for that old...

34
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,278
As I was saying,

35
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,180
He hunted high and low for that old sow.

36
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,448
About all he...

37
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,724
About all he done that summer
was hunt for that sow.

38
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,491
Wouldn't even stop...

39
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,493
Wouldn't even stop hunting
when winter come.

40
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,961
And sure enough, one night,
when he was plowing home...

41
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:39,029
One night, when he was plowing home
through the snow,

42
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,798
He seen something move in the shadows.

43
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:45,866
Sam... Sam's right scared.

44
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,634
Figures maybe it's a bear.

45
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,169
Then the...

46
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:55,004
Then the bear grunts
and it ain't no bear at all.

47
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,671
It's the sow!

48
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,205
Well, Sam was fitting to be tied.

49
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:01,373
The rejoicingest man you ever seen.

50
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,142
Ten times as rejoiceful for the lost one
as for 'em that stayed in the fold.

51
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:07,876
Now this here...

52
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,144
Now this here...

53
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,345
Now this here is the point!

54
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:27,852
It appears to me that
the devil be a-knocking at the

55
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,687
Door of the house of worship.

56
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,621
If there's any of you
want to go get him, you're...

57
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,556
You'll be free to go.

58
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,657
'Cause the meeting's over.

59
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,960
Lookee here, Pastor Pile.

60
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,261
Alvin York done shot his initials
in this tree.

61
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,329
"A-Y," plain as day.

62
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,331
It was Alvin York, Ike Botkin
and Buck Lipscomb in their liquor.

63
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,566
Who was you saying it was?

64
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,534
Who was you saying it was?

65
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:03,069
- It was Alvin, Mrs. York.
- How be you know it?

66
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,007
It wasn't Alvin, Mother York,
it was the liquor.

67
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:15,042
Mighty good shooting
for a man in his liquor.

68
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,075
Ain't it?

69
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:45,823
Say, let's do it again.

70
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,138
- Howdy, boys!
- Howdy!

71
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,440
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Luke.

72
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,674
- We were looking for you Saturday.
- Couldn't get here no more than fly.

73
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,643
Roads are getting soggier and soggier
between here and Rugby.

74
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:32,077
- Is that so?
- Water is so deep

75
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,312
In some of 'em creek beds,
had to use old Betsy's belly for a boat.

76
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,379
How are you, Zeke?

77
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:40,548
I reckon you could have got here quicker
if you had carried Betsy.

78
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,882
Yeah, wished I could get me another mule
like old Flora.

79
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,850
They ain't turning out mules
like they used to.

80
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,084
No, sir!

81
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,051
Hey, what you got there, young fellow?

82
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,386
The very latest thing in ladies' hats,
the cloche model.

83
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:54,387
Women folks around here
wear split bonnets.

84
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,089
The young ones goes bareheaded.

85
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,056
Maybe so, but in modern merchandising,

86
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:00,857
The storekeeper endeavors
to create a demand.

87
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,092
Now in this line of ladies' bloomers,

88
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,227
Very moderately priced,
has the finest elastic in the waistband,

89
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:09,095
Also in the knees.

90
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,396
No amount of washing
will make it lose its snap.

91
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:14,898
- Your first trip in these parts, ain't it?
- Yes.

92
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:17,032
And we have them in three lovely colors.

93
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:20,600
Which we absolutely guarantee
will not fade or shrink.

94
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,735
Plenty of room in the seat, too.

95
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,536
I can tell you these garments
are mighty popular with the ladies.

96
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,004
- You can, huh?
- Yes.

97
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,537
Well, folks hereabouts wouldn't know
what 'em things is for.

98
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:31,605
- Lem?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,940
- Lem, here's your Nashville paper.
- Well, thank you, Pastor.

100
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,574
I got letters here for Tom Carver
and Ed Watson.

101
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,375
Both back tax bills, I reckon.

102
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,744
- What does it say, Lem?
- Well...

103
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,381
They're a-telling, Cordell Hull
are speechmaking over in Jimtown.

104
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,415
Appears he's out running
for Congress again.

105
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,683
- It says...
- I mind when Cord Hull

106
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,751
Wasn't knee high to a toad frog,

107
00:08:57,918 --> 00:08:59,752
And running around in his shirttail.

108
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,353
Just goes to show you what
a fellow can do if he gets book learning.

109
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,088
That paper is four days old,
I read it over at Nashville.

110
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,256
Yep. It took Luke three days
of mule-paddling

111
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,957
To bring the mail from Rugby.

112
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,758
I can believe that,
after driving over here from Jamestown.

113
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,225
Jimtown.

114
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,893
- I thought it was Jamestown.
- It are.

115
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,763
Well, anyway, since driving over here,

116
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,032
What I'd like to know is,
how do you fellows get into this valley?

117
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,133
We were born here.

118
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,602
Now look, Mr. Pile,

119
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,303
I'd like to sell you some of these garments

120
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,437
Before the price goes up
on account of the war.

121
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:40,871
What war?

122
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,373
Why, the... The war in Europe.

123
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,808
Oh, that war.

124
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:52,443
Yes, certainly.

125
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,812
Look likes the Germans
might get into Paris, don't you think?

126
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,947
Well, we ain't done
much thinking on it, mister.

127
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,781
It ain't in our corner, nohow.

128
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,648
If you're hankering for trouble,

129
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,950
It ain't scarce
right here in these mountains.

130
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,651
Oh, I ain't looking for any trouble.

131
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:11,118
Yep, fighting could have been
mighty plentiful

132
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,254
Down at the meeting house last night.
Did you hear?

133
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:17,789
Alvin York and two other fellows
done busted up the meeting.

134
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:20,790
That ain't a smithereen
to what he done in Jimtown.

135
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:23,225
- Nigh split the jail, he did.
- No...

136
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,392
Raised such a rumpus
they had to turn him loose.

137
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,493
Do tell.

138
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,961
Old man Jarvis up Bear Creek way

139
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,295
Told me he seen the three of 'em
riding their mules,

140
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,663
Hell-bent for election,
toward the Kentucky border.

141
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,264
I reckon their liquor was getting low

142
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,298
And they wanted to get there
before they sobered up.

143
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,835
Howdy, Mrs. York.

144
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,403
- Howdy, Luke.
- Howdy, Mother York.

145
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:53,906
- Tolerable, Pastor.
- What can I do for you today?

146
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,641
Could I be getting a can of baking powder
and a...

147
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,610
- Poke of salt?
- Sure thing.

148
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,616
I ain't having but five eggs
and they're kind of puny.

149
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,849
Oh, eggs are eggs, I reckon.

150
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,318
I was plumb out of salt.

151
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:27,121
Don't be taking it hard, Mother York,
what you just heard.

152
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,123
I ain't taking nothing hard, Pastor.

153
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,459
And I ain't making excuses
for Alvin to nobody.

154
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,161
Of course you ain't,
and I ain't asking you to.

155
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:41,328
- I'm right proud of Alvin.
- Got a right to be.

156
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:44,164
Works hard, Alvin does.

157
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,365
Patching and scratching that poor land.

158
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:53,801
It's mighty hard work,
getting corn out of rocks.

159
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:56,769
- Indeed it is.
- Who's to blame him

160
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,171
If he busts loose now and again?

161
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,006
Nobody, Mother York, nary a soul.

162
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,174
Of course, I ain't for Alvin

163
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,542
Doing like he does.

164
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:15,478
A little religion wouldn't do him no hurt.

165
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,180
No, it wouldn't.

166
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:24,549
Pastor, I wouldn't be against
your talking to Alvin.

167
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,784
You reckon it'd do any good?

168
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:32,219
Well, it wouldn't do no harm.

169
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,654
I'd be riding up and having a talk with him.

170
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,023
I'm thanking you, Pastor.

171
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,331
- George.
- Yes, Ma?

172
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:02,333
I reckon I know where your brother's at.

173
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,836
He's up at the Kentucky border.

174
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:09,003
- Go fetch him.
- Yessum.

175
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:23,410
Better be taking a piece of corn
for your supper, Son.

176
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:24,811
Yessum.

177
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,687
- Hiya, Marter.
- Hiya, Alvin.

178
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:47,988
- Mart, we wants to get us a bottle.
- Now look here, Alvin.

179
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,424
You know, I know and so do the Sheriff.
You're from over here in Tennessee.

180
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:56,025
And I can't sell you no liquor
less you gets over yonder in Kentucky.

181
00:13:56,192 --> 00:14:00,994
Marter, you are the legalest fellow in
these here parts, if you ain't nothing else.

182
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:02,429
You gotta be, in this business.

183
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,497
Maybe our credit ain't no good
in Tennessee.

184
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,498
Bet it ain't no better in Kentuck.

185
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,699
What you be having, Alvin?

186
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,234
You got any corn without no lye in it?

187
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,268
No poison oak leaves in it, either.

188
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:17,569
Ain't no lye in this liquor.

189
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,854
Plumb hollow I am,
like an old, burnt-out stump.

190
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,555
Me, too.

191
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,557
What are we drinking to, Alvin?

192
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,892
What'll we drink to, Ike?

193
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:09,694
Why, I reckon we drunk
to pretty near everything there is.

194
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,629
- I can't think of nothing new.
- Me neither.

195
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,030
Reckon we better begin all over?

196
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:20,099
If we can't drink to something,

197
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,367
Why don't we drink against something?

198
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,234
Against something? Against what?

199
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,803
Oh, against something
or somebody we're against.

200
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,937
I ain't against nobody or nothing.
Except getting sober.

201
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,038
We'll drink against that.

202
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,473
You... You'll be a-killing
two birds with one stone.

203
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,708
- Come on. Sure.
- Ain't never gonna get sober.

204
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:51,146
Never gonna get...

205
00:15:58,216 --> 00:15:59,950
Well, I'll be blowed.

206
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,151
What are you doing here, George?

207
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,820
Young'uns like you ain't got no business
in a place like this here, nohow.

208
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:09,288
- Now just you skedaddle.
- Ma wants you home.

209
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,323
- Now look here, George...
- Ma wants you.

210
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,092
- Shucks, son of a gun...
- Well,

211
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:21,927
Reckon I better go. I'll be seeing you.

212
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,330
His ma wants him.

213
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,234
Get up.

214
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,168
Here, here. Quit that.

215
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:43,337
Hold your horses, Marter.

216
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,644
Here we go.

217
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,780
Here we go again.

218
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,950
I'm still a-coming.

219
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,164
Say when you got enough.

220
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,799
Say it.

221
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,134
Enough, enough.

222
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:56,439
Ma wants you, Alvin.

223
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:00,041
Ma wants you.

224
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,376
Coming, George.

225
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:19,183
- I'll be seeing you.
- So long, Al.

226
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,327
Here he is, Ma.

227
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,696
It took a heap of looking,
but he come easy.

228
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:52,131
- Fetch me a pail of water, George.
- Yessum.

229
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:34,719
Breakfast's ready, now it is.
Better be getting at it.

230
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,486
South field needs a-plowing.

231
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,994
The Lord bless these victuals we done got

232
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:57,663
And help us to be
beholding to nobody. Amen.

233
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,767
I reckon you'll want some salt
on your pone.

234
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:18,039
Whoa, Fred.

235
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:28,411
Giddap, Noah.

236
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,915
Whoa.

237
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:40,049
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

238
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,418
I've been kind of expecting you.

239
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:47,586
I'm right sorry about the other night, I...

240
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,588
I reckon I done the wrong thing.

241
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,589
See that rock, Alvin?

242
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:57,257
You've been plowing around that rock
a heap of years.

243
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:58,959
Sure have.

244
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,693
Did you ever think when you start plowing
your furrows crooked,

245
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,727
It's mighty hard to get 'em straight again.

246
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:08,763
- I never thought on it much.
- It's that a-way, I reckon,

247
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:12,364
With other things besides plowing.

248
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:16,733
Satan's got you by the shirttail, Alvin.

249
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,868
Sure has. Giddap, Noah.

250
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,303
He's gonna yank you straight down to hell.

251
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,770
You are plum right, Pastor.

252
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,637
You gotta make him let loose of you
before it's too late.

253
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,105
I sure wish I know'd how.

254
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:29,439
Wrestle him, Alvin,
wrestle him like you would a bear.

255
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:33,075
I done wrestled him, Pastor, but...
Whoa, whoa there, Noah.

256
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,209
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, Noah.

257
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,777
But old Satan, he hangs on tight.

258
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,611
You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin.

259
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:42,480
Why, twixt the two of you,
you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy.

260
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,780
Why, I sure wish the Lord would throw in.

261
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,914
He will, if you ask him.

262
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:50,649
Oh, I done prayed, Pastor,
till I was black in the face.

263
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:57,986
- But it wasn't no use.
- It ain't only praying, Alvin, it's believing.

264
00:21:58,153 --> 00:21:59,787
Now, you see here.

265
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:03,789
Take a look at the old oak yonder.
Looks mighty strong.

266
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,724
Been standing there since your pa
was a boy a-plowing in the same field.

267
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:10,593
Looks like it could go right on standing
all by itself, don't it?

268
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,726
Yep.

269
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:14,928
Just a-resting itself
and feeding on the earth.

270
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,729
Well, it can't. It can't stand there

271
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:20,964
Without there's a lot of deep roots
a-holding it up.

272
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,499
Can't see the roots,
but they're there just the same.

273
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:27,300
It appears to me it's been planned
a fellow's got to have his roots

274
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,902
In something outside his own self.

275
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:34,570
I reckon I ain't found no roots
what'll hold me up, when...

276
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,238
When I'm hell-bent to fall.

277
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:38,639
And then take the animals in the woods.

278
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,140
Squirrels'd go mighty hungry

279
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:42,808
If nothing made 'em store up nuts
for the wintertime.

280
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:43,975
- Sure would.
- How do you reckon

281
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:47,910
Birds get to fly north in the summer
if there ain't something a-guiding 'em?

282
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:50,945
A bird ain't got no way of telling
north from south.

283
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:52,813
And then there's the bees.

284
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,313
Bees'd sure be in a fix
if they wasn't beholding to something

285
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,982
To show 'em how to get back to the hives.

286
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:01,283
Well, I ain't no bird and
I ain't no squirrel.

287
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,318
- And I sure ain't no bee.
- Well, that's right, Alvin.

288
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,878
The way I figure,

289
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:09,277
there ain't no use for a fellow
going out looking for religion. It's...

290
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,988
Well, it's just gotta come to a fellow.

291
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:13,156
It'll come, my boy. You'll see.

292
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:15,690
Maybe slow, like the way daylight comes.

293
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,958
And maybe in a flash,
like a bolt of lightning.

294
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,460
- When?
- When you ain't even expecting it.

295
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,295
Well, I hope so.

296
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,931
Giddap, Noah. I'll be seeing you.

297
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:57,776
Get after him, now.

298
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,613
Tracks are mighty fresh.
Less than an hour old.

299
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,981
- Reckon it's a red fox?
- Might be red and might be gray.

300
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,548
It's making a big circle.

301
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,849
Can't tell about his course
till he gets out on the flat.

302
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:35,860
They took to the hill there.
Yeah, that-a-way.

303
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:48,833
What's the matter, Alvin?

304
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,369
Howdy.

305
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,405
- You're Alvin York, ain't you?
- Yes.

306
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,172
Let's get going, Alvin.

307
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:07,008
I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
Where you been keeping yourself?

308
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:08,876
- Hereabouts.
- What's ailing you?

309
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:10,777
Are you coming or ain't you?

310
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,245
You better go get that fox, George.

311
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,213
You're just tetched.

312
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,280
How's your ma?

313
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,282
I asked you how your ma was.

314
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:24,450
Tolerable.

315
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,252
I figured it was you out a-hunting.

316
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,886
No mistaking the voices
of 'em hound dogs.

317
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,854
One's a-having a hook to the end of its bay

318
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,055
You could be hanging a bucket on.

319
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:40,191
The other's a croak, just like a frog,
about moonrise.

320
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,926
- What...
- You ain't Gracie Williams, are you?

321
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,927
Well, I ain't nobody but.

322
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,262
Why, you was only just...

323
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,231
You sure growed up all of a sudden like...

324
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:55,965
Reckon I have.

325
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,968
Sounds as if they've run that fox
to ground.

326
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,769
I said 'em hound dogs
run the fox to ground.

327
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:09,204
You better be getting along.

328
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:10,805
Reckon I had.

329
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,974
- I'll be seeing you.
- Hoping.

330
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,928
Ma.

331
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:01,096
Yeah?

332
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:04,731
When you and Pa got hitched,
what did Pa have to set up with?

333
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:07,832
Well, your pa had this here farm

334
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:13,302
And a mule and $5, no $6.

335
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,738
What did Grandpa have?

336
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:23,106
Your grandpa had this here farm,
a pair of horses.

337
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,774
The mare was in foal.

338
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,276
I reckon I wouldn't, George.

339
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:39,748
Ma.

340
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:43,316
It's sure ripped down here.
You reckon you can fix it?

341
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:46,317
I reckon. Come over here, Alvin.

342
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:49,618
Bend over.

343
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,488
You're a-figuring on setting up,
ain't you, Son?

344
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:58,490
- Yessum.
- Getting married?

345
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:01,658
- Who's it gonna be?
- Gracie Williams.

346
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,726
Gracie Williams?

347
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:11,129
Asked her yet?

348
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:13,197
No, I ain't.

349
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:17,732
What's the matter?

350
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,800
I ain't said nothing.

351
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,435
Reckon that'll hold.

352
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:26,837
Reckon it better.

353
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,511
Hold it thataway, Zeb.

354
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:48,513
Thinking on going to that there shindig
next Saturday night, Miss Gracie?

355
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:50,981
- I ain't been asked.
- Well...

356
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:54,349
You've been asked now.

357
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:58,518
- I can't say, Zeb. I have to think it over.
- Well, I don't...

358
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:01,919
Joshua, 14, verse 9...

359
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,822
You'd be a-coming if you wanted to,
Miss Gracie.

360
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:10,457
Maybe I could and maybe I couldn't.

361
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,659
Why, it's Alvin York.

362
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:18,027
- Howdy, Miss Gracie.
- Howdy, Alvin.

363
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,862
- You know Zeb Andrews, ain't you?
- Howdy.

364
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,330
Knitting, Zeb?

365
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,798
He was just a-helping me.

366
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,967
I wasn't expecting you
to be a-calling so soon.

367
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,401
Well, I said I'd be seeing you.

368
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:36,202
Last time I seen Alvin
he was chasing a fox.

369
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:38,570
He stopped here for a spell to

370
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:41,506
Kind of catch his breath.

371
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:44,940
- Did you kill that fox, Alvin?
- I sure did.

372
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:48,008
- We run over there...
- Was that a gray fox or a red?

373
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,675
Red. Just to the side of that...

374
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,711
Why, a red fox skin ain't worth nothing
this time of the year.

375
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,678
That little hollow...

376
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,279
This one was.

377
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:02,215
"Asa begat Joshiat
and Joshiat begat Joshua."

378
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:05,150
It's just Uncle Lige talking to himself.

379
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,818
Zeb here was telling me there's gonna be
a dance over to Thomson's Mill.

380
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:09,952
Yeah, I hear that...

381
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,520
Ed Morgan's gonna do the fiddling.

382
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,654
I was figuring that...

383
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:16,722
Just about the best fiddler
in these here parts, he is.

384
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,190
- He ain't.
- If he ain't, who'd be?

385
00:30:19,357 --> 00:30:22,291
- Tod Haskins.
- He can't hold a candle to Ed.

386
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,793
- You're a-thinking.
- I'm a-knowing.

387
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:28,895
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Now, now, now. Hush up, you two.

388
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:31,462
There ain't no call
for fussing over a fiddler.

389
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:34,397
- We weren't a-fussing. I was telling him...
- Well, I'm a-telling you...

390
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:38,965
The way I figure, Ed's better at the jigging
and Tod can sure fiddle a square.

391
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:43,702
"It biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder."

392
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,904
Uncle Lige there was a-telling me
that corn's right good this harvest.

393
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:51,172
How's the crops up your way, Alvin?

394
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:54,139
We figure to get about
20 bushel to the acre.

395
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:56,207
We're gonna get about 60.

396
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:57,575
Well, there's a heap of difference

397
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:59,343
Twixt farming the bottomland and the top.

398
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,543
- Well, there sure is.
- I reckon...

399
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,511
You know, I don't see how you get five
bushels off of that there land of yours.

400
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,746
Now look here, Zeb Andrews...

401
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:12,749
Miss... Miss Gracie,

402
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,750
I'd sure be much obliged
if I could have a cup of water.

403
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,352
I got some nipping cider.

404
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:21,720
- Well, that'd go mighty good.
- I'll be getting it.

405
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:26,355
"And the lion shall lie down
with the lamb."

406
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,402
Here's your cider. It's coming from the...

407
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:57,036
Where's Zeb?

408
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:04,172
- What's he...
- I reckon he lit out.

409
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:07,375
Well, isn't he be coming back?

410
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,942
No, ma'am, he ain't.

411
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:13,411
- That strikes me mighty queer.
- Yessum.

412
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:17,446
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

413
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:20,414
"do it with thy might."

414
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:25,449
Alvin, you...

415
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:27,784
You was fighting.

416
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:31,052
- It weren't much.
- Alvin York...

417
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,860
You ain't a-fitting to
come a-visiting a girl.

418
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,388
He ain't got no business
around here anyhow.

419
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,866
As much business as you
have, Alvin York.

420
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:39,456
- No, he ain't.
- Well, why ain't he?

421
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,791
- Well, he ain't because...
- Because, why?

422
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,092
Because...
Because I'm a-going to marry you.

423
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,961
- You what?
- I'm a-going to marry you.

424
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:54,629
Now, now, now, Alvin, you stop that.
Don't you be saying things like that.

425
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:56,463
- Don't you be saying 'em.
- Well, I have.

426
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,031
It ain't...

427
00:32:58,298 --> 00:33:00,132
- Oh, you are, are you?
- Yessum.

428
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,966
Well, you can't...

429
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,201
- Well, your mother told me about it.
- That's what I'm a-doing.

430
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:09,069
Well, I never... Lookee here...

431
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:13,071
I wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree,
Alvin York.

432
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,606
Fine husband you'd make.

433
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:18,107
I allow Zeb Andrews would make
a better one?

434
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,641
Oh, how should I know? Maybe he would.

435
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:25,444
Zeb Andrews got a piece of bottomland,
that's it, ain't it?

436
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,413
You thinking that's it, aren't you?

437
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:33,281
Folks say you're no good
except for fighting and hell raising

438
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:35,648
And I'm thinking they're plumb right.

439
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:36,983
If I had a piece of bottomland,

440
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,084
I'd guess it'd make a heap of difference,
wouldn't it?

441
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,251
- A piece of bottomland!
- Well, I can get some.

442
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:43,319
Well, go and get it. I ain't a-caring.

443
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:46,820
There ain't nothing I can't get
if I set my mind to it.

444
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:49,455
You don't think much of yourself, do you?

445
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:51,423
Yes, I do.

446
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,157
Amen.

447
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:10,593
That there's bottomland soil, ain't it?

448
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,130
Queer how the folks
that lives on the bottom

449
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:21,466
Looks down on the folks on top.

450
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,301
It was always that way.

451
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:28,836
Ain't no changing it.

452
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,870
Well, I'm a-gonna change it.

453
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:34,639
I'm a-gonna get us a piece of bottomland.

454
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:40,041
Your pa set out to get hisself
a piece of bottomland once.

455
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,676
Nary a man ever tried harder.

456
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,711
Liked to kill hisself trying.

457
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:53,848
It was a long time before he gave up,

458
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:57,183
But he had to in the end.

459
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:01,218
Well, I ain't a-setting myself up
as a better man than Pa.

460
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:03,618
I reckon I ain't half as good,

461
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:07,854
But I'm a-knowing where there's
a piece of bottomland to be had

462
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,889
And I'm a-gonna get it.

463
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,824
Maybe you will.

464
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,961
How old you say this here mule be?

465
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:25,462
- Nine year, but Abraham's sound.
- Yes, he are.

466
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,665
He's kind of pussle-gutted,
it appears to me.

467
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:33,667
Nary a bit.
He's just mighty well fed, that's all.

468
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,034
Well...

469
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:39,636
I reckon I might allow you $30 on him.

470
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,270
- $30?
- Yeah.

471
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:42,837
- You say $30?
- Yeah.

472
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,339
Well, he's worth $40 if he's worth a cent.

473
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:47,307
Then he ain't worth a cent.

474
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,108
- What's all this here you got?
- Well, there's two dozen pullets.

475
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,476
$6.

476
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:59,111
Why, that's 25 cents a piece.
They're worth twice that much.

477
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:00,745
Not to me, they ain't.

478
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:04,114
- What are these?
- Them's prime winter pelts, Mr. Tomkins.

479
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:08,083
Mighty poor. They won't fetch that much.

480
00:37:08,316 --> 00:37:10,650
I might allow you $1.50 a piece for 'em.

481
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:13,252
Well, I can get $3 a piece for 'em
in Jimtown.

482
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,453
It's quite a-ways to Jimtown.

483
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,321
Let's see now. That's $40.50.

484
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:21,789
- What else you got?
- Well, there's

485
00:37:22,356 --> 00:37:23,756
Two sacks of rabbit skins,

486
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:26,858
This here clock
and a sack of goose feathers.

487
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:33,795
I tell you, Alvin,

488
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:37,663
I'll give you 50 United States dollars
for the whole caboodle.

489
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,831
- $50 for everything?
- That's the best I can do.

490
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:44,367
- Sounds like an awful little.
- Take it or leave it.

491
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:47,868
Can you... Can you do any better
on the price of the land?

492
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,703
Not a cent. $120.

493
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,303
- How much time I got to pay for the rest?
- Sixty days.

494
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,972
Well, it's a bargain. I'll take it.

495
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:59,207
Well, then I reckon
we can put it in writing.

496
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,709
You understand now, don't you, Alvin?

497
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,444
If I don't get my money afore the 60 days,

498
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:10,946
You lose the whole caboodle
and you don't get the land.

499
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:14,881
Now, $70 is a lot of money
for a fellow like you to get his hands on.

500
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,882
It's more than a dollar a day.

501
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:20,184
Now then, 60 days is all you got.

502
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:25,553
Sixty days and sixty nights.

503
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:27,387
What?

504
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:29,054
Well, the way I figure,

505
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:33,557
If I count the nights, too, I got
nigh onto four months to pay you off.

506
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,492
Well, that's one way of figuring it.

507
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:40,793
Well, I'll tell you.

508
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,861
I was figuring on taking
'em rocks out myself, Alvin.

509
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:47,496
But if you're willing to take on the job
at 75 cents a day,

510
00:38:47,663 --> 00:38:48,731
- well, I...
- I'll take it.

511
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:50,832
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

512
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:54,028
Well, I tell you. I was thinking
maybe I could shoe your mules for you.

513
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:58,163
Sorry, Alvin. Had 'em shod
just yesterday over to Possum Trot.

514
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,832
Might give you two, three days
work though, splitting rails.

515
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,399
That's good.

516
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:23,709
Oh, I reckon it's worth about...

517
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,444
- $3.
- $3?

518
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:31,046
Why, that's a right fair price, Pastor.

519
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,547
I only worked two days to get it.

520
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:35,681
It's worth it

521
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:37,982
To me.

522
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,883
All right, George, let him go.

523
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,384
Giddap, Noah, giddap. Come on.

524
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:44,552
- Giddap, Noah.
- Giddap, Noah.

525
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,986
Come on, Noah.

526
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,853
Come on.

527
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,528
Whoa, Noah.

528
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,798
What... Why, Miss Gracie,

529
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:13,466
I was thinking you was to the dance.

530
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:16,133
No. I ain't at the dance.

531
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:19,235
No. No, I can see that.

532
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:21,669
Alvin, I...

533
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,570
Yeah?

534
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:27,172
- Alvin, I just...
- Yeah?

535
00:41:28,473 --> 00:41:29,473
I...

536
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,307
Alvin...

537
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,380
That's what I was wanting to tell you.

538
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,218
Giddap, Noah.

539
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:16,924
Lord...

540
00:43:18,124 --> 00:43:19,758
Lord, if you can,

541
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:22,926
Help him to be getting his land.

542
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:25,394
Amen.

543
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,762
All right, George.

544
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:31,096
Again.

545
00:43:32,964 --> 00:43:34,198
Again.

546
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:37,899
Gotta get under there.

547
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,573
It ain't no use, George.

548
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:52,941
I can't do it.

549
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,476
- Yes, you can.
- I tell you, I can't do it!

550
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:08,447
My time's up tomorrow night!

551
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,250
There ain't enough money
for the bottomland.

552
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:17,619
I can't get the rest!

553
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:22,621
How?

554
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:25,789
How am I gonna do it?

555
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:48,833
- Howdy, Alvin.
- Mr. Tomkins, I've got to talk to you.

556
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,235
Well, I reckon it's money
what talks the loudest.

557
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:52,802
You got the rest of your payment?

558
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:55,237
- Well, no, I ain't got it all.
- That's bad.

559
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:59,272
- But I can get it for you by Saturday.
- Saturday ain't Tuesday.

560
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:01,739
All I'm asking is, is for four extra days.

561
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:04,007
How can I be sure
you'll get it by Saturday?

562
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:07,642
Well, there's a beef and turkey shoot
coming up. You must've heard about it.

563
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,977
- Yeah.
- I'm aiming to cut five targets

564
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:12,612
And win the beef critter
and then put him up for cash money.

565
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:14,513
- It ain't likely.
- Oh, yes, it is.

566
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,514
- That'll take some shooting, Alvin.
- But I could do it.

567
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,782
Well, I'd like to do you
a favor, Alvin, but...

568
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:21,849
Will you?

569
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:24,017
There's another fellow
asking for that land.

570
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:26,618
- You ain't letting him have it.
- I don't know.

571
00:45:26,785 --> 00:45:29,986
I was telling him
your option was up Tuesday and...

572
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:34,288
But I got to have 'em extra days,
Mr. Tomkins. I just got to.

573
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:37,490
Well, I oughtn't to do it,

574
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:40,324
But I reckon he can wait till Saturday.

575
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:44,026
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tomkins.
I'll sure get it for you.

576
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:45,827
Yes, I sure will.

577
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:54,365
You plumb missed him but you cut wood.

578
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:57,933
It ain't the log you're supposed to shoot,
Zeke, it's the critter behind it.

579
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,168
You better get yourself
a pair of 'em specs, Zeke.

580
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:03,269
He won't stick his head up
so I can get a shot at him.

581
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:05,370
Jim Corey, next shooter.

582
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,142
Reckon he's laying an egg back there, Jim?

583
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,876
Yeah, he might be.

584
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:22,778
You missed!

585
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:25,612
Doggone it, that turkey can sure hide.

586
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:28,047
Maybe he wants to keep his head.

587
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:30,048
Alvin York, next shooter.

588
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:32,716
Bust him in the eye, Alvin,
if he winks at you.

589
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:35,250
Shoot him when he ain't looking.

590
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:42,354
You better sight him mighty fine, Alvin.
That there is the last turkey.

591
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:46,622
You can't hit him
if you can't see him, Alvin.

592
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,125
Better wait till he goes to roost, Alvin.

593
00:46:58,528 --> 00:46:59,962
You got meat!

594
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:02,230
He sure busted him wide open.

595
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,031
I reckon
you just got to talk their language, Alvin.

596
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,165
I reckon you do.

597
00:47:06,332 --> 00:47:09,300
You sure got him, Alvin. Ought to be
eating good if he ain't too tough.

598
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:10,568
This here bird ain't for eating.

599
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:13,635
Come on, fellows.
Get your targets ready for the beef shoot.

600
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:16,803
Rules same as all as were.
Shots are $1 a piece.

601
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,904
The two best shooters
get the hindquarters.

602
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:20,972
The next two get the forequarters.

603
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,973
Fifth man gets the hide and the tallow.

604
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,274
The sixth man gets to dig the lead
out of the tree.

605
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:27,509
All right, pay your dollar
and draw your number.

606
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:31,311
Load her up careful, George.
We got a long ways to paddle.

607
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,345
- Here you be, Alvin.
- Thankee.

608
00:47:33,511 --> 00:47:35,712
Hey, Zeke, you ain't paid your dollar yet.

609
00:47:35,879 --> 00:47:39,148
Why, sure enough.
I reckon it just slipped my mind.

610
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:42,049
How much for this here bird?

611
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,151
Well, I can't give you
any more than one shot, I reckon.

612
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:49,853
I'll be taking it and give me four more.

613
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,121
Five shots? Am I hearing you right, Alvin?

614
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:56,156
I'm a wanting five shots, Lem.

615
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:58,757
You figuring to get that whole critter?

616
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,324
My mind's sort of running that a-way.

617
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:02,191
Where'd you get 'em ideas, Alvin?

618
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:04,860
You sure got some shooters against you.

619
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:07,428
They'll get a chance
when I put the critter up again.

620
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:10,429
I'm a-needing cash money
and I'm gonna get it.

621
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:14,397
Ain't nobody ever cut five centers
unless it were Daniel Boone.

622
00:48:14,564 --> 00:48:17,166
And you ain't wearing no coonskin hat.

623
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,666
I ain't a-needing one.

624
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,505
Number eight next.

625
00:48:39,276 --> 00:48:40,676
Number nine.

626
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,101
How do they stand so far, Luke?

627
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,601
Ain't nobody cut center but Alvin York.

628
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:36,603
Alvin cut dead center all four times.

629
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:42,139
Two more shooters.
Tom Carver, you're first.

630
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:43,973
Alvin's got one more coming.

631
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,641
Get going, Tom.

632
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:01,881
You better draw down, Alvin.

633
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:09,685
You got to beat Tom's shot
if you want to get the whole beef, Alvin.

634
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,726
What do it look like?

635
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:29,227
It looks like plumb middle to me.

636
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:46,702
Well, Tom ain't more than a hair off,

637
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:50,237
But Alvin's done cut dead center,
fair and square.

638
00:50:50,671 --> 00:50:54,139
- Howdy, Daniel Boone.
- There's your beef, Alvin. All yours.

639
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:57,707
- Five centers is right smart shooting.
- I ain't seen it like since the big one.

640
00:50:57,874 --> 00:51:00,675
Well, any of you fellows
want another chance at that critter,

641
00:51:00,842 --> 00:51:02,676
Why, just drop a dollar a piece
in this here hat.

642
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:04,577
Are you shooting against us, Alvin?

643
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:06,711
- No, hey, not this time.
- I ain't got a dollar.

644
00:51:06,878 --> 00:51:08,879
- Lend me a dollar, Lem.
- Here's my dollar, Alvin.

645
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:11,147
You... You lend me a couple of...

646
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:13,015
- Howdy, Miss Miranda.
- Howdy.

647
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:14,582
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, there.

648
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:16,483
- You all come over to see the shooting?
- Yeah.

649
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,717
It's all over now.

650
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:21,985
Alvin York cut center five times
and won Lem's beef critter on the hoof.

651
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:24,353
- Alvin won Lem's beef critter?
- Sure did.

652
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,921
- Well, I'll be danged.
- And he's putting him up again.

653
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:29,555
Well, boys, get your targets ready.

654
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:33,090
Oh, Mr. Tomkins,
I was just coming over to see you.

655
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:37,660
Here you be, $26. And I've got
the rest of it right here in my pocket.

656
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:41,762
I'm right sorry, Alvin, but I just sold that
bottomland to Zeb here.

657
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:45,330
- You're telling me you...
- Now, don't go raring off, Alvin.

658
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:46,930
I never figured you'd get that money.

659
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:49,399
Anyway, your time was rightly up
last Tuesday.

660
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,433
- Why, you allowed I could have more...
- But it wasn't in writing.

661
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,900
But I was a-taking your word for it...

662
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:56,769
And Zeb here paid me cash money
all down.

663
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:59,603
- He did, did he?
- It ain't my fault. He sold it to me.

664
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,104
Now look here...

665
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:02,438
Alvin!

666
00:52:02,905 --> 00:52:04,105
Business is business.

667
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:05,506
- Wait a minute!
- Get out of here!

668
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:06,774
You better get, both of you!

669
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:10,909
It ain't no use, Alvin. You'd only be
fixing yourself for trouble.

670
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:16,178
I was... I was aiming to get that
piece of land.

671
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:17,545
Well, it weren't to be.

672
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:21,580
Mind you, Alvin, we can't always
figure the ways of Providence.

673
00:52:24,882 --> 00:52:26,116
Alvin...

674
00:52:29,184 --> 00:52:33,119
- Alvin, it don't make no difference.
- It do to me.

675
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,623
Come on, Buck.

676
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,397
Swing her, Buck, swing her!

677
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:03,033
I sure do admire big women. She's about
that biggest that I ever did see.

678
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:10,236
Three women in one she is, Alvin.
A whole passel of women.

679
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,871
Hey, a fellow who'd marry her'd
be a bigamist.

680
00:53:14,272 --> 00:53:19,041
See? Big-muss. Yes, sir, bigamist.

681
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,542
Told me I could have 'em extra days.

682
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:26,111
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
- His word weren't no count.

683
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,713
Forget about Nate Tomkins, will you?

684
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:31,580
Quit pestering yourself. It ain't no use.

685
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:34,549
Look at that there big woman.

686
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:38,483
Why don't you have a turn with her, Alvin?
Take you back to your log rolling days.

687
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,051
"Business is business."

688
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:43,786
Well, once around her
is twice around Bear Mountain.

689
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:47,722
Look at Buck here, Alvin.
He's plumb tuckered out.

690
00:53:47,888 --> 00:53:50,256
- I sure am.
- Well, he might be,

691
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:53,124
Dancing around a whole passel of women
that-a-way.

692
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,958
- Another bottle, Marter.
- Sure.

693
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,759
That land were mine.

694
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:59,460
Ain't nobody gonna get it away from me.

695
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:04,630
I'd sure like to see you
toad-hop her about, Alvin.

696
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:07,063
I'm a-drinking against Nate Tomkins.

697
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,999
Now, how about that there big woman?

698
00:54:10,732 --> 00:54:12,300
Alvin, you better be a-staying here.

699
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,134
- Let go of me.
- We'll go along with you.

700
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:16,434
What I got to do is my own.

701
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:27,674
It sure ain't a good night for a killing.

702
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:31,509
There's no stopping him now, I reckon.

703
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:49,474
Give me that old time religion.

704
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:27,287
- Howdy, Mr. Tomkins.
- Look here. Stand where you are.

705
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:28,922
Don't you come any closer.

706
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,090
- Mr. Tomkins, I just want to...
- Come closer and I'll hit you.

707
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:34,458
No need of getting riled, Mr. Tomkins.

708
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:38,026
- I ain't a-looking for no trouble with you.
- What you doing around here?

709
00:58:38,193 --> 00:58:40,626
- Well, I want to talk to you about...
- What about?

710
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:42,028
About Abraham.

711
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:44,929
That mule's legally mine.
You ain't got no claim on him.

712
00:58:45,096 --> 00:58:46,362
Well, I ain't denying he's yours...

713
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:50,531
Stay where you are if you don't want to be
laid out in two pieces.

714
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:54,566
Well, I was a-figuring
on a-buying Abraham back.

715
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,068
- Buying him back?
- Yes, sir.

716
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:59,168
My mule's kind of poorly,

717
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,970
And something done happened to him
and I sure need a mule.

718
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,971
- Are you meaning it?
- Yes, sir.

719
00:59:06,405 --> 00:59:08,005
No hard feelings?

720
00:59:08,472 --> 00:59:12,274
- Shucks, no, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

721
00:59:12,808 --> 00:59:15,609
And... And there's one more thing.

722
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:20,078
I'm asking your forgiveness
for a-flaring up at you the way I done.

723
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:23,012
It were Satan a-speaking out of me.

724
00:59:25,847 --> 00:59:29,583
Zeke was a-telling me, but I...
I couldn't believe him.

725
00:59:29,749 --> 00:59:31,784
- About what?
- That you got religion.

726
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:35,452
- Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins.
- Well, I'll be damned.

727
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,520
Well, I sure would like to be a-buying
that there mule back.

728
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:39,954
- You would, huh?
- Yeah.

729
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,122
- How much would you be asking for him?
- Well, let's see.

730
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:46,257
You said he was worth $40
and I allowed you $30.

731
00:59:46,424 --> 00:59:47,524
That's right.

732
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:51,159
Well, you can have him back for $20.

733
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:55,261
Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth
a sight more than that.

734
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:56,495
Maybe he is,

735
00:59:56,662 --> 01:00:01,631
But seeing as how I'm trying to do
the fair and square thing, Alvin, $20.

736
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:07,767
I reckon I know what you're thinking.
It's more blessed to give than to receive.

737
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:10,201
Maybe. Come on, get your mule.

738
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:13,537
And another thing, I'm gonna
give you back the clock you sold me.

739
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:16,037
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it don't run nohow.

740
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:35,347
- Howdy, Mr. Andrews.
- Howdy.

741
01:00:35,513 --> 01:00:38,282
I'd kind of like to see Zeb,
are he hereabout?

742
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:39,816
Maybe he is.

743
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:42,516
I sure would like to have words with him.

744
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:46,452
You coming peaceful?

745
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:50,020
Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews.
I ain't looking for no trouble.

746
01:00:50,654 --> 01:00:52,655
Zeb. Come out of there.

747
01:00:54,222 --> 01:00:55,689
There he be.

748
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,658
Howdy.

749
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:01,792
What you'd be wanting with me,
Alvin York?

750
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:05,294
I want to talk to you, Zeb, about...
About that there piece of land.

751
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,328
I bought it, it's mine.

752
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,296
I know it, but...

753
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:11,564
Sure it's yours, Zeb, but...

754
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:15,833
But Nate Tomkins was...
Was a-figuring that...

755
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,700
I ain't caring
what Nate Tomkins was a-figuring.

756
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:23,036
- Well, Nate was just thinking...
- It's mine and I'm gonna keep it.

757
01:01:23,203 --> 01:01:25,905
Well, sure it's yours, Zeb,
but if you'll only allow me to talk...

758
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,205
Ain't nobody a-holding you.

759
01:01:28,505 --> 01:01:30,173
Oh, yes, they are.

760
01:01:30,907 --> 01:01:33,741
Well, anyway, Nate was a-thinking
that your being so busy here,

761
01:01:33,908 --> 01:01:36,309
Maybe you need some extra help
on the other piece of land.

762
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:40,178
- Well, what's that got to do with you?
- Well, I'm asking you for the job.

763
01:01:40,344 --> 01:01:44,813
- You mean you're aiming to work for me?
- I'd be if you allow me.

764
01:01:45,346 --> 01:01:48,081
Well, shucks. That sure got me stumped.

765
01:01:48,848 --> 01:01:51,750
I was a-buying that land just to spite you.

766
01:01:52,384 --> 01:01:55,018
Well, I sure don't blame you none.

767
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:58,586
Well, maybe we can figure it
so you can sharecrop the piece.

768
01:01:58,753 --> 01:02:00,554
Then you kind of be a-working for yourself.

769
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,354
No, I ain't asking for anything extra, Zeb.

770
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:05,657
Well, if you can farm that bottomland
like you've been doing the top,

771
01:02:05,824 --> 01:02:09,325
I reckon that land will be yours
in a couple of seasons.

772
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:13,194
Well, with the help of the Lord,
I'll make you a good crop.

773
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:14,828
Like I'm saying, Miss Gracie,

774
01:02:14,994 --> 01:02:18,362
I ain't ever seen a prettier piece of land
than that there Andrews farm.

775
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:21,163
Corn is thicker than fur on a squirrel.

776
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,866
And I seen eight beef critters
a-grazing in the pasture there.

777
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,866
That are a lot of critters.

778
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:31,035
And that Zeb Andrews
sure are a forgiving man.

779
01:02:31,202 --> 01:02:33,203
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.

780
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:35,070
Be sitting, Alvin.

781
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:39,940
- And a Christian man, if I ever seen one.
- Reckon so.

782
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:42,740
What I done to him that night
we were visiting you weren't right.

783
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:45,342
The devil was a-pushing me from behind.

784
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:47,909
It were too dark. I couldn't see.

785
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:51,178
I didn't have no call
to come twixt you and him.

786
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:53,879
What are you getting at, Alvin York?

787
01:02:54,046 --> 01:02:56,280
All I'm aiming to say, Miss Gracie, is,

788
01:02:56,447 --> 01:03:00,116
A upstanding man like Zeb Andrews
would make a girl a right smart husband.

789
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:01,683
- What's that?
- And...

790
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:06,385
And if you change your mind about Zeb,
well, I reckon I could...

791
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:10,221
- You could what?
- I could rightly understand.

792
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,255
Oh, you could, could you?

793
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:16,590
Lookee here, Alvin York,

794
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:18,724
If I wanted Zeb Andrews for a husband,

795
01:03:18,891 --> 01:03:21,292
I reckon I could get him
without your acting so noble.

796
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:23,594
- I done kissed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

797
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,261
Well, I don't go around kissing men
I ain't gonna be a-marrying.

798
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:27,895
Now you be a-listening to me.

799
01:03:28,062 --> 01:03:30,130
- Am I marrying a piece of land?
- Yes. No.

800
01:03:30,296 --> 01:03:31,364
- Or a beef critter?
- No.

801
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,531
Or a field of corn?

802
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:35,066
No, it's you I'm marrying,
ain't nobody else in this here world.

803
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:36,199
- Are you hearing me?
- Yes.

804
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:38,300
Well, then don't you talk that way
to me again, Alvin!

805
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:40,268
- No.
- Don't you ever!

806
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:44,036
Oh!

807
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:52,373
The Lord sure do move
in mysterious ways.

808
01:03:54,808 --> 01:03:58,943
So that's what the Lord done said to Cain
when he done killed Abel.

809
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,745
It was a way of telling him
that he wouldn't get no crops no more.

810
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:05,280
And anybody that's a farmer
knows what that means.

811
01:04:05,447 --> 01:04:08,548
Alvin, how do you know that it happened
just that-a-way?

812
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:10,449
A-seeing how you weren't there.

813
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:11,949
Well, the Book says so.

814
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:16,118
And there ain't nothing written
in the Book that ain't the truth.

815
01:04:19,486 --> 01:04:21,654
So, a long time after that

816
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:25,289
When the Lord was a-giving Moses
the Ten Commandments,

817
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,724
He was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

818
01:04:29,258 --> 01:04:30,958
Now... Now go ahead with the reading.

819
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:35,060
Hey! Hey! War! Hey!

820
01:04:35,227 --> 01:04:37,495
Hey! Pastor Pile!

821
01:04:37,895 --> 01:04:39,829
- What's happened, Luke?
- It's war.

822
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:42,898
President Wilson done declared war
against Germany.

823
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:44,465
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.

824
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,433
It says so right here in this here paper.

825
01:04:58,672 --> 01:05:02,107
Here you are, Jim.
I reckon I won't wait to be drafted.

826
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:05,308
- I'm joining up as soon as the corn's in.
- Me, too.

827
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:09,110
Attaboy, Tom. I heard my daddy talk
about fighting Yankees.

828
01:05:09,277 --> 01:05:12,344
And my granddaddy
done fought in the Revolution.

829
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:14,979
Sure wish I was a young fellow.

830
01:05:15,146 --> 01:05:18,347
Well, come along, Zeke.
You load 'em and I'll shoot 'em.

831
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:21,516
- Hi, Alvin.
- Hi, Alvin.

832
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:23,184
Hey, Alvin, what about you?

833
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,818
You joining up now
or you waiting to be called?

834
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:27,852
I reckon I'm a-waiting.

835
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:30,187
- Howdy, Ike.
- Hi, Alvin.

836
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:34,189
Howdy, Alvin.

837
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:37,490
Good morning, Pastor.
Reckon I need some coal oil.

838
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:41,092
I'm glad you come in, Alvin.
I was gonna send for you.

839
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:42,659
You was?

840
01:05:43,593 --> 01:05:47,128
- You ain't registered yet, have you, Alvin?
- Of course I ain't.

841
01:05:47,295 --> 01:05:50,196
Is that the new seed
you was gonna send for?

842
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:57,133
It's Tuesday, Alvin. You only got till 6:00.

843
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,301
I ain't a-gonna register.

844
01:06:00,468 --> 01:06:01,768
Come here.

845
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,038
- You gotta register, Alvin.
- I ain't a-going to. I ain't a-going to war.

846
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,040
War is killing
and the Book's against killing.

847
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:14,941
So war is against the Book.

848
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:17,142
You're plumb right, Alvin.

849
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:20,211
You got the using kind of religion,
not the meetinghouse kind, but you...

850
01:06:20,378 --> 01:06:22,945
- The kind I got's the kind you teached me.
- I know that.

851
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:26,047
And I hate to be telling you, but
I don't want to see you get in no trouble.

852
01:06:26,213 --> 01:06:27,180
Now, you got to register

853
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:28,781
And there ain't no way
you can get out of it.

854
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:30,353
You mean they can make
you go to war

855
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,353
even if it's against what
you think is right?

856
01:06:32,383 --> 01:06:36,051
No, no, no, they won't make you do
that. It's what I want to tell you.

857
01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:37,552
Come here.

858
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:41,121
It's right here.

859
01:06:42,054 --> 01:06:43,388
Let me see.

860
01:06:43,821 --> 01:06:47,890
Now, wait a minute. Here.
There it is right there, see?

861
01:06:48,224 --> 01:06:50,991
"Members of well-recognized
religious sects

862
01:06:51,158 --> 01:06:54,960
"whose existent creed
forbids its members to participate in war

863
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:58,828
"are entitled to request exemption
from military service."

864
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:00,796
What... What's that there exemption?

865
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:04,765
Well, that, it means,
if you're exempted, you don't have to go.

866
01:07:04,898 --> 01:07:06,532
Well, how do I get this exemption?

867
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:09,900
Well, you got to write a letter
to the draft board.

868
01:07:10,668 --> 01:07:13,069
- Is that all there is to it?
- Yep.

869
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:17,405
Well. Well, sure I'll register.
Will you write the letter for me?

870
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,572
Why, I'd be glad to, Alvin.
Come on over here.

871
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:25,308
"Therefore, we find
that we can't consider your church

872
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,075
"a well-recognized religious sect,

873
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:30,644
"organized and existing, May 18,1917.

874
01:07:31,944 --> 01:07:35,246
"We find further, that it has
no special creed except the Bible,

875
01:07:35,446 --> 01:07:38,580
"which can be interpreted
by its members as they choose.

876
01:07:38,747 --> 01:07:40,914
"And finally, there's nothing
in the creed of the church,

877
01:07:41,081 --> 01:07:43,916
"expressly forbidding its members
to participate in war.

878
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:47,418
"Therefore your application for exemption
is denied."

879
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,586
Is this here the last word
or has he got some place to appeal?

880
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:54,921
He can appeal to
the District Board at Nashville

881
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,422
And finally to the General Board
in Washington.

882
01:07:57,588 --> 01:07:59,323
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

883
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,991
You're welcome.

884
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:06,393
I'll be a-writing 'em appeals for you,
Alvin, so don't you be worrying.

885
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,161
Oh, I ain't a-worrying.

886
01:08:13,663 --> 01:08:16,098
We'll be a-fixing this here bridge.

887
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,270
There it is.

888
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,005
So, we'll be a-building the house
right over there by that tree.

889
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:34,506
And the big room is gonna be...

890
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:39,875
The big room is gonna be right...
Right here in front, just like this.

891
01:08:40,176 --> 01:08:42,143
And it's gonna have three windows.

892
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:46,479
And the kitchen will be here,
and it's gonna be good and big, too.

893
01:08:47,112 --> 01:08:49,346
- And there'll be a stove.
- Where?

894
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:51,514
Well, right about there.

895
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:53,882
And I'm gonna build you one of 'em sinks.

896
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:56,084
And I'm gonna give you a pump,
so you won't have to carry

897
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:57,217
No water from the springs.

898
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:59,251
- A pump, Alvin?
- Sure.

899
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,152
Alvin, pumps costs a heap of money.

900
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,021
Well, we're gonna have curtains in the
windows and carpets on the floors.

901
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:06,688
And it ain't gonna take very long either

902
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:09,290
If the Lord keeps a-showering
his blessings on me.

903
01:09:09,457 --> 01:09:11,524
Won't take more than two, three years,
I reckon.

904
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:16,293
Just to think, in two, three years,
a house right there where we're looking.

905
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:19,894
And it will be our house.

906
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:23,296
- Alvin.
- What do you want?

907
01:09:23,629 --> 01:09:25,630
Pastor Pile wants to see you, Alvin.

908
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:27,965
Well, Gracie and me
is kind of busy right now.

909
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:30,333
Well, tell him I'll stop by the store
on the way home.

910
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,533
He said he wants to see you right off.

911
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,135
He said you best be a-coming.

912
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:36,535
Well, tell him I'll be there.

913
01:09:36,902 --> 01:09:39,204
Shucks, just when we was having fun.

914
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:41,505
Would you be
a-telling me again sometime?

915
01:09:41,672 --> 01:09:43,039
I sure will.

916
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:57,379
- Howdy, Pastor.
- Howdy, Alvin.

917
01:09:57,712 --> 01:09:59,813
I got right bad news for you.

918
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,782
Word just come.
They're a-taking you for the army.

919
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:04,116
Well, that can't be.

920
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:07,250
That letter we done sent to Washington,
says that I was against fighting and...

921
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:09,351
They ain't going to exempt you, Alvin.

922
01:10:09,518 --> 01:10:12,519
You got to report to Nashville
tomorrow night.

923
01:10:12,786 --> 01:10:14,387
I ain't a-going.

924
01:10:16,055 --> 01:10:18,822
You ain't got no choice.
This was the last appeal.

925
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:21,758
I don't care about that. I ain't a-going.

926
01:10:22,224 --> 01:10:24,959
You've got to go, Alvin. It's the law.

927
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:26,059
What?

928
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,494
What kind of law is it
that says a man's got to go

929
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:30,662
Against the Book and its teachings?

930
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:33,663
Well, I reckon there ain't no answer, but,

931
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,698
If you don't go,
they'll be a-coming after you.

932
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:40,233
Well, they won't get me.
I'll go back in 'em hills.

933
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,067
Yeah, and they'll put hounds on your trail,

934
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:44,701
And they'll follow you
no matter how far back you go.

935
01:10:44,868 --> 01:10:46,963
Then they'd better not
catch up with me,

936
01:10:46,964 --> 01:10:49,410
'cause they'll be a-wishing
they hadn't. I...

937
01:10:54,673 --> 01:10:57,841
Sorry, Pastor, I... Them's sinful words.

938
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:00,742
I wasn't thinking of what I was saying.

939
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,511
I'll go.

940
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:09,680
War's away to the other side
of the ocean, Alvin.

941
01:11:10,147 --> 01:11:13,214
Lots of things can happen
before you get there.

942
01:11:14,382 --> 01:11:18,851
You put your trust in the Lord
and he'll look out for you.

943
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:20,918
I done forgot the Lord.

944
01:11:22,586 --> 01:11:25,187
I ain't never gonna forget him again.

945
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:29,589
Goodbye, Alvin.

946
01:11:47,864 --> 01:11:49,032
Well...

947
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:56,836
I reckon these'll do till I get fixed up
in government clothes.

948
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:10,842
The corn's doing right good
on the south hill.

949
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:13,510
It might need a little extra hoeing.

950
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,114
Mule's at the gate.
You got a long ways to go.

951
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,516
Well, you'll be taking care of things
from now on, George.

952
01:12:26,683 --> 01:12:27,850
Sure will.

953
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:30,852
I guess you'll be needing a man-sized gun.

954
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:34,886
- You can have my rifle.
- I'm a-thanking you.

955
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,856
Well...

956
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:43,758
I'm going.

957
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:52,528
I had to see you again, Alvin.
I just had to.

958
01:12:55,731 --> 01:12:57,098
Now, now...

959
01:13:01,599 --> 01:13:04,868
No, no, don't you be looking at me, please.

960
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:09,303
Don't want you to be
remembering me like this.

961
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:12,438
Close your eyes, please?

962
01:13:13,238 --> 01:13:14,439
Yessum.

963
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:17,574
- Are they closed?
- Yes.

964
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:29,979
Bye, Alvin.

965
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,917
I'll be a-coming back.

966
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:10,065
Bye, Alvin.

967
01:14:10,432 --> 01:14:12,299
I'll be a-coming back.

968
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:19,437
Ma.

969
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:22,938
What are they a-fighting for?

970
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,672
I don't rightly know, child.

971
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,941
I don't rightly know.

972
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,781
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

973
01:14:42,947 --> 01:14:44,314
Okay, Sarge.

974
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,718
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

975
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:53,019
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.

976
01:14:53,186 --> 01:14:54,686
Dig, soldiers, dig.

977
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:56,387
Dig your way straight down to China.

978
01:14:56,554 --> 01:14:58,321
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?

979
01:14:58,689 --> 01:15:02,824
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.

980
01:15:06,826 --> 01:15:08,794
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

981
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:11,227
Yes, sir.

982
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:13,362
Which one of your men is York?

983
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:15,963
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

984
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,698
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?

985
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,700
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

986
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,967
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.

987
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:25,368
Yes, sir.

988
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:32,971
That'll be a big help.

989
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:35,139
Dig. Dig. Dig.

990
01:15:36,473 --> 01:15:40,809
I've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

991
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:44,077
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.

992
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:46,144
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.

993
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:48,045
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

994
01:15:48,212 --> 01:15:50,813
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

995
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,980
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, I guess.

996
01:15:53,147 --> 01:15:55,582
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

997
01:15:55,749 --> 01:15:58,817
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

998
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:00,985
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.

999
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:02,852
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

1000
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:06,187
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?

1001
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,154
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

1002
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:10,522
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

1003
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:14,725
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

1004
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:18,059
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

1005
01:16:18,226 --> 01:16:19,760
It goes for miles.

1006
01:16:19,927 --> 01:16:22,261
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.

1007
01:16:22,762 --> 01:16:24,595
It doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

1008
01:16:24,762 --> 01:16:26,329
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.

1009
01:16:26,496 --> 01:16:28,564
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.

1010
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:31,398
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?

1011
01:16:31,565 --> 01:16:33,366
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?

1012
01:16:33,532 --> 01:16:35,734
Steam... No. Steam cars.

1013
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,835
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.

1014
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:41,269
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

1015
01:16:41,436 --> 01:16:43,604
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.

1016
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,171
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

1017
01:16:46,338 --> 01:16:48,206
I'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

1018
01:16:48,372 --> 01:16:51,141
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?

1019
01:16:51,308 --> 01:16:52,975
Just a word now and then.

1020
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:56,176
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

1021
01:16:56,343 --> 01:16:57,810
And they wanna get into the cars
all together.

1022
01:16:57,977 --> 01:16:59,611
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.

1023
01:16:59,778 --> 01:17:03,446
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

1024
01:17:03,613 --> 01:17:05,013
"Move back in the cars," I yell.

1025
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,015
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."

1026
01:17:08,182 --> 01:17:11,484
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

1027
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:12,784
That's why they call me "Pusher."

1028
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:14,685
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

1029
01:17:14,852 --> 01:17:16,853
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.

1030
01:17:17,353 --> 01:17:20,654
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.

1031
01:17:20,855 --> 01:17:23,790
- 2-4-1-8-0-0.
- Zaranopolis Nick.

1032
01:17:25,023 --> 01:17:27,824
2-4-1-8-0-1.

1033
01:17:27,991 --> 01:17:30,659
- 2-4-1-8-0-1.
- Ross, Michael T.

1034
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:32,827
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

1035
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:35,661
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.

1036
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:40,531
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.

1037
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:43,832
York, Alvin C.

1038
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,167
Anything wrong with it?

1039
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:48,968
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

1040
01:17:49,135 --> 01:17:53,237
I thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

1041
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,038
No, sir, I ain't.

1042
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:58,672
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

1043
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:00,740
- Next man.
- There you are, York.

1044
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:05,376
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.

1045
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:07,044
Thomas, Bert E.

1046
01:18:15,248 --> 01:18:17,214
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

1047
01:18:17,381 --> 01:18:19,382
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

1048
01:18:19,549 --> 01:18:20,717
Not bad.

1049
01:18:23,885 --> 01:18:24,985
You call that clean?

1050
01:18:25,152 --> 01:18:27,553
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.

1051
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,888
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.

1052
01:18:31,055 --> 01:18:32,655
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

1053
01:18:32,822 --> 01:18:34,023
Clean it.

1054
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:37,024
That's a good job, York.

1055
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:39,059
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

1056
01:18:39,225 --> 01:18:42,827
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.

1057
01:18:42,994 --> 01:18:44,561
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

1058
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:47,662
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.

1059
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:01,035
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

1060
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:02,337
Okay.

1061
01:19:02,503 --> 01:19:05,071
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

1062
01:19:05,237 --> 01:19:08,839
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

1063
01:19:09,006 --> 01:19:13,008
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.

1064
01:19:13,175 --> 01:19:15,076
So don't start murdering each other.

1065
01:19:15,242 --> 01:19:17,877
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

1066
01:19:18,043 --> 01:19:19,678
Ready, number 30.

1067
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:23,013
Not yet, we'll try it first.

1068
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,248
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

1069
01:19:27,415 --> 01:19:28,882
Take a deep breath.

1070
01:19:29,415 --> 01:19:31,250
Blow, let a little of it out.

1071
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,085
Hold it.

1072
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,585
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

1073
01:19:35,752 --> 01:19:37,586
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

1074
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:41,088
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

1075
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:43,756
Ready? Aim.

1076
01:19:46,224 --> 01:19:47,691
I can't hold it no more.

1077
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:50,226
All right, Ross, take another one.

1078
01:19:50,726 --> 01:19:51,793
Aim.

1079
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,127
Fire.

1080
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:57,196
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

1081
01:19:57,363 --> 01:19:58,429
Just like that.

1082
01:19:58,596 --> 01:19:59,896
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

1083
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:02,264
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?

1084
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,765
- Yeah.
- Here.

1085
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:05,899
Load.

1086
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,901
Aim.

1087
01:20:10,369 --> 01:20:13,236
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.

1088
01:20:13,737 --> 01:20:15,638
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

1089
01:20:15,804 --> 01:20:19,206
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

1090
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:26,909
- A miss.
- Miss.

1091
01:20:27,443 --> 01:20:29,111
Ready on number 29.

1092
01:20:29,711 --> 01:20:30,978
Ready on 29.

1093
01:20:31,145 --> 01:20:32,479
Ready, 29.

1094
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:37,548
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

1095
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:39,715
Aim. Fire.

1096
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:44,285
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

1097
01:20:44,451 --> 01:20:46,886
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

1098
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,453
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

1099
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,553
Yes, sir.

1100
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,489
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

1101
01:20:52,656 --> 01:20:54,757
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.

1102
01:20:54,923 --> 01:20:56,924
You reckon you know about that, do you?

1103
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,724
We'll see. Here.

1104
01:21:01,059 --> 01:21:02,927
Load. Aim.

1105
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:08,663
Fire.

1106
01:21:12,398 --> 01:21:14,098
- A miss!
- Miss.

1107
01:21:15,966 --> 01:21:18,434
So you know about sighting, do you?

1108
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,969
I sure thought I cut plumb center
that time.

1109
01:21:21,136 --> 01:21:22,469
You did, huh?

1110
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:26,238
I can't no ways see how I can miss
that whole great big target.

1111
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:28,973
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

1112
01:21:29,673 --> 01:21:31,140
Re-mark for 29.

1113
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:33,007
Re-mark, 29.

1114
01:21:33,474 --> 01:21:35,509
Oh, I didn't see that one.

1115
01:21:39,177 --> 01:21:42,179
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.

1116
01:21:42,579 --> 01:21:45,814
I can't figure out how I got
way down there on the edge.

1117
01:21:45,981 --> 01:21:49,282
Well, I reckon I can do a little better
when I get used to this here rifle gun.

1118
01:21:49,449 --> 01:21:51,817
Here's five chances to do better.

1119
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:58,687
Fire when ready.

1120
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:04,022
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

1121
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,757
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

1122
01:22:06,924 --> 01:22:10,593
I always wet my sights
when I'm fixing to do some shooting.

1123
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,160
Okay, do some shooting.

1124
01:22:21,998 --> 01:22:25,032
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.

1125
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,467
Okay, York. You're on your own.

1126
01:22:33,836 --> 01:22:36,304
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1127
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,975
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1128
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:51,345
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

1129
01:22:55,947 --> 01:22:57,882
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

1130
01:22:58,048 --> 01:22:59,983
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

1131
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,150
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

1132
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,285
Bring 29 to the firing line.

1133
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:13,788
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

1134
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:16,724
I reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

1135
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,358
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

1136
01:23:19,525 --> 01:23:22,126
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

1137
01:23:22,293 --> 01:23:25,895
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.

1138
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:28,396
But they was exaggerating some.

1139
01:23:30,564 --> 01:23:34,498
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

1140
01:23:34,665 --> 01:23:37,534
A-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

1141
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,234
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

1142
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:41,636
I'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

1143
01:23:41,802 --> 01:23:43,670
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

1144
01:23:43,837 --> 01:23:46,671
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.

1145
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:50,306
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.

1146
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,475
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

1147
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:55,242
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

1148
01:23:55,408 --> 01:23:56,910
Yeah, what's the answer?

1149
01:23:57,076 --> 01:23:59,210
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

1150
01:23:59,377 --> 01:24:01,578
The rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

1151
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,979
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

1152
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:07,714
And then the next one, see?

1153
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:10,416
Kind of coming from back to front.

1154
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:13,250
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

1155
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:14,417
And, if...

1156
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:17,386
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

1157
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,754
But if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

1158
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:21,855
He's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

1159
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:24,556
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

1160
01:24:24,722 --> 01:24:27,558
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

1161
01:24:27,723 --> 01:24:30,091
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

1162
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:33,393
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

1163
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,094
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?

1164
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:39,429
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.

1165
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:40,664
It's your move.

1166
01:24:43,765 --> 01:24:46,999
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.

1167
01:24:47,767 --> 01:24:52,069
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

1168
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:54,037
Made by your company sergeant.

1169
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:55,404
Yes, sir?

1170
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:58,205
You have a very excellent camp record.

1171
01:24:59,005 --> 01:25:01,373
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

1172
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,074
You applied for exemption, I believe,
as a conscientious objector.

1173
01:25:05,241 --> 01:25:06,541
Yes, sir.

1174
01:25:06,741 --> 01:25:09,243
Well, I think we can disregard that.

1175
01:25:10,076 --> 01:25:13,245
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

1176
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:15,378
To the rank of corporal with special detail

1177
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:18,180
As instructor in target practice.

1178
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:21,081
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.

1179
01:25:21,248 --> 01:25:23,249
I congratulate you, York.

1180
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:28,385
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

1181
01:25:29,252 --> 01:25:32,254
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best I can,

1182
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,688
Like I already done Pusher and Bert.

1183
01:25:34,855 --> 01:25:39,424
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

1184
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:43,459
Well, I don't want to be no corporal.

1185
01:25:43,626 --> 01:25:46,727
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.

1186
01:25:46,927 --> 01:25:49,962
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

1187
01:25:50,129 --> 01:25:51,729
Well, you see, I...

1188
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,531
Is it because of your
religious convictions, York?

1189
01:25:54,698 --> 01:25:56,398
Yes, sir. That's it.

1190
01:25:56,932 --> 01:25:59,233
You see, I believe in the Bible,

1191
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:04,102
And I'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

1192
01:26:04,269 --> 01:26:06,603
Is something the Lord done give us.

1193
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,438
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

1194
01:26:09,605 --> 01:26:13,540
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks

1195
01:26:13,707 --> 01:26:18,041
Ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

1196
01:26:19,776 --> 01:26:21,943
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.

1197
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,978
York, with your permission, Major?

1198
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,646
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

1199
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,981
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

1200
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:31,615
Yes, sir.

1201
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:33,382
Well, I do, too.

1202
01:26:33,783 --> 01:26:36,950
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

1203
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:39,452
For what he believes to be right?

1204
01:26:39,786 --> 01:26:41,486
Well, it done said,

1205
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,921
"Blessed are the peacemakers."

1206
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:45,755
Yes, I know, but...

1207
01:26:46,789 --> 01:26:49,791
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke,

1208
01:26:50,223 --> 01:26:54,793
Where he says, "He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one"?

1209
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:56,794
He said that to Peter.

1210
01:26:57,294 --> 01:26:59,228
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

1211
01:26:59,395 --> 01:27:03,431
He said, "Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword."

1212
01:27:03,596 --> 01:27:05,165
That were further on.

1213
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:08,566
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

1214
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,801
But according to St. John,

1215
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,402
He said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

1216
01:27:14,803 --> 01:27:17,970
"If my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight."

1217
01:27:18,137 --> 01:27:19,905
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

1218
01:27:20,072 --> 01:27:23,139
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

1219
01:27:23,473 --> 01:27:25,474
And that... That is different.

1220
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:28,142
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.

1221
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:31,110
York, have you ever read this?

1222
01:27:31,443 --> 01:27:33,745
<i>"History of the United States."</i>

1223
01:27:36,913 --> 01:27:39,047
It sure is a lot of writing.

1224
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,783
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:47,751
You know about him?

1226
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,252
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

1227
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:52,453
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

1228
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,855
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

1229
01:27:56,955 --> 01:27:59,423
And that book's full of great men.

1230
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:05,126
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

1231
01:28:05,293 --> 01:28:07,527
When he went out alone
into the wilderness?

1232
01:28:07,694 --> 01:28:10,062
Well, I never thought much on it.

1233
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:12,629
Was he looking for new lands?

1234
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:14,564
- Might be.
- Maybe.

1235
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:17,466
Maybe for something more.

1236
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:22,534
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

1237
01:28:23,768 --> 01:28:27,103
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

1238
01:28:27,269 --> 01:28:29,604
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.

1239
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:33,639
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

1240
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,475
I think that's what he wanted.

1241
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:40,410
I think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

1242
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:43,077
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?

1243
01:28:43,244 --> 01:28:44,377
Yep.

1244
01:28:44,978 --> 01:28:48,446
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

1245
01:28:48,613 --> 01:28:51,014
From the very beginning until now.

1246
01:28:51,148 --> 01:28:53,249
For we're still struggling.

1247
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:55,950
It's quite a story, York.

1248
01:28:56,484 --> 01:28:59,718
How they all got together
and set up a government,

1249
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:04,454
Whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

1250
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:07,622
And each man
to defend the rights of all men.

1251
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:11,657
We call it a government of the people,

1252
01:29:12,492 --> 01:29:15,326
By the people and for the people.

1253
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,428
Why, I never knowed
it was all written down.

1254
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:23,563
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.

1255
01:29:24,864 --> 01:29:26,931
You want to worship God
in your own way.

1256
01:29:27,098 --> 01:29:28,132
Yes, sir.

1257
01:29:28,298 --> 01:29:30,333
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.

1258
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,634
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

1259
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:35,902
And raise your family
according to your own likes?

1260
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:39,937
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

1261
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:42,072
But the cost of that heritage is high.

1262
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:46,107
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

1263
01:29:47,141 --> 01:29:49,442
How you gonna answer that, York?

1264
01:29:50,842 --> 01:29:52,077
Well...

1265
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:56,312
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

1266
01:29:58,347 --> 01:30:00,148
Well, take your time.

1267
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:05,683
Well, if I could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, I...

1268
01:30:05,884 --> 01:30:08,418
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...

1269
01:30:09,685 --> 01:30:11,952
I could figure something out.

1270
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,321
I've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

1271
01:30:15,487 --> 01:30:17,955
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

1272
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:19,756
You mean I can go home?

1273
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,891
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

1274
01:30:22,058 --> 01:30:23,059
I'll recommend your exemption.

1275
01:30:23,224 --> 01:30:25,426
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.

1276
01:30:25,592 --> 01:30:27,627
I'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

1277
01:30:27,794 --> 01:30:29,628
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1278
01:30:30,228 --> 01:30:32,396
I sure would like to read this here book.

1279
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:35,164
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

1280
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:38,698
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

1281
01:30:54,573 --> 01:30:56,007
Come on, boy.

1282
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,735
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

1283
01:31:55,469 --> 01:31:57,103
Can't say, child.

1284
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,005
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

1285
01:32:02,171 --> 01:32:06,474
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

1286
01:32:07,174 --> 01:32:10,142
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

1287
01:32:10,309 --> 01:32:12,143
He can't read the Book.

1288
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:14,845
Get the table set.

1289
01:32:20,014 --> 01:32:22,948
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

1290
01:32:23,682 --> 01:32:25,850
Want George to go get him, Ma?

1291
01:32:28,784 --> 01:32:30,185
Let him be.

1292
01:32:47,559 --> 01:32:49,361
<i>Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.</i>

1293
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:52,029
<i>But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.</i>

1294
01:32:52,195 --> 01:32:55,125
<i>Them that lived by the sword,
will be a-perishing by the sword.</i>

1295
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,231
<i>The government of all men to
defend the rights of each man.</i>

1296
01:32:57,398 --> 01:32:59,332
<i>And each man to defend
the rights of all men.</i>

1297
01:32:59,499 --> 01:33:02,134
<i>Remember, the Lord done
said, thou shalt not kill.</i>

1298
01:33:02,301 --> 01:33:04,235
<i>But the cost of that heritage is high.</i>

1299
01:33:04,402 --> 01:33:07,038
<i>Sometimes all we have to
preserve it, even our lives.</i>

1300
01:33:07,073 --> 01:33:09,170
<i>- Obey your God.
- Defend your country.</i>

1301
01:33:09,337 --> 01:33:12,405
<i>- Your God.
- Your country...</i>

1302
01:33:12,571 --> 01:33:16,140
<i>- God.
- Country...</i>

1303
01:33:28,246 --> 01:33:30,847
"Render therefore unto Caesar

1304
01:33:31,213 --> 01:33:33,548
"the things which were Caesar's,

1305
01:33:34,082 --> 01:33:38,884
"and unto God
the things that were God's."

1306
01:33:41,552 --> 01:33:44,354
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.

1307
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:50,388
And unto God, God's.

1308
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,898
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.

1309
01:34:10,065 --> 01:34:12,099
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

1310
01:34:16,335 --> 01:34:19,769
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.

1311
01:34:19,936 --> 01:34:21,770
Well, you're welcome, York.

1312
01:34:21,937 --> 01:34:24,538
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.

1313
01:34:24,705 --> 01:34:27,573
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.

1314
01:34:28,206 --> 01:34:29,941
I rather hoped that you would, York.

1315
01:34:30,107 --> 01:34:33,743
But there's just one thing, sir,
that I ought to tell you.

1316
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:35,611
There's lots of things...

1317
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,777
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.

1318
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:40,779
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

1319
01:34:40,946 --> 01:34:44,581
But it's... Well, it's just like
Pastor Pile done told me.

1320
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:49,583
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than I be.

1321
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:56,920
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

1322
01:34:57,787 --> 01:35:00,289
It's enough for me that I trust you.

1323
01:35:00,788 --> 01:35:04,357
And I believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

1324
01:35:04,523 --> 01:35:05,691
Thank you, sir.

1325
01:35:05,858 --> 01:35:09,593
And I'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

1326
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,462
Well, I'll sure take care of my men
the best I can, sir.

1327
01:35:13,629 --> 01:35:15,463
I know you will, York.

1328
01:35:16,096 --> 01:35:18,264
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.

1329
01:35:21,765 --> 01:35:25,567
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

1330
01:35:26,067 --> 01:35:28,936
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

1331
01:35:29,769 --> 01:35:31,970
No, I don't think so, Captain.

1332
01:35:32,704 --> 01:35:35,605
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.

1333
01:35:43,976 --> 01:35:45,310
"Dear Mom,

1334
01:35:45,644 --> 01:35:49,812
"am feeling just fine
and have taken in all the sights.

called Notre Dame Cathedral.

to plant a crop of corn.

to front pretty soon.

1339

'cause we got all our training

1340
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:16,924

for no sight-seeing tour..."

1341
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:19,092
"Tour, nohow.

she was a-worrying.

"Tell her, don't."

1344
01:36:27,864 --> 01:36:30,865
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.

1345
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:34,667
It ain't right for us to
be a-feared, Gracie.

1346
01:36:36,034 --> 01:36:37,901
Alvin's in good hands.

1347
01:36:39,269 --> 01:36:42,737
The Lord takes care of 'em
that's a-believing in Him.

1348
01:37:13,252 --> 01:37:16,053
- Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

1349
01:37:16,353 --> 01:37:18,254
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1350
01:37:18,454 --> 01:37:21,122
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

1351
01:37:21,288 --> 01:37:23,389
We're running shy of these.

1352
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:25,724
Besides, we can do with some help.

1353
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:27,124
Look out.

1354
01:37:34,795 --> 01:37:38,763
It takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

1355
01:37:38,964 --> 01:37:41,465
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

1356
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,733
That's only half the truth.

1357
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:47,702
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

1358
01:37:48,635 --> 01:37:49,735
Duck.

1359
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:55,605
See what I mean?

1360
01:37:55,905 --> 01:38:00,174
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

1361
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:04,209
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

1362
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:07,477
See?

1363
01:38:10,579 --> 01:38:13,714
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

1364
01:38:14,714 --> 01:38:15,881
Duck again.

1365
01:38:25,186 --> 01:38:28,587
If that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

1366
01:38:28,754 --> 01:38:31,189
You know, you only flop for...

1367
01:38:32,756 --> 01:38:35,324
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

1368
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,825
Hey, Bert!

1369
01:38:51,865 --> 01:38:55,567
If one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

1370
01:39:08,706 --> 01:39:12,541
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

1371
01:39:13,408 --> 01:39:16,377
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

1372
01:39:16,543 --> 01:39:19,511
Depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

1373
01:39:19,678 --> 01:39:22,280
Which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

1374
01:39:22,446 --> 01:39:23,680
It must be taken.

1375
01:39:23,847 --> 01:39:25,180
This is all open country ahead,

1376
01:39:25,347 --> 01:39:28,082
But you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

1377
01:39:28,249 --> 01:39:32,118
On the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

1378
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:34,718
Synchronize your watches.

1379
01:39:35,919 --> 01:39:38,887
Use as a mark, 4:32.

1380
01:39:39,921 --> 01:39:43,390
It is now minus 10, eight, six,

1381
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:46,457
Four, two, mark.

1382
01:39:46,624 --> 01:39:47,591
Any questions?

1383
01:39:47,758 --> 01:39:49,759
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

1384
01:39:49,925 --> 01:39:52,460
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

1385
01:39:52,627 --> 01:39:54,762
Zero hour will be 6:10.

1386
01:39:59,864 --> 01:40:02,932
I'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

1387
01:40:03,098 --> 01:40:07,701
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

1388
01:40:07,868 --> 01:40:09,368
First platoon at 6:10,

1389
01:40:09,535 --> 01:40:11,903
Second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

1390
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,304
Yes, sir.

1391
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:29,078
- 6:10.
- 6:10. All right.

1392
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:50,287
Come on, men!

1393
01:43:04,884 --> 01:43:06,385
Halt and take cover!

1394
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:20,858
We'll never get through.

1395
01:43:23,026 --> 01:43:24,693
We gotta wipe out those nests.

1396
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:28,495
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

1397
01:43:28,662 --> 01:43:30,196
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

1398
01:43:30,362 --> 01:43:34,298
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

1399
01:44:04,812 --> 01:44:06,146
Take cover.

1400
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:09,548
Listen.

1401
01:44:31,058 --> 01:44:32,259
Heinie!

1402
01:44:33,426 --> 01:44:34,559
Listen.

1403
01:44:38,928 --> 01:44:40,229
We're not far enough back.

1404
01:44:40,395 --> 01:44:41,330
Savage, keep the men quiet.

1405
01:44:41,497 --> 01:44:43,531
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

1406
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:13,178
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

1407
01:45:14,145 --> 01:45:15,646
Look! Heinies!

1408
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:18,081
Come on, get 'em.

1409
01:45:38,223 --> 01:45:39,290
Hold your fire!

1410
01:45:39,457 --> 01:45:42,926
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

1411
01:45:43,626 --> 01:45:45,293
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!

1412
01:45:46,628 --> 01:45:48,161
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.

1413
01:45:48,328 --> 01:45:49,595
Go on.

1414
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,282
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.

1415
01:46:31,181 --> 01:46:32,349
Savage.

1416
01:46:33,316 --> 01:46:34,416
Savage?

1417
01:46:35,017 --> 01:46:36,317
Where's Savage?

1418
01:46:36,684 --> 01:46:39,419
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

1419
01:46:39,586 --> 01:46:41,754
You're the only noncom left.

1420
01:46:44,087 --> 01:46:46,489
York, take over.

1421
01:46:47,023 --> 01:46:49,690
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

1422
01:46:51,158 --> 01:46:52,825
Watch this fellow.

1423
01:46:53,659 --> 01:46:55,993
The rest of you keep under cover.

1424
01:46:57,861 --> 01:46:59,328
Come back here.

1425
01:46:59,495 --> 01:47:02,530
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.

1426
01:47:46,151 --> 01:47:47,452
Hey, Alvin!

1427
01:47:56,123 --> 01:47:58,290
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

1428
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:27,404
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

1429
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:29,939
Keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

1430
01:48:30,106 --> 01:48:31,706
Don't try anything funny.

1431
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:33,741
Belly to the ground, you babies.

1432
01:48:33,908 --> 01:48:34,807
We better get up there.

1433
01:48:35,108 --> 01:48:37,242
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

1434
01:48:49,415 --> 01:48:52,349
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

1435
01:48:52,516 --> 01:48:54,884
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

1436
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:57,284
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?

1437
01:48:57,418 --> 01:48:58,886
I said tell him it's useless.

1438
01:48:59,053 --> 01:49:02,388
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.

1439
01:49:23,531 --> 01:49:25,732
Just like a flock of turkeys.

1440
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:53,412
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

1441
01:49:55,046 --> 01:49:56,546
Come this a-way.

1442
01:50:01,582 --> 01:50:04,917
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

1443
01:50:09,253 --> 01:50:12,788
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

1444
01:50:15,855 --> 01:50:17,222
Keep a-coming.

1445
01:50:19,223 --> 01:50:21,892
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

1446
01:50:24,093 --> 01:50:26,061
All right. Keep a-coming.

1447
01:50:27,261 --> 01:50:29,696
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

1448
01:50:29,862 --> 01:50:31,396
All right, get on down!

1449
01:50:33,864 --> 01:50:36,032
Come on out and keep your hands up.

1450
01:50:36,198 --> 01:50:37,733
Boy, I told you.

1451
01:50:43,235 --> 01:50:44,202
Look at that mob.

1452
01:50:44,369 --> 01:50:45,936
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

1453
01:50:46,103 --> 01:50:47,604
Sure we can. That's my mate.

1454
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:49,938
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

1455
01:50:50,105 --> 01:50:51,505
Get going.

1456
01:50:51,939 --> 01:50:54,074
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.

1457
01:50:55,574 --> 01:50:56,709
Move forward, there.

1458
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:59,409
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

1459
01:51:03,411 --> 01:51:05,679
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.

1460
01:51:06,013 --> 01:51:08,147
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.

1461
01:51:08,314 --> 01:51:09,514
Nice going, York.

1462
01:51:09,714 --> 01:51:12,781
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.

1463
01:51:13,081 --> 01:51:15,983
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

1464
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:18,150
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.

1465
01:51:18,317 --> 01:51:21,586
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

1466
01:51:22,219 --> 01:51:24,987
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.

1467
01:51:28,088 --> 01:51:29,256
Watch them fellows.

1468
01:51:29,323 --> 01:51:31,257
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

1469
01:51:39,394 --> 01:51:40,528
Pusher.

1470
01:51:41,228 --> 01:51:42,463
Pusher.

1471
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:45,530
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

1472
01:51:47,798 --> 01:51:49,566
The end of the line.

1473
01:51:57,570 --> 01:52:00,204
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

1474
01:52:05,474 --> 01:52:08,541
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

1475
01:52:09,908 --> 01:52:11,409
You know what I'm a-saying?

1476
01:52:11,576 --> 01:52:13,077
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1477
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,311
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

1478
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:18,613
You and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

1479
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:19,980
Go ahead.

1480
01:52:22,648 --> 01:52:24,382
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

1481
01:52:30,985 --> 01:52:33,086
Look them fellows over good.

1482
01:52:36,421 --> 01:52:38,455
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.

1483
01:52:38,622 --> 01:52:41,124
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.

1484
01:52:44,992 --> 01:52:46,426
Now, get going.

1485
01:53:03,234 --> 01:53:04,935
Tell 'em to halt.

1486
01:53:07,803 --> 01:53:09,604
If you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

1487
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:11,971
Which way would you be a-going?

1488
01:53:12,138 --> 01:53:13,406
Up there.

1489
01:53:14,339 --> 01:53:16,473
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

1490
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:28,979
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

1491
01:53:31,213 --> 01:53:32,181
What's up?

1492
01:53:32,348 --> 01:53:35,115
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

1493
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:40,185
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.

1494
01:53:40,419 --> 01:53:42,119
We got enough to take care of already.

1495
01:53:42,286 --> 01:53:43,920
And a few more won't make no difference.

1496
01:53:44,087 --> 01:53:45,287
Hey, you.

1497
01:53:45,587 --> 01:53:47,922
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

1498
01:53:48,088 --> 01:53:52,023
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

1499
01:53:53,625 --> 01:53:56,592
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

1500
01:54:44,716 --> 01:54:47,049
They sure are trained good, Major.

1501
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:50,884
Hey, Sarge, look.

1502
01:54:51,418 --> 01:54:53,586
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.

1503
01:54:55,654 --> 01:54:57,121
Hello, there!

1504
01:54:57,321 --> 01:54:59,489
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.

1505
01:54:59,656 --> 01:55:01,824
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.

1506
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:03,825
- Hello there!
- Who are you?

1507
01:55:03,992 --> 01:55:07,326
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

1508
01:55:08,326 --> 01:55:10,394
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!

1509
01:55:11,328 --> 01:55:12,662
That's a Yank, all right.

1510
01:55:12,829 --> 01:55:16,063
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!

1511
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,634
Keep 'em covered.

1512
01:55:26,435 --> 01:55:27,669
Where you going?

1513
01:55:27,836 --> 01:55:30,337
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

1514
01:55:30,504 --> 01:55:32,005
It's up that way someplace.

1515
01:55:32,171 --> 01:55:35,573
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.

1516
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:37,841
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

1517
01:55:38,008 --> 01:55:39,842
What would we do with them?

1518
01:55:40,075 --> 01:55:41,743
Well, I don't rightly know.

1519
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:43,777
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.

1520
01:55:43,944 --> 01:55:45,177
Thank you.

1521
01:55:46,278 --> 01:55:47,178
Come on.

1522
01:55:47,345 --> 01:55:48,612
Forward!

1523
01:56:08,088 --> 01:56:09,322
All right. Halt!

1524
01:56:09,489 --> 01:56:11,290
Prisoners, hold right there!

1525
01:56:12,357 --> 01:56:14,192
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

1526
01:56:21,528 --> 01:56:23,296
Beg your pardon, sir.

1527
01:56:23,529 --> 01:56:24,529
Yeah?

1528
01:56:24,696 --> 01:56:28,097
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

1529
01:56:28,765 --> 01:56:30,766
Put 'em right over there.

1530
01:56:32,266 --> 01:56:33,700
Wait a minute.

1531
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:35,701
How many have you got?

1532
01:56:35,868 --> 01:56:38,169
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.

1533
01:56:38,336 --> 01:56:41,370
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

1534
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:43,672
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?

1535
01:56:43,839 --> 01:56:48,107
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

1536
01:56:48,274 --> 01:56:50,209
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

1537
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:54,710
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.

1538
01:56:55,377 --> 01:56:58,145
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

1539
01:56:58,312 --> 01:57:01,514
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

1540
01:57:02,013 --> 01:57:04,014
Well, good Lord.

1541
01:57:04,949 --> 01:57:06,649
I guess we can give you some help.

1542
01:57:06,816 --> 01:57:08,717
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

1543
01:57:15,353 --> 01:57:18,689
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

1544
01:57:18,856 --> 01:57:22,491
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his lonesome.

1545
01:57:22,657 --> 01:57:24,724
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.

1546
01:57:24,891 --> 01:57:27,192
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.

1547
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:30,061
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

1548
01:57:30,228 --> 01:57:33,062
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!

1549
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:34,963
Hey, what's that? How many?

1550
01:57:35,129 --> 01:57:37,231
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

1551
01:57:37,397 --> 01:57:39,699
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?

1552
01:57:39,866 --> 01:57:41,733
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

1553
01:57:41,899 --> 01:57:43,200
- I don't know.
- One guy.

1554
01:57:43,367 --> 01:57:44,501
How could one guy...

1555
01:57:44,667 --> 01:57:46,802
- Guy named York.
- What's that?

1556
01:57:46,969 --> 01:57:49,203
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

1557
01:57:49,370 --> 01:57:51,804
And brought them all back. They say...

1558
01:57:57,907 --> 01:58:01,208
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

1559
01:58:04,743 --> 01:58:07,511
Now, as I understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

1560
01:58:07,678 --> 01:58:09,512
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

1561
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:10,646
Yes, sir.

1562
01:58:10,813 --> 01:58:12,513
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

1563
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,781
That was right up on this other ridge.

1564
01:58:14,948 --> 01:58:16,949
Yes, sir. Right up there.

1565
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:18,783
Where were you?

1566
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:22,252
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.

1567
01:58:22,819 --> 01:58:26,954
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so I worked my way across

1568
01:58:27,355 --> 01:58:30,122
Up behind that log there under the hill.

1569
01:58:31,823 --> 01:58:33,523
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

1570
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,492
Your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

1571
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:39,593
I reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

1572
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,694
What did you wanna go over there for?

1573
01:58:41,861 --> 01:58:43,528
Well, I figured that was a good place to be

1574
01:58:43,695 --> 01:58:46,297
Because they had to rear up
and show themselves

1575
01:58:46,464 --> 01:58:48,864
In order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

1576
01:58:49,031 --> 01:58:50,832
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.

1577
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:51,933
I see.

1578
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:55,868
So, I went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

1579
01:58:56,201 --> 01:58:59,836
Then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

1580
01:59:00,003 --> 01:59:02,638
And couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

1581
01:59:02,804 --> 01:59:05,273
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

1582
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:07,307
How many did you kill?

1583
01:59:08,507 --> 01:59:10,308
I don't rightly know, sir.

1584
01:59:10,475 --> 01:59:12,609
I think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

1585
01:59:12,776 --> 01:59:16,211
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

1586
01:59:17,211 --> 01:59:19,312
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

1587
01:59:19,479 --> 01:59:20,879
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.

1588
01:59:21,046 --> 01:59:23,981
I was pretty busy
and I reckon they was, too.

1589
01:59:24,181 --> 01:59:27,449
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

1590
01:59:27,616 --> 01:59:31,018
And couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

1591
01:59:31,185 --> 01:59:34,052
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

1592
01:59:38,855 --> 01:59:40,122
Corporal.

1593
01:59:41,722 --> 01:59:45,058
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?

1594
01:59:45,225 --> 01:59:47,825
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

1595
01:59:47,992 --> 01:59:51,160
You as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

1596
01:59:51,327 --> 01:59:52,894
But not to kill.

1597
01:59:54,161 --> 01:59:56,895
What made you
decide to change your mind?

1598
01:59:57,329 --> 01:59:58,696
Well, sir...

1599
01:59:58,863 --> 02:00:01,898
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

1600
02:00:02,065 --> 02:00:04,732
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

1601
02:00:04,899 --> 02:00:06,834
But it was this way, Colonel.

1602
02:00:07,234 --> 02:00:09,836
When I started out I
felt just like you said.

1603
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:12,002
But when I hear them
machine guns a-going

1604
02:00:12,169 --> 02:00:14,571
And all them fellows
are dropping around me,

1605
02:00:14,737 --> 02:00:18,739
I figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

1606
02:00:18,906 --> 02:00:22,007
And there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

1607
02:00:22,174 --> 02:00:24,042
And that's what I done.

1608
02:00:24,676 --> 02:00:27,210
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

1609
02:00:27,376 --> 02:00:29,845
Yes, sir. That was why.

1610
02:00:32,746 --> 02:00:37,381
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

1611
02:00:39,749 --> 02:00:41,217
<i>Sergeant York!</i>

1612
02:01:09,897 --> 02:01:11,397
Thank you, sir.

1613
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:15,566
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

1614
02:01:15,733 --> 02:01:19,101
You have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

1615
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:27,772
Sergeant York, I am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

1616
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:30,840
It's a privilege to command
such men as you.

1617
02:01:34,842 --> 02:01:36,209
Sergeant York,

1618
02:01:36,376 --> 02:01:40,044
As Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

1619
02:01:40,211 --> 02:01:42,746
It is my pleasure to confer upon you

1620
02:01:42,913 --> 02:01:45,280
The United States
Congressional Medal of Honor

1621
02:01:45,447 --> 02:01:47,948
For heroism beyond the call of duty.

1622
02:01:50,216 --> 02:01:51,750
Thank you, sir.

1623
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,297
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

1624
02:02:20,464 --> 02:02:22,298
Representative from
your district of Tennessee.

1625
02:02:22,465 --> 02:02:24,466
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

1626
02:02:24,633 --> 02:02:26,966
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

1627
02:02:27,133 --> 02:02:28,967
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

1628
02:02:29,134 --> 02:02:31,202
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.

1629
02:02:43,141 --> 02:02:45,643
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

1630
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:49,078
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

1631
02:02:49,311 --> 02:02:51,812
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

1632
02:02:51,978 --> 02:02:54,313
May I present you with this key to our city

1633
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,981
As a token of our very great esteem.

1634
02:02:57,148 --> 02:02:59,049
And may God bless you.

1635
02:03:01,383 --> 02:03:02,551
Thank you for what you said,

1636
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:05,385
And I'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

1637
02:03:05,552 --> 02:03:08,053
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

1638
02:03:09,821 --> 02:03:13,155
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

1639
02:03:13,322 --> 02:03:14,989
Is there anything we can do for you?

1640
02:03:15,156 --> 02:03:17,124
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.

1641
02:03:17,291 --> 02:03:18,324
And that is?

1642
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:19,926
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

1643
02:03:20,092 --> 02:03:23,927
I sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

1644
02:03:24,394 --> 02:03:25,628
I think we can arrange that.

1645
02:03:29,996 --> 02:03:31,630
Well, here we are.

1646
02:03:36,366 --> 02:03:39,101
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

1647
02:03:39,268 --> 02:03:41,036
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty
hard to please.

1648
02:03:41,201 --> 02:03:43,937
If there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

1649
02:03:44,103 --> 02:03:46,004
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1650
02:03:47,038 --> 02:03:50,040
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

1651
02:04:05,614 --> 02:04:08,381
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

1652
02:04:08,548 --> 02:04:11,283
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

1653
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:13,550
So we understand.

1654
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:21,421
Representative Hull.

1655
02:04:22,522 --> 02:04:24,723
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

1656
02:04:25,356 --> 02:04:26,790
Put them on.

1657
02:04:27,024 --> 02:04:29,358
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?

1658
02:04:32,626 --> 02:04:33,994
Thank you.

1659
02:04:37,262 --> 02:04:39,330
Hello. Hello there.

1660
02:04:42,531 --> 02:04:43,632
What?

1661
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,833
Who is it?

1662
02:04:49,601 --> 02:04:51,468
I... I can't hear you.

1663
02:04:52,503 --> 02:04:55,137
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?

1664
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:56,705
I can't hear you.

1665
02:04:56,872 --> 02:04:58,706
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

1666
02:04:58,973 --> 02:05:00,306
Stand closer, Ma.

1667
02:05:00,473 --> 02:05:02,807
When are you coming home, Alvin?

1668
02:05:03,474 --> 02:05:07,243
I said, when are you coming home?

1669
02:05:08,577 --> 02:05:12,212
Oh, I'm glad, Son.

1670
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:15,380
I'll tell her.

1671
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:17,448
She's right here.

1672
02:05:18,314 --> 02:05:20,716
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

1673
02:05:22,650 --> 02:05:25,218
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!

1674
02:05:25,651 --> 02:05:28,086
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

1675
02:05:28,253 --> 02:05:30,654
He's got this here phone in here now.

1676
02:05:30,821 --> 02:05:33,655
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

1677
02:05:33,822 --> 02:05:35,723
I can't wait to see you.

1678
02:05:35,890 --> 02:05:39,158
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

1679
02:05:39,658 --> 02:05:40,792
Yeah.

1680
02:05:41,626 --> 02:05:44,994
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.

1681
02:05:46,494 --> 02:05:47,595
Bye.

1682
02:05:56,166 --> 02:05:58,333
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

1683
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,902
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.

1684
02:06:25,947 --> 02:06:28,848
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

1685
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:34,885
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

1686
02:06:35,485 --> 02:06:37,386
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?

1687
02:06:38,487 --> 02:06:40,454
I wanna be a-going home.

1688
02:06:40,987 --> 02:06:42,322
When do you think I can go?

1689
02:06:42,489 --> 02:06:45,323
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.

1690
02:06:46,224 --> 02:06:47,657
I've got to get to work.

1691
02:06:47,824 --> 02:06:51,092
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

1692
02:06:51,259 --> 02:06:52,160
What do you mean?

1693
02:06:52,326 --> 02:06:54,627
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

1694
02:06:54,794 --> 02:06:56,661
You're a pretty famous man now.

1695
02:06:56,828 --> 02:06:59,397
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

1696
02:06:59,563 --> 02:07:01,665
It seems a lot of people realize it.

1697
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:03,332
For instance,

1698
02:07:03,798 --> 02:07:06,500
Two companies want you
in motion pictures,

1699
02:07:06,667 --> 02:07:09,301
Ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new

1700
02:07:09,467 --> 02:07:12,569
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

1701
02:07:12,736 --> 02:07:16,672
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

1702
02:07:16,838 --> 02:07:18,606
What does that mean?

1703
02:07:19,305 --> 02:07:23,808
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

1704
02:07:24,475 --> 02:07:27,410
I ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

1705
02:07:27,576 --> 02:07:29,277
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

1706
02:07:29,444 --> 02:07:31,845
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far

1707
02:07:32,012 --> 02:07:34,846
And they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

1708
02:07:35,013 --> 02:07:37,014
They're offering me all that money?

1709
02:07:37,181 --> 02:07:39,848
It's just a plain business proposition.

1710
02:07:40,516 --> 02:07:43,650
I sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

1711
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:46,252
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...

1712
02:07:46,419 --> 02:07:48,653
Here's your chance to get it.

1713
02:07:50,454 --> 02:07:53,922
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

1714
02:07:54,089 --> 02:07:56,524
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?

1715
02:07:57,857 --> 02:07:59,191
That's it.

1716
02:08:00,592 --> 02:08:03,126
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

1717
02:08:04,794 --> 02:08:07,162
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.

1718
02:08:07,529 --> 02:08:09,029
I reckon it is.

1719
02:08:09,196 --> 02:08:12,164
Take all the time you want to think it over.

1720
02:08:12,464 --> 02:08:14,699
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

1721
02:08:14,865 --> 02:08:17,667
I ain't proud of what happened over there.

1722
02:08:17,833 --> 02:08:20,969
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

1723
02:08:21,135 --> 02:08:23,936
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

1724
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:29,006
So, the way I figure, things like
that ain't for buying and selling.

1725
02:08:29,173 --> 02:08:30,707
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.

1726
02:08:30,873 --> 02:08:34,007
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

1727
02:08:34,174 --> 02:08:36,475
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?

1728
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:43,345
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.

1729
02:08:49,781 --> 02:08:52,315
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.

1730
02:09:04,088 --> 02:09:05,655
Oh, there he is!

1731
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:22,863
Alvin!

1732
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:24,564
Oh, Alvin!

1733
02:09:25,164 --> 02:09:26,365
How are you?

1734
02:09:48,009 --> 02:09:49,476
Ma, I'm back.

1735
02:09:50,477 --> 02:09:52,711
I'm right glad, Son.

1736
02:09:55,779 --> 02:09:58,214
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

1737
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:01,482
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.

1738
02:10:01,649 --> 02:10:02,749
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

1739
02:10:02,916 --> 02:10:05,384
They better be a-something big.

1740
02:10:05,584 --> 02:10:06,851
As I was saying, Alvin,

1741
02:10:07,018 --> 02:10:10,352
Of course, I always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

1742
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:13,354
But I ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

1743
02:10:13,521 --> 02:10:16,088
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

1744
02:10:16,255 --> 02:10:17,923
Since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

1745
02:10:18,089 --> 02:10:19,456
Sure are, Alvin.

1746
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:21,658
Hang on, Rosie.

1747
02:10:23,926 --> 02:10:24,993
Hey,

1748
02:10:25,526 --> 02:10:28,928
What about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

1749
02:10:29,094 --> 02:10:31,529
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.

1750
02:10:31,696 --> 02:10:34,164
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.

1751
02:10:34,331 --> 02:10:38,300
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

1752
02:10:38,432 --> 02:10:40,733
I sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

1753
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:43,035
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

1754
02:10:43,201 --> 02:10:45,303
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

1755
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:49,338
I'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

1756
02:10:50,738 --> 02:10:52,406
Hang on, everyone.

1757
02:10:56,007 --> 02:10:57,541
Hey, look here.

1758
02:10:59,342 --> 02:11:03,078
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.

1759
02:11:03,911 --> 02:11:06,346
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.

1760
02:11:06,912 --> 02:11:08,681
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.

1761
02:11:08,846 --> 02:11:11,481
There's something we got to talk about.

1762
02:11:11,648 --> 02:11:14,716
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?

1763
02:11:14,883 --> 02:11:16,617
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

1764
02:11:16,784 --> 02:11:18,418
And all them people coming here
from all over...

1765
02:11:18,585 --> 02:11:21,987
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but I reckon we'll get through it all right.

1766
02:11:22,119 --> 02:11:25,388
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?

1767
02:11:25,555 --> 02:11:29,624
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

1768
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:32,091
Why, some girls don't even get that.

1769
02:11:32,592 --> 02:11:35,593
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

1770
02:11:35,759 --> 02:11:37,127
Oh, I don't know.

1771
02:11:37,327 --> 02:11:39,494
I done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

1772
02:11:39,628 --> 02:11:42,697
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

1773
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:44,930
I'm expecting my husband to love me.

1774
02:11:45,097 --> 02:11:47,532
I reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

1775
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:50,100
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

1776
02:11:50,267 --> 02:11:52,268
Just a-having you. But...

1777
02:11:52,468 --> 02:11:56,036
Well, I was expecting to take over
from here myself.

1778
02:11:56,203 --> 02:11:58,770
I reckon you'll get to do your share.

1779
02:11:59,404 --> 02:12:02,138
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

1780
02:12:02,706 --> 02:12:03,607
We got to wait.

1781
02:12:03,773 --> 02:12:06,975
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

1782
02:12:07,141 --> 02:12:08,909
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.

1783
02:12:09,076 --> 02:12:12,711
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.

1784
02:12:13,144 --> 02:12:16,779
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till I tell you.

1785
02:12:17,779 --> 02:12:19,014
Come on.

1786
02:12:24,983 --> 02:12:26,950
There! Now you can look.

1787
02:12:27,718 --> 02:12:30,052
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

1788
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,187
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.

1789
02:12:33,354 --> 02:12:36,122
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

1790
02:12:36,288 --> 02:12:38,123
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres

1791
02:12:38,289 --> 02:12:42,324
And the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

1792
02:12:42,992 --> 02:12:44,559
And it's for us.

1793
02:12:50,161 --> 02:12:52,997
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

1794
02:12:54,330 --> 02:12:55,564
Come on.
