{1365}{1393}In Virginia,
{1393}{1448}high school football|is a way of life.
{1449}{1499}It's bigger|than Christmas day.
{1500}{1555}My daddy|coached in Alexandria.
{1557}{1616}He worked so hard,|my mama left him,
{1617}{1651}but I stayed with Coach.
{1653}{1706}He needed me on that field.
{1757}{1812}Up until 1971|in Alexandria,
{1814}{1864}there was no race mixing.
{1866}{1914}Then the school board|forced us to integrate.
{1915}{1983}They combined the white school|and the black school into one
{1986}{2052}called|T. C. Williams High School.
{2278}{2364}Murderer! Murderer!
{2365}{2405}hat summer|a black teenager was killed
{2405}{2453}by a white store owner,
{2453}{2514}and the city was|on the verge of exploding.
{2515}{2618}!! Well, my mind|is goin' through some changes!!
{2621}{2658}You've caused|enough damage!
{2659}{2697}- This is my store!|- Back off.
{2700}{2768}Blue left!|Blue left! Left!
{2800}{2858}Come on, Kurt, don't let Ray|back you down like that!
{2861}{2905}You're twice his size!
{2906}{2961}Aargh!|What are they doing?
{2963}{3016}If they keep playing like that,|we'll lose every game!
{3018}{3057}I didn't think|that was so bad.
{3060}{3095}!!She had to run!!
{3132}{3207}Looks good, Gerry.|I can see you been working.
{3208}{3249}Thanks.|Thanks a lot, Coach.
{3251}{3317}Listen, with the schools|integrating and all,
{3320}{3348}some of the guys are|worried about losing
{3351}{3382}their starting|positions.
{3383}{3437}Well, that's something we're|just gonna have to figure out,
{3438}{3475}but you don't worry|about that now.
{3476}{3534}You just keep at it.|All right?
{3537}{3565}Yes, Coach.
{3567}{3643}Hey, guys! Guys!
{3644}{3684}It's comin' down!
{3685}{3735}It's comin' down|at the store!
{3736}{3760}They want to burn|the place up
{3763}{3804}'cause that colored kid|got shot.
{3805}{3842}Come on, man,|let's go.
{3882}{3940}Hey. Hey!
{3973}{3999}Coach?
{4000}{4072}You just get Sheryl|to the school now, Herb.
{4075}{4106}!!Sorry!!
{4318}{4360}Get in the truck.
{4362}{4425}Gerry, Alan, Ray,
{4428}{4476}if you ever want|to play for me again,
{4477}{4527}get in the truck now.
{4530}{4599}You boys are gonna cool off,|come with me to my office,
{4600}{4635}help me finish|packing my things.
{4637}{4686}Gerry, son, your heart's|in the right place,
{4689}{4712}but you ought|to know better
{4713}{4744}than to embarrass|the coach like that.
{4746}{4789}Hell, why don't you just|kick them all off the team?
{4792}{4833}I don't want to play with|any of those black animals.
{4833}{4857}Whoa.
{4857}{4895}I see him.
{4898}{4932}Who are you?
{4933}{4986}I'm Herman Boone. I'm|the new assistant coach.
{4987}{5028}Well, from|the looks of things,
{5029}{5107}I'd say we got all the help|we need around here.
{5108}{5141}Why ain't you outside there
{5142}{5199}with all your|little friends, hollering'?
{5285}{5354}This was the time that|was arranged for me
{5354}{5410}to meet with|Coach Yoast.
{5412}{5457}I never miss|an appointment.
{5458}{5536}Well, maybe you just|better reschedule.
{5538}{5580}Coach Boone, the school|board made the decision
{5581}{5646}to put you on my staff.|I did not hire you.
{5649}{5721}Well, I came up here|to coach at G.W.
{5724}{5776}I didn't ask the schools|to redistrict.
{5778}{5817}I didn't ask to be|assigned to your staff,
{5817}{5852}so I guess we're both|in a situation
{5854}{5878}we don't want to be in.
{5879}{5936}But I can guarantee|you this, Coach,
{5937}{5988}I come to win.
{5989}{6060}Win? Coach Yoast|here has been nominated
{6061}{6118}to the Virginia|High School Hall of Fame.
{6119}{6174}15 winning seasons.
{6177}{6239}I won a couple of titles|down in North Carolina.
{6242}{6276}That's double ''A'' ball.
{6277}{6344}This here's Virginia.|We play triple ''A.''
{6345}{6423}What an opportunity|for me then...
{6424}{6524}to learn...|from the best.
{6526}{6623}!! Ooh, I bet|you're wonderin' how I knew!!
{6625}{6670}Are those|people the movers?
{6671}{6729}No. Looks like|they're moving in here.
{6732}{6781}How many|of them are there?
{6784}{6819}It only takes one.
{6822}{6853}Then we're gonna be|overrun by 'em.
{6856}{6925}Mommy, where are you|taking my teddybear?
{6927}{7004}That. Come on, y'all.|Ohh.
{7006}{7054}Where is everybody?
{7055}{7100}Nicky, yes.
{7102}{7165}Look there, here|comes some more of'em.
{7168}{7243}That's Dr. Day, that|Negro from the school board.
{7246}{7287}What's he doing here?
{7288}{7342}The school board has decided|that Negro Herman Boone
{7343}{7373}is gonna be|the head coach at T.C.
{7374}{7435}It's not fair!|My daddy's head coach!
{7438}{7480}This is gonna be|his Hall of Fame year!
{7481}{7515}No one|is trying to takeaway
{7518}{7562}your daddy's future|place in the hall.
{7565}{7631}You can't just walk in here|and take my daddy's job away!
{7632}{7709}That is enough, Sheryl.|That's enough.
{7805}{7826}Sheryl!
{7829}{7861}Ow.
{7863}{7896}I...
{7898}{7987}it's all right, Bill.|I feel the same way.
{7990}{8042}It's those agitators|and race-mixers
{8043}{8088}I feel like|taking a swat at.
{8090}{8125}Troublemakers in|the Berg are ready
{8125}{8152}to put a torch|to the city.
{8152}{8176}to put a torch|to the city.
{8177}{8241}You want us to burn up|like Watts?
{8244}{8279}Every head coach in|the system is white.
{8282}{8324}We had to give them|something.
{8324}{8413}It's the world we live in,|God help us all.
{8415}{8488}I left North Carolina|because I was passed over
{8488}{8536}for a job that I had|rightfully earned.
{8539}{8581}Gave it to a white coach|down there
{8583}{8626}couldn't even tie up|his own football cleats.
{8629}{8663}Now you are asking me
{8664}{8714}to do the same thing|to this man?
{8717}{8745}I can't do that.
{8748}{8799}Herman?
{8828}{8913}Folks in Carolina say|you marched with Dr. King.
{8916}{8996}Say you stood toe-to-toe|with the Klan.
{8996}{9030}Said you're a race man.
{9031}{9078}That's right.|I'm also a family man.
{9079}{9146}Coach Boone, black folks|have never had
{9147}{9192}anything in this city|to call their own
{9195}{9245}except humiliation|and despair.
{9246}{9280}Dr. Day, excuse me.
{9283}{9332}Herman, I think you'd|better look outside.
{9729}{9799}So, you see,|we need you, Coach Boone.
{9801}{9849}Come on,|meet the people.
{9852}{9897}Coach Boone,|I'm Charles Campbell.
{9898}{9956}This here is|my boy Julius.
{9956}{9994}He can be the fi nest|defensive end
{9997}{10052}in the whole state|if you push him to it.
{10053}{10083}I've heard a lot|about you.
{10085}{10121}You're like an answer|to our prayers.
{10124}{10168}Now, wait a minute. I'm not|an answer to your prayers.
{10169}{10264}I'm not a savior|or Jesus Christ,
{10265}{10305}Martin Luther King,|or the Easter bunny.
{10306}{10354}I'm a football coach,|that's all.
{10357}{10387}Just a football coach.
{10388}{10415}You're our coach.
{10416}{10452}You're our coach!
{10453}{10491}Coach Boone!
{10597}{10717}Boone! Boone! Boone!
{10947}{10988}What do you want?
{11030}{11070}Is Coach Yoast here?
{11073}{11095}We're busy...
{11098}{11159}interviewing|for head coaching jobs.
{11162}{11248}Gotten 11 offers and|certainly no time for you.
{11496}{11560}Well, come on in.|I've got an office out back.
{11595}{11667}Look, I can't|even spell diplomacy,
{11668}{11722}and I'm sorry about|the way things went down,
{11724}{11794}but make no mistake,|I am qualified
{11796}{11820}to be this school's|head coach.
{11821}{11855}Sure. You've been in,|what,
{11856}{11903}4 or 5 programs|in the past 1 0 years?
{11904}{11941}With 4 or5|championships.
{11942}{11975}This isn't about me.
{11976}{12031}I'm worried about my boys.
{12034}{12106}Well, I ain't gonna|cook 'em and eat 'em.
{12109}{12171}The best player will play.|Color won't matter.
{12172}{12233}From the looks of our|little situation we got here,
{12235}{12281}I'd say it's about|all that does.
{12284}{12322}Yeah, you're right.
{12325}{12356}We're in|a tough spot, Coach,
{12359}{12397}you, me, the whole city.
{12400}{12452}I think it would go a long|way to smooth things over
{12453}{12507}if you would stay,|work on the staff,
{12508}{12572}be a defensive coordinator,|assistant head coach.
{12572}{12643}Work under you?
{12644}{12712}If that's the way|you see it.
{12781}{12835}Good night, Coach.
{12936}{12980}It's been|a rare privilege
{12981}{13031}to have lived here|as long as I have
{13032}{13059}coaching your boys.
{13060}{13114}I'll be taking|the year off...
{13117}{13148}No.
{13148}{13227}after which|I'll be moving to Loudon
{13228}{13306}and taking the head coaching|job at Loudon High.
{13309}{13402}- I say boycott T.C. Williams!|- Tell 'em, Fred!
{13405}{13460}Our boys aren't playing|for some ''Coach Coon!''
{13461}{13511}Coach,|he stole your job.
{13512}{13553}I'm not playing for him.
{13556}{13608}I started a petition, and I'm|sitting this season out.
{13608}{13643}Only place|you're going to sit
{13645}{13682}is back in that chair,|Gerry.
{13683}{13717}I appreciate it, though.
{13720}{13779}Boycott T. C.!|Boycott the school!
{13780}{13844}Stop this, Fred.|You know none of these boys
{13847}{13892}can afford to go|to some other district
{13892}{13917}just to play ball.
{13920}{13955}They sit this one out,
{13957}{13993}they put their futures|on the line.
{13995}{14043}Coach, I'm out, too.
{14044}{14073}I'm not playing|for no thief.
{14074}{14108}Don't do this.
{14111}{14163}Don't make this any harder|for me than it already is.
{14166}{14205}Coach, if you go, I go.
{14208}{14256}only play|for you, Coach Yoast.
{14259}{14317}Don't go, Coach.|You can't leave us.
{14318}{14389}Coach Yoast!|Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast!
{14537}{14582}We'll be all right,|Coach.
{14609}{14643}I've coached|most of these boys
{14644}{14675}since they|were your age.
{14677}{14713}I've seen them grow up|in front of my eyes,
{14715}{14773}almost like|they were my own kids.
{14774}{14802}Almost.
{14804}{14880}This is a heck of a time|to be abandoning them
{14880}{14938}to look out for|themselves, ain't it?
{14941}{15017}So...what are you|gonna do?
{15086}{15124}We gonna play|some ball, y'all!
{15127}{15185}Black inside, black inside,|black inside.
{15186}{15223}Unh, unh, unh, unh!
{15226}{15272}Yo, Petey,|how many yards you figure
{15274}{15306}you gonna get|this season, bro?
{15309}{15356}You know, I ain't one|to brag, big Blue,
{15357}{15405}but I figure on|at least a thousand.
{15405}{15453}But I ain't|one to brag.
{15456}{15490}Didn't I tell you|all them white boys
{15491}{15521}weren't gonna play|for no brother?
{15524}{15558}Well, who needs 'em, baby?
{15559}{15641}From now on the Titans gonna be|powered by soul power, bro.
{15642}{15741}! He said soul power!
{15774}{15798}Shut up.
{16056}{16139}Put your hand down.
{16141}{16163}You're smiling.
{16165}{16187}Yes.
{16189}{16244}Yes, sir.|Why are you smiling?
{16245}{16317}'Cause I love football.|Football's fun.
{16319}{16367}Fun, sir. It's fun?
{16368}{16391}- Yes.|- You sure?
{16392}{16415}I think--
{16416}{16440}Now you're thinking'.
{16440}{16479}First you smile,|then you thinking'.
{16481}{16519}You think football|is still fun?
{16520}{16544}Uh, yes.
{16546}{16568}Sir.
{16570}{16615}- Yes--no, sir.|- No?
{16616}{16652}It was fun.
{16653}{16690}Not anymore, though,|is it?
{16691}{16715}Not right now.
{16718}{16759}It's not fun anymore.|Not even a little bit.
{16760}{16797}Uh...no.
{16799}{16841}Make up your mind.|Think since you're thinking.
{16844}{16882}Go on, think.|Is it fun?
{16885}{16910}- No, sir.|- No?
{16911}{16934}Absolutely not?
{16935}{16961}Zero fun, sir.
{16964}{17009}All right, listen up.|I'm Coach Boone.
{17010}{17108}I'm gonna tell you all|about how much ''fun''
{17109}{17161}you're gonna have|this season.
{17164}{17238}We leave for camp,|Gettysburg College,
{17239}{17308}August 1 5th, 7:29 A.M.
{17310}{17352}If you report at 7::30,
{17352}{17394}you will not be playing|football this season,
{17397}{17431}you will be watching.
{17434}{17493}You will wear|a jacket, shirt, and tie.
{17493}{17528}If you don't have one,|buy one.
{17530}{17586}Can't afford one,|borrow one from your old man.
{17589}{17636}If you don't|have an old man,
{17637}{17705}then find a drunk,|trade him for his.
{17706}{17750}'Cause I guarantee you|there isn't a bum on the street
{17753}{17787}that looks as raggedy|and ridiculous
{17788}{17822}as what I'm looking at|right now.
{17825}{17871}This is no democracy.
{17873}{17943}It is a dictatorship.
{17945}{18004}I am the law.
{18004}{18117}If you survive camp,|you will be on the team.
{18120}{18199}If you survive.
{18200}{18229}Check 'em in, Coach.
{18230}{18268}Checkin' 'em in.
{18269}{18327}I'm Coach Hinds,|your offensive line coach.
{18329}{18384}Yell out your name and position|starting from the right.
{18385}{18426}Petey Jones,|running back.
{18429}{18469}The running back, y'all.
{18470}{18495}Whatever, Petey.
{18497}{18531}Get out here!
{18532}{18620}Yeah, yeah, yeah.|Jerry Harris, quarterback.
{18621}{18693}Hallelujah!|Hallelujah, Rev!
{18694}{18716}Rev?
{18717}{18765}It's just|a nickname.
{18765}{18837}And who in the name|of heaven might you be?
{18840}{18927}Louie Lastik,|offensive lineman.
{18929}{18985}Naval family, just moved|here from Bayonne.
{18987}{19030}Someone said football,|so I come runnin'.
{19033}{19061}What's goin' on,|everybody?
{19352}{19396}With him calling the shots,|ain't none of us
{19396}{19451}gonna see nothin'|but the bench this year.
{19452}{19512}He ain't calling|the shots. You'll play.
{19692}{19743}You have just disrupted
{19745}{19780}my first team meeting
{19783}{19820}in an unacceptable|fashion.
{19821}{19855}This is my team now.
{19856}{19889}Either you're with that|or you're not.
{19890}{19938}I'm here, ain't I?|Let's talk football.
{19941}{19965}Let's talk football.
{19966}{20004}I run the defense--
{20006}{20082}As a part of|my team strategy.
{20083}{20130}Now, I have never seen|an assistant coach's name
{20131}{20174}in the newspaper|for losing a game.
{20175}{20209}I want a job|for Coach Tyrell.
{20212}{20246}He's been with me|for 1 0 years.
{20247}{20290}I won't leave him|out in the cold.
{20291}{20331}You don't get me|without him.
{20332}{20393}You're overcooking|my grits, Coach.
{20394}{20534}All right. I will|allow Coach Tyrell
{20537}{20569}to coach|the special team,
{20571}{20619}but I will have|my eye on him.
{20620}{20678}And you.
{20813}{20851}Good morning, good morning,|Coaches, how are you?
{20853}{20884}Good morning|to you.
{20884}{20932}Looks good today,|doesn't it?
{20935}{20991}Just wanted to let you know|what the offense is doing.
{20993}{21035}Awful skinny play book,|ain't it?
{21036}{21134}I run 6 plays, split veer.|It's like novocaine.
{21135}{21176}Just give it time,|always works.
{21176}{21202}See you on the bus.
{21240}{21283}Be patient, Bill.|Your time will come.
{21285}{21331}Herman, here we go.
{21333}{21371}Here we go.
{21443}{21481}How can I help|you boys?
{21482}{21516}I'm Gerry Bertier,
{21519}{21584}the only all-American|you got on this team.
{21584}{21639}You want any of us|to play for you,
{21641}{21674}you reserve half|the open positions
{21676}{21706}for Hammond players,
{21707}{21752}half the offense,|half the special teams.
{21755}{21800}We don't need any of|your people on defense.
{21803}{21827}We're already set.
{21828}{21883}Uh-huh. Don't need|none of my people?
{21885}{21933}What did you say|your name was, Jerry?
{21933}{21965}Gerry.
{21968}{22012}No, you must have said|Jerry, like Lewis,
{22012}{22102}which would make you|Dean Martin, right?
{22105}{22171}Ladies and gentlemen,|I got an announcement to make.
{22173}{22243}We got Jerry Lewis|and Dean Martin
{22245}{22289}going to camp with us|here this year.
{22290}{22329}Jerry tells the jokes,
{22331}{22396}Dean sings the songs|and gets the girl.
{22396}{22448}Let's give them|a round of applause.
{22608}{22671}Where's your folks,|Gerry?
{22673}{22715}Your parents,|are they here?
{22716}{22770}Where are they?
{22771}{22804}That's my mother.
{22804}{22835}That's your mama?
{22836}{22880}Very nice.|How are you?
{22883}{22941}Take a good look at her.
{22942}{22976}'Cause once|you get on that bus,
{22979}{23037}you ain't got no mama|no more.
{23038}{23096}You got your brothers|on the team,
{23099}{23133}and you got your daddy.
{23134}{23175}Now, you know who|your daddy is, don't you?
{23176}{23261}Gerry, if you want to play|on this football team,
{23264}{23385}you answer me when I ask you|who is your daddy.
{23387}{23449}Who's your daddy, Gerry?
{23450}{23481}Who's your daddy?
{23545}{23568}You.
{23569}{23627}Uh-huh. And whose team|is this?
{23628}{23734}Is this your team,|or is this your daddy's team?
{23737}{23771}Yours.
{23772}{23853}Mm-hmm. Get on the bus.
{23854}{23951}Put your jacket on first|and get on the bus.
{23953}{23975}OK.
{24032}{24074}Uh, Dean?
{24114}{24159}Fix that tie, son.
{24468}{24529}All right, listen up,|I want everybody off the bus.

{24687}{24738}All right,|everybody, off the bus.
{24739}{24773}Listen up, I don't care
{24776}{24827}if you're black, green,|blue, white, or orange,
{24828}{24890}I want all of my defensive|players on this side,
{24893}{24950}all players going out|for offense over here.
{24951}{24978}Right now.
{24979}{25037}Let's move! Let's move!|Let's move! Let's move!
{25040}{25116}You and you, offensive bus.|Sit together.
{25119}{25184}You and you, defensive bus.|Sit together.
{25187}{25221}Get comfortable, too,
{25222}{25280}because the person that|I have you sitting next to
{25280}{25345}is the same one|you'll be rooming with
{25346}{25396}for the duration|of this camp.
{25492}{25541}! 'Cause, baby!
{25544}{25651}!There ain't|no mountain high enough !
{25653}{25739}!Ain't no valley|low enough !
{25740}{25799}Blue, shut up.
{25801}{25843}I don't want to see|your smilin' and shuff in',
{25845}{25915}and hear all your minstrel|show singing on this bus.
{25917}{25965}You, too.
{25967}{26014}Got that right.
{26061}{26107}You can shut up, too.
{26141}{26223}!!!!
{26522}{26583}!! When I die|and they lay me to rest!!
{26586}{26624}That's my bed.
{26627}{26703}!! Gonna go to the place|that's the best!!

{26946}{26984}I ain't lookin' at that|for 2 weeks, man.
{26985}{27018}Take it down.
{27019}{27049}!! When I die!!
{27050}{27121}You can close your eyes|for 2 weeks, all I care.
{27122}{27167}Why don't you look at your wall|and I'll look at mine?
{27169}{27204}I'll look|wherever I want to,
{27204}{27259}and I don't want to be|looking at that for 2 weeks.
{27262}{27324}Then you better use your|X-ray vision, Superman,
{27325}{27383}and look right through it,|'cause it ain't comin' down.
{27554}{27577}Aah!
{27620}{27644}Fight!

{27862}{27910}Get him off.
{27911}{27939}Get off me!
{27941}{27997}Bunch of tough guys, huh?
{28035}{28106}You look like a bunch|of fifth-grade sissies
{28107}{28157}after a cat fight.
{28160}{28205}You got anger. That's good.
{28208}{28250}You're gonna need it, son.
{28251}{28287}You got aggression.|That's even better.
{28288}{28318}You're gonna|need that, too,
{28321}{28401}butany2-year-oldchild|can throw a fit.
{28403}{28491}Foot ball is about|controlling that anger.
{28493}{28565}Harnessing that aggression|into a team effort
{28566}{28621}to achieve perfection!
{28624}{28682}Some coaches,|they cut a player
{28683}{28751}if they think|he's not up to snuff.
{28753}{28812}When they think|he's hurting the team.
{28813}{28860}This is|a public school program.
{28861}{28916}I will never, ever|cut a player
{28918}{28954}who comes out|to play for me,
{28956}{29012}but when you put|that uniform on,
{29015}{29083}that Titan uniform,|you better come to work.
{29121}{29200}We will be perfect...
{29202}{29237}in every aspect of the game.
{29240}{29288}You drop a pass,|you run a mile.
{29289}{29344}You miss a blocking assignment,|you run a mile.
{29346}{29385}You fumble the football,
{29388}{29502}and I will break my foot off|in your John Brown hind parts...
{29505}{29540}and then you will run a mile.
{29543}{29581}Perfection!
{29659}{29687}Let's go to work.
{29749}{29790}Move!|Move those feet!
{29793}{29820}Get up, boy! Get up! Get up!
{29821}{29875}Get up! Get up! Get up!
{29913}{29953}Keep those heads up!
{29954}{30005}Keep those feet moving!
{30006}{30040}Everything|we gonna do is changing.
{30043}{30084}We are change.
{30084}{30126}We're gonna change|the way we run.
{30128}{30184}We're gonna change|the way we eat.
{30184}{30218}We're gonna change|the way we block.
{30219}{30276}We're gonna change|the way we tackle.
{30279}{30315}We're gonna change|the way we win.
{30318}{30369}Defense is desire!
{30372}{30394}Fire and desire.
{30396}{30437}Defense! Come on!
{30503}{30579}Get up. Get outta here.|Go run. Go.
{30681}{30732}Unh!
{30732}{30776}Keep those legs movin'!|Keep those legs apart!
{30777}{30812}Keep movin: keep movin'.
{30815}{30859}Keep that ball with you till|you get outta the briar patch.
{30860}{30918}Show me, son! Show me, 'Bama!
{30921}{30948}Show me, 'Bama!
{30948}{30996}Jump on that ball carrier|like a starving man
{30997}{31035}on a Christmas ham.
{31069}{31092}Hut!
{31161}{31185}Fumble! Fumble!
{31188}{31219}What is wrong with you?
{31220}{31248}Why are you fumbling|my football?
{31250}{31280}My blockers were bad.
{31281}{31304}Your blockers|ain't got nothin'
{31305}{31344}to do with you|holding the ball!
{31346}{31381}Did your blockers|fumble the football,
{31383}{31419}or did you fumble|the football?
{31422}{31445}I did, sir.
{31446}{31480}All right. How many|feet are in a mile?
{31481}{31525}How many feet|are in a mile?
{31527}{31579}5,280 feet!
{31580}{31679}You pick this ball up,|you run every one of them!
{31682}{31759}You're killing me, Petey!|You're killing me!
{31988}{32046}What you doing, man?
{32049}{32118}Eating lunch.
{32119}{32165}I see you eating lunch.
{32166}{32213}But why you|eating over here?
{32214}{32273}Why don't you go on over there|and eat with your people?
{32276}{32333}Man, I don't have|any people.
{32334}{32368}I'm with everybody,|Julius.
{32368}{32415}He's just|alight-skinned brother.
{32416}{32478}Yeah, and I'm|a dark-skinned cracker.
{32481}{32550}Come on, Julius, he's|just another blessed child
{32553}{32608}in God's loving family.
{32662}{32708}Come on, Blue, let me--
{32804}{32869}Lord, we come|before you today...
{32872}{32965}and ask you to soften|big Julius Campbell's heart.
{32965}{33044}Look at that traitor.
{33047}{33088}And Rev?|He better be praying
{33088}{33157}I block for|his black behind.
{33160}{33205}Yeah, but, Ray,|if you don't block
{33208}{33245}you're not gonna start.
{33246}{33301}I'll start.
{33302}{33335}I'll just bide|my time.
{33336}{33404}I got some plays we won|the city title with last year.
{33404}{33483}Got some trick plays,|some stuff that might
{33485}{33558}fi re up the boys'|imaginations a little bit.
{33561}{33605}Trick plays?
{33606}{33650}I think unless the boys|start having a little fun
{33651}{33699}they're not gonna put points|up on that board for you.
{33701}{33736}You worry|about your defense.
{33736}{33765}Let me worry about|the offense.
{33767}{33850}All right.
{33853}{33895}Lastik!
{34041}{34111}I want you to|tell me something
{34113}{34148}about one of your|black teammates.
{34151}{34179}Sir, yes, sir!
{34181}{34214}I'm rooming with Blue, sir,
{34216}{34284}and I noticed he wears those|leopard-spotted under wears,
{34285}{34322}bikini-style, sir!
{34323}{34392}OK, maybe somebody|who's not your roommate.
{34395}{34439}Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.
{34440}{34484}That's Jerry Harris, sir!
{34487}{34532}People call him Rev|'cause he's always praying,
{34532}{34611}and he won't abide|a foul tongue, sir!
{34613}{34656}And what is the Rev gonna|do after high school?
{34659}{34693}I don't know.
{34694}{34748}Go to college|and all that, I guess.
{34751}{34786}What about you?|You gonna go to college?
{34789}{34823}Oh, not me, Coach.
{34824}{34860}I ain't a brainiac|like Rev.
{34861}{34898}Think you got a future|in football?
{34899}{34971}Heck, no. I just figure|if I got to be in school
{34974}{35019}I might as well hit some|people while I'm at it.
{35020}{35063}All right, I like that.
{35064}{35104}A self-aware man,|I like that.
{35105}{35159}But if you don't|go to college,
{35160}{35210}it's not gonna be because|you're not qualified,
{35211}{35256}so I want you to bring me|your test scores
{35259}{35314}at the end of every week, and|we'll go over them together, OK?
{35316}{35361}We'll keep that|between you and me.
{35362}{35389}OK.
{35390}{35479}So, what kind of music|does the Rev like?
{35481}{35519}Me and Rev both|dig on The Temptations.
{35522}{35546}Oh, yeah?
{35547}{35596}! I know you want|to leave me !
{35598}{35694}! But I refuse|to let you go !
{35695}{35742}!!If I got to pray!!
{35743}{35793}!!Plead for your sympathy!!
{35794}{35834}! I don't mind !
{35835}{35883}! 'Cause you mean|that much to me !
{35884}{35938}!Ain't too proud|to beg !
{35939}{35986}OK, all right.|Stop begging.
{35989}{36043}Anybody else?
{36107}{36154}No volunteers?
{36219}{36246}Campbell?
{36309}{36363}Bertier?
{36408}{36449}No, huh?
{36524}{36634}Each one of you|will spend time every day
{36637}{36700}with a teammate of|a different race.
{36702}{36764}You will learn|about him and his family,
{36765}{36802}his likes, his dislikes.
{36803}{36871}You will report back to me
{36873}{36939}until you meet every one|of your teammates.
{36940}{37028}Until that time,|we go to 3-a-day practices.
{37028}{37087}You continue|to ignore each other,
{37089}{37145}we'll go|to 4-a-daypractices.
{37146}{37200}Now, is there any part of this|you don't understand?
{37210}{37275}Let's see.|What's your daddy's name?
{37276}{37323}I mean, you do have|a daddy right?
{37324}{37399}I have a father,|and his name is Eric.
{37402}{37446}And what's he do?
{37447}{37499}Wait, he does have|a job, right?
{37501}{37612}!!!!|!! They're gonna|put me in the movies!!
{37615}{37718}Huh? Yes! This one.
{37721}{37776}I don't even have|to ask, but I will.
{37777}{37811}What do you think|of this one?
{37813}{37883}Does the term ''cruel|and unusual punishment''
{37885}{37926}mean anything to you?
{37951}{37995}2 minutes to go|in the game.
{37996}{38036}The other team is out there,|they're tired.
{38037}{38077}Fourth quarter.|Fourth quarter.
{38078}{38122}Fourth quarter.
{38125}{38184}Nobody from my family|ever went to no college.
{38184}{38209}I'll tutor you,|Louie.
{38211}{38246}I'm white trash!
{38248}{38290}I ain't gonna get|no C-plus grades!
{38291}{38339}I'm just down-home, no-good,
{38342}{38411}never-goin'-to-no-college|white trash, man!
{38413}{38448}Would you hurry up|and get off the phone?
{38448}{38478}I got to call|my girl, too, man!
{38479}{38510}Say it right now.
{38512}{38601}Oh, oh, don't|do this right now.
{38602}{38654}Hey, man, what is this,|Wild Kingdom?
{38657}{38681}Shut up, y'all!
{38682}{38722}Mating habits of|the mountain gorillas?
{38723}{38774}Gerry, you say it, or I'm|not hanging up the phone.
{38776}{38853}Say it right now.
{38856}{38887}I love you, sugar.
{38888}{38949}Ha ha ha!|''I love you, sugar!''
{38952}{38976}Left!
{38979}{39013}Let's go!
{39014}{39044}Watch it!|Watch it!
{39045}{39093}Set! Hut!
{39165}{39199}et him!|Get him! Get him!
{39236}{39267}What are y' all doing?
{39268}{39335}44 stack! You're supposed|to know your jobs!
{39336}{39395}Campbell, you're playing|selfish, show-off football.
{39397}{39422}Hold your man down.
{39424}{39459}Don't you single me out|like that.
{39460}{39496}What, you think|I'm stupid or something?
{39497}{39531}Listen,|I'm the team captain,
{39532}{39568}and I don't need you|up in my face--
{39607}{39641}We're here to|play football, y'all.
{39642}{39675}Let's play football.
{39676}{39724}Doc?
{39727}{39758}I got it.
{39761}{39800}Y'all didn't come|out here to practice!
{39802}{39857}'Cause champions|pay the price!
{39858}{39915}Lookin' like a bunch|of bums out here!
{39916}{39994}Who's a coward?|Cowards won't block.
{39997}{40046}Cowards won't tackle.
{40047}{40108}Cowards won't|go after fumbles.
{40111}{40145}Coach,|we need a water break.
{40146}{40169}We been out here all day.
{40197}{40244}What did you say?
{40245}{40283}I said we need|a water break.
{40285}{40331}You need a water break.
{40333}{40405}Water is for cowards.|Water makes you weak.
{40406}{40461}Water is for washing|blood off that uniform,
{40464}{40509}and you don't get|no blood on my uniform.
{40512}{40575}Boy, you must be|outside your mind!
{40577}{40636}We are going to do up-downs
{40639}{40726}until Blue is no longer|tired and thirsty.
{40978}{41020}Coach!
{41144}{41215}There's a fine line|between tough and crazy,
{41216}{41264}and you're firting|with it.
{41428}{41476}All right,|get some water.
{41476}{41588}I'll take that.
{41589}{41633}Hey, wait|your turn, boy.
{41636}{41664}Who you calling|a boy, cracker?
{41665}{41732}Yaah!
{41733}{41788}Quit it, jerks!
{41789}{41859}Come on! You're all acting|like a bunch of sissies!
{41860}{41895}Quit it!
{42100}{42210}All right, man, listen.|I'm Gerry, you're Julius.
{42212}{42245}Let's get some particulars
{42247}{42282}and just get this|over with, all right?
{42284}{42319}- Particulars?|- Yeah.
{42322}{42347}No matter what I tell you,
{42349}{42384}you ain't never gonna know|nothing about me.
{42387}{42460}Listen, I ain't runnin'|any more of these 3-a-days.
{42461}{42500}What I got to say,|you really don't want to hear
{42501}{42581}'cause honesty ain't too high|on your people's priority list.
{42583}{42628}Honesty?|You want honesty?
{42629}{42704}All right, honestly,|I think you're nothing.
{42707}{42740}Nothing|but a pure waste
{42741}{42782}of God-given talent.
{42785}{42830}You don't listen|to nobody, man.
{42833}{42879}Not even Doc or Boone!
{42882}{42926}Shiver push on the line|every time, man.
{42929}{42982}You blow right past 'em!
{42985}{43067}Push 'em!|Pull 'em! Do something!
{43068}{43115}You can't run over|everybody in this league,
{43116}{43176}and every time you do, you|leave one of your teammates
{43177}{43222}hanging out to dry--|me in particular!
{43225}{43300}Why should I give a hoot|about you, huh?
{43300}{43345}Or anybody else out there?
{43347}{43388}You want to talk about a waste,|you the captain?
{43389}{43414}Right.

{63815}{63887}But there are a lot|of pretty women here.
{63888}{63953}Hey.
{63956}{63991}Look at 'em, Gerry.
{64018}{64047}They hate us.
{64049}{64160}Nah. Just a bad day.|Things'll cool down.
{64162}{64213}No, Gerry. They're|always gonna hate us.
{64254}{64313}We don't need you here,|either, hippie boy.
{64314}{64368}You hear|what he said?
{64402}{64427}Hey, man.
{64430}{64454}Hey, Julius.
{64455}{64509}Man, it's crazy|out here, man.
{64510}{64557}Yeah, well,|what did you expect?
{64560}{64636}I don't know. I ain't quite|expect it to be like this.
{64638}{64721}Ah, sorry. Julius,|this is Emma.
{64832}{64896}!!Now the time has come!!
{64896}{64941}!! Time!!
{64944}{65003}Camp over now, huh?
{65006}{65074}Back to the real world,|Bertier.
{65075}{65136}This is what|they're integrating us for?
{65139}{65209}We'd have been better off|staying where we were.
{65267}{65295}!! Time!!
{65363}{65391}!! Time!!
{65489}{65527}Mmm.
{65528}{65612}Yeah, this is|my sanctuary right here.
{65658}{65719}All this hatred and turmoil|swirling around us,
{65720}{65788}but this...|this is always right.
{65791}{65840}Struggle.
{65843}{65891}Survival.
{65894}{65932}Victory and defeat.
{66032}{66079}It's just a game, Doc,|but...
{66135}{66165}I love it.
{66216}{66330}Coach, I'm afraid I've put you|into a no-win situation.
{66333}{66373}I just found out the board|didn't even think
{66374}{66408}you'd make it out of camp.
{66408}{66439}And now that you have,
{66440}{66494}I've learned that|at the first sign of trouble--
{66497}{66528}Trouble?|What kind of trouble?
{66528}{66583}Lose a game...
{66586}{66615}they'll fire you
{66618}{66672}and turn it back over|to Yoast.
{66673}{66727}One game,|just like that?
{66728}{66755}Mm-hmm.
{66756}{66795}What about my family?
{66796}{66820}We just got here.
{66820}{66857}They just expect me|to pick up and move?
{66858}{66888}What about my girls?
{66891}{66967}I--I don't know|what to say, I...
{66968}{67032}I'm sorry, Coach.
{67035}{67076}! Pump, pump,|pump it up! !
{67077}{67118}! Pump, pump,|pump it up! !
{67121}{67167}! Pump that Titan spirit up! !
{67169}{67204}Look at 'em.
{67205}{67229}They come here|to watch the game,
{67231}{67301}and they still don't|want no part of us.
{67602}{67635}! Give us more !
{67636}{67681}! Do your stuff,|let's go! !
{67860}{67914}All right,|everybody on their feet.
{67917}{67962}On your feet, on your feet.|Let's go, let's go.
{68011}{68044}Listen up.
{68044}{68085}I'm not gonna talk|to you tonight about...
{68086}{68154}winnin' and losin'.
{68157}{68222}You're already winners,
{68225}{68271}'cause you didn't|kill each other up at camp.
{68274}{68380}Tonight, we got Hayfield.
{68380}{68418}Like all the other schools|in this conference,
{68421}{68452}they're all white.
{68455}{68538}They don't have|to worry about race.
{68541}{68583}We do.
{68585}{68675}But we're better|for it, men.
{68678}{68754}Let me tell you something.|You don't let anything...
{68757}{68803}nothin'...
{68805}{68840}come between us.
{68840}{68884}Nothin' tears us apart.
{68885}{68915}Greekmythology,
{68918}{68994}the titans were greater|even than the gods.
{68997}{69056}They ruled their universe|with absolute power.
{69059}{69100}Well, that football field|out there tonight,
{69103}{69148}that's our universe.
{69148}{69209}Let's rule it like titans.
{69210}{69241}Got it!
{69401}{69429}So the Titans defense
{69432}{69471}takes the field|for the first time
{69473}{69508}against|the Hay field Hawks,
{69509}{69552}led by quarterback|Daniel Cullum
{69553}{69611}on the Hawks|32-yardline.
{69612}{69642}Ohh!
{69689}{69728}We're moving like molasses|out there,
{69731}{69759}for crying out loud!
{69762}{69799}I mean, come on!
{69800}{69851}Uhh! Ooh!
{69852}{69889}Mama.

{69979}{70009}What?
{70010}{70067}You guys can do|better than that--uhh!
{70070}{70104}Yeah!
{70105}{70156}Huddle up.|Fellas, huddle up.
{70157}{70191}Bosley? Where's Alan?
{70193}{70239}Alan, you've got to|stick your man!
{70242}{70283}They're gonna score on us|all night if you don't--
{70284}{70314}He's too fast, Gerry.|I can't stick with him.
{70317}{70361}Let's go, let's go!
{70362}{70400}22! Hut!
{70530}{70564}Touchdown, Hawks!
{70713}{70750}Shape up that|defense, Yoast.
{70753}{70780}You just worry|about your offense.

{71435}{71480}There's no excuse!|No excuse!
{71481}{71515}You want to play|football or not?
{71518}{71567}Do you want to|play football--
{71569}{71600}Boy, get over there|on the bench?
{71661}{71713}Herb, take over for me.
{71714}{71744}You got it.
{71744}{71823}Petey!|You all right?
{71824}{71888}I was a 2-year starter|at G.W.
{71889}{71927}All this yelling|he's doing,
{71929}{71980}it--it don't do nothing|but make me play worse.
{71981}{72012}I can't play for this man.
{72014}{72055}You come play|linebacker for me.
{72056}{72119}23's killing us. I want|you to get out there,
{72121}{72160}I want you|to cover him for me.
{72162}{72211}- You want me to go in now?|- Yeah.
{72214}{72259}I can't! I--I...
{72261}{72306}I haven't practiced|with the defense. I can't.
{72307}{72350}hat doesn't matter.|Just get out there.
{72351}{72392}I want you to cover 23.|That's all you have to do.
{72395}{72430}We'll talk|about theres to fit
{72431}{72467}when we|put this one away.
{72468}{72540}You think Yoast is trying to|let them score on purpose?
{72540}{72564}What?
{72564}{72588}Do you?
{72588}{72619}Oh, come on, Herman.
{72621}{72652}OK, let's go.

{78617}{78660}He acting all crazy|and stuff, man.
{78660}{78691}It don't even|make no sense.
{78692}{78722}Petey.
{78723}{78763}He know the man's|from out of town.
{78815}{78866}5 times--5 times,|player of the week.
{78869}{78927}He's not some|walk-on scrub, Yoast.
{78928}{78979}The boy's a player.|He's a star.
{78980}{79018}And he busted|his butt for you.
{79021}{79068}This is all your doing,|you blacks.
{79069}{79119}That is enough.
{79120}{79155}It's my call.
{79157}{79186}Now listen.
{79189}{79243}You just go on|home now, Fred,
{79246}{79302}before you do something|that you're going to regret.
{79473}{79521}Yeah, well...
{79524}{79558}I guess we won't be seeing|much of him, huh?
{79559}{79594}I will.
{79597}{79634}He's on the deacon|board with me.
{79703}{79754}All right,|listen, about Petey...
{79757}{79795}no thanks required,|Coach.
{79840}{79861}Thanks?
{79895}{79929}You challenged|my authority
{79932}{79988}in front of the entire|football team, Coach.
{79988}{80039}Now, you think you're|doing these boys a favor
{80040}{80101}taking them aside every time|I come down on them,
{80104}{80196}protecting them|from big bad Boone.
{80197}{80245}You're cutting my legs|from under me.
{80272}{80302}Some of the boys|just don't respond well
{80303}{80335}to public criticism.
{80337}{80369}I tell them|what they need to know,
{80372}{80413}but I don't|humiliate them
{80416}{80479}in front of the team.
{80481}{80519}Which boys are you|talking about?
{80566}{80599}Which ones|you talking about?
{80601}{80650}I come down on Bertier.|I don't see you coddle him.
{80693}{80724}Come down on Sunshine.
{80725}{80791}Don't see you grab his hand,|take him off to the side.
{80793}{80870}Which boys|are you talking about?
{80872}{80920}Now, I may be a mean cuss,
{80923}{80958}but I'm the same|mean cuss
{80961}{81040}with everybody out there|on that football field.
{81041}{81064}The world|don't give a damn
{81065}{81096}about how sensitive|these kids are--
{81099}{81157}Especially|the young black kids.
{81188}{81229}You ain't doing|these kids a favor
{81230}{81266}by patronizing them.
{81317}{81366}You're crippling them.
{81369}{81424}You're crippling them|for life.
{81551}{81575}Hey.
{81644}{81681}Gerry,|what are you doing?
{81684}{81729}I'm going down|to the Berg.

{81756}{81777}Yep.
{81780}{81836}What are you doing|at the Berg?
{81837}{81884}I'm going to play|basketball with Julius.
{81885}{81915}Then we're going to|comeback here for dinner.
{81917}{81972}Gerry, if your father|was still alive--
{81973}{82011}Ma, would--
{82013}{82068}Just give him a chance.|Just get to know him.
{82069}{82097}Listen to him|for 2 seconds.
{82100}{82158}I don't want|to get to know him.
{82205}{82261}You are coming to church|with your mother.
{82312}{82367}Right, right, right!
{82370}{82395}He's mine!
{82396}{82419}Hut!
{82570}{82596}ou blew|your assignment!

{82779}{82830}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{82833}{82858}I mean, it's fine, man.
{82860}{82884}I knew you was going|to stand me up.
{82885}{82910}I figured you weren't|going to make out
{82912}{82936}to the Berg, no way.
{82937}{82961}I knew you was all talk,
{82963}{82985}but now you|making us look bad
{82987}{83009}out there on the field.
{83011}{83050}Don't talk to me, man.
{83053}{83083}You ain't got nothing|to say to me.
{83084}{83139}Why the clouds,|Sunshine?
{83140}{83180}I can't make|that pitch, Petey.
{83181}{83232}You ain't gonna|never play anyway,
{83235}{83293}unless we're up|by 50 points.
{83296}{83321}And seeing as how|we ain't never gonna be
{83323}{83347}up by no 50 points,
{83348}{83393}you might as well|just sit back, relax,
{83396}{83427}and enjoy the bench.
{83428}{83467}How's it going, yo?
{83468}{83527}Man, I didn't sign up|to play like this.
{83529}{83571}These guys we're playing|got no heart.
{83574}{83612}We play like this|against Groveton,
{83613}{83642}we're going down.
{83643}{83695}OK, Offense.|Offense, let's go.
{83771}{83801}Hut!
{83893}{83942}Touchdown, Titans!
{83945}{83986}Game, Titans!
{84195}{84226}How you doing, Coach?
{84227}{84271}Good morning.
{84273}{84295}Where's your dad?
{84297}{84322}He's in his office.
{84323}{84356}Nicky, you allright?
{84357}{84397}Yes, Daddy.
{84398}{84421}OK.
{84424}{84458}What you doing?
{84459}{84528}Shooting some hoops.
{84531}{84566}Want to play?
{84720}{84761}I just did my nails.
{84794}{84857}How you doing?|Tyrell.
{84860}{84899}Coach--ahem--|if you don't need me,
{84901}{84929}I'm going to--
{84932}{84964}I'm going|to wait out back.
{84967}{84988}All right, Herb.
{85025}{85076}Coach Boone, to what|do I owe this surprise?
{85079}{85107}Have a seat.
{85156}{85189}I'll get straight to it.
{85192}{85224}We won't survive|another game
{85227}{85259}like the one we played|last Friday,
{85261}{85333}so I spoke to Mr. Vernon|the math teacher,
{85334}{85399}asked him to look at|the game fi lm from Groveton,
{85401}{85447}who we got next week.
{85450}{85519}I asked him|to analyze it for me.
{85521}{85570}Every coach has|certain tendencies--
{85604}{85648}All of them|except Ed Henry.
{85649}{85694}The only time|we'd be seeing Ed Henry
{85697}{85738}is at the state|championship.
{85739}{85776}Mm-hmm.
{85907}{85971}Well, gosh, this is...
{85972}{86009}this is great stuff--
{86012}{86067}Every quarter|broken down,
{86068}{86115}how many times they run|each play. I mean--
{86116}{86174}You like that, huh?
{86177}{86243}We'll be very tough|defensively with this.
{86246}{86280}I think so.
{86312}{86360}I brought Nicky by.
{86362}{86397}She was asking me|about Sheryl.
{86400}{86424}I'm getting|ready to take her over
{86425}{86475}to some of|her friends' house.
{86476}{86521}Any time you want to|bring her by the house,
{86523}{86564}we'd be more than|happy to have her.
{86657}{86702}!!!!
{86942}{87014}Oh, he's so cute.
{87017}{87075}He's in|my third period class.
{87127}{87199}What y' all staring|at old Sunshine for?
{87202}{87240}I'm the one dominating|on the field.
{87243}{87272}He ain't played|a minute all year.
{87274}{87315}Who cares|about the field?
{87315}{87363}Well, I don't want to be|the one to break your heart,
{87366}{87404}but Sunshine's|from California.
{87405}{87452}Yeah. A California|dreamboat.
{87453}{87490}No.
{87493}{87552}Sunshine|is from California.
{87552}{87597}He's a Californian--
{87599}{87634}You talking|to my girl?
{87635}{87692}I don't see any|livestock around here,
{87693}{87761}so I don't know what|you talkin' 'bout.
{87762}{87795}Ohh.
{87829}{87850}It's a fight!
{87853}{87877}Guys, stop it!
{87878}{87913}Get off me. Get off me.
{87916}{87943}Hey!
{87978}{88002}You want some?
{88005}{88047}Hey, hey, break it up.
{88049}{88083}Break--
{88084}{88111}et your hands|off me, man!
{88111}{88158}Hey, get off me!

{88350}{88372}Uncle Tom traitor!
{88374}{88396}Uncle Tom!
{88399}{88440}I know you didn't call me|no Uncle Tom.
{88441}{88484}Y'all better|back off me now, man.
{88485}{88516}Go! Move!
{88516}{88540}Looks like you went|to the zoo
{88540}{88591}and made some|new friends, Bertier.
{88592}{88684}Oh, big smart guy, huh?
{88686}{88715}!!Ah!!
{88717}{88755}!!Ahah!!

{88927}{88962}Marie|has asked about Sheryl.
{88965}{88999}Wanted to know if she could|come over and spend the night.
{88999}{89047}I told her I'd run it by you,|see what you thought.
{89047}{89084}Yeah.
{89085}{89112}She's over|at the Boones' tonight.
{89115}{89153}I was going to swing by
{89156}{89188}on my way home|and pick her up.
{89188}{89243}Over at the Boones', huh?
{89245}{89273}Yeah.
{89353}{89421}So that's the way|it is, huh?
{89422}{89449}Yeah, you haven't|changed a bit.
{89452}{89492}You was the one trying|to please everybody,
{89493}{89531}be the nice guy.
{89533}{89603}Sooner or later,|a man's got to pick sides.
{89634}{89701}As for me, well, I'm--|I'm not going to put myself
{89702}{89750}- through the rest of the season|with that uppity--|- Hey.
{89753}{89808}I brought you here.
{89809}{89869}I want you with me,
{89870}{89919}but you got to do|what you got to do.
{90038}{90066}That's all|you can say to me
{90068}{90103}after all|we've been through?
{90106}{90127}Do what you got to do?
{90130}{90154}Hey, Herb--
{90155}{90179}You go to hell.
{90443}{90476}That veer's|getting better.
{90477}{90515}I'll admit that.
{90516}{90552}But you're still weak|on the left side.
{90555}{90590}We're not weak|on the left side.
{90591}{90652}We just got to work harder|on the left side, that's all.
{90653}{90694}- That's not the problem.|- What is the problem?
{90696}{90740}You think it is, but it ain't.|It's your pass reads.
{90741}{90778}It's not--|It's a run anyway.
{90779}{90812}It's not a pass.|The veer is a run.
{90813}{90865}All right, you two,|that's enough of that.
{90868}{90947}Sheryl, don't you want|to play with Nicky?
{90948}{91015}I hate playing|with dolls.
{91016}{91076}I'm not playing.|I'm accessorizing.
{91077}{91105}Yeah, why don't you|go accessorize?
{91108}{91166}Don't you want to go|accessorize with--
{91225}{91269}Hey, ''Coach Coon!''
{91331}{91395}In the back.|In the back.
{91396}{91443}Mommy!

{92251}{92288}Where you going?|Turn around.
{92290}{92336}Coach Boone brought us|this far, y'all,
{92338}{92405}but he ain't going to be|there for us forever, man.
{92408}{92469}So what?|We won a few games.
{92472}{92542}And y'all fools|think that's something?
{92544}{92586}Man, that ain't|nothing, y'all.
{92587}{92623}And you know what else?
{92624}{92675}We ain't nothing, either.
{92676}{92753}Yeah, we came together|in camp. Cool.
{92754}{92784}But then|we're right back here,
{92785}{92819}and the world tells us
{92819}{92858}that they don't want us|to be together.
{92860}{92895}We fall apart
{92898}{92959}like we ain't a damn bit|of nothing, man.
{92960}{93011}And y' all think|we done won something?
{93012}{93072}Man, we ain't won|nothing, y'all--
{93073}{93117}Nothing.
{93120}{93148}Rev, what's|that you're always
{93148}{93175}telling me|when I get sick
{93176}{93242}of trying to keep up|with my grades and stuff?
{93244}{93299}! Even youths !
{93302}{93348}! Grow tired and weary!
{93382}{93439}! Even young men|stumble and fall !
{93440}{93499}! But those who trust|in the Lord !
{93501}{93574}!Will renew|their strength !
{93577}{93611}Say amen.
{93612}{93656}Amen. That's what|I'm talking about.
{93659}{93700}Amen--amen, right?
{93701}{93731}That's right, Rev.
{93732}{93761}!! They will soar!!
{93762}{93811}!! On wings|like eagles!!
{93813}{93862}! Oh, like eagles, y'all !
{93865}{93907}! Like eagles, y'all !
{93910}{93948}!They will walk!
{93951}{94010}!And not grow faint !
{94012}{94074}Yeah.|Can I get an amen?
{94077}{94112}Yeah!
{94149}{94183}Yeah.
{94184}{94207}Yeah.
{94246}{94335}We're playing Groveton|Friday night, y'all.
{94336}{94390}You all gonna play like|you ain't got no heart?
{94392}{94420}No!
{94421}{94454}Do you all want|a victory?
{94455}{94479}Yeah!
{94480}{94516}Do you all want|a victory?
{94516}{94543}Yeah!

{94671}{94692}Yeah!
{94750}{94784}Like I said,
{94785}{94818}we will not be|intimidated.
{94821}{94857}We're going to play|football games.
{94859}{94925}Hatred, violence|will not intimidate us.
{94927}{94949}Is that|why you need
{94952}{94977}the state troopers,|Coach?
{94979}{95031}Look, I don't need no|John Brown state troopers.
{95031}{95061}And you can tell whoever|threw this brick
{95062}{95086}through my window
{95089}{95123}they can come visit me|anytime.
{95124}{95147}I'll be at home.
{95148}{95178}I think it's time|you stopped
{95179}{95232}antagonizing everybody and|learned a little humility.
{95233}{95260}Humility, huh?
{95261}{95318}You know, if you could|just keep your mouth shut
{95319}{95363}and if you didn't|brag so much--
{95363}{95399}I see.|So you're blaming me
{95401}{95426}for what happened|last night?
{95429}{95487}No. I am talking about|setting a good example
{95490}{95531}for our boys|and for the community.
{95532}{95576}I don't scratch my head|unless it itches,
{95577}{95624}and I don't dance unless|I hear some music.
{95625}{95682}I will not be intimidated.|That's just the way it is.
{95685}{95721}If you want to carry|your sinful pride with you
{95723}{95759}to your grave,|that's your business,
{95761}{95813}But when your sins|end anger my little girl,
{95816}{95854}it becomes mine.
{95855}{95888}My sins?
{95888}{95936}You think my sins|had something to do
{95936}{95974}with what happened|last night?
{95975}{96019}I'm sorry about what|happened to your daughter,
{96022}{96053}I really am,
{96056}{96088}but may be you got|a small taste
{96090}{96131}of what my girls|go through.
{96132}{96172}Hmm?

{127164}{127244}What are you|talking about?
{127247}{127306}You would've been in that bed|right next to me.
{127309}{127373}You can't be hurt|like this.
{127423}{127497}You--you're Superman.
{127662}{127706}I was afraid of you,|Julius.
{127782}{127863}I only saw|what I was afraid of.
{127865}{127949}And now I know I was|only hating my brother.
{128015}{128066}I'll tell you what,|though.
{128069}{128128}Um, when all this|is over...
{128129}{128189}me and you are|gonna move out
{128190}{128227}to the same|neighborhood together.
{128228}{128320}OK? And, um...
{128321}{128410}and we'll get old,|and we'll get fat.
{128412}{128458}And there ain't gonna be|all this black-white
{128460}{128484}between us.
{128630}{128683}Left side.
{128728}{128776}Strong side.
{128945}{128975}Good morning.
{128976}{129003}Good morning.
{129043}{129110}Uh, the Marshall fi lm.
{129112}{129143}Well, that's good.
{129146}{129174}We're gonna have|to be real sharp
{129177}{129247}on the offensive|and defensive sides
{129249}{129278}of the football.
{129280}{129315}Figure we give|the kids
{129315}{129352}a couple of extra|practices this week,
{129352}{129389}make sure|they stay focused.
{129390}{129468}Got a press conference|today at 1 2 noon.
{129469}{129524}Press conference?
{129527}{129605}Listen, what we do here|amongst ourselves is one thing,
{129606}{129657}but we are not gonna|parade around
{129660}{129699}talking about football|at a time like this.
{129699}{129734}Hold on. I'm not talking|about parading.
{129736}{129782}I'm talking about|going out there,
{129784}{129828}presentin' a strong,|united front.
{129829}{129878}Now, I'm hurtin'...
{129880}{129924}just like you are,|Yoast,
{129925}{129991}but the season|is not over yet.
{129994}{130059}I did--We did not|come this far
{130059}{130117}to just break down|and lose now.
{130118}{130199}Everything's not always|about winning and losing.
{130199}{130247}I'm a winner.
{130285}{130334}I'm going to win.
{130336}{130415}Is this even about|football anymore?
{130418}{130467}Or is it just about you?
{130495}{130535}Coach Boone...
{130536}{130597}Uh, Coach,|you lost Bertier...
{130598}{130636}Is your defense|in trouble?
{130638}{130697}You cannot replace|a Gerry Bertier...
{130755}{130814}as a player or person.
{130936}{130971}I don't know, Mama.
{131080}{131111}Maybe Yoast was right.
{131112}{131159}Maybe I pushed 'em|too hard.
{131160}{131211}Gerry had an accident.
{131255}{131307}Sometimes life's|just hard.
{131338}{131380}For no reason at all.
{131382}{131447}You think I was blinded|by my own ambition?
{131447}{131561}Mm. Whatever kind|of ambition it took
{131564}{131629}to do what you did|around here...
{131630}{131694}this world could use|a lot more of it, Herman.
{131697}{131731}Hmm.
{131982}{132017}Hey, Coach.
{132018}{132044}Hey, Coach.
{132045}{132075}ow you doing?
{132226}{132268}This for me?
{132270}{132352}I want you to be my eyes|out there, all right?
{132397}{132432}Any of these guys slack off,
{132435}{132479}you just let me know.
{132480}{132521}You bet I will.
{132563}{132621}How you doing, Gerry?
{132624}{132662}I'm all right, Coach.
{132665}{132700}I was just talking|to these guys about Marshall,
{132702}{132727}trying to get 'em--
{132730}{132784}You don't need to talk|about football now.
{132785}{132843}I think this is a good|time for refection
{132843}{132871}and for prayer--
{132871}{132908}Coach...
{132911}{132953}I'm hurt.
{132956}{132983}I ain't dead.
{132984}{133042}No, you're not.
{133043}{133084}No, you're not.
{133127}{133180}You know, I've been,|uh, reading up
{133183}{133240}on the activities|that they got for people
{133241}{133296}in wheelchairs and such.

{133471}{133535}of state high school football|championships.
{133536}{133580}The Virginia triple 'A. ''

{134595}{134647}I just want|to say I'm sorry.
{134648}{134708}You abandoned your team|in their moment of need, Petey.
{134708}{134732}''Sorry'' won't make up|for that.

{134764}{134812}listen, I want|to play for you.

{138882}{138941}Do not come in here!
{138988}{139015}They got receivers|everywhere out there.
{139018}{139060}It's like watching|Monday Night Football.
{139063}{139108}Good hustle, good hustle,|good hustle.
{139108}{139153}Just give him|a little cushion.
{139156}{139194}And when they throw|that ball, you stick him.
{139195}{139221}- Ready?|- Break!

{139872}{139917}Set!
{139918}{139941}Hut!
{140181}{140226}They're a mile|ahead of us.
{140227}{140256}He's a mile ahead|of you, Coach.
{140257}{140288}If your defense|would stop somebody,
{140290}{140329}we'd get the ball|a little more.
{140330}{140363}Well, the Titans|gave 'em a scare,
{140366}{140434}but Ed Henry looks|supremely confident.
{140435}{140493}T. C. Williams|goes in at the half
{140494}{140534}trailing 7-0.
{140535}{140572}Coach!
{140575}{140600}Sweetheart.
{140602}{140627}You better get back|to your seat.
{140627}{140668}I can't, Coach.|What?
{140671}{140722}Ed Henry's got Boone's|number, sure as shoot in'.
{140723}{140813}And you ain't doin' nothin'|against that shotgun.
{140816}{140843}Look, Coach...
{140846}{140909}now ain't the time|to be proud.
{140912}{140967}It's all right.|We're in a fight.
{140994}{141056}You boys are doing|all that you can do.
{141057}{141091}Anybody can see that.
{141125}{141203}Win or lose...
{141203}{141248}we gonna walk out|of this stadium tonight
{141248}{141286}with our heads held high.
{141337}{141372}Do your best.
{141375}{141423}That's all anybody|can ask for.
{141426}{141456}No, it ain't, Coach.
{141457}{141550}With all due respect, uh,|you demanded more of us.
{141552}{141608}You demanded perfection.
{141611}{141698}Now, I ain't saying that|I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.
{141700}{141762}And I ain't gonna never be.|None of us are.
{141765}{141866}But we have won every single|game we have played till now.
{141868}{141944}So this team is perfect.
{141945}{142024}We stepped out on that field|that way tonight.
{142026}{142098}And, uh, if it's all the same|to you, Coach Boone,
{142099}{142147}that's how|we want to leave it.
{142150}{142181}Yeah.
{142184}{142255}I hope you boys have learned|as much from me this year
{142256}{142308}as I've learned from you.
{142311}{142390}You've taught this city how|to trust the soul of a man
{142392}{142435}rather than the look of him.
{142438}{142516}And I guess it's about time|I joined the club.
{142517}{142585}Herman! I sure could|use your help.
{142588}{142640}Ed Henry's kicking my ass|out there.
{142643}{142702}Listen up.|This is our time now.
{142705}{142750}Second half is our time!
{142752}{142787}We gonna make some changes|on defense.
{142790}{142826}They're spreading us out|too far.
{142828}{142928}We gonna put Sunshine, Alan,|Glascoe, Davis.
{142931}{142991}You gonna play both ways,|rest of the game.
{142993}{143023}I don't want a receiver
{143024}{143065}to get across that line|of scrimmage.
{143068}{143123}Coach Yoast will tell you|where you're playing, all right?
{143123}{143161}Let's go. It's our time.|Everybody in.

{143617}{143656}I didn't warm the bench|all year
{143658}{143702}so I could watch us|go down on my account.
{143703}{143778}Put Petey in.|He's better.
