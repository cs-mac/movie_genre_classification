1
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,842
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:21,242
I have killed you...

3
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:25,002
over and over in my mind...

4
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,502
because you made my one
and only friend die.

5
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,172
Because I cannot forgive you.

6
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:38,702
Every time I saw you,

7
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,542
I could not kill you...

8
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:44,342
even after I knew you were the King.

9
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:50,072
I wanted to believe that you were not.

10
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:08,002
If you must kill me in order for it to end,

11
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,942
strike me.

12
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:16,272
But will it really end...

13
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:18,942
if you kill me?

14
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,472
How many more must you kill for it to end?

15
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:26,541
Will it end if you kill the officials?

16
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,502
The noblemen?

17
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:31,602
No.

18
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:35,101
As soon as someone else takes their place,

19
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:36,901
they will do the same thing.

20
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,172
Whom will you kill then?

21
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:47,802
I wanted to change Silla...

22
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,872
with you.

23
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:54,442
I wanted to prevent deaths...

24
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,172
caused by the Bone-rank System.

25
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,772
I dreamed of becoming more than Silla...

26
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,402
and unifying the Three Kingdoms.

27
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,642
But if this is where it ends,

28
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:14,742
strike me.

29
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:37,972
Now,

30
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,602
there is no debt between us.

31
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:44,242
Is this...

32
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,142
the end?

33
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,172
We have different paths.

34
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:54,542
I guess...

35
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,902
the next time we meet,

36
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,102
we will be enemies.

37
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,772
I must switch the king.

38
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:23,042
Do you mean you will
remove King Jinheung...

39
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,701
and make someone else king?

40
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:26,972
No.

41
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:30,572
I mean I will not make anyone king.

42
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,402
Not a king.

43
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:37,941
I will put forth a scarecrow...

44
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,072
who is a Sacred Bone.

45
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,171
Who?

46
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,541
The Hwarang who pretended
to be the King in Baekje.

47
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,872
He is Prince Hwi Kyung's son, Sun Woo.

48
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,041
Prince Hwi Kyung?

49
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,342
Is he not the discarded Sacred Bone?

50
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,702
He is Prince Hwi Kyung's son?

51
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,302
Even if she became ill,

52
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,872
the Queen will not stand for this.

53
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,801
Even after the previous king passed away,

54
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,441
the Queen protected her son all alone.

55
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,311
For now, she has a justification...

56
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,242
as Sacred Bone's guardian.

57
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:18,742
That is why we must take it away.

58
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:22,542
The money, the power,

59
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:24,502
and the position.

60
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,072
She did not get it for free.

61
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:32,902
The people may think it is a rebellion.

62
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:34,741
People?

63
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,171
(Plotting the overthrow of a monarch)

64
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,402
Even when things go awry,

65
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:42,872
subjects bow down in order to live.

66
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,372
There is nothing to be afraid of.

67
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,472
Let us make...

68
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,878
Silla ours. That is my point.

69
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:56,872
It is the only way to keep your sheds full.

70
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:31,972
Pa Oh.

71
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:38,472
Once sun rises, bring Wonhwa Ah Ro...

72
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,872
to Wolseong Palace.

73
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,502
King Jinheung...

74
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,472
took Master Ahn Ji's
daughter to the palace?

75
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:52,702
We were a step late.

76
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,942
She is the perfect bait for Master Sun Woo.

77
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,842
How did you lose the chance?

78
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,842
Things will be complicated now.

79
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,172
Master Young Shil, you have a visitor.

80
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,242
Come on in.

81
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,042
This is an interesting picture.

82
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,972
You two look alike.

83
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,302
It is time we talk about
the important matters.

84
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,172
That is why we came here today.

85
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,272
Have you decided...

86
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,902
to wield power instead of being mistreated?

87
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:03,842
You must have heard that the King...

88
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,902
took Master Ahn Ji's daughter.

89
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,102
We must change...

90
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,172
the owner of Silla.

91
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:21,742
What can I help you with?

92
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,772
There is nothing you have to do.

93
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,842
I shall do it with Hwarang.

94
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:30,872
Then what should I do?

95
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,572
You and the other officials...

96
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,672
will support me as a new king.

97
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:44,102
No matter how hard you try,

98
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:48,172
I will be the one who owns Silla.

99
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,972
Silla's owner never changed.

100
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,702
It will be the same this time again.

101
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:21,242
Abdicate the throne? Is that what you said?

102
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:25,372
Yes. That is the only way I can gain power.

103
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:27,842
Marry Princess Sook Myung before then.

104
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,102
Is it that hard for you...

105
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:33,102
to step down?

106
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,642
Do you still see me as a
mother coveting the throne?

107
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:48,042
You can protect the throne
only if you stay objective.

108
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:49,672
A king...

109
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,042
must be able to take his friend's life.

110
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,072
A generous king...

111
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,042
puts the nation into anguish.

112
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,502
He ends up killing all of his subjects.

113
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:08,502
However, an objective monarch...

114
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,242
kills fast and brutally...

115
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:15,342
when the least amount
of damage can be done.

116
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:20,172
That way, he will not have to kill more.

117
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:21,412
Are you saying...

118
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:25,942
a king must kill someone
to stay in position?

119
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,602
Do you think Hwarang is yours?

120
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,602
They believe Master Sun
Woo deserves to be king.

121
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,772
They saw him sacrifice his life...

122
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,102
in front of everyone to protect the people.

123
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,412
Do you...

124
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,772
truly believe that
Hwarangs will follow you?

125
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,342
I will make them mine.

126
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:53,171
How?

127
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,872
As you said,

128
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,272
I will have to find a way...

129
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:01,442
that is the fastest with
minimal casualties.

130
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:23,601
I thought you were going to be king.

131
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,472
Are you still working on it?

132
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,912
"No path started as a path."

133
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,872
Do you remember that?

134
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,742
"No path started as a path."

135
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,972
"Someone must walk on it
for it to become a path."

136
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,541
"You must pound and break the hard land..."

137
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,572
"and pierce through it for
the water to flow out."

138
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:44,602
So...

139
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:48,172
Are you saying you will pound and break...

140
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,001
in order to create a path?

141
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:53,741
I do not want to be a
piece on a chess board.

142
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:55,972
Do not let the order that
someone else created...

143
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:59,602
be the order that you hold yourselves to.

144
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:03,502
You are not pieces on a chess board.

145
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,942
You are freer than anyone. You are Hwarang.

146
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:10,042
I will no longer remain quiet.

147
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,072
You will not remain quiet?

148
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,742
Did you decide on a rebellion?

149
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,772
A weak king cannot do anything.

150
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,602
What Silla needs...

151
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:25,372
is a powerful king who is
willing to change the nation.

152
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:29,542
I need your help, Chief Instructor.

153
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:30,942
Are you...

154
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:34,242
telling me to take a lead in a revolt?

155
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:39,572
I will leave the decision to you.

156
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:45,602
Please come back and help
Hwarangs become one.

157
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,172
If we split up now, I will
not be able to do it.

158
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,442
Why are you so sure I will help you?

159
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,742
Because I know we are on the same page.

160
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:01,942
Our Silla's future depends on it.

161
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:09,742
This is my intent.

162
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:39,872
Please inform the Queen.

163
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,872
That is good. You may go.

164
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,872
I saw her put something in the tea.

165
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,342
- Give it to me.
- It could be poison.

166
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,442
I said, give it to me.

167
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:22,942
I cannot let you drink it
not knowing what it is.

168
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:47,002
It is not poison you can notice instantly.

169
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,572
You need it to build up inside...

170
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,502
in order for it to work.

171
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,402
Did you drink it knowing what is in it?

172
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,772
I had my suspicions from the beginning.

173
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:21,042
Your Highness.

174
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,042
I shall call a physician.

175
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,902
Do not make a fuss.

176
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,472
I have seen...

177
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,302
the symptoms for a while.

178
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,572
This is the only way...

179
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:15,802
to see you by my side.

180
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,042
I heard you are hurt.

181
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,102
How is the injury?

182
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,272
It is fine.

183
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,372
However,

184
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:33,572
if I had not come here,

185
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,402
it would have healed faster.

186
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:40,542
I do not mind even if you heal slowly.

187
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,172
Either way, you will not
be able to leave here.

188
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:50,272
I brought you here as hostage.

189
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,972
A hostage...

190
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:55,972
so that your brother
cannot threaten my throne.

191
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,402
This...

192
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:03,578
is not like you, Your Majesty.

193
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:06,542
Did you forget that my
mother's blood run in me?

194
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:10,402
This might be the chance...

195
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,902
for you to know who I really am.

196
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:25,272
(Hwarang House)

197
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:33,272
Do you really plan on
seizing Hwarang House?

198
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,142
They are my Hwarangs.

199
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:38,471
I am not seizing them.

200
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:40,372
They have been mine from the beginning.

201
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,671
I need to take control now,

202
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,572
or they will go beyond my grasp.

203
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,802
King Jinheung is here. Open the doors.

204
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,701
Who is that?

205
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,742
Is it Ji Dwi?

206
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:21,302
Do people's personalities
change along with clothes?

207
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,972
He is just like the Queen.

208
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,302
He looks cold-hearted and cruel.

209
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:35,302
Hwarangs, show respect to the King!

210
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,702
I am...

211
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:45,872
the master of Hwarang, King Jinheung.

212
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:49,402
While I was in Hwarang, I saw...

213
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:51,072
how lazy...

214
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,172
and weak you were.

215
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:57,542
You were spoiled children
of powerful families.

216
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,142
However, Hwarang will now...

217
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:03,002
be reborn from head to toe...

218
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:05,571
under the management of
Silla's Royal Family...

219
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,272
to become strong warriors.

220
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,872
The King standing over there!

221
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,942
Are you any different?

222
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,742
I believe both you and Hwarang...

223
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:36,372
are weak and powerless.

224
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,172
Your Majesty.

225
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:41,802
Master Sun Woo.

226
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,302
Show your respect.

227
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,302
Master Sun Woo.

228
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:54,612
I said, show your respect.

229
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:04,002
There will be an abdication
four days from now.

230
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,341
As the royal guards...

231
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,541
that serve the King,

232
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,771
you will fulfil your obligations.

233
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,112
Hwarang...

234
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,772
must be free.

235
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:20,471
Only when they think and
move on their free will,

236
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:22,572
they are able to dream of
the future of a new Silla.

237
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:28,002
I am sure you have heard
of this, Your Majesty.

238
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:39,971
Are you going against me now?

239
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,841
I am telling you that we will decide...

240
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,642
for ourselves if we will
accept you as our King!

241
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,772
Are you not confident...

242
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:52,172
that you will be chosen?

243
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,671
There are two kings in Hwarang House.

244
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,471
What is going on?

245
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,872
Come here.

246
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,871
According to my informant,

247
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:14,671
the king might change.

248
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,942
- What?
- What?

249
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:18,112
What do you mean?

250
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:22,001
I thought Sun Woo was a half-breed,

251
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,072
but he's a Sacred Bone.

252
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,842
I knew he was different,

253
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:30,072
but did you see him talking to Ji Dwi?

254
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,612
What do you mean, Ji Dwi?

255
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:34,112
He's King Jinheung.

256
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,801
Instead of gaining control of us,

257
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:44,042
he is now a laughingstock. Poor Ji Dwi.

258
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,302
Ah Ro...

259
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,572
Your sister is all right.

260
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,371
She is currently...

261
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,572
I know.

262
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,902
Thank you about the last time.

263
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:38,772
Also,

264
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:42,702
I am sorry.

265
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:47,972
I am a bad man to you.

266
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,442
Of course, you should be sorry.

267
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:58,442
How can you treat a woman like me this way?

268
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,342
I am not a good man to you,

269
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,002
but you are a good woman.

270
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:14,972
Hence,

271
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:19,072
you should see a man who
feels the same as you.

272
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:47,302
Tea?

273
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:49,671
Did you just say tea?

274
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,372
It seems to have been for a long time.

275
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:54,172
She started coughing blood.

276
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:56,742
She told me not to say anything,

277
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:58,942
but I cannot leave her like that.

278
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,142
What do you think you are doing?

279
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,042
Is it Park Young Shil?

280
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:38,702
Who is behind you?

281
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:41,902
Is it Park Young Shil?

282
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,472
Pa Oh!

283
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,792
I shall follow your royal
command, Your Majesty.

284
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:53,102
Kill her.

285
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,972
Please spare me.

286
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,101
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

287
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,872
Your Highness!

288
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,601
Please spare me, Your Highness.

289
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,302
Please do not kill me.

290
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:20,302
Why did you do it?

291
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:24,872
What do you mean?

292
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,872
You knew it was poisoned.

293
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,642
Why did you drink it?

294
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,502
Why?

295
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,472
I did not know.

296
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:44,102
When I found out, it was too late.

297
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,902
Even if I had refused the tea,

298
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:51,302
they would have used another method.

299
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:53,942
You should have fled.

300
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:58,102
You should have renounced the throne...

301
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:01,242
and fled instead.

302
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,802
I tried to flee.

303
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,602
I wanted to avoid it.

304
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,172
However,

305
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,572
I had to live according to my fate.

306
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,472
If there is something you wish to protect,

307
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:20,742
become stronger.

308
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,742
You must be strong in order to fight.

309
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:28,142
Do not believe in frail hearts of people.

310
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:30,342
That is...

311
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,042
what a king must do.

312
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,172
Mother.

313
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:24,718
Are you reinstating me
as the chief instructor?

314
00:26:24,742 --> 00:26:25,872
That is correct.

315
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:30,372
Then do you plan to disobey...

316
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:33,242
the Queen's orders?

317
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:35,772
My will is the Queen's will.

318
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:39,342
My will is Silla's will.

319
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,502
It is good to see you again.

320
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:05,302
How have you all been?

321
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:07,342
- Well, Master!
- Well, Master!

322
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:10,572
I am standing here today...

323
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,671
because I heard...

324
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,542
you were given a very difficult assignment.

325
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,802
I believe...

326
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:21,542
this choice you make...

327
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:25,002
will create a new Silla
different from the past.

328
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:28,372
Also, I am certain that you
have grown sufficiently...

329
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,872
that you are qualified to make that choice.

330
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,342
Some may call this treason.

331
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:40,842
Also,

332
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,602
some may call it your duty.

333
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:47,772
The choice is yours to make.

334
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,101
Will you be a Hwarang that
changes this nation...

335
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,072
from the root?

336
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:56,572
Or will you remain being
unable to do anything?

337
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:58,972
Choose.

338
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:03,272
And if you made a decision,
trust in yourself...

339
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:05,442
until the end.

340
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:09,472
You are Hwarang.

341
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:12,072
Never forget...

342
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,472
that you are Hwarang. Never forget.

343
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:46,742
Is something wrong?

344
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,702
Did you say I asked myself...

345
00:28:51,602 --> 00:28:53,272
over and over...

346
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:55,942
why I must become king?

347
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,242
Did you say you can tell by my eyes...

348
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,472
that I never once gave up?

349
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:07,672
Yes, Your Majesty.

350
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:10,272
That is what I saw.

351
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:14,002
I hope everything you said was correct.

352
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:27,602
Your heart has never once changed.

353
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:31,402
But my heart is racing like this.

354
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,172
I heard the Queen...

355
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,302
is stepping down today.

356
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,102
That is correct.

357
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:48,142
I will become the true King today.

358
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:57,642
Are you...

359
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,802
worrying about me?

360
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:09,342
The throne seems very lonely.

361
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,702
I feel like...

362
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,942
you will sleep less there.

363
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,342
I guess I should thank you...

364
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:22,502
since I became stronger because of you.

365
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,242
Thanks to you,

366
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:28,002
I was able to come this far.

367
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,942
Is that him?

368
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:59,542
What is he doing here?

369
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:18,372
He needs to come on time.

370
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:51,372
We have gathered here today...

371
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:54,472
- to crown...
- Halt!

372
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:08,802
Do you really think...

373
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,372
that throne belongs to you?

374
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:21,071
We the officials think differently.

375
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,701
How dare you...

376
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:25,512
I, the highest official of Silla,

377
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:28,072
choose to crown...

378
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,442
another Scared Bone as king.

379
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,302
Prince Hwi Kyung's son,

380
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:35,042
Master Sun Woo.

381
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,071
The Hwarangs...

382
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:16,272
have chosen a king for the future of Silla.

383
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,242
We Hwarangs...

384
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:22,402
swear our allegiance...

385
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:25,742
to His Majesty who will empower Silla...

386
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,942
and who will serve the needs of the people!

387
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:49,342
Hwarang represents Silla's new conviction!

388
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,402
Devote yourselves to Silla...

389
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:54,572
and to the King of Silla!

390
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,342
Hail King Jinheung!

391
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:08,171
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

392
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,511
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

393
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,841
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

394
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,972
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

395
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:17,701
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

396
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,012
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

397
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:31,941
Traitor Park Young Shil!
You have attempted...

398
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:34,602
to kill the King and planned treason!

399
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:36,741
Receive your punishment.

400
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:38,441
- Master Park.
- Master Park.

401
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:39,742
Furthermore!

402
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:42,771
If anyone stands with him, step forward.

403
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,942
The swords of Hwarang
shall not forgive you!

404
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,602
I wanted...

405
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,472
to change Silla with you.

406
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:35,842
I wanted to prevent deaths...

407
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:39,672
caused by the Bone-rank System.

408
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,442
I dreamed of becoming more than Silla...

409
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:46,472
and unifying the Three Kingdoms.

410
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,072
Can what you dream of...

411
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,442
come true?

412
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,842
It will not be easy.

413
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:02,302
But if I do not try and just breathe,

414
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:06,512
I will be living, but I will not be alive.

415
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,172
What if...

416
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:12,042
I eliminate those trying to kill you?

417
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,172
Can you change Silla?

418
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:22,472
Now, this throne is yours.

419
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:25,372
So change it as you dreamed.

420
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:28,488
Use every ounce of power you possess.

421
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,272
At least to avoid disappointing you,

422
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,672
I will take that path until the end.

423
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:35,041
I, King Jinheung of Silla,

424
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:38,742
along with Hwarang, will
put the people first...

425
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:42,372
and will lead a powerful
and prosperous Silla.

426
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,442
Then...

427
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:13,672
what type of king are you thinking of?

428
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:18,672
A country where people are happy...

429
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,802
while the king is in agony.

430
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:26,401
Where the people do not
worry about the country...

431
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,072
But the king worries about the people.

432
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:32,872
That is the king I am thinking of.

433
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,242
Those kids.

434
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,772
I guess...

435
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:55,172
I did catch something big.

436
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,302
I am sorry...

437
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:10,012
for not telling you sooner.

438
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:15,371
If that is your choice,

439
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:16,602
I respect it.

440
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,012
I am proud of you.

441
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,042
I am sure your mother would be happy...

442
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,572
to see you like this.

443
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:40,742
What?

444
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,702
You thief.

445
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:01,242
Be careful.

446
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:16,172
Get out quickly. Hurry.

447
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:30,741
Hail King Jinheung!

448
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,101
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

449
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:35,242
- Hail King Jinheung!
- Hail King Jinheung!

450
00:43:59,872 --> 00:44:01,002
You really...

451
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:04,642
got here on your own.

452
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:08,272
I am glad...

453
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:10,702
it was not too late.

454
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:13,242
I shall...

455
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:16,672
bear the burden of Silla...

456
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:19,372
from now on.

457
00:44:24,072 --> 00:44:25,172
Do you think...

458
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:29,072
I hated you?

459
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:38,442
Do you think...

460
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:43,002
I hated you, Mother?

461
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,142
I know...

462
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,572
that you...

463
00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:54,802
protected Silla and me.

464
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:59,172
I shall also protect Silla and my people...

465
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,872
in my own way, different from yours.

466
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:07,842
I shall...

467
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:13,502
make Silla powerful.

468
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:37,602
Your Highness.

469
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:39,802
Your Highness!

470
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:47,942
How is she?

471
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:58,542
She is practically a corpse.

472
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,302
I have...

473
00:46:22,342 --> 00:46:24,042
something to tell you.

474
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,542
Please stay with her.

475
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:51,302
Please.

476
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,572
I wish...

477
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:46,472
I could have died by your hands instead.

478
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,402
Why did you...

479
00:47:57,602 --> 00:48:01,072
tell me not to drink the tea?

480
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:10,842
Did you...

481
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:17,342
worry about me?

482
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:23,642
I tried to let go,

483
00:48:26,772 --> 00:48:28,672
but I could not.

484
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:34,002
No matter how hard I tried,

485
00:48:37,472 --> 00:48:38,572
I wanted...

486
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:44,942
to go to you.

487
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,002
I tried to hate you.

488
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:00,372
I tried to kill you.

489
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:05,302
However,

490
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:12,342
I could not.

491
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:16,602
I...

492
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:21,102
I am sorry.

493
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:23,072
Did it go well?

494
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:25,942
It did.

495
00:50:29,742 --> 00:50:32,902
His Majesty asked me to bring this to you.

496
00:50:47,272 --> 00:50:49,572
Did you resent me for
locking you up in here?

497
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:53,172
It was the only choice I had...

498
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:55,702
in order to protect you from
Master Park Young Shil.

499
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:01,942
I fear I will not be able
to let you go if I see you.

500
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:05,302
I fear I will get greedy again.

501
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:11,242
Go. Do not make him wait too long.

502
00:51:12,242 --> 00:51:13,842
Go to him.

503
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:01,272
Was I too late?

504
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:11,972
Now, I will never...

505
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,472
leave you alone.

506
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:17,802
I promise.

507
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:46,672
Let me tell you what this is.

508
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,372
It is volume two of the
collective information...

509
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:54,772
on all the young masters
within the capital.

510
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:01,472
So...

511
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:06,542
Briefing will cost an
additional piece of silver.

512
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:08,442
Do you want it?

513
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:09,902
Here.

514
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:14,502
I have paid my debt in full now.

515
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:21,141
You are the legendary woman
who captured the hearts...

516
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:22,872
of two Sacred Bones.

517
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:27,302
But your living situation has not changed.

518
00:53:27,502 --> 00:53:30,541
How should it change?

519
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,502
You know.

520
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:35,942
Silk, gold, and wealthy life.

521
00:53:36,102 --> 00:53:38,002
Things like that.

522
00:53:39,002 --> 00:53:40,142
Is that right?

523
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:45,872
Did you wait long? Let us go have fun.

524
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:48,372
Why do you keep taking my child?

525
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:50,942
If you are bored, date.

526
00:53:51,072 --> 00:53:53,142
You said you were single.

527
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:57,172
I need someone to date.
I cannot date myself!

528
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:00,572
He said he would not leave me alone.

529
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:04,202
What am I supposed to do?

530
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,872
My father is in his room.

531
00:54:15,472 --> 00:54:18,801
Rather than hiding it like
this, should we just...

532
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,971
After what happened to Master Young Shil,

533
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:23,072
you are like a kite with its string cut.

534
00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:26,371
Your family does not have status or wealth.

535
00:54:26,372 --> 00:54:28,342
It is only natural that he opposes.

536
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:30,442
I guess.

537
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:35,372
But you have my love.

538
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:52,601
Prince Chang...

539
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:53,941
I think he plans...

540
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:56,572
to make an alliance with
Daegaya to strike us.

541
00:55:00,442 --> 00:55:03,542
We see each other only if
there is a problem now.

542
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:08,471
If I remain here, people will talk about...

543
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,571
"the other Sacred Bone" and whatnot.

544
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,841
You know that.

545
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,241
If you were going to keep being so cool,

546
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:16,002
you should just become king.

547
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:21,471
This looks pretty nice.

548
00:55:21,472 --> 00:55:23,702
Why you Dog-Bird...

549
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:27,872
It has been six months since you left.

550
00:55:28,472 --> 00:55:29,972
Have you seen Ah Ro yet?

551
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:44,972
He should at least send news...

552
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:49,172
or give me some sort of assurance.

553
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:50,642
End it!

554
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,242
It is no loss on my part.

555
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:53,872
It is no loss.

556
00:55:57,942 --> 00:55:59,242
How have you been?

557
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:04,742
I am back.

558
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:09,471
Who are you? I do not know you.

559
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:11,002
I have a bad memory.

560
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:23,502
You could not have forgotten me.

561
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:33,772
You look pretty.

562
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:35,842
Totally.

563
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:49,502
Let us get married.

564
00:56:53,302 --> 00:56:55,542
I cannot handle it. I miss you too much.

565
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:22,142
I missed you.
