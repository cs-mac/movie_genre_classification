1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,536
The Great Sacrifice

2
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:07,947
Our member Albrecht Froben

3
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,353
returns from a voyage which has led him
from Hamburg across the Atlantic ocean,

4
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:21,504
across the old German colonies in Africa
to the Japanese islands.

5
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,615
and which we proudly call
a pioneer enterprise,

6
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:30,494
undertaken in the service of
the German Colonial Association.

7
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,146
The Hamburg section of
the German Colonial Association

8
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:37,302
is aware that to Froben,
the Hamburg senator's son,

9
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:42,959
in whose blood has been
the global traveler since generations....

10
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:47,811
we couldn't offer a more
appropriate token of our esteem

11
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,340
than the whole world.

12
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:53,262
This is where I went off the boat
for the first time, Portuguese Guinea,

13
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,927
the Sudan,
our old colonies Togo and Cameroon,

14
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,190
Belgian Congo, Somalia.

15
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,214
The suitcases have arrived,
shall I bring them in?

16
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,048
Yes, bring them in.

17
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:07,221
Open the big black one,
here, it's the biggest key.

18
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,109
Then on board again,
to Ceylon.

19
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:14,409
In Ceylon I stayed for four weeks,
because there's our main tea depot.

20
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,138
Then onward, passing Singapore,

21
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,608
the Philippines, Japan.

22
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,304
You've made the first stop
because of me, haven't you?

23
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,277
Not exactly, but I know
your passion for East Asia.

24
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:27,657
I've brought you something
that will interest you.

25
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:30,133
I quite liked the way
the gentlemen have honoured me today,

26
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:33,488
but after all it's no big deal
to undertake such a trip nowadays.

27
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,514
You've accomplished something,
and it has been no small matter.

28
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,986
After all you've renewed connections
which in the last years

29
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:40,617
had been cut off for Germany.

30
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:44,094
To conquer something back is more
difficult than to stay put on it.

31
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,473
A Japanese warrior,

32
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,433
of the Ashikaga Shogunate,
around 1500.

33
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:54,031
You see, I've been there,
but you know much more about it.

34
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,599
But now I'll show you something
that will interest you most.

35
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,460
A beautiful Buddha.

36
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,615
That's not a Buddha, it has
eleven heads. That's a Kwannon.

37
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,370
The eleven-faced Kwannon.

38
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,062
Or a Kwannon, what's the difference.

39
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,872
No, this is something special.

40
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,235
A special goddess.

41
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:14,973
The Buddhist goddess of mercy.

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,581
The eleven-faced.

43
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,107
According to the legend,

44
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,529
a princess who knew how to
defend her virtue against all attacks.

45
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,099
Then she'll suit you.

46
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,780
Allow me to give her
to you as a present.

47
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,859
Albrecht, you don't know
what a pleasure you give me.

48
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,405
I'm just writing a book about East Asia,

49
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:35,410
about the old Japanese beliefs
up to the cult of Shintoism.

50
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,475
This here isn't probably as interesting
for an art historian and scholar.

51
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,397
A kimono?
for whom?

52
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,318
I'll find someone.

53
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:44,949
Albrecht, Albrecht...

54
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,895
You're now a dignified
and famous man,

55
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,741
you can't afford such
affairs any longer.

56
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:50,002
Your position demands it.

57
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,624
(speaks with Hamburg dialect) Oops!
Don't step on your own tie!

58
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,143
The best thing in life is what
has been tested and proven good,

59
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,390
as old Hummel used to say.

60
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:59,582
And if you imagine that I shall refrain
from taking out a Hamburg girl

61
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,564
for a boating
on the Alster in the evening,

62
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:02,891
then you're wrong.

63
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,539
Say, isn't that Octavia?

64
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:10,418
By the way, you'll have to pay a visit
to the uncle, the senator.

65
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,924
How is he?

66
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,501
Still busy with his humanistic studies?

67
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,575
Still reading Horace and Virgil?

68
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,058
I can't imagine how one can give
one's daughter a Latin name nowadays.

69
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:22,995
Octavia.

70
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,320
What does she do?

71
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,386
She's what she has always been.

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,451
The most beautiful thing
the Alster has ever seen.

73
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,149
Where did you get the painting?

74
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:35,854
She gave it to me.

75
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:38,813
I say, it doesn't fit
into your Buddhist shop.

76
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,965
It will have to fit.

77
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:42,566
I see.

78
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,006
Is she already married?

79
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,211
No.

80
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,980
No one dares to, is that it?

81
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,635
Yes, you're right, that's it.

82
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:51,266
Look at this!

83
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,676
The eleven-faced Kwannon.

84
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,602
The princess who knows how to
defend her virtue against all attacks.

85
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:00,515
Well, you'll have to visit
their house on the Elbe anyway,

86
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,817
even though she has a Latin name.

87
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,243
Is the family away on a voyage?

88
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:09,402
No.

89
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,430
Because the blinds are down.

90
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,534
The family doesn't like
glaring sunlight.

91
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,723
But the senator and
the lady of the house have gone out.

92
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,773
Please give my card to the senator
when he comes back.

93
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:22,365
Shall I announce you
to the young lady?

94
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,225
Miss Octavia is playing the piano?

95
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, please do.

96
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,952
One of these hours will be your last.

97
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,615
Octavia!

98
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:44,954
A return after three years
of wandering around?

99
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:47,348
I didn't really think
of returning, Octavia.

100
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,925
It's more like a very short visit.

101
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,100
- Is that a difference, Albrecht?
- Yes, it is.

102
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,679
"Returning", that sounds
as if someone expected you.

103
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,905
Really?

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,304
Would you like to come up?

105
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,498
Very pretty.

106
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,409
Much more pleasant than
down there in that old hall.

107
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,520
Here one may enjoy life.

108
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,145
Beautiful.

109
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,993
Very beautiful.

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,860
That clock is also nicer
than the one downstairs.

111
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,973
It doesn't remind one
of one's own mortality.

112
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,818
The good old clock.

113
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,610
It goes all the way back
to grandfather.

114
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,941
And great-grandfather probably.

115
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,563
I don't know,
I don't even notice it anymore.

116
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,434
Yes, what one has always seen in one's
childhood, what one grew up with...

117
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,450
that you don't see anymore.

118
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:43,467
But once you've been away for a while,
then you see it again,

119
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,389
and with new eyes.

120
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,042
Does world-travel
make one so pensive?

121
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:51,358
No, but one gets to see things
from a distance, Octavia.

122
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,630
Alster boat race.

123
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,864
My consolation prize from last year.

124
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,877
Matthias couldn't do better than that

125
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:01,064
He's more of a scholar
than a sportsman.

126
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,604
He doesn't risk enough perhaps?

127
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,331
Perhaps the dinghy isn't agile enough.

128
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,503
Constructed in a far too solid way,
is that it?

129
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,128
Old Hamburg.

130
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,463
I've come back to a
completely different kind of life.

131
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,948
I haven't had breakfast.
Will you have a coffee with me?

132
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,534
With pleasure.

133
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,697
Shall I fetch an armchair?

134
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,987
No thanks. I always sit on the floor.

135
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:21,512
You've played the piano just now.

136
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:23,776
That's my great passion.

137
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:25,148
It's my life.

138
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,969
On Sundays, we all sit together
down there, we're playing in a quartet.

139
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,624
The old Sanitätsrat Terboven
plays the first violin,

140
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,765
Matthias the viola, and when papa
has the time, he plays the cello.

141
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,519
- Milk?
- No, black.

142
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,797
I don't have the patience anymore
to listen to a quartet.

143
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,489
That has never been your style.
You need the wind and the waves,

144
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,867
the glare and the lust of the sun...
- Yes.

145
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,343
The wind and the waves,

146
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,401
the glare and the lust of the sun.

147
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,683
No arm's length

148
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,760
must be between us anymore.

149
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,962
One of these hours will be your last

150
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:18,223
You see Albrecht, this is how
we're sitting here every Sunday morning.

151
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:23,350
It's so to speak our spiritual
hors d'oeuvre before the Sunday roast.

152
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,543
We've another hour till dinner.
Read us something, papa.

153
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,434
What do you want to hear?

154
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,389
Perhaps a Dionysus Dithyramb
by Nietzsche?

155
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,135
A what?

156
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,360
A Dionysus Dithyramb.

157
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,915
I see.

158
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,821
Albrecht doesn't know that.

159
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,352
Let's listen to it.

160
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,761
The most beautiful one:
"The sun sinks".

161
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,848
That's Nietzsche's
premonition of death,

162
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,501
one of the most profound
poems ever written.

163
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,345
The sun sinks

164
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:59,869
Not much longer will you thirst,
Burned heart!

165
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:02,690
A promise is in the air,

166
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:07,571
Blowing to me from unknown mouths  —

167
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,978
A great coolness comes...

168
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,472
The air passes by strange and pure.

169
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:20,885
Doesn’t the night cast a furtive
Seductive glance towards me?

170
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,803
Remain strong, my brave heart!

171
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:28,535
Do not ask: why? —

172
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,341
Serenity, golden, come!

173
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,670
You doomed, more secret,
sweeter anticipation of pleasure! —

174
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,311
Did I run too quickly along my path?

175
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:52,430
Just now, when my foot becomes weary,
Your glance catches up with me,

176
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:58,823
Your happiness catches up with me.

177
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,723
Seventh solitude!

178
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:07,922
I've never felt
Closer to sweet security,

179
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,745
In the warmest glance of the sun. —

180
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:18,700
Isn’t the ice of my summits
still glowing?

181
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:26,180
Silvery, light, a fish

182
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:32,321
My bark now glides away ...

183
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,685
Very beautiful.

184
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,147
Yes, very beautiful.

185
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:44,057
But I think it's terrible.

186
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,597
What is terrible, the poem?

187
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,930
Nothing against your
recitation, papa, but...

188
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,446
What is it you don't like, Albrecht?

189
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,865
Don't smile in such a
patronizing way, Matthias.

190
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,871
Apparently you think I'm too stupid
to understand the poem.

191
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,281
Albrecht, why are you so irritable?

192
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,187
Don't you want to tell us, Albrecht,

193
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:12,916
why you find Nietzsche
disgusting all of a sudden?

194
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,053
Go on, I'm ready to listen to reason.

195
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,752
It's been a misunderstanding,
you must excuse me.

196
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,421
I had no intention to
teach you reason, papa.

197
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,952
But why do you
think it terrible, Albrecht?

198
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,102
This is why.

199
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,180
But my boy, open the other blinds too
if you don't like to sit in the dark.

200
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,868
The blinds have
nothing to do with Nietzsche.

201
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,713
But they have!

202
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,527
Unfortunately they have.

203
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:44,177
Can someone tell me why you're sitting
here every Sunday feeling gloomy?

204
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:46,495
Nothing against the poem.

205
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,941
But you lower the blinds and say:
"The sun is sinking."

206
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,313
Albrecht, please!

207
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,113
And outside the sun is shining.

208
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,629
Matthias, don't interrupt me for once.

209
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:58,511
You've asked me
what I think is terrible.

210
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,737
Here you are,
just look outside!

211
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:05,117
We've been sitting here for three hours,
talking about philosophical matters,

212
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,441
playing nocturnes,

213
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:10,637
night pieces by Chopin,

214
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,976
reading the thoughts of a genius
written shortly before he went mad.

215
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,370
Is that how a Sunday morning
is supposed to be?

216
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,415
It wasn't only the death premonition,

217
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:25,650
It was the approaching madness
he felt before his sun sank.

218
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:29,027
Night night night,
nothing but night.

219
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:31,460
and death.

220
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,630
And outside the sun is shining.

221
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:36,616
Say,

222
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,329
don't you think it spooky?

223
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:44,873
Don't be angry,
but that's beyond me.

224
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,490
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,673
Poor Octavia.

226
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:05,275
I'm a tough case.

227
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:08,377
You won't have it easy with me.

228
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,304
But later we can arrange our life
just like we want to,

229
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,003
or like you want to, but...

230
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,732
There's still another hour till dinner.

231
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,940
Let's run away.

232
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:24,151
You may, no one will be angry at you.

233
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,332
But I have to stay here,
we have guests.

234
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:29,763
Look around, row out with the boat,
stretch out on the planks.

235
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,493
There you have your wind and your waves,

236
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,109
and your glare of the sun.

237
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,507
Very well.

238
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:34,654
Ro vidare!

239
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,209
Go on!

240
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,632
Faster!

241
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:52,966
Jag ber dig hjärtligt, var god och va' förnäm,
och titta inte för noga på mig!

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,451
I beg your pardon?

243
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,115
If you stop rowing, my dress of waves
will become too transparent,

244
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:01,899
and I shall have to leave you.

245
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,337
Also, the water caresses me better
if you row faster.

246
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,265
Min vänlige släpare!

247
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,857
Just cling to the boat.

248
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,693
I'm not the least bit curious
to resolve this magic.

249
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,212
We're very far out now.

250
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,091
If you aren't a mermaid with a fish's tail,
it'll soon become dangerous.

251
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,348
Can you swim out that far at all?

252
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,254
I'll turn back now,

253
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,275
and you won't follow me.

254
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:39,222
just like you wouldn't follow
a real mermaid.

255
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:49,998
Tack så mycket.

256
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,450
She lives over there in the next house

257
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,829
Äls? But that' s not a name?

258
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:03,534
Älskling. Actually it's Älskling,
but everyone calls her Äls.

259
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:04,809
Is she Swedish?

260
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,782
I believe she's from Finland,
but I'm not sure.

261
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:09,749
Anyway, she's from the north.

262
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,890
Her step-father gave her the house
before he died,

263
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,591
but she lives rarely here.

264
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,863
She like a migrating bird,

265
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:20,248
comes along, settles,
and is off again the next day.

266
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:23,026
She spends a few months every year
in her homeland,

267
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,786
the land of a thousand lakes,
that's what you call it I guess.

268
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,151
And in the winter
she's somewhere in the south,

269
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,323
in the autumn in Africa,
or somewhere like that.

270
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:34,708
She has indeed a very...
how shall I put it...

271
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,775
a very unconventional way of living.

272
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,456
You know how people talk.
I don't know the details.

273
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:44,298
Äls... sounds charming after all.

274
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,845
And it suits her.

275
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,799
And it suits the mermaid
who appeared in your backwash.

276
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,452
I have no use for her.

277
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,343
I never had.

278
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:57,385
A pity, really.

279
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,309
I think she's a nice person.

280
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,383
Are you on friendly terms
with your neighbors?

281
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,021
Good heavens! First,
she lives there all alone, and then...

282
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,942
You know how we are around here...

283
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,669
Even if someone lives next door,
we don't know each other.

284
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,002
Here every house is a world in itself.

285
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,001
It has always been like that,
and will stay that way forever.

286
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,315
Good morning!

287
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:21,642
Good morning!

288
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,661
I still owe you thanks
for your pulling-service.

289
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,765
Don't mention it.

290
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,424
Or do you demand payment?

291
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,434
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather accept payment.

292
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,154
What kind of payment would you like?

293
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,305
For instance...

294
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,089
going out for a ride with you.

295
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,297
My greatest wish would be to
take part in the derby myself.

296
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:13,264
Thank God that's still men's business.

297
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,360
But it would certainly be beautiful.

298
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,149
I'd place a bet on you immediately,
victory and place.

299
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:19,727
Place?
That's not very gallant.

300
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,580
If you bet,
then it'll have to be victory only.

301
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:26,589
Earth's paradise lies on horseback.

302
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,700
You're saying this?

303
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:30,667
I thought sailing was your passion.

304
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,420
But there you depend
on the wind, Miss...

305
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,699
Well, 'mermaid'.

306
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,452
How may I call you, then?

307
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,443
Just call me Äls,
like everybody else does.

308
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:43,294
The name is a dear memory to me.

309
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:44,972
My mother gave it to me.

310
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,329
Äls...

311
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:48,890
May I accompany you on your rides?

312
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,080
Äls?

313
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,630
Of course, only
until you tire of me.

314
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,954
With that concession, I'll agree.

315
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:05,451
Well, goodbye.
Tomorrow at six.

316
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,241
But I'll have to be back at seven,
then my day begins.

317
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,864
Get back in there, you tramps!

318
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:12,141
Heisann.

319
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,879
Good morning.

320
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,279
You've been waiting for me?

321
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:31,094
You don't say!

322
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:38,061
Let me check first what your pulse has
to say about that gallop ride.

323
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,652
Don't look so serious, Sanitätsrat.
I feel splendid.

324
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,016
The pulse says no.

325
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:45,785
Very clearly no.

326
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:50,687
But I have forbidden you to swim,
to ride, to run around.

327
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:52,897
Let's sit down.

328
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,270
Why don't you listen to me?

329
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:58,468
My collegue Wildbrand made
an analysis of your blood.

330
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:01,243
I must confess it doesn't look good.

331
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,851
You are not as splendid
as you say you are.

332
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,467
Leave that.

333
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,459
I believe the doctors always want
to make you a bit more ill,

334
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:10,026
that's how they make their money.

335
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,768
Don't be angry, Sanitätsrat.

336
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,634
I tend to keep my worries
a secret from my patients.

337
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,730
because they have to feel healthy first
in order to get well.

338
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:20,504
But with you I mustn't act like this,
Miss Flodéen,

339
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:22,915
because you're unreasonable.

340
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,030
I know what's the matter
with me, Sanitätsrat.

341
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,535
I think I know it even
better than yourself.

342
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,548
Really? What do you know then?

343
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,567
How long do I still have
to live, Sanitätsrat?

344
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,533
I wasn't prepared for
such a direct question,

345
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:42,253
but no one could
seriously answer that.

346
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:45,373
Anyway, I believe...

347
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,538
that if you're reasonable...

348
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:49,642
What if I'm unreasonable?

349
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:52,738
Well, if you're unreasonable...

350
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:55,793
Do you want to be unreasonable?

351
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:57,684
I want to live.

352
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:59,575
I don't want to pine away,

353
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:03,356
I don't want to think all the time
whether I may do this or not.

354
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,264
I'd rather live a shorter time.

355
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,503
What does it matter if one
dies at 25 or at 26?

356
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,886
But I want to get something
out of those 25 years!

357
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:17,287
I've seen it for years with my mother,

358
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:21,297
taking one medicine after another,
always sparing herself.

359
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:22,928
That was her life,

360
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,183
leaving one sanatorium for the next,

361
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,302
artificially prolonging her life,

362
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,291
and all she got out of it
was a prolonged suffering.

363
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,816
A prolonged torture.

364
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,722
What is that torture
you want to prolong?

365
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,719
Are you in pain?

366
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:38,336
I am not, that's the point.

367
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,653
And that's why I'm such a bad patient.

368
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:44,907
You see, nature arranged this
very wisely, pains and all.

369
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,743
Pains protect us from decay,
pains can be the elixir of life.

370
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,945
You don't have that
natural protection, Miss Flodéen,

371
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,231
and you completely forget that fate

372
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,716
has already given you
a clear sign once before.

373
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:01,687
Do you know my silver
Danish mastiff Peer?

374
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,371
You have so many dogs, how can I...

375
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,765
But I have only one Peer.

376
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:08,717
I liked him best of all.

377
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,115
But when he got ill
and couldn't enjoy his life any more,

378
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,113
I myself killed him.

379
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,391
My gardener couldn't
bring himself to do it,

380
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,441
and I didn't want to
take him to the veterinary.

381
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,319
He was to be with me.

382
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,180
I was more merciful.

383
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:27,412
Excuse me, Miss Flodéen,
this is not a conversation for a doctor.

384
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,004
It's my profession to heal people,

385
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,383
and to keep them alive
as long as possible.

386
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,259
And that's why I am telling you:
quit riding.

387
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:40,153
You know it, first you perspire, then
cool off, then you catch another cold.

388
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:43,476
And you cannot afford such a cold.

389
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,968
Be merciful with yourself.

390
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:59,093
Älskling.

391
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:01,029
Mama's crying.

392
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,026
It's too much for you, Älskling.

393
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,628
In the end, the child
won't sleep again.

394
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,275
Come to me.

395
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:29,106
Älskling.

396
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:33,055
Älskling,
you're an unreasonable person.

397
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,611
That's what the doctor has told me
too just now, Gitta.

398
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,377
Do you imagine it's as easy for me
as it is for you to be reasonable?

399
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,847
I live under a different law.

400
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:47,003
Just like your mother.

401
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:50,185
Yes, that's how it'll have to be.

402
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,124
But I've always hoped to have
my child with me one day, and...

403
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,957
and that it wouldn't have to grow up
among strangers, like I had to.

404
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:58,863
Strangers?

405
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,248
Gitta, don't be angry with me.

406
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,242
You've been my nurse,

407
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,849
and I've believed for a long time
that you were my mother,

408
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:10,670
and you've always been
like a mother to me.

409
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:13,537
Now you're a mother for Susanne.

410
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,909
So you see.

411
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,787
Only, I often think...

412
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,471
I have my beautiful garden,

413
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,285
my beautiful house.

414
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:25,921
Why can't my child live with me?

415
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,568
With an ill mother?

416
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,792
We've gone through all this before,
and decided not to try that again.

417
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:35,100
- The child will suffer most from it.
- Yes.

418
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,006
It wouldn't make sense anyway.

419
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:39,476
You're hardly here,
you lock up the house again,

420
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,678
move south, or north,
and then it'll have to leave anyway.

421
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,995
Or do you want to take it
with you everywhere?

422
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:46,811
That's not suitable for a child.

423
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,869
There must be order in its life.

424
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,727
Älskling, let's not talk about
those old things anymore.

425
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,709
You know it's impossible.

426
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,603
Susanne doesn't lack anything, Älskling.

427
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,655
As long as I live,
she won't lack anything.

428
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,130
And you won't get talked about.
That would be unnecessary.

429
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,546
I don't care about that,

430
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,970
But it's nobody's business.
It doesn't have to be.

431
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,735
Then it's best that way, I guess.

432
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:20,190
But when I'm well again,
we'll build a house by the sea.

433
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:23,464
Next to the beach, so that
we'll see the sea all the time,

434
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,873
then I'll buy a pony
for Susanne, and...

435
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:32,704
A pony? Are you mad? A wild animal?
That's just like you.

436
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,276
and I'll have to be afraid again,
like in old times,

437
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:38,250
when little Älskling
started to gallop off, no.

438
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,580
You see, you'll cry and shout
and we won't listen to you again.

439
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,828
Does it always have to be like that?

440
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,030
Yes, it always has to be like that.

441
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:52,225
It's always like that...

442
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,384
That you have to fear
losing what you hold most dear.

443
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:13,367
- A mulled wine?
- That would be best.

444
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,295
- One mulled wine!
- Two, you mean.

445
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:18,140
Of course, two.

446
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,068
Two mulled wine!

447
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,748
A small adventure makes
life more interesting.

448
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,721
Wipe your face and your hands.

449
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,146
Water doesn't harm a mermaid.

450
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,317
I hoped to meet you yesterday
when I was rowing.

451
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:34,187
I searched the whole Elbe.

452
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,642
The mermaid is no longer.

453
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,072
Once you know the mermaid's name,
the magic is gone.

454
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,673
But if her name's Äls...

455
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,314
Äls isn't a name.

456
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:45,931
Nice and warm.

457
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:47,273
You see, you're cold.

458
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,526
I'm not, but still:

459
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,226
Härligt varm.

460
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,505
Will you be staying longer
in Hamburg this time?

461
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,695
Why?

462
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,843
Miss Froben told me that you're
only passing through here.

463
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:01,303
No, this time I'll stay longer.

464
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:06,232
I'm treated by a specialist.
You know him, Sanitätsrat Terboven.

465
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:08,565
I would have thought you
a model of health.

466
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,335
You see how one can be wrong,

467
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,211
But I'm healthy all right.

468
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,451
Only a remnant from the tropics
is bothering me now and then.

469
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,937
What business do you
have in the tropics?

470
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,962
Haven't you been told yet
that I'm a migrating bird?

471
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,665
I've already heard that
you were a migrating bird.

472
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:40,758
Bravo!

473
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,625
That was great, Äls!

474
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:48,659
Shooting from a standing position
is not difficult, Miss Froben,

475
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:51,861
but from a galloping horse,
that's different.

476
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,020
Bravo!

477
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:04,643
I'll be back!

478
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,365
Bravo!

479
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:25,323
Yeah!

480
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,547
Äls!

481
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:43,928
Not too far into the water!

482
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,062
It gets deep suddenly!

483
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:48,755
Äls!

484
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:53,147
Do you imagine my horse cannot swim?

485
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:59,447
Don't be so reckless!
Otherwise I'll have to follow you!

486
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,732
Out here there are no waves!

487
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,675
Go, Grållen!

488
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,075
You were splendid, Äls.

489
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,058
But you're reckless all the same.

490
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,455
- Why?
- The horse will shy at the surf.

491
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,016
What if it had
thrown you in the water?

492
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,365
You could easily have
gotten under its hoofs.

493
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:16,112
That's no big deal.

494
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:17,728
No big deal?

495
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,052
The horse might kill you with its hoofs
if it gets nervous.

496
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,775
Then I'll be dead,
what of it if, Herr Froben?

497
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,559
It's going to happen one day anyway.

498
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,035
I say, how can you talk of death
like this at your age?

499
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:32,198
What has age got to do with it?

500
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,574
One is always close to death,

501
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:38,385
and it's a good thing
if you smile at him from time to time,

502
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:43,463
and tell him: "You're my friend, you'll
come when I can't go on any further."

503
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:46,815
What are you saying?

504
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:51,039
I think you still have some time left
before he takes you in his cold arms.

505
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,189
Perhaps...

506
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,909
and perhaps not, one never knows.

507
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,928
You see the rainbow?

508
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,480
The bridge spanning to the beyond.

509
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:08,107
Who knows how soon
we'll have to cross over.

510
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,450
This is my favorite spot,
here at the lighthouse.

511
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,051
Today it's beautiful here,

512
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:20,710
but in autumn, when the migrating birds
arrive from my homeland.

513
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:22,823
then it's sad here.

514
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,591
But why?

515
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,537
Then they fly against the lighthouse
because they think it's the sun,

516
00:34:30,922 --> 00:34:33,636
and in the morning they lie
on the ground with their skulls smashed.

517
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:35,802
Sometimes whole flocks.

518
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:38,980
A sad picture.

519
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:40,672
Terrible.

520
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:44,195
But Äls,

521
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,802
you're so full of life and happiness.

522
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,846
It doesn't suit you
to think about death,

523
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,514
with the wind and the waves
and the blazing sun around.

524
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,625
You think so?

525
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:57,126
What am I supposed to think about?

526
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:58,474
You?

527
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,143
Yes, I only think about him.

528
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,300
Only about Albrecht Froben.

529
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,879
You're the only one
who knows about it, Grållen.

530
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:15,466
But you won't tell anybody.

531
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:22,486
You carried me with your soft
and light trot, as you always do,

532
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:26,348
and I must have said it
aloud very often:

533
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:29,749
"Albrecht Froben, Albrecht Froben".

534
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,975
I didn't mean it.

535
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,212
Only when I saw you
prick up your ears listening,

536
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:38,947
then I too heard myself saying it:
"Albrecht Froben, Albrecht Froben".

537
00:35:39,283 --> 00:35:40,625
I didn't want it.

538
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,088
We galloped,

539
00:35:42,363 --> 00:35:44,590
I wanted to cover it all
with the sound of your hoofs,

540
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:48,555
but it got wilder and wilder,
as the two of us got wilder.

541
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:53,754
Ah, Grållen, it's good
that you're here,

542
00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:01,033
so that I can tell at least one person
how often I think about him.

543
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:05,910
And it's so hard to keep silent,

544
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:08,619
especially if you're a woman.

545
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,484
You're thinking about the other woman,

546
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,063
not about Octavia,
only about the other one.

547
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:16,770
What makes you think so?

548
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,554
I can tell by your face.

549
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,430
Do you know my face that well?

550
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:21,955
I hope I do.

551
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:23,885
That is, at the moment I'm afraid I do.

552
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,663
Albrecht, I have
to tell you something.

553
00:36:29,364 --> 00:36:30,691
I think it's...

554
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:32,521
I think it's...

555
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,235
impossible.

556
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,552
It's hard to find the right words.

557
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:41,074
Perhaps I can give you an example
for what I have in mind.

558
00:36:41,974 --> 00:36:46,945
One can pack a Kwannon
or a silk kimono into a suitcase,

559
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:48,738
but not into a life.

560
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:50,904
You've put that splendidly.

561
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:52,398
Kwannon and kimono!

562
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:53,679
You're a poet!

563
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,234
But you don't know Äls at all.

564
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,414
Be so good as to stop using
that endearing name.

565
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:59,077
That's ridiculous,
everybody calls her like that.

566
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,090
Her name is Miss Flodéen.

567
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,575
After all she is a registered resident,
not a mythical creature.

568
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,198
But even Octavia calls her like that.

569
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:09,293
And you object that I call her by a name
which all the world uses.

570
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:11,992
And I think it's incredible that you
compare her and Octavia

571
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:13,883
in such a ridiculous manner.

572
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,423
Kwannon and kimono!

573
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:18,232
One cannot compare the two,
one wouldn't do justice to either of them.

574
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,894
Octavia is just heavenly,
and Äls is...

575
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:21,099
Earthly, isn't she?

576
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:22,526
Yes, earthly, if you want.

577
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:24,249
You don't seem to be
very proud of your abode.

578
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,756
We know very well that
we're closer to earth than to heaven.

579
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:27,908
We're made out of earth.

580
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:29,783
You don't have to give up heaven
just because you love the earth.

581
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:33,035
One doesn't have to,
but one does occasionally.

582
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,307
Even if you find me ridiculous again:

583
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:39,058
It means something that you faithlessly
gave up your passion for sailing,

584
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:40,903
excuse the word faithlessly,

585
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,550
and that you've suddenly
become a passionate horseman.

586
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:46,271
You ought to start working again,
you've had a long enough holiday.

587
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:47,827
It only gives you silly ideas.

588
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,013
Say, Matthias...

589
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,909
Do you doubt my love for Octavia?

590
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,805
I don't want that,
for Octavia's sake I don't want that.

591
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,703
That's why I tell you as a friend:
don't place yourself in danger.

592
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:01,975
Even if you don't die doing so.

593
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,481
Think of Octavia.

594
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,066
Does your cousin know
that you're here?

595
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:11,841
No, nor does my cousin Octavia.

596
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,424
So it's just you
who are worried, Herr Froben?

597
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:16,720
Yes.

598
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,496
Fortunately, Octavia doesn't seem
to know about that trouble yet.

599
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,760
You speak of such things...

600
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,551
I would be ashamed
to call them by name.

601
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:29,210
Don't you now that it's very dangerous
to interfere with fate?

602
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:31,678
You've said something aloud

603
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:35,429
which was carefully left unspoken
between Herr Froben and myself.

604
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:39,310
One shouldn't speak of everything.
It might have evil consequences.

605
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:42,855
At least I thought it my duty
to talk with you about it.

606
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:46,141
But I didn't hope, Miss Flodéen,
that we would understand each other.

607
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,061
Of course, you cannot share
my feelings for the Froben family.

608
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:51,988
Why have you turned to me
and not to your cousin Albrecht?

609
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:53,181
I already did so.

610
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:54,462
And?

611
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:56,764
I don't think I have achieved
anything by it.

612
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,310
And you thought you'd achieve more with me?

613
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,665
You're wrong, Herr Froben.

614
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:06,044
If it were like you suppose it to be,

615
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,353
especially then you should beware
of interfering with such feelings.

616
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,744
You should know that I would
fight for my happiness.

617
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:18,184
So it's war. Very well.

618
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:20,953
It all depends on who is the
strongest, Miss Flodéen.

619
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,408
And you must know that
Albrecht loves Octavia,

620
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,175
and she'll be his wife.

621
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,046
The couple will move away from here,

622
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,318
and I hope the distance
will cause you

623
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,498
to separate from
Albrecht emotionally, too.

624
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,459
All of a sudden he
immersed himself in his work

625
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:39,685
He didn't even want to go
on a honeymoon.

626
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,393
He cancelled everything.

627
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:44,260
We couldn't move to
Düsseldorf fast enough.

628
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,577
Are you comfortable
in the hotel, Octavia?

629
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,859
I don't think
we'll stay long in this town.

630
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,963
Then Albrecht isn't
looking for a flat?

631
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,564
He sends me out to look for one,

632
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,440
and I've had a look at lots of flats,

633
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,203
but when I think of our
house on the Elbe,

634
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:59,124
then I can't make up my mind.

635
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,778
That doesn't sound very happy, Octavia.

636
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,396
I am as happy as Albrecht is.

637
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,162
And is Albrecht happy?

638
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:09,717
Good gracious, he has his work,

639
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,020
and many social engagements.

640
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,405
He has so many obligations.

641
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:17,316
I could go to a party
or a ball every night.

642
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,158
But you know me.

643
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,108
One cannot overcome one's inhibitions.

644
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,701
That's it I guess.

645
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,071
But I accompany him,
you'll see tonight.

646
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,114
I'm even looking forward to it.

647
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:34,088
"The slide",
that's what the ball is called.

648
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,012
I've even got a mask.

649
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:37,933
They won't recognize me.

650
00:40:38,147 --> 00:40:39,122
A mask?

651
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,059
Octavia with a mask?

652
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:44,699
We do this quite often.
We arrive at different times,

653
00:40:44,928 --> 00:40:46,434
noone knows what the other wears.

654
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,476
and we have to look for
each other on the ball.

655
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,710
But I'll show my mask to you.

656
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,942
Albrecht won't mind
if you stay at my side.

657
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,802
I felt a bit uncomfortable anyway
to go there all alone.

658
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:08,562
Octavia's mask?

659
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,993
Yes.

660
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,381
Are you terribly shocked?

661
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,378
No, on the contrary.

662
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,173
I think it's wonderful that you join in.

663
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,840
Octavia's mask.

664
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,879
But Octavia, you won't
find him this way.

665
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,922
You've the whole evening before you.

666
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,614
Do you think I might take off
that disgusting thing?

667
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,382
Just keep it on.

668
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,516
I think such a mask is a good thing.

669
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,529
That way you can remain
incognito for a while.

670
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:05,850
A glass of champagne, please.

671
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,516
I feel that you think of me.

672
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,419
In the night the souls are closer to
each other than during the day.

673
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:35,003
Or is it just my longing
which lies to me?

674
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:38,447
I wanted to fight for you,

675
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,450
but I mustn't take you
away from Octavia.

676
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,942
I know how much happiness
I would take away from her.

677
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:49,026
I hope that I'll have the power
to conceal from you always

678
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:51,664
how infinitely I love you.

679
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,085
But I may tell you in my diary.

680
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,241
Each of its pages
shall speak of this love,

681
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:03,456
because this love alone fills my days.

682
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,495
Good night,

683
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:13,285
my beloved.

684
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:26,545
You cannot recognize him behind
the mask and the domino,

685
00:44:27,216 --> 00:44:29,695
but you can recognize
his company, can't you?

686
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:31,159
Come.

687
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,636
Tell me, beautiful mask,
are you looking for something special?

688
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:37,756
Sure, whether you wear a wedding ring,
or whether you're still free.

689
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,333
Masks will be taken off
only at midnight!

690
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:42,269
What a pity!

691
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,519
Octavia!

692
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,871
Octavia.

693
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,655
You're wrong, sir.

694
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,872
Have a drink, Octavia.

695
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,518
Are you that sure?

696
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:00,668
I would recognize you
among thousands, Octavia.

697
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:03,748
A bit more distance, sir.

698
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:06,592
Matthias!

699
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,946
Play-acting isn't your
strong point, Octavia.

700
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,514
But whoever you may be,
go down the slide with me just once!

701
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:14,816
All of life is a slide anyway!
Come along!

702
00:45:37,103 --> 00:45:38,673
Ladies, please!

703
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:44,600
Albrecht!

704
00:45:44,997 --> 00:45:46,933
I'm surely allowed
to kiss my own wife?

705
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,144
But nobody here
knows that I'm your wife!

706
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:52,178
Neither do I see that you've blushed
behind your mask, Octavia.

707
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:04,325
Once a year, at carnival,

708
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:09,629
we put off all seriousness,
all dignity, and whatever else,

709
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,480
and slip into fools' costumes.

710
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:17,110
The delicious juice of our native vine
shall wake up the holy ghosts of life,

711
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:20,285
our native vine
which has been growing for centuries

712
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:22,908
on the sunny shores of the Rhine!

713
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:28,106
Here innumerable feasts have been
celebrated in homage to beauty,

714
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:32,985
and now let's pay our own
tribute to beauty's triumph.

715
00:46:33,183 --> 00:46:36,634
For the most beautiful of our masks
we have the most beautiful thing

716
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:40,369
which grows on the beautiful shores
of our beautiful Rhine.

717
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:44,947
A cask of old Rüdesheim wine!

718
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:53,570
I'll raise a toast with the first glass
of this delicious drink

719
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:55,567
to the most beautiful mask

720
00:46:55,765 --> 00:47:00,080
to whom the jury has unanimously
awarded the first prize today.

721
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:04,909
The golden mask in the white dress!

722
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:15,149
Octavia!

723
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:19,100
A now His Foolish Highness,
Prince Carnival,

724
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,111
will lift the most beautiful mask
up onto his throne!

725
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:25,932
There he arrives
in his foolish splendour,

726
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:28,449
descending to us,
the dust-born!

727
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:32,688
That is the signal:
the mask is dropped!

728
00:47:34,543 --> 00:47:36,433
Carnival has begun!

729
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,337
Where is she?

730
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:42,320
She's already in the car,
driving home.

731
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:58,367
But how will it look, Matthias,
I have a position here.

732
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:00,272
It's embarassing,
with all those people around.

733
00:48:00,455 --> 00:48:03,041
Why? No one has recognized her.
That's what the masks are for.

734
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,444
Well, I guess you're right.

735
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:08,085
Say Albrecht, don't you ask
too much of her?

736
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:10,600
You must admit she
has been splendid tonight,

737
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:13,207
participating in everything,
even going down the slide with you.

738
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:16,165
Yes, and she screamed like mad.

739
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,209
You cannot ask more of her.

740
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:19,718
But don't overdo it!

741
00:48:50,906 --> 00:48:51,820
Octavia!

742
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:53,117
Yes?

743
00:48:53,406 --> 00:48:54,702
You're already in bed?

744
00:48:55,377 --> 00:48:56,734
Matthias has come with me.

745
00:48:57,192 --> 00:48:59,189
But you were to stay there.

746
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,785
You see, I didn't want that at all.

747
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,357
I didn't want to spoil your fun.

748
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,240
But you haven't spoiled it.

749
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:15,062
Octavia...

750
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:19,194
Let's finish celebrating
our carnival in here.

751
00:49:19,484 --> 00:49:20,799
I've ordered champagne.

752
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:22,980
You don't mind, do you?

753
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,861
I was afraid you were angry with me.

754
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:29,445
You're so sweet to me.

755
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:40,108
Now go to Matthias.

756
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:42,366
I'll be with you soon.

757
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:43,754
Fine.

758
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:47,489
Well, will she get up again?

759
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:51,551
I have a bad conscience, Matthias.

760
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,137
Couldn't do you any harm.

761
00:49:57,147 --> 00:49:58,660
I ought to apologize to you

762
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,122
because I've spoiled your evening
with my lack of humour.

763
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:03,920
But you haven't, Octavia.

764
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:07,580
Octavia, I have to tell you something.

765
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:11,744
- You...
- I don't deserve this.

766
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:14,001
I don't want to play down my faults,

767
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,029
but I was really angry
when you ran away.

768
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:18,166
But Matthias gave me
a good talking-to.

769
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:20,377
He told me that
I was very egoistical.

770
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:21,706
I didn't say that!

771
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:24,158
Perhaps you didn't use the word,
but I can read between the lines.

772
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:25,577
Anyway, you were right.

773
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:26,751
Cheers.

774
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:29,660
I wonder what will be
the outcome of this?

775
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:34,285
The outcome is perfectly clear.

776
00:50:35,086 --> 00:50:38,059
We'll pack and return to
Hamburg with Matthias.

777
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:40,024
There's nothing which holds us here.

778
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,985
Octavia, I didn't
advise him to do that.

779
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,361
Don't hurry things,
you're always so terribly volatile.

780
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:48,370
Very well, then in the spring,
but we'll leave as soon as possible.

781
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:51,915
Over-seas interests me much more
than inland navigation.

782
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:54,513
Besides, your father offered us
the house for the spring,

783
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,099
they'll be leaving for the manor.

784
00:50:56,358 --> 00:50:57,822
Think of it, Octavia!

785
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,650
The house by the Elbe!

786
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,893
But Octavia, you mustn't cry.

787
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,910
I am so happy, Albrecht.

788
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:11,820
We'll return home.

789
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,995
I didn't know that she
was still in Hamburg.

790
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:23,420
She told me at the time
that she was going away.

791
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:28,195
I don't remember either that she
ever stayed in Hamburg for the winter.

792
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:31,381
But Sanitätsrat Terboven says
her illness is persistent,

793
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:32,723
perhaps that's the reason.

794
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,367
Yes, it has to be her old complaint,
a remnant of a tropical disease.

795
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:37,970
How do you know?

796
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,915
She told me.

797
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,315
Strange that she would talk about it,
since she is so secretive otherwise.

798
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:48,043
This morning I've sent her our most
beautiful orchids from the hothouse,

799
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:50,086
with greetings from both of us.

800
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:51,620
You don't mind, do you?

801
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:54,657
And now you'll go riding.

802
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:58,785
I hope you won't find it boring,
being so alone.

803
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:00,609
I'll take a few more riding lessons,

804
00:52:00,705 --> 00:52:02,012
then I'll accompany you
if you want me to.

805
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,480
I'm not sure whether
it was right to send her flowers.

806
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,869
How now, out of bed?

807
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,445
You're not a good patient.

808
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,065
Will you believe me, Sanitätsrat,

809
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:38,084
there's no better medicine for me

810
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:42,308
than to be able to look down
to the garden once again,

811
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:45,172
look out into the street,

812
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,210
to see a bit of life.

813
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:52,433
And a horse once again.

814
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:56,425
It didn't do you any harm,
you look better.

815
00:53:57,139 --> 00:54:00,747
Then I might allow you the walk
to the window after all.

816
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:03,842
The walk to the window
doesn't make me well either.

817
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:08,133
I want to be allowed to drive
down to town just once.

818
00:54:08,476 --> 00:54:11,129
But what business could you
have in town these days?

819
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,917
Now, let's listen to your heart.

820
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:17,988
I have a duty to perform,
an urgent duty, professor.

821
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,763
Yes, very true.

822
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:23,600
Towards yourself,
towards your health.

823
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:25,323
Not only that.

824
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,580
I haven't just myself to look after.

825
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:30,598
Yes I know, Susanne.

826
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,268
But she's fine, isn't she?

827
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,255
She is, but I want to go out.

828
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,559
Back onto the horse, is that it?

829
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:40,343
That too.

830
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:44,768
A few days patience,
if the heart helps us along.

831
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,101
Do you think it's the heart?

832
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,513
I don't know what
has helped us so suddenly.

833
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:52,655
I do.

834
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,485
Wonderful how that
little Lippizan goes!

835
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:22,581
You like him better than the bay?

836
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:24,465
I like them both.

837
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,179
Only the bay is lame.

838
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:29,901
I'll have to send for the veterinary,
or do you know something about it?

839
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:31,510
Let me have a look!

840
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:33,250
The back leg?

841
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:34,988
Yes, the left.

842
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:39,790
I've made a bandage,
but I think it's better if...

843
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,930
We love each other, my friend,

844
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,980
and it will be terrible.

845
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,760
Terrible.

846
00:56:33,195 --> 00:56:35,297
Why did you ever take me
back to Hamburg, Matthias?

847
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,314
I have?

848
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:40,340
I beg your pardon?
I have taken you back to Hamburg?

849
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:43,289
You should have told me
that Äls was still here.

850
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,203
But I didn't know it.
What is she to me?

851
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,065
Ok, you're right.

852
00:56:48,993 --> 00:56:51,440
It's just a subterfuge to accuse you.
I'm accusing myself.

853
00:56:52,043 --> 00:56:53,491
But that's of no use at all.

854
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:54,787
I don't understand.

855
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,933
- You've told me yourself...
- Told you, rubbish!

856
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,859
You don't have to remind me of
the things I have told you at the time.

857
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:03,839
The things I'm telling
myself all the time.

858
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:07,579
But what use is it to tell myself that
Octavia is infinitely more beautiful,

859
00:57:08,169 --> 00:57:09,315
nobler, better.

860
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:13,630
The sublimity, the grace, the nobility
running in her veins.

861
00:57:14,065 --> 00:57:15,105
What's the use?

862
00:57:15,324 --> 00:57:17,062
- It's of no use to you?
- No, it isn't.

863
00:57:17,274 --> 00:57:18,593
It's of no use at all.

864
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:19,895
Not a bit.

865
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:22,350
I can tell myself a hundred times,

866
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,480
but when I'm with Äls, then...

867
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,625
then I'm just happier.

868
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:32,360
It seems there always remains an arm's
length between Octavia and myself.

869
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,799
That's the way it was on
the day of our engagement,

870
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:37,582
and that's the way it is today.

871
00:57:38,528 --> 00:57:40,113
But that's terrible, Albrecht.

872
00:57:43,202 --> 00:57:44,376
But I love Octavia.

873
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:47,930
No, my dear Albrecht,
that's impossible!

874
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,034
You cannot do away with it
that easily.

875
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,495
After all you're a man,
you have willpower!

876
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:54,681
You couldn't possibly hold
one woman in your arms

877
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,191
and claim to love the other.

878
00:57:56,404 --> 00:57:58,478
But I haven't held her
in my arms, Matthias.

879
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:00,226
Or as good as, probably.

880
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:02,107
I shouldn't have
talked to you, Matthias.

881
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:05,085
No. If you want to make me
your ally against Octavia, no.

882
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:07,750
I don't understand who you
think I am, Albrecht.

883
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:10,695
If you don't respect yourself,
at least show some respect for Octavia.

884
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,255
Well, then.

885
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,850
I've always believed friendship
knows no bounds,

886
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:20,653
but today I realise there are things
one must solve alone.

887
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,696
Is it that difficult?

888
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:39,960
Go on, answer me.

889
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,028
Octavia.

890
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:49,677
I was so sincere at the time
when I wooed you.

891
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:54,500
And now it is to have been a betrayal?

892
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,405
It cannot be all bad,

893
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:05,416
because it gives you a force,
a joy, a sweeping movement

894
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,550
which I've never
seen in you before.

895
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,290
Am I to love you less because of it?

896
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:14,300
Octavia.

897
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:16,970
You're so...

898
00:59:17,566 --> 00:59:18,679
good.

899
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:20,901
So, so...

900
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:22,822
Yes, I know.

901
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,020
But it's about you,

902
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:27,960
not about me.

903
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,070
Octavia...

904
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:39,526
That is so, so...

905
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,850
superhuman.

906
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:14,211
Lugna lite, lugna lite.
Jag kommer snart tilbaka. Stanna kvar.

907
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:07,808
Octavia!

908
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:10,939
Octavia!

909
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,400
Octavia!

910
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:26,931
What's the matter?

911
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:28,417
Where are you going?

912
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,314
I see.

913
01:01:32,477 --> 01:01:33,758
Octavia, what do you want?

914
01:01:33,972 --> 01:01:35,435
How is it going to end?

915
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,842
I don't know.

916
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,955
I want to, I just want to.

917
01:01:41,138 --> 01:01:44,371
Octavia, what do you want, what can
you want out here on the street?

918
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,487
Octavia, I am afraid for you.

919
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,344
I couldn't find any
peace of mind at home.

920
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,458
I had a feeling that you might
need me, that's why I came.

921
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:53,545
Octavia.

922
01:01:53,941 --> 01:01:56,165
This is not the right way
you're following now.

923
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:59,934
Octavia, its not like you at all
to follow that woman.

924
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:01,336
It is.

925
01:02:01,824 --> 01:02:04,950
If you knew how I have
suffered these last days.

926
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,615
Not every narcotic
takes away the pain.

927
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:09,485
But it's not a narcotic.

928
01:02:09,668 --> 01:02:10,568
Look at this!

929
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:13,807
The way men gaze after her.

930
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:17,040
Nobody ever gazes after me
on the street.

931
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,989
Even though everyone
tells me I'm beautiful.

932
01:02:20,624 --> 01:02:22,560
You've told me many times yourself.

933
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:24,890
Albrecht has told me.

934
01:02:25,764 --> 01:02:27,367
What's the secret?

935
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:29,810
She's like a magnet.

936
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:31,760
Yes, indeed.

937
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:36,120
Octavia, you should be glad that
nobody gazes after you on the street.

938
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:38,330
You're such a pure person.

939
01:02:39,248 --> 01:02:40,792
No, that's not it.

940
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:42,724
She is, too.

941
01:02:44,736 --> 01:02:46,901
She's just more powerful that I am.

942
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:51,000
It's no use pretending.

943
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,592
Octavia, you're beside yourself,
I beg you, come home now.

944
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:56,366
No. Don't you see,
she's on the way to somewhere.

945
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:03,764
Dovenfleet [Hamburg harbour area]

946
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:13,221
Look!
She's about to enter a building.

947
01:03:14,426 --> 01:03:15,600
Hello, Susannchen!

948
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,810
Do you see that?

949
01:03:27,923 --> 01:03:29,417
Does she have a child?

950
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:31,109
I don't know.

951
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,510
I didn't know.

952
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,820
Say, you're losing your bandages.

953
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:33,327
Kom til mig, Grållen.

954
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,570
Spring inte ifrån mig.

955
01:04:37,763 --> 01:04:39,006
Stanna her.

956
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:42,323
Vär rar mot mig, Grållen.

957
01:04:57,946 --> 01:04:59,420
I have to hold my horse.

958
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:01,377
I can't afford it.

959
01:05:02,216 --> 01:05:06,561
I don't have
your way with animals, Äls.

960
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:12,631
I love smelling the hay.

961
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,770
That's how I got to know you first.

962
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,225
A picture of abounding health.

963
01:05:20,497 --> 01:05:24,401
When I think about how I greeted you
at your window the first time,

964
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,320
how pale you looked behind
the window panes.

965
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:29,915
You should never have gone away.

966
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:34,151
For two months I lay
in that boring room,

967
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:37,658
and no one was there
to send greetings up to my window,

968
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:40,904
and to call me back to life.

969
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:42,620
Was it that dangerous?

970
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:46,390
The old Sanitätsrat Terboven thinks so.

971
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:49,847
But now all that is over.

972
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:51,517
Äls.

973
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,490
You mustn't break.

974
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,520
Äls.

975
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:03,210
En gang kommer et ögonblikk
der du glömmer all ting omkring dig.

976
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:06,335
Min älskling.

977
01:06:07,018 --> 01:06:08,512
What does that mean?

978
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,526
Beloved.

979
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,000
Min älskling.

980
01:06:25,946 --> 01:06:27,520
Älskling, that's what you are.

981
01:06:30,306 --> 01:06:31,340
You, too.

982
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:38,270
To die like this,

983
01:06:40,142 --> 01:06:42,780
that would be the happiest death.

984
01:06:43,817 --> 01:06:44,838
Äls.

985
01:06:45,525 --> 01:06:46,881
What are you saying?

986
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:50,405
And when I'm dead, do you hear,

987
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:52,882
I want my ashes to be
scattered into the sea.

988
01:06:53,187 --> 01:06:54,758
I beg you, Äls...

989
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:57,970
And when the waves
caress your foot,

990
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:02,889
Then you shall know
that it is I, your Äls.

991
01:07:03,544 --> 01:07:05,205
Äls, don't talk like that.

992
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:07,173
You're frightening me.

993
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,260
It was close, Albrecht,
when you were away for so long.

994
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:15,455
If you hadn't returned,

995
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:18,530
I think I would never
have overcome my fever.

996
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:24,648
We're like that,
we're different from you down here.

997
01:07:26,045 --> 01:07:28,560
When we love, then we're like that.

998
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,495
När vi älskar så är vi sånn:

999
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:42,393
I skillsmissan visnar vi som en bloma utan sol.

1000
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:45,664
That means:

1001
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:49,800
In separation we perish

1002
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,630
like the flower without the sun.

1003
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:58,329
Do you love me that much?

1004
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:21,596
Do you know if my husband
has gone out?

1005
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:23,677
Herr Froben has just gone out
for a ride with Miss Flodéen.

1006
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,147
I see.

1007
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:33,610
Why do you cry?

1008
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,250
I love you.

1009
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:43,278
And you're crying
because of that?

1010
01:08:46,129 --> 01:08:52,130
Because there has been
a love in my life before,

1011
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:54,799
without you.

1012
01:09:16,098 --> 01:09:19,711
Madam, I've made you a cup of tea.

1013
01:09:21,464 --> 01:09:22,940
Have I been asleep for long?

1014
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,330
Perhaps an hour.

1015
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,576
Has the Sanitätsrat...
hand me my back cushion...

1016
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,756
Has the Sanitätsrat been here?

1017
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:32,876
Yes, but he's left now.

1018
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:36,277
He said he couldn't prescribe anything
better than sleep and rest anyway.

1019
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:38,641
I don't feel well.

1020
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,490
I think I have a high fever.

1021
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,755
Will he return this afternoon?

1022
01:09:45,064 --> 01:09:47,007
He didn't know yet.
He has so much to do right now.

1023
01:09:47,336 --> 01:09:49,530
There's an epidemic in town, he says.

1024
01:09:51,422 --> 01:09:52,570
An epidemic?

1025
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,641
That sounds bad.

1026
01:09:58,731 --> 01:09:59,970
What is it?

1027
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:01,830
Typhus in the harbour area.

1028
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:03,692
It's in the paper, too.

1029
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:06,526
In the harbour area?

1030
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:08,615
Whereabouts?

1031
01:10:10,187 --> 01:10:11,376
Read it to me.

1032
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:18,264
"As we've just learned, in the harbour
area near the Dovenfleet,

1033
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,368
alarming illnesses have appeared"

1034
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:21,862
Dovenfleet?

1035
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:23,195
Yes, Dovenfleet.

1036
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,818
"which show symptoms of typhus.

1037
01:10:25,031 --> 01:10:27,365
Unfortunately there have already
been a few fatal cases.

1038
01:10:27,654 --> 01:10:31,775
At the moment it is deliberated whether
stricter police measures are necessary.

1039
01:10:32,705 --> 01:10:34,032
Good heavens!

1040
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:36,120
I must get up!

1041
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:39,399
Hand me my clothes and call a taxi.

1042
01:10:39,658 --> 01:10:41,168
But Madam, you cannot get up now.

1043
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,536
The Sanitätsrat said it's very
dangerous and that you need rest.

1044
01:10:45,024 --> 01:10:46,355
Give me my clothes.

1045
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:49,280
But Madam, this will end badly.

1046
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,597
I can't take the responsibility.

1047
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:53,519
Please lie down again.

1048
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,513
I'm too weak.

1049
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,883
My friend!
I mustn't write to you, but I have to.

1050
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:05,841
An epidemic reigns in Dovenfleet,
bearing a terrible name.

1051
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:08,405
A child is in danger, my friend.
A child that I love.

1052
01:11:08,603 --> 01:11:10,708
It lives at 22, Dovenfleet,
with Frau Steinkamp.

1053
01:11:10,906 --> 01:11:13,087
Take the child.
They will give it to you.

1054
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:15,496
If there's no one left to look after it,
take it wherever you want to,

1055
01:11:15,694 --> 01:11:17,265
only away from the danger.

1056
01:11:17,435 --> 01:11:20,012
I'll wait for you by the window
at 6 o'clock, till you come.

1057
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:23,534
And when you ride by,
I'll know whether it has been saved.

1058
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,948
Hurry! Äls

1059
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:49,248
I arrived just in time.

1060
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,997
The mother is ill, you say?
Typhus?

1061
01:11:52,277 --> 01:11:53,422
The foster-mother.

1062
01:11:54,825 --> 01:11:56,033
The child is healthy.

1063
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,108
We'll keep it here for
a few days for observation.

1064
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:05,255
Symptoms of typhus make
themselves felt very clearly.

1065
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:06,750
I'll bring that news gladly.

1066
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:10,480
But it was unwise to fetch the child,
you might have caught the disease.

1067
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:12,573
You leave things like that
to an ambulance.

1068
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:14,171
The mother was worried
about the child.

1069
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:16,292
She waits for the news,
I'll bring it to her.

1070
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,349
Do you need anything else, madam?

1071
01:12:31,545 --> 01:12:34,216
No, I don't need anything. You may go.

1072
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:39,812
You may go.

1073
01:12:39,995 --> 01:12:45,446
It can't be pleasant for a sick woman
to look out at the rainy weather.

1074
01:12:46,101 --> 01:12:47,580
If it were the sun...

1075
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:49,345
The sun...

1076
01:12:51,048 --> 01:12:53,430
I've seen so much
of the sun in my life.

1077
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,156
Go now.

1078
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,474
Leave me alone.

1079
01:14:00,773 --> 01:14:02,523
You're riding into
the stable, Herr Froben?

1080
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,976
You've almost smashed
your head at the gate.

1081
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:08,605
Are you unwell, Herr Froben?

1082
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,121
Good gracious!

1083
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,016
Herr Froben!

1084
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:16,440
I'll call the lady of the house.

1085
01:14:16,837 --> 01:14:19,277
No, it's nothing.

1086
01:14:20,161 --> 01:14:22,051
Nothing to my wife.

1087
01:14:23,299 --> 01:14:24,790
I don't want her to...

1088
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,294
or someone...

1089
01:14:32,036 --> 01:14:33,378
Help me.

1090
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,626
Octavia.

1091
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,343
I hear you, Albrecht.

1092
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:03,436
You mustn't open the glass.

1093
01:15:04,473 --> 01:15:06,554
Typhus is very infectious.

1094
01:15:19,037 --> 01:15:20,684
Do you want to tell me
something, Albrecht?

1095
01:15:21,828 --> 01:15:22,817
No.

1096
01:15:24,128 --> 01:15:25,650
But I must tell you.

1097
01:15:25,867 --> 01:15:27,990
It weighs on my heart like a stone.

1098
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:30,231
What is it?

1099
01:15:32,175 --> 01:15:34,110
I am afraid for Äls.

1100
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,917
Don't be afraid.

1101
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:40,170
Fate knows better what
it wants to do with us.

1102
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,281
I can see life above you,

1103
01:15:43,586 --> 01:15:45,860
and a light and happy future.

1104
01:15:46,445 --> 01:15:48,235
Only above myself?

1105
01:15:49,486 --> 01:15:50,858
Not above the both of us?

1106
01:15:52,098 --> 01:15:53,593
I don't know, Albrecht.

1107
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:57,152
You know it quite well,
don't avoid it, Octavia.

1108
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,375
Above you,

1109
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:02,867
and above my love.

1110
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:04,785
Yes.

1111
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:07,635
Wherever you go to be happy,

1112
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:10,867
my love will always accompany you.

1113
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,980
In this rain I have greeted Äls
for the last time.

1114
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,530
And now she'll be waiting,

1115
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,325
and...

1116
01:16:29,494 --> 01:16:30,450
And what?

1117
01:16:32,193 --> 01:16:33,250
And die.

1118
01:16:34,706 --> 01:16:37,649
One doesn't die
that quickly, Albrecht.

1119
01:16:39,723 --> 01:16:40,990
You don't know her.

1120
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:47,380
At the time, when we were
away in Düsseldorf,

1121
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:50,274
She couldn't get well again either.

1122
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:54,162
She once said to me:

1123
01:16:55,641 --> 01:16:57,855
"In separation we perish,

1124
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:02,155
like the flower without the sun."

1125
01:17:03,272 --> 01:17:04,375
That's what she said.

1126
01:17:06,016 --> 01:17:10,942
"And no one was there
to send greetings up to my window,

1127
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:14,949
and to call me back to life."

1128
01:17:32,491 --> 01:17:35,715
Then I'll conclude the last will.

1129
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:37,992
Yes.

1130
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,285
He isn't inside the room yet,

1131
01:17:43,977 --> 01:17:46,880
but I can feel him
sneaking round the house.

1132
01:17:49,318 --> 01:17:50,919
Who's sneaking around the house?

1133
01:17:51,315 --> 01:17:52,779
The friend.

1134
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,366
Friend?

1135
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,150
Friend Hein.

1136
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,387
I see.

1137
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:03,925
Friend Hein. Death.

1138
01:18:05,343 --> 01:18:08,200
I think, madam,
you are too gloomy.

1139
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:11,700
You're seeing ghosts, don't you?

1140
01:18:13,425 --> 01:18:14,940
Don't say anything.

1141
01:18:19,936 --> 01:18:24,180
And the universal heir's
exact address is...?

1142
01:18:25,308 --> 01:18:28,282
Dovenfleet 22.

1143
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,834
Susanne.

1144
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,680
Now it'll come to nothing

1145
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:43,115
with our pony,

1146
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,955
with our house by the sea.

1147
01:18:50,413 --> 01:18:51,480
Susanne...

1148
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:53,051
I beg your pardon?

1149
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,680
Six o'clock.

1150
01:19:12,688 --> 01:19:16,088
Notary, please go now.

1151
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,487
I must be alone.

1152
01:19:19,783 --> 01:19:21,353
I'm expecting someone.

1153
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:24,629
You're expecting a visitor?

1154
01:19:24,858 --> 01:19:26,337
And you're talking of dying!

1155
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,130
If he doesn't come
I won't survive this day.

1156
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:37,080
Yes, even an embrace can bring death,

1157
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:39,215
even a child's embrace.

1158
01:19:40,563 --> 01:19:42,941
So be careful in the future.

1159
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:45,025
This time you've been lucky.

1160
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,680
You'll get over it
with your robust health.

1161
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,520
Ah, well.

1162
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:52,860
Aren't you glad about it?

1163
01:19:53,607 --> 01:19:54,623
I am.

1164
01:19:56,432 --> 01:19:57,423
But...

1165
01:19:57,697 --> 01:19:58,643
But?

1166
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:04,260
Why don't you tell me how
Miss Flodéen is, Sanitätsrat?

1167
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:06,680
You're her doctor.

1168
01:20:07,214 --> 01:20:09,775
You ought to know
how much I long for news of her.

1169
01:20:11,092 --> 01:20:15,026
Or do you think that you owe it
to Octavia not to speak of it?

1170
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,436
Octavia does not need a sacrifice.

1171
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:19,845
She is making a sacrifice.

1172
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,115
Yes.

1173
01:20:23,996 --> 01:20:26,545
For her, our marriage has
been a great sacrifice,

1174
01:20:26,908 --> 01:20:29,255
One great sacrifice.

1175
01:20:30,551 --> 01:20:33,174
Yes, there are people whose
nature is like this, Herr Froben.

1176
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,249
and that's why Äls
doesn't have to wait in vain

1177
01:20:37,316 --> 01:20:40,442
for you and your greeting.

1178
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:44,620
A rider is standing at the gate,

1179
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:47,255
at Äls' garden gate,

1180
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:51,060
offering her the lover's salute

1181
01:20:51,697 --> 01:20:53,588
for which she is waiting every day.

1182
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:56,048
Who?

1183
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:01,170
Who is standing at the gate?

1184
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:50,920
Octavia.

1185
01:22:59,276 --> 01:23:00,283
Äls..

1186
01:23:03,138 --> 01:23:06,264
I will have to hurt you
very much, Äls.

1187
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:10,970
I know, Albrecht.

1188
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,160
I know it.

1189
01:23:16,019 --> 01:23:18,210
I know everything.

1190
01:23:20,608 --> 01:23:22,920
I am so sad, Albrecht,

1191
01:23:25,254 --> 01:23:27,940
even though I see
your figure at my window.

1192
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,610
But you're so far away from me.

1193
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:38,061
Your love is so far away from me.

1194
01:23:40,373 --> 01:23:43,260
I don't feel it anymore.

1195
01:23:46,472 --> 01:23:47,478
Albrecht.

1196
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,400
But I'm not at the gate, Äls.

1197
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:56,170
It is Octavia who is greeting you.

1198
01:23:58,374 --> 01:23:59,980
It isn't you?

1199
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:07,434
Yes, it's you.

1200
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,260
I can see you, Albrecht.

1201
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,060
Is it really you?

1202
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,853
Who can say what is real?

1203
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,880
What do you want here, my darling?

1204
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:32,480
I want to say farewell, Äls.

1205
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:38,540
Do we have to?

1206
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,800
Before Octavia's love

1207
01:24:43,349 --> 01:24:46,886
everything else must be extinguished
and pass away.

1208
01:24:48,057 --> 01:24:49,460
Do you understand this?

1209
01:24:51,137 --> 01:24:52,265
Yes.

1210
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,879
Forgive me, Äls,

1211
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:58,389
that I am so cruel.

1212
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:01,720
But I must tell you.

1213
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:05,540
I love Octavia.

1214
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,260
I know it.

1215
01:25:10,959 --> 01:25:12,274
I know.

1216
01:25:14,085 --> 01:25:15,680
Beloved.

1217
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,610
Farewell,

1218
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:23,034
and be happy.

1219
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:26,560
Äls!

1220
01:25:28,646 --> 01:25:30,156
I cannot see you any longer.

1221
01:25:32,634 --> 01:25:33,579
Äls!

1222
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:39,330
Don't call me any longer.

1223
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,920
I don't want it anymore.

1224
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:48,600
Listen, Albrecht.

1225
01:25:51,531 --> 01:25:54,733
So far away am I,

1226
01:25:58,011 --> 01:25:59,660
far away.

1227
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,180
The sea

1228
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,300
is far away.

1229
01:26:11,289 --> 01:26:15,193
Are you going away?

1230
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,680
Or...

1231
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,750
is it I?

1232
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:24,010
Who is going away?

1233
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,005
We...

1234
01:26:29,772 --> 01:26:31,330
cannot know.

1235
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:39,729
Step aside, Albrecht.

1236
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:45,250
Stand clear of the gate.

1237
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,180
It was her last wish to have
her ashes scattered into the sea.

1238
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,045
She has returned.

1239
01:27:35,974 --> 01:27:38,551
The wind and the waves
had been her elements.

1240
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,480
Now she is in wind and wave.

1241
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:50,040
