1
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,250
<i>You know, I told him</i>

2
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,542
<i>This shelf smells
like a privy.</i>

3
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>I will treat it as such.</i>

4
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,708
Captain, reporting
with a new prisoner.

5
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,125
Signed by
the emperor.

6
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,417
Shut your mouth.

7
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:12,833
<i>Looks like we've caught
quite a fish today.</i>

8
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,708
Mystical insurrection
against the empire.

9
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,958
You, dirty old beggar?

10
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,917
<i>Sir, he's of The Way.</i>

11
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,167
Martinian, is it?

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,458
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,333
What way? Say what
you mean, guardsman.

14
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,542
He's a follower of the one
they call "Jesus the Christ. "

15
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:31,708
<i>Jesus the Christ,
a religious fanatic.</i>

16
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,417
Is that all we get
here these days?

17
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,833
Name?

18
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,125
What is his name?

19
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,750
Simon Peter of Galilee.

20
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,500
They call him
"the fisherman. "

21
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,792
<i>He knew Jesus.</i>

22
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,208
Enough!

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,375
Take him to the box.

24
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,875
Let him convert, relax.

25
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,917
Father,

26
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:29,292
thank you for this chance
to suffer for you.

27
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,708
Thy will be done.

28
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,125
<i>When do you think
they will pass his sentence?</i>

29
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,250
<i>Do you really think
he knew this Jesus?</i>

30
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,417
<i>We should question him.</i>

31
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:10,667
<i>Maninian, you'd rather look
at some old fool than your wife?</i>

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,958
<i>Go home.</i>

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,208
<i>Calm yourself.</i>

34
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,667
<i>You'll be Ô¨Åne by yourself?</i>

35
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,833
<i>I think I can
handle watching a door.</i>

36
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,708
<i>Right, well,
I'll see you in the morning.</i>

37
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,167
Is it you, Lord?

38
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,708
Ask your God
to save us.

39
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,792
Are you afraid
he'll deny you?

40
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:03,417
Am I to be judged silently
by an assassin's blade

41
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:08,000
in the night?

42
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,500
No...

43
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,208
that face has
never seen murder,

44
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,417
<i>much less committed it.</i>

45
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,333
I'm not supposed
to give you this.

46
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:30,542
<i>So were you
a priest or a prophet?</i>

47
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,000
I am a fisherman.

48
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:44,042
Lord Jesus,
thank you for this food,

49
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:48,750
<i>bless it to my body
and body to your service.</i>

50
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:53,083
Thank you
for my captors.

51
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:57,333
<i>I pray for their hearts
to be open to you.</i>

52
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,083
<i>Amen.</i>

53
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,292
So-

54
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,917
what is your price?

55
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,208
What?

56
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,542
<i>What do you seek in
payment for this forbidden meal?</i>

57
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:22,292
Just a-just a chat,
something to pass the hours.

58
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Yeah right,
it's my wife, my Novella.

59
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,833
She's heard about these
Christians and their Way.

60
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,083
And your Messiah,
this Jesus,

61
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,875
she's insatiably
curious about him.

62
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,458
<i>I've warned her
repeatedly to be careful,</i>

63
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:41,458
<i>but you know women,</i>

64
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,458
or perhaps you don't.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,292
<i>Here I am with one of the most
famous Christians in my charge.</i>

66
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,250
There's no harm to
ask him a few questions,

67
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,250
for her sake.

68
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:59,750
Ask, and it shall
be given to you;

69
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,208
seek,
and ye shall find.

70
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,750
<i>What, did he say that?</i>

71
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,667
Your God, your Jesus?

72
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,667
He said, "Come to me,

73
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:18,375
"all those who are weary
and heavy laden,

74
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:22,208
"and I will give you rest,

75
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,667
peace.

76
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,917
Do you want peace?

77
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,250
Don't get any ideas.

78
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,583
The gods are
good enough for me.

79
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:39,708
<i>And what of
the life after this one?</i>

80
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
Are you prepared
for that?

81
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,875
<i>You really
think you could convert me</i>

82
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,833
to living a life
of persecution?

83
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:50,667
<i>No, to
living a life of hope</i>

84
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,417
with an inheritance that can

85
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:58,208
never perish,
spoil, nor fade.

86
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,583
<i>Is that so?</i>

87
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,208
Do you care to make
a wager on that?

88
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:12,208
If you can convert me,
I'M set you free.

89
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,083
That wager would not
be fair for you.

90
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, we will talk then,

91
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,667
and you will tell me
of your God,

92
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,375
and you will
meet your match, Simon Peter.

93
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,333
<i>If that is your wish,</i>

94
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,167
but I thought it was your
wife who was interested.

95
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,750
Processus.

96
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,042
Don't think you'll
get away with that easily.

97
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,458
I don't know what
you're talking about.

98
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,083
Fraternizing
with a prisoner.

99
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,375
It was merely
an interrogation.

100
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,667
On whose orders?

101
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,417
My own.

102
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,458
I should report this.

103
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,958
Are we to open
Pandora's Box

104
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,625
and report each
other's transgressions,

105
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,333
dear Processus?

106
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,667
Should I report
the gambling?

107
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,625
The women?

108
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,417
The missing wife?

109
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,292
The lightened coffers?

110
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,958
I was wondering when
you might grow a backbone.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,208
Why is he so important
to you, anyway?

112
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,500
He's a famous man.

113
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,833
I've never met
a famous man.

114
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,333
I'm curious.

115
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,833
Don't get
too attached.

116
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,625
His sentence?

117
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:09,417
<i>There's no reward
waiting for you in the Kingdom.</i>

118
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:14,125
<i>My master can free you
from this suffering</i>

119
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,708
<i>and provide great riches.</i>

120
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:21,083
All you need do
is deny him,

121
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,667
<i>as you did before.</i>

122
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,375
<i>That was long ago!</i>

123
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,250
<i>I have been forgiven.</i>

124
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:34,833
<i>Do not speak to me about your
temporary earthly riches.</i>

125
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:40,583
<i>I now have
everlasting riches</i>

126
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,208
<i>beyond anything
that you can provide.</i>

127
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,500
Have you?

128
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:50,542
Has your Father
told you that.

129
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,750
<i>My master
told me a secret.</i>

130
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:58,125
Perhaps he will
tell you too,

131
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,833
<i>when you meet him.</i>

132
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,458
That I shall die
in 3 days?

133
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,417
<i>Be gone, demon!</i>

134
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:11,750
Three days,
Simon Peter,

135
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,125
<i>three days,
and you're mine.</i>

136
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,500
<i>In the name of Jesus,</i>

137
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,958
I cast you out!

138
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,500
Did you hear that?

139
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,042
<i>A shriek in the cells?
What of it?</i>

140
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,500
Well, perhaps
we should check.

141
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,333
Perhaps you
should relax.

142
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,042
Ah, that-
that's disgusting.

143
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,875
You'll get
used to it,

144
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,208
<i>the screams,</i>

145
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,542
the filth.

146
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,250
So what do you
think of the gods?

147
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,208
Ugh!

148
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,292
You are boring!

149
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,292
Is this what happens
when you marry?

150
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,333
What if they're right?

151
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,375
What if their one God
is greater than the Olympians?

152
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,458
So join them.

153
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,125
I have a cell
just your size ready.

154
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,375
No...

155
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,250
No, I will not endanger
my wife like that,

156
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:18,083
but still I'm troubled
with what we're doing.

157
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:28,167
<i>They say these Christians
go quietly to their deaths.</i>

158
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,625
Makes my job easier.

159
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,417
I mean, it's amazing
they get any converts at all.

160
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,250
What could this cult
possibly offer a man

161
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
for him to risk his
freedom and his life?

162
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:45,583
Who cares, as long as there's
coin in rounding them up?

163
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,500
Your heart is as
black as this place.

164
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,458
Thank you.

165
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,250
I will find out more.

166
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,500
I didn't see a thing.

167
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,708
<i>Did you really know him?</i>

168
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:05,542
<i>The one they call
the King of the Jews?</i>

169
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:11,000
You truly mean to hear
my story, don't you?

170
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,375
I do.

171
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,958
<i>Did he really rise
from the dead?</i>

172
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:21,375
<i>The story
begins long before that day.</i>

173
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,833
I have time.

174
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,625
Tell me everything.

175
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,542
You may have time;

176
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,125
however, I have but
3 days left to my life.

177
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,083
<i>Who told you that?</i>

178
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,833
How do you know that?

179
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,917
<i>If the forces
that surround me frighten you,</i>

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,417
then this is not
a tale for your ears.

181
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,500
I want to know,
I need to know.

182
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,792
Your one God, is he
greater than all the rest?

183
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,500
<i>There
is only one true God.</i>

184
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,458
But how do you know?

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,750
<i>Jesus himself said,</i>

186
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:10,458
<i>"I am the way,
the truth, and the life.</i>

187
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,042
<i>No one comes to the
Father, but through me. "</i>

188
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,833
He had power
over the storms,

189
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,750
made the lame walk
and the blind see.

190
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,792
<i>He healed the lepers</i>

191
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,208
and made the dead rise.

192
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,375
So you were friends
with this Jesus?

193
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,375
A prophet?
A living God?

194
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,792
What of us, if we're
to put you to death?

195
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,250
Peace.

196
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:49,042
I will tell you
of Jesus, our Lord.

197
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,583
First...

198
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,417
I knew him
as a man.

199
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,917
<i>Brother</i>

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,208
Hurry, Simon!

201
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,875
He called to us!

202
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,417
There, there,
I can see him,

203
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,167
I can see him!

204
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,417
Come on, brother!
Hurry up!

205
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,167
He is this way!

206
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,625
<i>We have to get
home and tend to Mother!</i>

207
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,583
There, Simon, hurry!

208
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,917
He is there!
Come on!

209
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,458
Andrew!

210
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,167
Andrew.

211
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,667
<i>As I gazed upon him,</i>

212
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,083
<i>I was afraid-
not of him.</i>

213
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,250
<i>His presence was like
all the light and love</i>

214
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,333
<i>and goodness of the world.</i>

215
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,667
<i>No, I was afraid for myself}
for I knew at that moment</i>

216
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,625
<i>that my life would now
become about him.</i>

217
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:24,042
<i>But what was I,
a simple Ô¨Åsherman,</i>

218
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,875
<i>strong enough
to face such a life?</i>

219
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,250
You are Simon,
son of John.

220
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,167
You will be called Peter.

221
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,292
<i>Tell me, brothers,
who do people say that I am?</i>

222
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:55,250
There are those that say you
are John the Baptist or Elijah,

223
00:16:55,333 --> 00:17:00,167
but mostly people
say you are a prophet,

224
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:03,833
but they don't
know for sure.

225
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,208
And what about you?

226
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,500
<i>Who do you say I am?</i>

227
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:15,375
You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.

228
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:20,333
<i>Then Jesus
walked with us to our home by the sea,</i>

229
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,500
<i>where my wife's
mother lay dying.</i>

230
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:28,083
Her sickness was deep.

231
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:32,375
<i>It was the kind
no remedy could cure,</i>

232
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,667
<i>but Jesus reached
out his hand.</i>

233
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,583
<i>Before my eyes,
he had banished the sickness.</i>

234
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:06,292
<i>This was but one of many
miracles he performed,</i>

235
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,625
<i>seen by many witnesses.</i>

236
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,833
That is quite a story,

237
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,625
if any of it's true.

238
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,500
Why would I be false?

239
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,958
What would I gain?

240
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,083
<i>You have nothing
I want.</i>

241
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,542
Not even freedom?

242
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,667
<i>As I said,
you have nothing I want.</i>

243
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,500
<i>Even if I believe you,</i>

244
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,333
<i>I've already
made up my mind.</i>

245
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,250
You are clearly insane.

246
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,042
In what respect?

247
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,458
Well, any man who
wishes good health

248
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,708
upon his
mother-in-law is-

249
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,333
mad.

250
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,667
Your wits are
sharp, soldier.

251
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,250
What is your name?

252
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,208
Martinian.

253
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,708
Would you hear
more of Jesus

254
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:05,167
and accept what
I say is the truth?

255
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,375
I will listen well.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,125
It's only a rooster.

257
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,083
<i>The sound
offends you?</i>

258
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,042
It reminds me.

259
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:25,333
<i>Reminds you of what?</i>

260
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,875
I denied my Lord.

261
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,292
I denied him,
not once,

262
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,667
but three times.

263
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,250
You sinned
against your Lord?

264
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,792
I denied him.

265
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:50,500
<i>You were not cast
out from his fellowship?</i>

266
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:56,292
Man can be weak
in the heart and mind.

267
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,417
Our Lord knew this.

268
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,500
<i>I say to you,</i>

269
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,667
anyone who
commits any sin

270
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,375
<i>is a slave to sin,</i>

271
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:19,208
and a slave does not
remain in the house forever.

272
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,917
The Son remains forever.

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,458
<i>So if the Son
sets you free,</i>

274
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,792
you will be
free indeed.

275
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,417
<i>The emperor can forgive.</i>

276
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>A magistrate can forgive.</i>

277
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,292
Beg for their forgiveness.

278
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,333
Deny your Lord,
and you could go free.

279
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,250
I am already free.

280
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,042
What, even in chains?

281
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,417
You are the one
in chains, Martinian,

282
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,875
<i>not I.</i>

283
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,917
Free yourself.

284
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,042
So you will do nothing?

285
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,333
You will sit here
and wait for death?

286
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,542
With Christ,

287
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,208
death is only
a beginning.

288
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,125
<i>And what
of me, Simon Peter,</i>

289
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
and my question?

290
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,167
Let's say you're right.

291
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,958
Who would forgive my sin,
being your jailer,

292
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,958
jailer to the personal
friend of God?

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,083
<i>Forgiveness
is only found in Jesus,</i>

294
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:20,000
our Lord.

295
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,500
So, I should, uh-

296
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,042
Yeah.

297
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,333
Home to your wife.

298
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:49,375
Leave a real soldier
to do his job.

299
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,792
Forgiven?

300
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,167
You?

301
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:22,708
You are a fool to die.

302
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,750
Christ has forsaken you.

303
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,333
God has forsaken you.

304
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,250
You are alone!

305
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,125
I am not alone!

306
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:39,875
Jesus says, "I will neither
leave you nor forsake you. "

307
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,083
Nothing better to do
than rile at the rabble

308
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,000
with talk of gods?

309
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,958
How could you follow
a leader like that?

310
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,333
King of the Jews, right?

311
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:04,000
We were more like soldiers
following our General.

312
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:08,833
<i>Can't you imagine the
different kind of leader,</i>

313
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:12,708
<i>one where the lower
soldier is as important</i>

314
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,125
as the highest general?

315
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,208
You mean I would have the
same stature as the officers?

316
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:22,125
Why would any general
agree to that?

317
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,792
There is a difference between
leading and love of your people,

318
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,500
versus having
the love of power,

319
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:36,708
<i>the greed of leadership.</i>

320
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,250
Man was born with
the desire to rule.

321
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,292
What if your
general loved you

322
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:49,250
and felt that all men
were created equal?

323
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:54,583
<i>Jesus was that
kind of a general.</i>

324
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,042
<i>My brother Andrew and I</i>

325
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>were among the
Ô¨Årst of the disciples,</i>

326
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,417
<i>captains, you might say.</i>

327
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,708
You're mistaken,
Brother.

328
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,333
The Master clearly
called me first.

329
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,583
You are mistaken.

330
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,917
I told you that
we found the Messiah.

331
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,583
I was in the boat
when Jesus called,

332
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,875
"Come, follow me. "

333
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,125
We were in the
boat together.

334
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,667
He called to us
at the same time.

335
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,583
Yes, yes, but I was
closer to the shore.

336
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,125
<i>There was
John and James, the sons of Zebedee,</i>

337
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,333
<i>whom Jesus cherished.</i>

338
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,042
Mother wanted me to sit
on Jesus rig ht hand.

339
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,375
And you on the left.

340
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,875
Why am I to be
on the left?

341
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,167
Mother has
no say in this.

342
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,333
You be on the left.
I will be on the right.

343
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,875
James, Jesus loves me
better than you.

344
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,833
Hmph, we will see
about that.

345
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:44,750
<i>There was
Philip, Nathaniel, and Thomas,</i>

346
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,792
<i>James, the son of Alpheus;</i>

347
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,667
<i>Thaddeus;</i>

348
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,250
<i>Simon, the Canaanite;</i>

349
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:56,958
<i>Matthew the tax collector;</i>

350
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,500
<i>and, of course,
there was Judas.</i>

351
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:06,375
<i>But Jesus knew what
was in our hearts.</i>

352
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:19,250
<i>The Master spoke of giving
power beyond comprehension.</i>

353
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:23,833
Heal the sick,

354
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,042
cleanse the lepers,

355
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,625
raise the dead,

356
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,667
<i>drive out demons.</i>

357
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,042
<i>Freely you have received;</i>

358
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,417
therefore, give freely.

359
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,833
<i>Suppose it
doesn't work, Lord?</i>

360
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:46,750
<i>Suppose I rebuke a demon,
and it refuses to leave?</i>

361
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:50,792
<i>There are times
when it will be more work.</i>

362
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:55,625
Some can only be driven out
by prayer and fasting.

363
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,917
Witchcraft and magic.

364
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,667
That is not
what I speak of.

365
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:07,792
<i>I speak of
the true power,</i>

366
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,333
which can only
come from God.

367
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,667
<i>Not
very nice of you.</i>

368
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:16,000
Your Lord gives you powers,
yet you deny him three times?

369
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,292
You have much
anger in you.

370
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:25,083
<i>You have a wish for
true love in your life,</i>

371
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,792
peace, happiness.

372
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,042
Show me these
powers of yours.

373
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,625
<i>Prove it.</i>

374
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:36,042
You are not ill.

375
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,208
<i>You are not
beset by demons.</i>

376
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,750
<i>What would you
have me do?</i>

377
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>Hmph, Ô¨Ågures.</i>

378
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,458
<i>I would have you
be crucified</i>

379
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,417
and die
a rebel's death.

380
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,583
<i>Oh, did no one
tell you?</i>

381
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,583
Now, I've gone and
spoiled the surprise.

382
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,208
It cannot be
that way.

383
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,417
<i>Let's see how quickly
your knees turn to water.</i>

384
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,542
<i>You misunderstand</i>

385
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:09,208
I am not worthy to die
in the same manner

386
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,125
as blessed Jesus.

387
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,667
What?

388
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,917
You think it's some
kind of honor?

389
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,833
You're insane.

390
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,208
Martinian,
you will come with me.

391
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,042
You got me.

392
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,292
You will come
with me now!

393
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,250
What's this all about?

394
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,583
An agent with the seal of the
emperor wants to question you

395
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,333
about your talks with
this Christian rebel.

396
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,750
Martinian-

397
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,375
Martinian,
what's wrong?

398
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,167
What are you
doing here?

399
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,917
This is no
place for you.

400
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,250
Is he
really here?

401
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,542
Is who here?

402
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,792
Simon Peter,
of course.

403
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,333
The one they call
the Prince of the apostles.

404
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,875
He is here.

405
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,458
Why did you not
mention it?

406
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,333
Must I tell you of every
prisoner now, Wife?

407
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,042
Do not attempt that
tone with me, Husband.

408
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,500
You'll only
embarrass yourself.

409
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,500
Yes, he's here.

410
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,042
I've even spoken to him,
asked him questions.

411
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,333
Well, you've asked him
all the wrong questions.

412
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,000
You don't even know
what I've asked.

413
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,500
I know you've asked
the wrong thing.

414
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,958
And what would be
the correct question?

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,708
Ask him for a
blessing, of course,

416
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,125
for my womb, so I may
bear you a child.

417
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,375
That is
dangerous talk.

418
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,042
I know your interest
in these Christians,

419
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,792
but better not
go further.

420
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,250
It doesn't,
does it?

421
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,708
No, of course not.

422
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,958
I'm serious.

423
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,583
I will not lose you
to this cult.

424
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,833
I hear you.

425
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,750
You have made
yourself clear.

426
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,375
I'm also curious
about this man,

427
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,417
but I will not ask
for his blessing.

428
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,833
That crosses
the line.

429
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,375
I will ask him
one question.

430
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,958
Will that suffice?

431
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,458
Now; if you need
time to think-

432
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:04,792
I- I want to know
how Jesus really died,

433
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,333
and the days
leading up to his death,

434
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,708
and-

435
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,000
Well, ask him that,

436
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,833
and you shall be allowed
to sleep in the bed tonight.

437
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,583
<i>All right,
I have a question.</i>

438
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,167
Not so circumspect today.

439
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,917
Are you eager to hear
tales of my Master?

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,292
There is one tale
in particular I would hear:

441
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,833
the death of your Lord.

442
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,833
<i>How did it come about?</i>

443
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,500
That is a tale
both sad and glorious.

444
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,333
<i>I'm surprised you do not
know the answer already.</i>

445
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,542
<i>I know some
whispers, rumors.</i>

446
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,208
I would hear the truth of
it from one who lived it.

447
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,958
<i>They say he
was betrayed?</i>

448
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,583
Yes, he was.

449
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,458
<i>Who was it?
Why did he do it?</i>

450
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,792
<i>Please, I must hear.</i>

451
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,542
I have to be sure.

452
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,875
<i>If your Master
is the true Son of God,</i>

453
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,875
and you are his
right hand, I will be-

454
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:04,958
I fear for my soul.

455
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:09,208
Ilf I tell you this story,
and you know my words are true,

456
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:14,917
<i>will you then accept
Jesus as your Lord?</i>

457
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,792
I will listen well.
I promise nothing more.

458
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,417
<i>Where shall I begin?</i>

459
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,625
<i>It was on the night
of the Passover feast.</i>

460
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,167
<i>Jesus summoned us
all to dine with him.</i>

461
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,750
<i>There was an inn.</i>

462
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:39,917
<i>There was an upper room
away from all eyes.</i>

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,125
<i>There was a table
set for 13.</i>

464
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,500
<i>I had walked
with Jesus,</i>

465
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:51,708
<i>seen many wondrous
and terrible things.</i>

466
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,083
<i>I thought I had become wise
and learned of the world,</i>

467
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,792
<i>burl was not prepared
to hear the secrets</i>

468
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:04,625
<i>this room would reveal.</i>

469
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,917
Brother, join me.

470
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,583
Who would've thought that
two fishermen from Galilee

471
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,750
would be here
in this room?

472
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:20,167
My hands have lost
their roughness.

473
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:24,375
As have mine.

474
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,667
Do you miss it?

475
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,583
We're still
fishermen, Brother.

476
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:33,667
Now we cast our
nets for the Lord.

477
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,833
Who's supposed
to wash our feet?

478
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,625
Philip, you didn't arrange
for servants to wash our feet?

479
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,292
The Master did not tell me
to provide for servants.

480
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,875
Must you be
told everything?

481
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,458
Should we wash
our own feet?

482
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,458
Well, I'm not.

483
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,917
Well, where do we sit?

484
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,375
We should wait for the Master
to assign places of honor.

485
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,667
Well, why wait then?

486
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,958
The order is
always the same.

487
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:12,708
Judas, welcome.

488
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:14,417
<i>Are the others
far behind?</i>

489
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,375
They come.

490
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,917
It's been decided we'd wait
for the Master before we sit.

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,208
You can wait.

492
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,125
I've walked all day.

493
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,458
<i>As have I.</i>

494
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,833
<i>And so we
sat, we talked, and we laughed,</i>

495
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:47,375
<i>even persecuted,
even hunted as we were.</i>

496
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:51,792
<i>We laughed because
Jesus was still with us.</i>

497
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,542
And then he entered,

498
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:10,542
<i>and then there
was no more laughter,</i>

499
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,167
<i>not for a long,
long time.</i>

500
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:19,333
I have greatly desired
to eat this Passover with you

501
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,750
before I suffer;

502
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:25,167
for I tell you,
I will not eat it again

503
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:30,875
until it finds its fulfillment
in the kingdom of God.

504
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,667
Blessed are you,
O Lord, our God,

505
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,792
King of the universe,

506
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,750
<i>who chose
and sanctified us</i>

507
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,375
<i>with your commandments</i>

508
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:07,792
<i>and who gave us appointed times
for happiness: festivals.</i>

509
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:12,667
<i>And times for joy,
the day of this festival, Lord;</i>

510
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,417
<i>the festival of matzah.</i>

511
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:19,750
<i>He spoke
the prayer of joy and of thanks,</i>

512
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,167
<i>but there was no
joy in the room.</i>

513
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,625
<i>He was still a beacon
of love and light,</i>

514
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:31,292
<i>but over the rest of us
a shadow fell.</i>

515
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:44,542
Take and eat.

516
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:50,333
This is my body,
which is broken for you.

517
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:58,583
Do this in
remembrance of me.

518
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:38,708
Drink from this cup,
all of you,

519
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,000
for this is my blood
of the new covenant,

520
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,208
which is shed for many
for the forgiveness of sins.

521
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,917
Do this in
remembrance of me.

522
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,792
So what did it mean,
the drinking of the wine

523
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,750
and the eating
of the bread?

524
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,542
This is the symbol
of the new covenant

525
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:46,750
<i>in remembrance
of his death.</i>

526
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:52,208
<i>You are those who
stood by me in all my trials,</i>

527
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,208
<i>and I confer
on you a kingdom,</i>

528
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:02,667
even as my Father
conferred his kingdom upon me.

529
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,458
Pete r-

530
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,167
<i>Satan intends to sift
you like wheat,</i>

531
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,708
but I have prayed
for you, Peter,

532
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,958
that your faith
may not fail.

533
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,583
And when you have
turned back, I say to you,

534
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,125
you will encourage
your brothers.

535
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,250
<i>Lord, I am prepared to go
with you to prison and to death!</i>

536
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:28,583
<i>I tell you Peter,
before the rooster crows today,</i>

537
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:34,250
you will disown me
three times.

538
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,333
<i>No wonder you hate to
hear the crowing of the rooster.</i>

539
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,083
I was a fool.

540
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,542
But you said
he forgave you.

541
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:56,833
<i>Yes, later,
not that I deserved it.</i>

542
00:38:56,875 --> 00:39:00,125
<i>So Jesus
became the sacrifice.</i>

543
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,542
Yes, he was ushering
in the new covenant

544
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,750
<i>that his death
would symbolize.</i>

545
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,917
Do you understand?

546
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,583
Not really.

547
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:18,250
<i>In time, you will.</i>

548
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:21,750
So what happened next?

549
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,333
What does he do now?

550
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,250
I don't know.

551
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,125
<i>He prepared a
wash basin like a servant?</i>

552
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,042
But why?

553
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:52,625
it was to be-

554
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:58,417
one of his
last lessons to us.

555
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,292
<i>If only I had
known it,</i>

556
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:10,708
<i>I would not
have hesitated</i>

557
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:23,250
Lord?

558
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:27,708
You do not understand now,
but later you will understand

559
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,583
<i>why I am doing this.</i>

560
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:35,917
No Lord, you will
never wash my feet.

561
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,250
If I do not
wash your feet,

562
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,417
then you will have
no place in me.

563
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:50,000
He washed your feet?

564
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:51,500
<i>That's madness!</i>

565
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,792
Your Master,
your so-called living God,

566
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:58,125
why would he lower himself
to the duties of a slave?

567
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:03,833
No, no leader would lower
himself in his men's eyes.

568
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,417
But Jesus did
lower himself.

569
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,500
I do not understand.

570
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:17,375
Explain this to me.

571
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:22,208
<i>Jesus was talking
about spiritual cleansing.</i>

572
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:26,708
<i>While we were arguing
about who was the greatest,</i>

573
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:31,625
<i>Jesus showed us
what loving,</i>

574
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:35,375
humble service
looks like.

575
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,208
But if we are
to love one another,

576
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,125
<i>then how could one
of your own betray Jesus?</i>

577
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:46,500
What you speak of-

578
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,750
is the devil.

579
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,000
<i>The devil?</i>

580
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:52,250
<i>What is this?</i>

581
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:55,125
<i>A dark serpent, Satan.</i>

582
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,375
<i>He works
against God's light,</i>

583
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,042
<i>cloaking the world
in violence,</i>

584
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:03,333
<i>hate, and distrust,
turning men against one another.</i>

585
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,208
Sol am damned
as a soldier.

586
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,708
You have a choice,
Martinian.

587
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:10,958
<i>The Lord has given
you a choice;</i>

588
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,833
<i>for God wills that
all men should be saved</i>

589
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:18,625
It's not so easy.

590
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,542
The devil was
in your ranks.

591
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,958
Who was it?

592
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,708
<i>How did it happen?</i>

593
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:30,458
After the washing of
feet, the darkness was revealed to us.

594
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:36,750
<i>I have washed your
feet as an example to you.</i>

595
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:42,958
<i>Now that you know it,
blessed are you if you do it.</i>

596
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,542
<i>A person who has taken a bath
needs only to wash his feet.</i>

597
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,708
<i>His whole body
is clean.</i>

598
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:56,042
You are clean.

599
00:43:56,083 --> 00:44:00,917
But I am not speaking
about all of you.

600
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,333
<i>I know those
who I have chosen,</i>

601
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,417
but all this is to bring about
what the Scripture said.

602
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:15,625
Even my close friend,

603
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:19,917
<i>he who shared my bread,</i>

604
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,125
<i>has lifted up
his heel against me.</i>

605
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,042
What does this
mean, Lord?

606
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:30,875
I am telling you now,
and I tell you the truth.

607
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:38,542
One of you
will betray me.

608
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,167
<i>What is he saying?</i>

609
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,458
<i>That is impossible!</i>

610
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,708
It cannot be!

611
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,000
<i>A traitor amongst us?</i>

612
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,750
Find the traitor! Tell me,
tell me who it is, Lord!

613
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:03,917
One of the twelve,

614
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,792
<i>he who dips his hand
with me in the dish.</i>

615
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:16,542
Here at this table,
sitting among us as a friend,

616
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,625
<i>is a man
who will betray me.</i>

617
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,875
<i>And
as I looked around the table,</i>

618
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:33,208
<i>I saw the weakness
that lies in all men,</i>

619
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,833
even us,
the twelve chosen by God.

620
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:41,750
<i>We were not
above fear.</i>

621
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:45,042
<i>It was the worst
kind of fear:</i>

622
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:51,000
<i>not fear from without,
but fear from within.</i>

623
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:54,375
<i>So one by one,
I looked at them,</i>

624
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,833
<i>and I saw their fear.</i>

625
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,125
<i>No one was
closer to Jesus.</i>

626
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,333
<i>No one stood with cleaner
hands before him;</i>

627
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:11,583
<i>and yet, even he was
vulnerable to sin and fear,</i>

628
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,708
<i>as any of us.</i>

629
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,958
A traitor?

630
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,375
How can that be?

631
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:22,458
I know that I have
no such inclination.

632
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,625
Am I not
above reproach?

633
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,917
I have been promised
a throne in your kingdom.

634
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,500
How could I betray the Master
who's dedicated his life

635
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,292
to love and unselfishness?

636
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:37,042
At times, my temper
has bested me.

637
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,875
James and I would have
called down fire from heaven

638
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,458
to smite the Samaritans,

639
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,792
so enraged were we
at their disrespect.

640
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:51,417
Will my pride
cause me to stumble?

641
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:57,375
My intolerance,
my bigotry?

642
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,625
Is it me, Lord?

643
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:10,167
<i>There was
James, the other son of Zebedee,</i>

644
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:15,083
<i>so ferociously certain
that he could never fail Jesus;</i>

645
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:20,625
<i>now so afraid
that he could.</i>

646
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:22,542
Show me this traitor.

647
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,708
Bring him to me, that I may
lay down mighty judgment

648
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,375
on his head!

649
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:32,958
You can sometimes
be too kind,

650
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,667
too forgiving.

651
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,958
I'm not encumbered
by such.

652
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:44,958
<i>Some even see your mercy
as a sign of weakness.</i>

653
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,458
It cannot be me
you speak of.

654
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:51,625
I'm sure of it.

655
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,917
Am I not one
of the sons of thunder?

656
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,125
Is my father not
an influential man?

657
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,292
I have been promised
a seat at your table,

658
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,083
along with
my brother, too.

659
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,625
<i>How could either
of us betray you?</i>

660
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:11,542
<i>I was there
on the mountain.</i>

661
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:14,042
I saw you transfigured.

662
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:17,167
John and I heard
the very voice of God.

663
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:22,583
Only three of us
can claim that.

664
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:28,500
Oh Lord, will my
righteous fury unbalance me?

665
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:33,500
<i>Will I strike out to hurt,
rather than to heal?</i>

666
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,333
Is it me, Lord?

667
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,708
<i>Thomas,
my friend, must you forever</i>

668
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:49,250
<i>second-guess
yourself and him?</i>

669
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,292
I knew this
would happen.

670
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,583
I saw it from
the first.

671
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,125
I tried to tell them
this would not end well.

672
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:01,750
Now they argue over
the identity of the betrayer.

673
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:06,042
What difference
does it make?

674
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:09,167
Every act has been
carved in stone

675
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,333
long before
we drew first breath.

676
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:18,083
All our efforts
and dreams are nothing.

677
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,000
Where has it
brought us?

678
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:26,458
To the brink of ruin.

679
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:29,833
What if his end
is somehow,

680
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:33,333
someway
a new beginning,

681
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,875
and it's my doubts,
my pessimism that will hinder

682
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:40,208
the coming
of this new world?

683
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:46,000
What if it's the darkness of my
own mind that signals his end?

684
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:51,292
It cannot be.

685
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,833
Is it me, Jesus?

686
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,000
<i>Poor Philip.</i>

687
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:13,083
<i>That was the one time
I couldn't cover him.</i>

688
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:18,042
<i>The fear was his
to face on his own.</i>

689
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:22,708
<i>It's probably me.</i>

690
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,083
I'm sure I will make another
mistake along the way

691
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,833
or ask another
foolish question,

692
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:32,625
and that somehow will
cause all of this to end.

693
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:36,750
Why did Jesus pick me?

694
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,750
Is the Lord allowing me
to be such a misfit,

695
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:42,792
knowing that my foolish ways
will bring upon his demise?

696
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,583
<i>But I can think of no other
reason Jesus would invite me</i>

697
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,833
into his kingdom.

698
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:51,375
I am not worthy of it.

699
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:54,667
Is it me, Lord?

700
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,667
You knew the hearts
of all these men so intimately.

701
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,375
<i>They were my brothers</i>

702
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:06,917
<i>together in our love
of Christ.</i>

703
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
<i>We lived, suffered
through many trials.</i>

704
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:14,792
And what of your
actual brother, Andrew?

705
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,708
His heart I knew
best of all.

706
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:26,542
He loved Jesus,
wanted so badly to please him.

707
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,250
Lord?

708
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:35,958
The traitor
cannot be me.

709
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,208
I am the first.

710
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:45,917
You-you saw me, and you
called to me, didn't you?

711
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:52,875
<i>I saw you, and I knew you
were the Messiah right away.</i>

712
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,792
I brought you
my brother.

713
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,958
Yes, he is talented in
swaying the hearts of men,

714
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:01,667
but I am a firstborn.

715
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:06,292
I am the first chosen.

716
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:10,667
I deserve my place
of honor, don't I?

717
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:20,583
Or am I only to be known for
being Peters older brother,

718
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:27,792
<i>destined to live in the
shadow of one greater than I?</i>

719
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:33,000
Do I have a place in heaven only
because I am Peter's brother?

720
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:39,000
Will I come to resent it and
thereby fall by the wayside?

721
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:44,875
Will that be my
downfall and yours?

722
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:50,542
Is it me, Lord?

723
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:57,333
<i>And what
of you, Simon Peter?</i>

724
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:03,250
Was your mind so full of
dark thoughts and suspicions?

725
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:07,958
<i>More than
I would have imagined.</i>

726
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:14,042
<i>I felt the same fear</i>

727
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:19,125
<i>I did on that hilltop</i>

728
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:23,958
<i>the day I Ô¨Årst saw him.</i>

729
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:28,292
<i>There can't be a traitor.</i>

730
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,917
It's impossible.

731
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,833
I won't believe it.

732
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:40,583
But you say there is,
so it must be true.

733
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:48,458
<i>More than likely,
it's Matthew or Simon.</i>

734
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,167
I should say something.

735
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:57,917
Yes, I will stand
and accuse them both.

736
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,042
What am I saying?

737
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:07,042
Matthew and Simon, they love
you with all of their hearts.

738
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:13,250
<i>Maybe Nathaniel or Philip.</i>

739
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:16,958
Yes, most certainly Philip,
it has to be.

740
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,875
Why didn't! see it before?

741
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:26,000
No, poor simple Philip
has the faith of a child.

742
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:28,875
He would be the
last to betray you.

743
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:32,792
<i>Who then?</i>

744
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,667
Surely not I.

745
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,208
Am I not the rock?

746
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,917
<i>Did I not walk
on the water?</i>

747
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:48,250
And did I not sink
like a rock into the sea

748
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:54,042
when I lost my faith
and became afraid?

749
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,458
What if it is me?

750
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:07,250
Is it me, Lord?

751
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:22,042
Thirty pieces of silver.

752
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,167
Did you know that,
Teacher?

753
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,458
The price of a slave.

754
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,833
That's all they
think you're worth.

755
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,792
I'm afraid.

756
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:40,750
Am I to be the villain only
because I saw through you?

757
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,792
Am I to be punished because
I'm the only one of the twelve

758
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:48,625
who did not
believe your lies?

759
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:54,625
You call yourself
a Savior;

760
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:58,500
then save yourself.

761
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:05,333
If you will not,
nothing will change.

762
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,167
Your life will be meaningless
and your death will be in vain.

763
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:18,500
It appears our Messiah
needs a Messiah.

764
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:23,708
Who will save you,
Jesus?

765
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:27,542
Who can save you?

766
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,958
It was me, Lord.

767
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:09,542
I will not sit for this!

768
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:14,375
<i>The Master accuses
and then says nothing.</i>

769
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:20,417
I will not sit for it.

770
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,375
Lord?

771
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:32,750
Hurry and do
what you must do.

772
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,042
Where is he going?

773
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,500
Teacher,
what is happening?

774
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,417
Is Judas
the betrayer, Lord?

775
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:55,042
Now is the
Son of man glorified.

776
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:01,542
<i>Why did he do it?</i>

777
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,375
What could he gain?

778
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:10,083
Satan the deceive!
had entered into him.

779
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,000
<i>He was promised
great rewards.</i>

780
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:17,583
And did Jesus order
you to go after him?

781
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:21,750
<i>Jesus
forgave Judas his deed.</i>

782
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:23,917
I don't understand
this forgiveness.

783
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,250
If a man plots to betray you,
or strikes you,

784
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:29,083
or steals from you,

785
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:33,417
I mean, how could you
forgive such a man?

786
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,042
Only the
Son of God can.

787
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:41,833
Jesus-

788
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:44,375
he is the way,

789
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,250
the truth,

790
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:49,208
the life.

791
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:55,042
<i>I tell you, do not
resist an evil person.</i>

792
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,833
<i>If someone strikes you
on the right cheek,</i>

793
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:01,417
<i>turn to him the
other cheek, also.</i>

794
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,750
And if someone wants to
sue you and take your shirt,

795
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,208
let him have
your coat, as well.

796
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,500
If someone forces you
to go 1 mile,

797
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,708
go with him 2 mile.

798
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:15,417
Give to the one
who asks you

799
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,958
and do not turn away
from the one

800
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:20,375
who wants to
borrow from you.

801
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:26,625
Again,
I see his wisdom.

802
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:32,792
Are your eyes
beginning to be opened?

803
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:37,625
So what happened
to Judas?

804
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,458
<i>Judas fled.</i>

805
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>Jesus forgave Judas,</i>

806
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,833
<i>but the betrayer
could not forgive himself</i>

807
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:19,042
<i>nor accept Jesus
gift of forgiveness,</i>

808
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:22,833
<i>so he took
his own life.</i>

809
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:25,208
Easy death
for a traitor.

810
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,833
Some have said so.

811
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:30,708
So then after the supper,
then Jesus was captured?

812
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:35,875
Yes, though
the hour was late,

813
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,042
<i>Jesus led us out
into the country</i>

814
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:43,667
<i>to a garden
called Gethsemane.</i>

815
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:51,125
This night,
you will all fall away.

816
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:54,250
My friends,

817
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:59,792
<i>if the world hates you,</i>

818
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:03,833
know that it
hated me first.

819
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:07,042
<i>Remember what
I taught you.</i>

820
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:11,375
No servant is greater
than his master.

821
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:16,250
<i>If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you also.</i>

822
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:22,042
<i>Indeed, the day is coming
when anyone who kills you</i>

823
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:24,417
<i>will think he
is pleasing God.</i>

824
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,917
Lord, there's
danger here.

825
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,167
Let us depart.

826
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:30,167
Listen to my words.

827
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:33,333
The time is coming when
you will weep and lament,

828
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:36,958
<i>but the world will rejoice;
but I promise you,</i>

829
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,625
your sorrow will
turn into joy.

830
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:51,208
My Father,

831
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,792
the time has come.

832
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:58,292
Glorify your Son,

833
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:01,583
so that I may
glorify you.

834
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:10,167
<i>As you sent me
into the world,</i>

835
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,458
so I send these

836
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,792
who you have
given to me,

837
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,375
into the world.

838
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,375
<i>Sit here while
I go and pray.</i>

839
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:25,333
Pete r,

840
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,667
John,

841
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,208
James,

842
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,708
come.

843
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:07,458
Remain here and keep
watch while I pray.

844
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:31,667
What is the purpose
of this night?

845
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,833
<i>The Lord Ô¨Ålls our minds
with moments of death,</i>

846
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:39,542
betrayal, sorrow,
and rejoice.

847
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,083
<i>He bring us here to Gethsemane
in the dark of night to pray?</i>

848
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:48,875
He's going to his Father
to seek his will.

849
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,667
<i>He is sorely troubled</i>

850
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,125
Have we not done enough
to lighten his load?

851
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,750
<i>See how he suffers.</i>

852
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,042
<i>Shall we go to him?</i>

853
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,083
He bid us only
to stay and watch.

854
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,667
Watch for what?

855
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,833
<i>Only us twelve know
about this secret place.</i>

856
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,750
<i>That is
what unsettles me.</i>

857
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:09,208
We are twelve
no longer.

858
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,417
One of us
is a betrayer.

859
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:18,208
Why then would he choose
us three to accompany him?

860
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,750
I feel that I cannot
stay awake.

861
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:29,542
I feel it, too.

862
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:32,458
A warm night
makes me weary.

863
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:34,458
We will watch
in shifts.

864
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,417
Peter, you stay awake
and watch our Lord.

865
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,333
Stay awake with me,
brothers.

866
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,125
<i>What if this is how
the betrayal happens,</i>

867
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:46,000
that we fail our Master's
command and fall asleep?

868
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,750
I'll stay-

869
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,542
I will not
fail you, Lord.

870
01:04:56,583 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>I will stay awake
all night,</i>

871
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,958
keep watch.

872
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,417
What?

873
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:18,292
<i>Could you not
watch with me for 1 hour?</i>

874
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,000
Forgive me, Lord.

875
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,625
<i>I failed you.</i>

876
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:28,083
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.

877
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:32,083
Watch and pray so that you
will not enter into temptation.

878
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,542
Yes.

879
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,458
The betrayal
is at hand!

880
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,750
Brother.

881
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,833
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

882
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,125
<i>Remember what
I taught you.</i>

883
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:46,000
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

884
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,583
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

885
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,500
Who is it
that you seek?

886
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:16,417
Jesus of Nazareth.

887
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,875
I am he.

888
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,833
Lord!

889
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,875
<i>This is a
tale for the ages.</i>

890
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,333
<i>You swear it all
happened as you say?</i>

891
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,917
Every word.

892
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,708
So they took
Lord Jesus-

893
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,125
<i>your Lord Jesus-</i>

894
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,833
and they crucified him?

895
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,458
<i>Tell me of that.</i>

896
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,333
it was-

897
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:26,458
witnessed by many.

898
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,583
<i>Jesus our Lord
was crucified</i>

899
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,750
just as it
was prophesied.

900
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:38,125
<i>He had to die.</i>

901
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,792
I don't understand.

902
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,708
<i>Why did he die?</i>

903
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,833
Why did he not call
his angels to save him,

904
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,208
use his power to come
down from the cross,

905
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,917
anything to avoid the
horror of crucifixion?

906
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,625
<i>A t
last, we come to it.</i>

907
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:54,583
You are clever,
Martinian.

908
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,917
<i>Your thoughts, we!-</i>

909
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,792
Think back to all that
I have told you of Jesus.

910
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:10,667
<i>So Jesus said he
would be gloriÔ¨Åed in death,</i>

911
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:14,333
<i>so he must have planned
on being betrayed.</i>

912
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:20,000
So his death was a sacrifice,
but a sacrifice of what?

913
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:23,000
We were speaking
of sin,

914
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,000
so the sacrifice
was for a sin,

915
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,625
<i>but what sin?</i>

916
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:30,625
<i>He was pure
and had none.</i>

917
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:35,292
So he died for a sin
that was not his own.

918
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,250
<i>Go on.</i>

919
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,000
Since we've sinned,

920
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:49,875
he must have died
for our sins.

921
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:57,417
So when he died,

922
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:01,792
he sacrificed himself
for all our sins.

923
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,917
Martinian,
you do understand.

924
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:07,542
<i>No-</i>

925
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,750
No, I-

926
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:13,667
<i>I don't know</i>

927
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:17,167
I think it was better when
I didn't know any of this.

928
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,500
I don't think
I'm ready.

929
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,125
If I become
a follower of Jesus,

930
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,667
<i>I might be persecuted
and die like you.</i>

931
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:26,583
How are you not
afraid to die?

932
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:29,917
I do not want to die,

933
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,375
<i>burl am not
afraid of death.</i>

934
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,458
This life is temporary.

935
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,583
Just as Christ was raised
from the dead into life,

936
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:45,667
<i>I, and all
who believe in him,</i>

937
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,625
will be raised
from the dead.

938
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:52,833
<i>Don't forget,
I saw the risen Christ.</i>

939
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,125
I know he died.

940
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:57,667
I saw the empty tom b.

941
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:01,125
<i>But more than this,</i>

942
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:05,167
I saw the risen Lord.

943
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,792
I walked with him,

944
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:11,333
and talked with him,

945
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,792
and ate with him.

946
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,667
<i>I must think on this.</i>

947
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:27,500
I must speak
to my wife.

948
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,542
My love,
what news?

949
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:50,792
What?

950
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,500
Have you gone mad?

951
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:54,000
You haven't left
this spot.

952
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,292
You must go home.

953
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,583
You've been here
the entire night!

954
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,667
I wait to hear
Simon Peter's answer.

955
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:01,042
Why did you make me
ask that question?

956
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,417
You are a man grown.

957
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:03,667
You may do
as you wish.

958
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,083
You make threats
I can't ignore.

959
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:11,042
No, I was
as curious as you.

960
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,917
I've gone too far,
and now I am unsure.

961
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,792
Unsure? Of what?

962
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,333
Everything.

963
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:23,333
The gods, the world,
the afterlife, myself.

964
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,292
And I will not endanger you
by accepting this faith.

965
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,583
Martinian-

966
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,417
No, you are
my wife.

967
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,708
I am your husband.

968
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,250
Martinian- It is my
duty to protect you!

969
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:32,542
I am putting
my foot down.

970
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,000
We will hear no more
of these Christians.

971
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,875
My love, I am already
a Christian.

972
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:42,792
H ow?

973
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,667
How did this happen?

974
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:49,833
There was a slave
who told me of Jesus,

975
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:54,125
a girl from the market,

976
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,833
told me
the words of Christ.

977
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:02,292
I met her in secret,
and we talked many times.

978
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:04,333
When she took ill,
I tended her death bed.

979
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,917
My love, she-

980
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,417
she had no fear
of dying.

981
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:17,583
<i>She had a peace
that was indescribable.</i>

982
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:20,542
<i>She was meek,
gentle, kind.</i>

983
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:24,542
<i>She was the least,
and she shall stand Ô¨Årst</i>

984
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:27,833
<i>next to Christ
in heaven.</i>

985
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:31,833
<i>When death took her,
she smiled,</i>

986
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:38,250
<i>as if she could
already see his face.</i>

987
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,458
I have that same
peace, Martinian.

988
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:46,083
If I were to die tomorrow,
I have such rest in my heart.

989
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:51,208
My beloved Martinian, do you
not desire to have that same-

990
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,542
that same rest
in your heart?

991
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:56,125
Call to Jesus
in prayer.

992
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,417
Ask him to
forgive your sins.

993
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:02,917
Ask him to be your Savior
from sin and punishment.

994
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,917
I do not believe
my ears.

995
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,625
I am married
to an outlaw!

996
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:11,708
Do you love me?

997
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:15,583
You know I do
with all my heart.

998
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:20,208
Then you must choose,
for my path is with Christ.

999
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,292
Where does
your path lead?

1000
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,583
I don't know.

1001
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:27,875
You have taken counsel
with Simon Peter himself.

1002
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:31,333
You have heard
the truth from his lips.

1003
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:36,625
What more do you
need to hear?

1004
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,375
Nothing.

1005
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:46,292
I need nothing more.

1006
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:50,792
Do you still
seek his blessing?

1007
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,750
Wait here.

1008
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:04,917
<i>Time's up, Ô¨Åsherman.</i>

1009
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,625
<i>Third day breaks.</i>

1010
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:11,958
<i>You are mine.</i>

1011
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:14,833
I fear no evil.

1012
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:17,958
Christ has victory
over you.

1013
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:26,958
My fate is
sealed by Christ.

1014
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:42,042
I just have one
last question.

1015
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:45,625
<i>Where did you find the strength
to become the man that you are,</i>

1016
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:49,333
from an ordinary fisherman
to a great apostle?

1017
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:53,458
<i>People line up just so that
your shadow might fall on them.</i>

1018
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,625
<i>What caused
this transformation?</i>

1019
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:59,708
It was all God.

1020
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,542
<i>Jesus chose me.</i>

1021
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:06,208
He walked with me
and taught me.

1022
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:12,042
He gave me the
Holy Spirit to guide me,

1023
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:16,875
<i>and God has a plan
for you, too.</i>

1024
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:24,292
The wager is yours,
Simon Peter.

1025
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,083
<i>You have won.</i>

1026
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,000
<i>I have decided.</i>

1027
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,208
I will stand with you
and as Christ is my Lord.

1028
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,875
Now come, I will
take you out of here

1029
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:35,833
before the shift changes.

1030
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:39,708
Jesus Christ
welcomes you

1031
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:44,125
with honor and love,
Martinian,

1032
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,667
but I cannot
go with you.

1033
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:49,083
<i>That would only
endanger you.</i>

1034
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,500
I will die.

1035
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:51,792
Oh, cursed on that.

1036
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:54,083
I thought you
would say that.

1037
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,583
Hold on.

1038
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,000
What have you done?

1039
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,250
You would not
come to her.

1040
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:18,125
What else
was I to do?

1041
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,583
This is dangerous.

1042
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,792
<i>Simon Peter,
apostle of Christ,</i>

1043
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:28,625
I beg you,
give me your blessing.

1044
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:35,708
<i>Novella, is your
life given over to Jesus?</i>

1045
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:40,583
<i>Do you claim him to be
your Lord and salvation?</i>

1046
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,542
<i>Yes.</i>

1047
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:47,042
Then you shall
be blessed as you desire.

1048
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:51,333
<i>Accept this blessing in the
glorious name of the Father,</i>

1049
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,167
His Son Jesus Christ,

1050
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,458
and the Holy-

1051
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:59,292
<i>Processus.</i>

1052
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,500
<i>Processus,
what are you doing?</i>

1053
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:02,750
Do you like
persecution so much

1054
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,333
that you want
to partake of it?

1055
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,250
You heard his words,
as well as I.

1056
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:10,250
Did you not hear
the truth in them?

1057
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,750
They were just stories.

1058
01:18:12,792 --> 01:18:15,375
What of Christ,
the man himself?

1059
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,875
His words, his followers are
spreading across the land,

1060
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,625
fulfilling prophecies,
performing miracles,

1061
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:21,750
risen from the dead,
that is no story!

1062
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,500
He was a rebel,
and his followers are outlaws!

1063
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,083
That is what
the emperor says.

1064
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,750
What do you think?

1065
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,667
Am I an outlaw?
My wife?

1066
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,000
Would you see us
tortured and killed?

1067
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:32,583
<i>You're asking
me to disobey my command!</i>

1068
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,750
I'm asking you
to think for your soul,

1069
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,208
the part of you that
will live forever.

1070
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:37,500
Stop confusing me!

1071
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,583
Let go of your anger,
your distrust.

1072
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:42,000
How dare you
talk down to me.

1073
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:43,292
I am arresting you!

1074
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,833
Let him into
your heart.

1075
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,125
Shut your mouth!

1076
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,417
Save yourself!

1077
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,708
I said shut up!

1078
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,250
Martinian!

1079
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:56,625
Strike me
all you want.

1080
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,167
I am your friend
and I love you.

1081
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,208
Christ our Lord
loves you.

1082
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:24,375
Come Process us.

1083
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:30,792
Receive Jesus as your Savior
and be free of all your sins.

1084
01:19:54,708 --> 01:20:01,250
God the Father,
you have given us salvation.

1085
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:06,083
Touch these hearts,
as today they recognize

1086
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,167
their need for you,

1087
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:13,458
<i>and they wish to accept
Jesus as Lord.</i>

1088
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,250
Processus,

1089
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:17,667
<i>Martinfan,</i>

1090
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,375
<i>pray with me.</i>

1091
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:25,208
<i>"Lord, I accept
Jesus as my Savior,</i>

1092
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:31,167
<i>and I thank you
for the forgiveness of sin. "</i>

1093
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:35,958
<i>Lord,
I accept Jesus as my Savior,</i>

1094
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:39,458
<i>and I thank you
for the forgiveness of sin.</i>

1095
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,000
<i>Amen.</i>

1096
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,500
Amen.

1097
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:49,583
Amen.

1098
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:55,500
Novella, you seek
the blessing of Christ.

1099
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,625
May I ask?

1100
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:06,917
We are without child.

1101
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,500
"I will withhold no good
thing from those who love me,

1102
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:16,500
says the Lord.

1103
01:21:16,542 --> 01:21:19,083
Go in peace.

1104
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,375
<i>Thank you.</i>

1105
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:39,458
<i>How many times
have I told the guards?</i>

1106
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:43,000
<i>Political prisoners on the left,
religious fanatics on the right.</i>

1107
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:46,042
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?

1108
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:49,167
You two,
where's your prisoner?

1109
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:52,000
It is past dawn,
you great louts.

1110
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:53,583
He is to be crucified.

1111
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,875
Bind him and take him.

1112
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,250
We need the cell for another.
Who is it?

1113
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:00,667
Sir, another
Christian, Saul of Tarsus.

1114
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:01,917
They're crawling
out of the walls,

1115
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:05,458
these Christians!

1116
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:20,708
This is gonna be the hardest
thing I've ever done.

1117
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,875
Is it time?

1118
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,750
It's time,
Simon Peter.

1119
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,542
The cell is required
for another Christian prisoner,

1120
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:50,750
a certain
Saul of Tars us.

1121
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:54,542
Paul, my old friend.

1122
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,500
Teacher,
I cannot do this.

1123
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:01,792
I cannot do this.

1124
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,083
For all that you've done for
the sake of Christ our Lord,

1125
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:05,833
let us escort you
to safety.

1126
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:07,583
<i>My dear Maninian,</i>

1127
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:11,583
that is exactly
where I'm going.

1128
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,458
<i>What! told you
in the darkness,</i>

1129
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,458
speak in the light.

1130
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,667
What I whispered
in your ear,

1131
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:27,500
proclaim from
the rooftops.

1132
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,375
We must go.

1133
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,875
Then take me to Jesus

1134
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:43,792
<i>and be quick about it.</i>

1135
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:48,083
I can't bear to be away
from him a moment longer.

1136
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:05,042
<i>Peace, I leave you.</i>

1137
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,875
<i>My peace I give you;</i>

1138
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,458
<i>not as the world
gives peace,</i>

1139
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:15,125
<i>for in this world
you will have many troubles.</i>

1140
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,333
<i>But take heart,</i>

1141
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:21,125
<i>for! have
overcome this world.</i>

1142
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:24,583
<i>I am the way.</i>

1143
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:27,333
<i>I am the truth.</i>

1144
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:31,667
<i>I am the life.</i>

1145
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:37,125
<i>No one comes to the Father,
except through me.</i>

1146
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,542
<i>Everyone who asks
will receive.</i>

1147
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,083
<i>He who seeks will Ô¨Ånd,</i>

1148
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:47,167
<i>and to him who knocks
the door will be opened.</i>

1149
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,458
Do not let your hearts
be troubled.

1150
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,958
Do not be afraid.

1151
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,500
Remain in my love.

1152
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:04,250
Again I say,
remain in my love;

1153
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:11,333
and surely,
I am with you always

1154
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:15,208
to the very end
of the age.
