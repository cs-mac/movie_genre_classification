1
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:06,578
The princess nodded,
and the frog said,

2
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:11,124
"That which you have promised,
you must perform."

3
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,587
Very good.
Keep reading.

4
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:19,840
"So the princess leaned in
and kissed the frog,

5
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:25,095
"but as she did, he became
a handsome prince,

6
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,263
"and they rode off to his kingdom,

7
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,101
where they lived
happily ever after."

8
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,729
Happily ever after.

9
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:38,565
There's no such thing
as "happily ever after."

10
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,278
Not for a real princess.

11
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:47,073
The prince my father wants me
to marry will always be a frog.

12
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:50,451
My offer still stands.
I will help you get to America.

13
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,954
- America?
- That's very kind.

14
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,081
But we're running out of time.

15
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:58,584
I know of a ship bound for America,
but we must leave tonight.

16
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,586
- Leave tonight?
- We must hurry, Princess.

17
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,013
Hurry, Princess.

18
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,820
Mung Goo Hi.

19
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:17,656
Zhou Hei.

20
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,850
Chow Lu.

21
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,534
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

22
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,786
Okay. Great.
Great. Okay.

23
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:57,581
Come here. Look at this.
Spent a lot of time on this.

24
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,958
Now, pay attention,
'cause I don't want any mistakes.

25
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,460
Now, I've calculated the speed of
the train and the speed of our horses.

26
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:04,796
We meet at this vector.
The only variable is the wind.

27
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:08,132
- Technically, if you travel over here
on the horses... - Is this the train?

28
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:24,522
All right. We're just gonna wing it...
like we always do.

29
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,566
Ride down, jump on the train,

30
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,485
hoorah the money, head back
to the cathouse, all right?

31
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,155
Let's go. Come on. Move out. Go!

32
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,158
You okay? Nervous? It's all right
to be nervous when you're new.

33
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,618
You'll be okay.
I'll keep an eye on you.

34
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,663
All you gotta do is follow my lead.
All right, look alive, outlaws!

35
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:52,005
"So the princess leaned in
and kissed the frog,

36
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:56,176
"but as she did,
he became a handsome prince,

37
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,845
"and they rode off
to his kingdom,

38
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,974
where they lived
happily ever after."

39
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,652
Reach for the sky,
ladies and gentlemen!

40
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,363
Touch that gun and I'll
blow your goddam head off!

41
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:21,491
What are you doin'? I sorta like
to be the only guy that talks, Wallace.

42
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:23,826
- All right. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay. Good.

43
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,370
Don't worry. Come on, come on.
Big 'Un, let's go.

44
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,706
Why is the new guy talking?
Where did you get this guy?

45
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,875
You know I'm the only one who talks.
Okay, everybody keep calm.

46
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,211
You think you're gonna shoot me?
Is that right?

47
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,880
What you got right in here?
Yeah, you got this gun?

48
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,007
You think you're gonna
do something with that gun?

49
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,467
Come on, Lady Bird.
You got anything in here besides yarn?

50
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,971
- You got it out for me!
- Hey!

51
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,515
No.

52
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,892
Come here. Come here.
We don't steal from women.

53
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,853
Get over here.
Take that side.

54
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:56,064
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

55
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:59,484
I'm so sorry about that.
I apologize.

56
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,487
First time you've
seen an outlaw?

57
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,157
Scared?
Kind of excited too?

58
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,826
All mixed up?
Yeah.

59
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:14,039
Last train we robbed, we were naked,
it was so hot out.

60
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,207
Yeah, it was somethin'.

61
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,712
Yeah, it's got
my initials right there.

62
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:25,174
What are you lookin' at?

63
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:30,095
Wait! Stop!
Where did you get this guy?

64
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,265
- Texas.
- Texas? Are you insane?

65
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,684
Just shoot me now, 'cause I don't
understand what we're doing here.

66
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,604
Sir... Come here, come here,
come here. Sit down.

67
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:43,155
- Excuse me. Where is water?
- Sir, sit down.

68
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:53,950
- What happened? Wallace, what
are you doing? - I'm just wingin' it.

69
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,786
No! That's not
how we wing it!

70
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,580
No more winging it!
Stop! Come on, Big 'Un.

71
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:02,541
- You've lost your "winging it" privileges.
- Damn.

72
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,043
Damn!

73
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:38,032
Uncle, are you alright?
Uncle?

74
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,594
He's dead

75
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:46,707
Who killed my uncle?
Who did this?

76
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,695
Give me the dynamite.
Give me the dynamite.

77
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,198
No, no, no, no. You stay here.
You don't get to come.

78
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:26,076
- Keep an eye on Wing Nut.
- Hey, Blue, looky here!

79
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,089
Okay.

80
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:47,888
- Who killed my uncle?
- What the hell is this, the Orient Express?

81
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:51,891
- Get him!
- Come here!

82
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,687
Wh- Hey!
The safe's getting ready to blow!

83
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:45,357
Get ready to reap
the fruits of our labour.

84
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,804
Move it! Let's go!

85
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,599
Roy, you just blew
the shit out of our fruits.

86
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,615
Shit.

87
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,657
We got a Chinaman to catch.

88
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,705
Stop! Stop!

89
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:53,086
Stop! Stop!
Turn around!

90
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:56,088
Turn around!

91
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:01,385
What the-

92
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:05,514
- Who are you?
- Hey, Roy!

93
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,683
Don't you worry about a thing!
I got you covered!

94
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:10,810
No!

95
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,829
No!

96
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,946
Roll, baby, roll!

97
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,350
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!
It's my gang now!

98
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,999
I don't understand.

99
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:23,877
You said your friend
had a large estate.

100
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:26,087
He does.

101
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:29,215
- What exactly does he do?
- Well, you could say...

102
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,426
he's a philanthropist.

103
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:35,012
He helps Chinese immigrants
get back on their feet.

104
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,050
Welcome to America,
Princess.

105
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,553
Lo Fong.

106
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,306
Forgive me if I do not bow.

107
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:26,976
Calvin, this man is a trai-

108
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,145
Traitor.

109
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,857
Why? Because he ran away
from the Forbidden City?

110
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:45,660
Your reward is on the table,
Mr Andrews.

111
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:02,384
Well, now you're gonna have to
double it, or I'm gonna kill her.

112
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,182
One thing about the Chinese,
Mr Andrews-

113
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:16,281
We do not renegotiate.

114
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:34,204
Whatever you think
I'm going to do for you,

115
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,125
you're wrong.

116
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:42,045
It was just like a nightmare.

117
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,631
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

118
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:50,303
My gang left me in the desert. I felt like
all the other cowboys hated my guts.

119
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,806
Everyone was- I just missed you.
I missed all of you.

120
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,558
We missed you too, Roy.

121
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,935
I think it's medication time.

122
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:05,275
Come here, devil woman.

123
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:11,572
That's naughty.

124
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:14,908
Careful. Careful with that.

125
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,069
Careful.

126
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:30,172
Holy crap! The vultures are
eating my head!

127
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:36,595
Help! Help!
My gang buried me!

128
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,431
They left me for dead!

129
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,770
Thank heavens.
I thought you were a mirage.

130
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:49,357
- Come on. Water.
- You.

131
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,946
- You killed my uncle!
- Bull!

132
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,281
That was Wallace
all the way.

133
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:01,951
- He was one of your bandits.
- He wasn't part of my gang.

134
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,788
He was a new guy.
He's crazy as a road lizard.

135
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:09,625
- You deserve to die.
- Hold on a second.

136
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,127
You know what
no one's saying here?

137
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,380
I had a chance to kill you
on that train, and I chose not to.

138
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:18,300
'Cause I'm not a barbarian.

139
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,886
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Carson City.

140
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:26,766
I'm closer to diggin' myself to China
than you are to gettin' to Carson City.

141
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:28,809
- Hey!
- Which way?

142
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,187
Hey, that's better.
Dig me out and I'll show you.

143
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,442
Which way?

144
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,782
You see the...
mountains over there?

145
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:49,828
Carson City
is on the other side.

146
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:53,707
All right, dig me out.
I kept my end of the bargain.

147
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,869
Dig me out.

148
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:01,172
Dig.

149
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:06,135
Hey! Hey!

150
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,513
- Come on!
- Don't talk. Just dig.

151
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:10,019
Run! Hurry!

152
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:27,817
Where is Carson City?

153
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:51,814
Good morning everyone.

154
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:11,092
- How.
- How.

155
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,345
- How.
- How.

156
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,640
- How. How...
- How.

157
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:50,619
No way... me and her...

158
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,396
I thought you might be hungry.

159
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,190
Please eat.

160
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,613
- You were wrong.
- You would find me a much better host...

161
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,741
if we could come to
some sort of an arrangement.

162
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,121
An arrangement?

163
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,457
Like the one you have with the slaves
working on this railroad?

164
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:22,503
These people are free to leave.

165
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:26,132
What do you want with me?

166
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:31,887
Once I have the emperor's gold,
my work will be complete.

167
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,810
Princess.

168
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:44,107
I think it is time for you
to be among your people.

169
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,825
They don't look like any injuns
I ever seen, Jedediah.

170
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,203
That's because they're not
injuns, woman! They're Jews!

171
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,240
You, stay.

172
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,102
You guys, get a load of this.

173
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,491
How.

174
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,086
Is this Carson City?

175
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,257
No, this ain't Carson City, Chief.

176
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:31,927
You're gonna have to get
your firewater somewhere else.

177
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:17,802
All right, Roy, ante up.

178
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:33,033
And stay out!

179
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,496
You bounce back fast, kimosabe.

180
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,634
What are you doin' here? I thought
you were going to Carson City.

181
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,970
You! You gave me bad directions!

182
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:08,223
No, I gave you wrong directions.

183
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:12,060
You want your toothpicks back?

184
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:15,480
- You got a lot of nerve, comin' in here
with that... - Give it back to me!

185
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,456
Ain't that somethin'?

186
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:34,580
Take your hand off me.

187
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:48,093
Hey, I just want to go
to Carson City!

188
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,585
You're goin' for a ride!

189
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,953
No!

190
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,962
Yes! Yeah!

191
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,842
Yes! Yes!

192
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,427
No! No!

193
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,638
Sorry!
I'm sorry!

194
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,023
You!

195
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:46,493
- Who in the hell started this?
- The Chinaman.

196
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:51,205
Let me out of here!

197
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,000
Let me out!
Give me the book back!

198
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,044
I have to go to Carson City
to rescue the princess!

199
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,130
- You've got the wrong person!
I don't belong here!

200
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,441
Hey!
Let me out!

201
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,385
Keep goin' with the Chinese. That's
workin'. They're about to let you out.

202
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,389
-Give me the book back! -For cryin' out loud,
just give him the book back, please.

203
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,682
- If it'll give us some peace and quiet-
Forget about it. - Open it up!

204
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,852
- They're not givin' you the book back. Drop
the book. - I wasted enough time with you.

205
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,397
- What? You've wasted enough time with me?
What about me? - Give me the book!

206
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,649
- Listen for a second. Stop!
- Give me the book! Hey!

207
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:24,152
Listen! Stop!
You're not in the East, okay?

208
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:28,072
You're not in China. This is the West.
The sun doesn't rise here, it sets here,

209
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:32,034
and you're closer to getting us hung than
you are getting that book back, okay?

210
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:37,414
Now, just-
I like that.

211
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:39,666
That's what I'm talking about.
You're wound so tight.

212
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,544
You're the most irritable guy I've ever
been around. Just relax for a second.

213
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:45,588
Take 10 minutes, and then you can
go back to screaming, I promise.

214
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:48,841
I'll join you.
Okay, just relax for a second.

215
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,220
Come on, sit down.

216
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:57,683
Come on.

217
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,939
Just relax.

218
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:07,692
Is that relaxed?

219
00:40:07,817 --> 00:40:11,362
You look sort of
rigid there.

220
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:13,614
You know what?
We got off on the wrong foot.

221
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:17,034
Let's try to start again.

222
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,786
Man, you sure can fight.

223
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:22,080
I've never seen anything like that.

224
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:25,291
It was-

225
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:28,544
I'm trying to give you
a compliment.

226
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,714
You're not still mad about me pointin'
you in the wrong direction, are you?

227
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,301
Come on. You gotta be able
to laugh at stuff like that.

228
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:38,971
Like me in the desert. I don't
hold any grudges. I laugh about it.

229
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:42,307
I'm not angry at you. You just
left me there with chopsticks to die.

230
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:46,728
Roy, all by his lonesome. Just me
and the buzzards pickin' at my head.

231
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:52,566
You're a very silent man,
aren't you?

232
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,818
You weren't expecting to see
old Roy in that bar, were you?

233
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:56,745
Be honest. Were you?

234
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:02,993
Did you really
use those chopsticks?

235
00:41:03,118 --> 00:41:06,371
You better believe it.

236
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:09,665
Now you laugh. That's funny.
I gotta remember that one.

237
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:15,254
- So, who are you?
- I'm Imperial Guard to the Emperor of China.

238
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:17,798
China.

239
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:22,302
- What's with the book?
- The book belongs to Princess Pei Pei.

240
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,179
- Who?
- Princess Pei Pei.

241
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:26,806
She was kidnapped
from the Forbidden City.

242
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:30,184
Forbidden City?
I like that, the Forbidden City.

243
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:35,147
A princess kidnapped.
It's so mysterious. Go ahead.

244
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:37,482
The emperor sent us
to get her back.

245
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:39,818
Us? You mean your friends
from the train?

246
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:44,989
They are also Imperial Guards. They have
4 days to bring the gold to Carson City.

247
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:47,950
- What gold?
- The gold for the princess.

248
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:52,955
The gold-
Was the gold on the train?

249
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,790
Yes.

250
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:02,213
How much gold?

251
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:05,800
100,000 pieces.

252
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:10,054
Sir? Sir?
Could you hand us that book, please?

253
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,389
Sir, there's been
a mistake. He has-

254
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:14,850
Sir- Yeah.

255
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:28,237
We're gonna get that book,
and we're gonna get you out of here.

256
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:31,157
- You help me escape?
- Yes.

257
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,243
- Why?
- Why? I'm gonna tell you why.

258
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:36,870
Because there are some things
in this world that are just wrong,

259
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:39,915
and stealing a princess
is one of them.

260
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,167
Yeah.
That's wrong.

261
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,378
I'll tell you another thing. I feel guilty
about leading you up that mountain.

262
00:42:45,503 --> 00:42:47,672
What was I thinking?
How much time did we waste there?

263
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:50,508
That was stupid.
It wasn't funny. All right?

264
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,885
Now, sit tight and let me
figure this out.

265
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,430
All right,
come on, Roy.

266
00:42:56,555 --> 00:43:00,558
Maybe- Maybe I pretend to be sick, then
attack the guards when they come in.

267
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:02,852
Okay, you mean
the sick prisoner routine?

268
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:05,229
Yeah. Does that still
work in China?

269
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:07,315
'Cause here it's sorta
been done to death.

270
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,569
- I have another idea.
- No, no...

271
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:15,947
Here's how you help me. You stay on your
side of the room, let me figure it out over here.

272
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:18,241
Okay, you play over there.

273
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:24,539
Think. Think.
What do we got here? Yeah.

274
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:26,457
Okay.

275
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:30,252
We got wood. We got a wall
made out of wood.

276
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:32,421
That's good.
We got pillows.

277
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:38,551
We got pillows, sheets.
We got the sheets and the mattress.

278
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:42,221
Okay, let's put it all together.
Let's think. Add it up, add it up.

279
00:43:42,347 --> 00:43:45,266
What do we got?
What do we got?

280
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,770
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

281
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,480
What are you doing?

282
00:43:52,106 --> 00:43:55,317
- Hold this for me.
- No. That's your shirt. You hold it.

283
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,492
I like your energy,
but I'm not with you.

284
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:08,245
- When the shirt gets wet, it doesn't break.
- I don't know what that means.

285
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,622
And then-

286
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:17,462
Okay. And then what-
Then with the wet shirt, you-

287
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:20,840
You bend the bars.
That's the pay-off.

288
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:22,967
Don't waste my time
with stuff like that, okay?

289
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:25,594
A 2,000-year-old civilization,
that's all you can come up with?

290
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,097
Shame on you.
Shame on you.

291
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:40,108
Come on. Stop, please.
It's embarrassing.

292
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:54,663
- See? I told you so.
- No, you said, "Wet shirt don't break,"

293
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:56,790
not "Piss shirt
bend bar."

294
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,543
- Twist it.
- Help.

295
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:03,129
Okay, there.
Get it. There you go.

296
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:07,216
Just one more.
Yeah.

297
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:09,676
You're as strong as an ox!
Go! You can do it!

298
00:45:12,763 --> 00:45:15,140
There, you got it!
We're gettin' it!

299
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:18,852
- Hold it for me. I'll get through.
- Okay.

300
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:21,354
No, no, no. You hold it
and I'll go through.

301
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:31,029
No! Not your hand! Stop.

302
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,199
- Hold it.
- Adios, sucker.

303
00:45:34,324 --> 00:45:37,577
- What?
- I'm just kidding. Come on. Go.

304
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,746
I wouldn't leave
my old pal there.

305
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,123
Go.
Really squeeze.

306
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,710
No, no, no, no.
Grab this, grab that.

307
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:50,881
Work your magic
right here.

308
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,344
-Too dry.
-What? Juice it up. Juice it up. Go.

309
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,347
I can't!
No more!

310
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,557
Damn it.

311
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:04,977
Come on out, little Roy.
Work your magic.

312
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:14,110
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

313
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:16,988
- Stop! Don't look at me.
- Relax!

314
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:20,867
- Relax. It'll come.
- Thanks.

315
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:23,869
- That helps. Yeah. Good.
- Is that called relax?

316
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:53,146
Sheriff! Thank God you're here.
Get the guns!

317
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,074
- Get my book!
- I got it!

318
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,827
Who's the pretty lady?

319
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,496
- That's my wife.
- How long you been in this country?

320
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:13,998
- 4 days.
- Nice work.

321
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,503
Hello.

322
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,089
Come on.
Let's adios, partner.

323
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,174
Hyah!

324
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,181
Well, best of luck to you.

325
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:35,643
Guess this is what
your people call sayonara.

326
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:38,646
Looks like Fido's giving you
some problems there.

327
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,773
You want me to... give you a hand?

328
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:43,817
- No, I can do it.
- Sure, you can.

329
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:46,528
How is a greenhorn like you
gonna make it to Carson City...

330
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:49,364
and rescue this princess?

331
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:52,367
Stop, stop...

332
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:58,039
I can't take it any more.
Watch me do it.

333
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:03,043
Get it like this
and you put it up high.

334
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:08,340
See? It'll drift back
when you're riding.

335
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:16,013
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

336
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:18,391
Take you to Carson City,
help you rescue Princess "Pee Pee."

337
00:48:18,516 --> 00:48:21,227
Pei Pei. You do not
care about the princess.

338
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:23,687
You don't know me
very well, do you?

339
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,817
Tell you one thing- I'd hate
to think of an innocent member...

340
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:30,902
of Chinese nobility
suffering.

341
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:33,780
Tell you that.

342
00:48:35,448 --> 00:48:38,826
You people believe in karma
over there, right?

343
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:44,248
Well, I've been thinking. There must be a
reason why we keep running into each other.

344
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:48,084
I've ridden with some terrible men-
just people I couldn't trust.

345
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,545
But when I
look at you,

346
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,091
there's something different
about you, and I can see it.

347
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:57,760
I can see it
in your eyes.

348
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,097
It's what the Indians
call Chippichawa.

349
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:05,559
- What's that?
- Chippichawa is nobility.

350
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:08,687
And you have it
in spades.

351
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:14,692
You've got yourself a partner.
This has nothing to do with gold, okay?

352
00:49:15,817 --> 00:49:17,445
Shake on it.

353
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,197
Why you spitting
in your hand?

354
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:22,366
Well, it's customary,
to seal the deal.

355
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:24,560
Come on. Let's go.

356
00:49:31,249 --> 00:49:33,292
This is gonna be
a long journey.

357
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:41,175
You boys take care now, you hear?
Shalom.

358
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:49,265
- Shalom.
- Let's go.

359
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:55,354
Yee-haw!
Goddam!

360
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:57,732
Looks like y'all had a twister
touch down in here.

361
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:02,653
- Roy O'Bannon and his partner come
through town. - Roy O'Bannon?

362
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:06,490
Roy O'Bannon ain't got no partner,
friend. Roy O'Bannon is dead.

363
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:12,161
He ain't dead. He busted out of jail
last night with the Shanghai Kid.

364
00:50:12,286 --> 00:50:15,248
Shanghai Kid?
Roy got a new gang goin'?

365
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:19,001
That son of a bitch.
That 2-timin' son of a bitch!

366
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,962
He double-crossed us with that Chinaman
from the damn train!

367
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:25,674
Just like that.
See, at kind of a rakish angle.

368
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:29,844
- Yeah, yeah.
- How do I look?

369
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:33,514
I think you look great.
I think you look like a real cowboy.

370
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:36,475
Very dapper,
red bandanna.

371
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,186
Roy O'Bannon.

372
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:42,189
- My name is Chon Wang.
-John Wayne?

373
00:50:42,314 --> 00:50:43,675
Chon Wang.

374
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,610
- That's a terrible cowboy name.
- Why?

375
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:49,946
No, come on, that's not gonna work.
That's horrible.

376
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:54,116
- That's so bad. And so's the ponytail.
- No!

377
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:00,706
It doesn't look
that bad, actually.

378
00:51:02,165 --> 00:51:04,543
Never touch my queue.

379
00:51:04,668 --> 00:51:06,545
That killed!

380
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,839
- We have to go to Carson City.
- Okay.

381
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:13,217
Now, before we go to Carson City, I
want to teach you some stuff. Come on.

382
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,180
You just follow me.

383
00:51:18,305 --> 00:51:21,058
- What's that?
- Sensitivity. Increased reflexes.

384
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:24,060
Now, these are guns. These can be
your best friend or worst enemy.

385
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:26,521
That's a spin in my left hand.
That's a spin in my right hand.

386
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:28,898
That's 2 spins. Now, here,
I'm gonna let you hang onto this.

387
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:32,193
See? Be careful.
Always be ready.

388
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:34,653
Now, try to exhale
for long-range shots,

389
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:36,739
inhale for short-range.

390
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:38,699
All right, now cover up your ears,
'cause this could be loud.

391
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:40,784
Cover up your ears.

392
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,549
I am like a wild horse.
You can't tame me.

393
00:51:57,675 --> 00:52:01,011
You put the oats in the pen, though,
and I'll come in for a nibble every day.

394
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:10,311
But if you ever shut that gate, I'll jump
the fence. You'll never see me again.

395
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,619
Thing about your husband--
and this is nothing against him,

396
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,704
because I really
like him-

397
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:32,123
he comes from a very
male-dominated society.

398
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:36,126
<i>* Because I wanna be a cowboy, baby</i>

399
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:39,546
<i>* With the top down
and the sunshine shinin'</i>

400
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:42,215
<i>* Cowboy, baby</i>

401
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,637
<i>* West coast chillin' with the Boon's wine
Gonna be a cowboy, baby</i>

402
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,723
<i>* Ridin' at night
'cause I sleep all day</i>

403
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:53,350
<i>* Cowboy, baby</i>

404
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:56,770
<i>* I can smell a pig
from a mile away</i>

405
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,816
Let me put it this way--

406
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:04,402
my horse is definitely
not my best friend.

407
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:08,114
<i>* That's why they call me
a cowboy, baby</i>

408
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,618
<i>* With the top down and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby</i>

409
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:21,001
Now, people start
looking at you funny,

410
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:23,253
all you gotta say is,
"Howdy, partner."

411
00:53:23,378 --> 00:53:25,838
- Howdy, partner? - Faster than that or
people will think you're slow in the head.

412
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:28,132
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

413
00:53:28,257 --> 00:53:31,594
-Just follow my lead. Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

414
00:53:34,054 --> 00:53:37,182
- Howdy, partner.
-Just park it right there.

415
00:53:38,475 --> 00:53:40,519
It's not working.

416
00:53:40,644 --> 00:53:45,315
Some people aren't as tolerant as I am.
Not very friendly today.

417
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:51,695
John, what are you--

418
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:55,115
-John--
- Hurt.

419
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,951
Okay. We gotta
work on that.

420
00:53:59,327 --> 00:54:01,371
Here you go,John.
Straighten up here.

421
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:03,498
- Roy, it hurts so bad.
- I know, John,

422
00:54:03,623 --> 00:54:06,125
but I'm not gonna walk with you
if you walk like that.

423
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,544
I'll be okay.

424
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:16,551
- Hey, Roy. It's you.
- Holy shit!

425
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:18,678
I'm a wanted man.
Look at this!

426
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:20,722
- 500 bucks! That's a lot of money.
- Let me see.

427
00:54:20,847 --> 00:54:23,975
- Nice picture.
- Careful, careful.

428
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,310
Look at this.
Do you know what this means?

429
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,562
- This will drive the girls crazy.
- Really?

430
00:54:28,688 --> 00:54:31,565
Yes, really. Come on, let's get
a couple more of these.

431
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,734
- It's not bad.
- I'm wanted too!

432
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:37,320
- What?
- This.

433
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:39,739
Come on.
That's not right.

434
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:41,908
I know. I'm not from Shanghai.

435
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,035
No!
$ 1,000 for a sidekick?

436
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,746
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Be careful.

437
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:50,666
Justice system's all screwed up.

438
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:55,045
Man can't even ride a horse, and that's
a really cool nickname- Shanghai Kid.

439
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,255
It's like, got
a snap to it that-

440
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:03,303
Trouble. John, come here.
Get over here.

441
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:07,306
Tie 'em up
over here, fellas.

442
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:13,938
What's going on?

443
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,567
Howdy, partner.

444
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:25,573
My God, it's a posse.
They can't be looking for us.

445
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:29,201
- What's "posse"?
- I think they're passing us by.

446
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:34,498
It looked like Marshal Nathan
Van Cleef, the psychotic killer.

447
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:43,089
Roy O'Bannon!
This is Marshal Nathan Van Cleef.

448
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:45,633
We know you're hidin' in there.

449
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:48,135
God, it is him.
It is him.

450
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,973
Why don't you throw down your 6-shooters
and come out with your hands up.

451
00:55:53,098 --> 00:55:55,892
And that goes for the scum
you're ridin' with too.

452
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:59,312
- He won.
- Roy, Roy, it's okay.

453
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:02,315
No, it's not okay!
Stop! You don't know this guy!

454
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,319
Let me talk to them.
Remember, we have to save the princess.

455
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,696
What are you doin'?
St-

456
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:15,285
- Go easy, fellas.
- Why are they shooting at me?

457
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,954
What happened to "Mr Shanghai Kid"?
"Oh, I'm a wanted man"?

458
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,998
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an outlaw.

459
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:22,917
- I am not an outlaw!
- Stop! You're a bad guy!

460
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:27,171
- Look at that poster. What does that say?
- Drives girls crazy.

461
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:29,506
Drives girls crazy?
Drives the posse crazy.

462
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:32,593
Makes them want to hang you,
string you up, because you're a bad guy.

463
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:40,016
- You got 20 seconds-
- God! Give us a minute!

464
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:44,562
Go around back, gentlemen. Make sure he
isn't trying to pull the saddle over our eyes.

465
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:50,275
Remember, I want
the Chinaman alive.

466
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:53,820
I'm not a bad guy.

467
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:56,239
You're a bad guy.
You're with me, you're a bad guy.

468
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:02,161
Hey, you put me
in this situation!

469
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:05,206
- I'm the good guy, you're the bad guy!
- No! We're both bad guys!

470
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:07,750
- No, only you're the bad guy!
You go out there and tell them! - No!

471
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:11,003
- I'm not going out there! You go
out there! - No, you have to go!

472
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,258
- Did I just do that?
- Not bad.

473
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:21,596
I don't know karate,
but I know "karazy," and I will use it.

474
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,060
What the hell
is going on in there?

475
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,948
You okay?

476
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,950
You just threw me
through a window.

477
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,369
You got that gold?

478
00:57:47,494 --> 00:57:50,622
What? Gold?
What gold?

479
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,707
Wrong answer.

480
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:57,629
Wait. I'm-
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed!

481
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,089
No gun. Hold on, no gun.
I don't--

482
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:02,216
I'm unarmed!
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

483
00:58:02,341 --> 00:58:05,719
- Don't worry. I help you.
- No, John. No, no.

484
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:08,097
John!
John-

485
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:12,142
Fight with honour.
You will win.

486
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:15,729
Are you frickin' insane? Is that what
they teach you in Imperial Guard School?

487
00:58:15,854 --> 00:58:19,107
- What-
- Pick 'em up.

488
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:29,408
Well.

489
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:32,452
If it ain't
the Shanghai Kid.

490
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:38,124
How about we make
the Kid dance?

491
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:41,836
Come on!
You can do better than that.

492
00:58:46,382 --> 00:58:48,634
You robbed
the wrong train, son.

493
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:00,144
- Look, Marshal, I think that if-
-Just shut up and put on your guns.

494
00:59:07,985 --> 00:59:10,946
This is serious,
you know?

495
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:13,031
We don't come back
from this.

496
00:59:13,156 --> 00:59:15,617
That's the general idea.

497
01:00:30,644 --> 01:00:32,651
What the hell you doin'?

498
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,193
Stop procrastinating.
Come on. Hurry up, son.

499
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:43,113
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
cheapen it. All right?

500
01:00:43,238 --> 01:00:45,699
This is a duel.
It's a sacred thing.

501
01:00:45,824 --> 01:00:48,618
It's beautiful.
It's what separates us from the animals.

502
01:00:50,743 --> 01:00:51,955
Yeah.

503
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:58,377
I do not envy you. You ready?

504
01:00:58,502 --> 01:01:00,754
Why don't you turn
and face me like a man?

505
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,966
Why don't you do it your way and I'll
do it my way? How about that?

506
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:12,098
Come on, Roy. You can do it.

507
01:01:12,223 --> 01:01:14,225
No, you can't.
He's gonna kill you.

508
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:26,069
- One.
- He's gonna blow you away.

509
01:01:26,194 --> 01:01:28,154
Come on, Roy.
Don't think like that.

510
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:35,161
2.

511
01:01:35,686 --> 01:01:37,747
Yeah. Be positive.

512
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:40,499
Be the bullet.
Be the lead bullet.

513
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:49,257
- I'm about to die.
- 3.

514
01:01:49,382 --> 01:01:51,175
Roy!

515
01:01:53,386 --> 01:01:55,513
Duel's off!

516
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,851
Roy!

517
01:02:00,976 --> 01:02:03,312
You blew it, John!

518
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:06,148
Never interrupt a man
in the middle of a duel.

519
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:10,610
I had him. That's what kills me.
I had him! I had him!

520
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:14,962
Be careful everyone.

521
01:02:18,075 --> 01:02:21,370
Now you know how it feels
to haul you around in that sedan chair.

522
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:24,623
I will never bow to you.

523
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:31,004
Take a good look
at these faces.

524
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:34,966
If you attempt to escape,

525
01:02:35,091 --> 01:02:37,176
I will kill one worker
every hour...

526
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:39,170
until you are found.

527
01:02:46,184 --> 01:02:47,894
Starting with this one.

528
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:58,737
Do not let him
see you suffer.

529
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:03,033
I know who you are.

530
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,371
Please, tell no one.

531
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:13,660
You call this a special hideout?

532
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:17,046
Yes, it is, John.

533
01:03:17,171 --> 01:03:19,590
It's also a good place
to gather intelligence,

534
01:03:19,715 --> 01:03:23,552
'cause no one passes through Carson City
without these people hearing about it.

535
01:03:23,677 --> 01:03:26,763
- Would you ask them about the princess
- Yes, sir, I will.

536
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,932
And I don't care
how ugly it gets.

537
01:03:29,057 --> 01:03:33,019
I'm not gonna rest until I've pumped
everybody in there for information, okay?

538
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,273
- Hi, Roy.
- Hello, ladies.

539
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,359
Make way for
a couple of desperados.

540
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,444
Nice to see you again,
Mr O'Bannon.

541
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,529
- Greetings. Hello.
- Roy.

542
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,450
Yeah, we're gonna get some
information here. Trust me.

543
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,870
This is not
a proper hiding place.

544
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,873
Come on, John.
Let's relax for a little bit.

545
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,792
- Here, have a drink.
- No. I wanna find the princess.

546
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:04,089
So do I, but we can't exactly go door
to door in Carson City looking for her.

547
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:06,758
- Don't forget, we're wanted men.
- Only because of you.

548
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:09,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's my fault.

549
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,401
So, what's the princess like?

550
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:19,269
John, what's the princess like?
Is she pretty?

551
01:04:19,394 --> 01:04:22,772
- Is she a pain in the neck?
- You are not fit to talk about her.

552
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:25,817
John, you better
remember where you are.

553
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,902
This is the West.
It's not the East.

554
01:04:28,027 --> 01:04:30,821
- Remember? - And the sun
may rise where I come from-

555
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:32,907
Blah, blah, blah.
I know.

556
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:34,992
Good.
You remember.

557
01:04:35,117 --> 01:04:38,162
- Is she single? Is she single?
- What?

558
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:40,288
Is she married?
Is she available?

559
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:43,667
Only to a member
of the Imperial family.

560
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,464
Are you a member of the Imperial
family? I don't think so.

561
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:54,635
Was that a joke, John?
That was a joke.

562
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,305
John, that was your first joke.
We gotta have a toast. Your first joke.

563
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:01,266
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

564
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:03,435
Come on.
Drink.

565
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,520
-Just one.
- Okay.

566
01:05:05,603 --> 01:05:07,855
But don't talk about
the princess any more.

567
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,691
Word of honour.

568
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:17,447
Be fun to play
a drinking game.

569
01:05:17,573 --> 01:05:20,033
- You know any Chinese drinking games?
- No.

570
01:05:20,158 --> 01:05:23,370
Every country has a drinking game.
You must know one.

571
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:26,706
Just one?

572
01:05:46,307 --> 01:05:48,309
- Uno mas?
- Uno- What?

573
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,811
- One more. Uno mas.
- Okay.

574
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:08,411
No! I lost?
One more.

575
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,085
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah!

576
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:21,047
I'm so lost, John.

577
01:06:22,715 --> 01:06:24,676
90% of the time,
I don't even know...

578
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:26,761
what I'm doin'
out here in the West.

579
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:29,180
Terrible outlaw.

580
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:32,683
- No, you're a good outlaw.
- Stop, please. I'm a screwup.

581
01:06:32,808 --> 01:06:36,603
- No, I am screwup. Look at my scar.
- No.

582
01:06:36,728 --> 01:06:40,690
One for arriving late
at a guard duty.

583
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:44,360
One for dropping fighting stick.
You good. I saw you.

584
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:48,072
The only thing I'm good at
is talking.

585
01:06:49,365 --> 01:06:52,368
- It's true.
-John.

586
01:06:52,893 --> 01:06:55,370
Take your hand off me, John.

587
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:01,209
One more game?

588
01:07:01,334 --> 01:07:05,379
No. No more drinking.
That's it.

589
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:09,550
- Uno mas?
- No mas, John. No mas.

590
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:16,890
Roy?

591
01:07:17,015 --> 01:07:19,476
Roy?

592
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:24,439
- Are you coming?
- Fifi?

593
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:27,566
Uno mas?

594
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:52,673
So, who's your
funny-looking friend?

595
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:55,092
I don't know.

596
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:57,761
He's this crazy
Imperial Guard I met.

597
01:07:57,886 --> 01:07:59,804
He's-He's really funny.

598
01:08:01,129 --> 01:08:02,932
The guy's hysterical.

599
01:08:03,057 --> 01:08:05,601
We were just playing- Did you see us?
We were just playing that game.

600
01:08:05,726 --> 01:08:08,687
John's going-

601
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:11,440
And I was going- You can't really
understand what he's saying, but-

602
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:15,777
Roy? Roy? I never figured you
for riding with a Chinaman.

603
01:08:18,488 --> 01:08:22,450
Well, I'm not exactly
riding with him, Fifi.

604
01:08:22,575 --> 01:08:27,621
He's not my friend, you know.
I mean, he's a Chinaman.

605
01:08:27,746 --> 01:08:30,040
Well, that's good.

606
01:08:30,165 --> 01:08:32,960
I mean-
And you really-

607
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:35,962
Were you guys talking
about who he was?

608
01:08:36,087 --> 01:08:38,649
Let's talk about something else.

609
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:46,648
Don't you look delicious?

610
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,892
- What's going on?
- Well.

611
01:08:50,017 --> 01:08:52,811
- You!
- If it isn't the Shanghai Kid.

612
01:08:57,941 --> 01:08:59,501
Here.

613
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:21,170
Thank you.

614
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:26,175
Thank you.

615
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,260
Uno mas?

616
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:33,014
John, come on.
We gotta get going.

617
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,934
- The marshal's downstairs.
- No, no, Marshal's in there.

618
01:09:37,644 --> 01:09:39,604
Man, John.
What'd you do to him?

619
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:41,689
- Come on. Let's get going.
- No!

620
01:09:41,814 --> 01:09:45,442
- I don't wanna ride with you. - Come on,
John. Damn, you're a mean drunk.

621
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:48,879
- Hi, horsey!
- All right.

622
01:09:49,404 --> 01:09:51,740
- All right, it's time for a "yee-haw."
- Yee-what?

623
01:09:52,465 --> 01:09:54,034
Roy O'Bannon special.

624
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:57,036
We jump off, land on the back
of the horse, yell "yee-haw..."

625
01:09:57,162 --> 01:09:59,539
and ride off, all right?

626
01:09:59,664 --> 01:10:03,209
Watch me and do exactly as I do it.
Yee-haw!

627
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,166
Yee-haw!

628
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:15,887
Okay, hyah! Hyah!

629
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,264
- Hyah! Where's the head?
-John!

630
01:10:18,389 --> 01:10:20,392
John, get up!

631
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,561
Tie 'em up.

632
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,605
What happened to my horse?
Is he dead?

633
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,732
No, but we are, John.

634
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:32,152
- Hi, horsey. You sleeping?
- Get up.

635
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:41,744
Mighty impressive hardware
you're packin'.

636
01:10:41,869 --> 01:10:45,914
Why don't you get your eyes off
my package, you twisted son of a bitch.

637
01:10:50,627 --> 01:10:53,505
- I hope that's him leaving.
- Your turn.

638
01:10:56,049 --> 01:10:58,301
Thank you, Mr Van Cleef.

639
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:01,512
Well, well.
What have we here?

640
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:06,600
Mr O'Bannon, I presume.

641
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,478
Can I get a drink of water?
I got cotton mouth.

642
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:12,605
Don't mention it.

643
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:16,609
And this must be
the famous Shanghai Kid.

644
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:23,824
- Chon Wang?
- Lo Fong?

645
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:26,034
You remember
your old comrade-in-arms?

646
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,120
I remember a traitor.

647
01:11:28,245 --> 01:11:30,288
I'm sensing some bad blood here.

648
01:11:30,413 --> 01:11:34,209
- Where is the gold?
- Where's Princess Pei Pei?

649
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:36,044
Stop.

650
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:38,171
Come on. We're men.
We're not pinatas.

651
01:11:38,296 --> 01:11:40,339
Okay? And we're
really hungover.

652
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,675
We're not trying
to be tough guys.

653
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,344
- You wanna talk about the gold, let's talk
about the gold. - So, you have my gold?

654
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:47,679
- Your gold?
- Yes, we have the gold.

655
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:51,641
- Then where is it?
- The gold's in a safe place.

656
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:56,229
Is he telling the truth?

657
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:03,527
No.

658
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:08,824
Nice, John. Way to go.
Way to think on your feet.

659
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,493
He cannot lie.
He is bound by Imperial decree.

660
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,661
Imperial decree.

661
01:12:13,786 --> 01:12:16,581
When are you gonna learn
you're not in China any more?

662
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:21,252
He will never learn.
He can only follow orders.

663
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:27,049
At least I still have my honour.

664
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:36,599
Slaves have no honour.

665
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:40,019
- No! No!
- Hey!

666
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:46,233
Now you can never
go back to China.

667
01:12:49,152 --> 01:12:52,113
You blew it.
You blew it, man.

668
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:55,950
You do not want to cut
his hair off, trust me.

669
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:58,536
Nothing personal, boys.

670
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:03,207
My loyalty
is to the emperor.

671
01:13:03,332 --> 01:13:06,460
Yeah, John, I heard
all about the emperor.

672
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:10,046
Must be a hell of a man.

673
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:13,299
He's only 12.

674
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:16,135
Are you kidding me? You're sitting here
with a noose around your neck...

675
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,888
ready to die for someone whose balls
haven't even dropped?

676
01:13:21,015 --> 01:13:25,143
By virtue of the authority vested
in me through the territory of Nevada,

677
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:28,563
I do hereby order these men
to hang by their necks...

678
01:13:28,688 --> 01:13:30,648
until their feet
quit kicking.

679
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,490
You're goin' to hell, boys,

680
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:41,784
and your horses
are taking you there.

681
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:43,911
Tighten 'em up.

682
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:46,396
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

683
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,383
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

684
01:13:50,808 --> 01:13:53,669
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em!

685
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,258
Hey! Watch it, you little punk.

686
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:03,495
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

687
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,140
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

688
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:11,669
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

689
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:18,609
John, what are you doing?

690
01:14:34,957 --> 01:14:38,377
What the hell is goin' on here?
Stop those horses!

691
01:14:38,502 --> 01:14:41,129
Stop them!

692
01:14:46,259 --> 01:14:48,553
Pull it!
Pull it!

693
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:58,812
- I'm back in the saddle again
- Help me!

694
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:01,398
<i>* I'm back</i>

695
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:08,821
<i>* I'm back in the saddle again</i>

696
01:15:08,947 --> 01:15:11,032
Well, don't just stand there!
Go after them!

697
01:15:18,831 --> 01:15:21,166
Will you listen to this creek, John?

698
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:25,503
I've never noticed
what a beautiful melody a creek makes.

699
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:27,589
I've never taken the damn time.

700
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:30,925
Look at these mountains
and these trees.

701
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,886
Hell, look at these green trees. Come
here. I don't even know the names-

702
01:15:34,011 --> 01:15:36,388
We're gonna learn the names
of these green trees. Come here.

703
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:39,224
I want you
to look at these.

704
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:41,351
Can we not-
John, what are you doing?

705
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,687
Are you still worried
about your hair?

706
01:15:43,812 --> 01:15:46,773
John, listen to me.
You're very vain.

707
01:15:46,898 --> 01:15:49,859
By the time you're 70,
your queue, your ponytail...

708
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,944
will be as good as new.

709
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:54,196
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

710
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:57,199
Can we not take 2 seconds, John?
We just cheated death.

711
01:15:57,324 --> 01:16:01,411
Come on. Let's look at
these mountains for a second.

712
01:16:01,495 --> 01:16:04,789
- Okay, let me get my stuff. God, you're
unbelievable. - I'm going alone.

713
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:14,381
What are you-
John, what are you talking about?

714
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:18,302
- I heard you.
- You heard me. Okay.

715
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:21,388
At Goldie's.

716
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:24,432
You said
I wasn't your friend.

717
01:16:26,226 --> 01:16:28,227
John-

718
01:16:28,353 --> 01:16:31,147
Hold on a second, John.
I was talking to a girl.

719
01:16:31,272 --> 01:16:34,567
- It was- That's taken out of context.
That's not... - Roy.

720
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:38,570
You were right.
How could I ever be your friend?

721
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:41,907
I'm just a Chinaman.

722
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:44,617
Hold on, John. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to-

723
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:46,786
Sayonara, Roy.

724
01:17:41,419 --> 01:17:43,379
Wait here.

725
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:58,060
Please.

726
01:18:17,619 --> 01:18:19,579
You have come a long way.

727
01:18:19,704 --> 01:18:22,207
I hope the princess you seek...

728
01:18:22,332 --> 01:18:24,334
is worthy of such devotion.

729
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:29,922
It is my duty to bring her home.

730
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,713
I even brought her favourite book.

731
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:43,935
That's very kind of you.

732
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,397
But what if you found
the princess...

733
01:18:48,522 --> 01:18:51,900
and she did not wish to go back to
the Forbidden City?

734
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:55,529
Why would she want
to stay here?

735
01:18:55,654 --> 01:18:58,949
Maybe she can do more
for the people here...

736
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:03,077
than she could back in China.

737
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:13,086
Princess Pei Pei.

738
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:18,717
Please,
don't draw attention.

739
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:23,554
Please.
Stand up!

740
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,556
Princess, you have
to come with me.

741
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:29,810
I cannot.
Fong cannot find me missing.

742
01:19:29,935 --> 01:19:31,937
Princess,
I cannot leave you here.

743
01:19:36,024 --> 01:19:39,569
Please, stand up!

744
01:19:39,694 --> 01:19:43,656
Don't bow!
Get up!

745
01:19:43,781 --> 01:19:46,742
Get up!

746
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:48,994
You must go.

747
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,581
If I leave, Fong
will begin to kill the others.

748
01:19:52,706 --> 01:19:55,167
It is my duty
to bring you home.

749
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:59,546
I command you to go.

750
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,675
Go!

751
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,803
Go!

752
01:21:12,612 --> 01:21:14,990
Reach for the sky, baldy!

753
01:21:15,115 --> 01:21:18,076
That's right.
It's Roy.

754
01:21:18,201 --> 01:21:20,661
Am I interrupting?

755
01:21:20,787 --> 01:21:22,747
I followed you.
So what?

756
01:21:22,872 --> 01:21:26,166
What am I supposed to do, let you
wander off? You're a greenhorn.

757
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,303
You'll get killed out here.

758
01:21:29,628 --> 01:21:32,089
Come on! We gotta adios
out of here, partner! Come on!

759
01:21:32,214 --> 01:21:34,716
Hyah!
You gotta stick with me.

760
01:21:36,676 --> 01:21:38,678
Don't forget, we got
a princess to save.

761
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:40,873
Give my regards
to the emperor, Princess.

762
01:23:56,928 --> 01:23:59,389
Princess.

763
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:04,061
- Chon Wang?
- Chon Wang?

764
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,819
That's right, Johnny Wayne is here.

765
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:14,862
Hey, it's me.

766
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:17,573
Why did you cut his hair?

767
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:19,992
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

768
01:24:20,117 --> 01:24:22,244
Go on, drop the gun.

769
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:24,329
Now, slide it over.

770
01:24:34,213 --> 01:24:36,674
Is that her?

771
01:24:36,799 --> 01:24:38,718
She's pretty.

772
01:24:38,843 --> 01:24:41,011
Grab her.

773
01:24:42,805 --> 01:24:45,057
Come on.
We'll take it from here, guys.

774
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:11,206
John, what-
John, get up.

775
01:25:11,331 --> 01:25:13,374
What are you-
I thought we were past this.

776
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:15,427
Come on, John.

777
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:20,965
Do you see?
He will always be a slave.

778
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:27,220
You, as being the Emperor's
guard

779
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:32,520
is responsible to escort
Princess Pei Pei back to palace

780
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:39,481
This is the West,

781
01:25:41,608 --> 01:25:44,569
not the East.

782
01:25:47,197 --> 01:25:49,157
And the sun may rise...

783
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:51,284
where we come from,

784
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:54,829
but here is where it sets.

785
01:25:58,374 --> 01:26:02,002
You want me to translate?
The princess stays.

786
01:26:03,712 --> 01:26:05,672
The princess stays.

787
01:26:05,797 --> 01:26:08,591
I grab the gold,
you marry the princess.

788
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:11,761
We both hang Fong and call it a day.
Mission accomplished.

789
01:26:14,388 --> 01:26:16,348
Well, well.

790
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:22,854
Nice to see
we're all churchgoers.

791
01:26:24,314 --> 01:26:26,358
Son of a bitch!
With my own guns!

792
01:26:27,734 --> 01:26:29,753
Sweet, ain't it?

793
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:42,956
How about that?
It's a Mexican standoff.

794
01:26:43,081 --> 01:26:46,835
Only we ain't got
no Mexicans.

795
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:06,895
No!

796
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:10,231
Princess Pei Pei!

797
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:27,218
- I hit you?
- No.

798
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:29,762
But you're gettin'
really close.

799
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,390
You've almost killed me,
like, 17 times already.

800
01:28:35,851 --> 01:28:37,811
18, 19, 20!

801
01:28:39,521 --> 01:28:41,481
You're on fire today!

802
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,779
Captain, catch it!

803
01:30:22,782 --> 01:30:25,159
How do you survive
out here?

804
01:30:25,284 --> 01:30:30,372
What's that supposed to mean? These
aren't my- These guns are really weird.

805
01:31:05,404 --> 01:31:07,865
Oh, man.

806
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,703
Stay low!

807
01:31:15,247 --> 01:31:18,290
Princess, over here.

808
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:22,713
Hold it tight

809
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:52,406
Maybe we should let bygones be bygones.
You got off some good shots.

810
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:57,285
I got off some good ones.
Let's call it a tie.

811
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,829
What's the matter, O'Bannon?
Out of bullets?

812
01:31:59,954 --> 01:32:02,331
No, I got one left.

813
01:32:03,749 --> 01:32:05,751
Tell you what I'll do.

814
01:32:05,876 --> 01:32:09,254
I'll take out
all my bullets but one.

815
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:12,424
And that way, we'll be even.
How's that?

816
01:32:13,884 --> 01:32:16,261
Okay.
That sounds fair.

817
01:32:16,386 --> 01:32:18,346
You'd do that for me?

818
01:32:19,371 --> 01:32:20,974
Yeah.

819
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:26,479
You bet I would.

820
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,054
We come out on 3.

821
01:33:49,179 --> 01:33:52,099
I know,
but-but let me count.

822
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:57,020
Fight with honour.
Okay.

823
01:33:57,145 --> 01:33:59,063
Fight with- Okay.
1!

824
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:02,692
2!
2 and a half!

825
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:04,735
2 and 7/8!

826
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,571
3!

827
01:34:26,672 --> 01:34:28,966
How the hell did that happen?

828
01:35:09,461 --> 01:35:11,463
It's a miracle.

829
01:35:13,048 --> 01:35:15,508
I am invincible.

830
01:35:16,718 --> 01:35:18,636
Roy!

831
01:35:18,761 --> 01:35:21,263
Invincible!

832
01:36:09,432 --> 01:36:13,394
- Now it's time for you to die.
- Adios, partner.

833
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:06,359
Roy!

834
01:37:15,243 --> 01:37:17,203
He took the gold.

835
01:37:31,674 --> 01:37:33,593
Is that all you care about
is the gold?

836
01:37:33,718 --> 01:37:36,262
Shame on you.

837
01:37:36,387 --> 01:37:40,808
There's more to life than money.
I hope you learn that one day.

838
01:37:40,933 --> 01:37:42,893
What happened?

839
01:37:43,018 --> 01:37:45,896
What? Nothing, nothing.
I just killed him. How'd you do?

840
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:48,940
- How? - What do you mean, how?
I shot him with my gun.

841
01:37:49,065 --> 01:37:51,067
Come on.
Tell me the truth.

842
01:37:51,192 --> 01:37:53,778
It was unbelievable. You missed
a miracle. I had one bullet left.

843
01:37:53,903 --> 01:37:57,323
He had, like, a million left. He lied to me
and told me that he only had one too.

844
01:37:57,448 --> 01:38:00,409
But-But when-
But when he-

845
01:38:11,294 --> 01:38:13,963
- She's staying?
- Yes.

846
01:38:15,214 --> 01:38:18,259
- Can I stand?
- Yes.

847
01:38:21,094 --> 01:38:24,264
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!

848
01:38:24,389 --> 01:38:26,933
That's my line. He stole my gang,
he's stealing my lines.

849
01:38:27,058 --> 01:38:29,102
- That's unbelievable.
- Roy! Roy!

850
01:38:29,227 --> 01:38:33,189
- Get back!
- Stop, stop. It's Wallace.

851
01:38:33,314 --> 01:38:35,358
Hey, Roy,

852
01:38:35,483 --> 01:38:38,819
we know you been moonlightin' on us with
that old yellow fella from the train!

853
01:38:38,944 --> 01:38:41,029
You guys, you stay here.
This isn't your battle.

854
01:38:41,754 --> 01:38:44,825
No, we stick together.
We are partners.

855
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:49,204
That's beautiful.

856
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:55,793
You go out the back door.

857
01:38:55,918 --> 01:38:58,879
- No.
- Don't worry, Princess.

858
01:38:59,004 --> 01:39:01,048
I promise you,
I will see you again.

859
01:39:02,299 --> 01:39:04,801
That which you have promised...

860
01:39:04,926 --> 01:39:07,971
you must perform.

861
01:39:15,019 --> 01:39:18,545
Protect Princess.

862
01:39:21,108 --> 01:39:23,401
- Get out of the way!
- Why?

863
01:39:23,527 --> 01:39:26,988
- Come on!
- Why? What are you--

864
01:39:27,113 --> 01:39:31,159
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- No, John, stop, stop.

865
01:39:31,284 --> 01:39:35,871
They can't touch me. Something
happened back there. It was a miracle.

866
01:39:35,996 --> 01:39:39,249
- There's no way--
- Hey, smart-ass! Do you hear me?

867
01:39:39,374 --> 01:39:42,169
Time's up, O'Bannon!
It's the end of the line!

868
01:39:42,294 --> 01:39:45,314
We can take these guys.
Yep, we can take them.

869
01:39:45,839 --> 01:39:49,258
Are you comin' out
or ain't you?

870
01:39:50,635 --> 01:39:53,095
Gun.

871
01:40:01,478 --> 01:40:04,439
You really are
the Shanghai Kid.

872
01:40:07,817 --> 01:40:09,944
Nice riding with you, partner.

873
01:40:20,996 --> 01:40:23,373
We go out on 3.
I count.

874
01:40:23,498 --> 01:40:25,708
No, I count.

875
01:40:25,834 --> 01:40:28,544
We'll both count.

876
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:31,422
1, 2, 3!

877
01:40:42,182 --> 01:40:45,810
- Indians! Look out!
- No! My family! My family!

878
01:40:53,025 --> 01:40:55,402
- Friends. Brothers!
- Roy!

879
01:40:55,527 --> 01:41:00,824
I gotta tell ya, we always
figured you for a dumbshit, but,

880
01:41:00,949 --> 01:41:03,993
we was thinkin' maybe you wanna
come back and rejoin the gang.

881
01:41:04,119 --> 01:41:06,746
- So, what do you say?
- Yeah, what do you say?

882
01:41:06,871 --> 01:41:08,789
I think I'm just
gonna wing it.

883
01:41:08,915 --> 01:41:10,791
All right.

884
01:41:10,916 --> 01:41:12,918
-And you are goin' to jail.
- That works too.

885
01:41:16,213 --> 01:41:17,931
How, kimosabe!

886
01:41:18,256 --> 01:41:20,592
How, kimosabe!

887
01:41:30,559 --> 01:41:32,770
It's nice to be
standing here next to you.

888
01:41:32,895 --> 01:41:35,230
I don't think I've ever gotten
a chance to thank you for-

889
01:41:35,355 --> 01:41:37,566
for saving us so many times.

890
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:41,611
I wish you could understand what-
I feel like there's this gap between us.

891
01:41:41,736 --> 01:41:43,738
It's like, I'm a cowboy,
you're an Indian.

892
01:41:43,863 --> 01:41:46,240
You say "wampum,"
I say "money."

893
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:48,618
At a certain point,
I just think--

894
01:41:52,371 --> 01:41:54,415
Shut up, Roy.
You talk too much.

895
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,959
Did-Did-
She just-

896
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:14,516
There she is, right on time,
carrying a big, fat payroll.

897
01:42:19,729 --> 01:42:21,981
I don't know if I'll ever
get used to this one.

898
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,360
Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

899
01:42:26,486 --> 01:42:29,447
I can guarantee you, we won't get half
as many girls being lawmen.

900
01:42:29,572 --> 01:42:31,490
I know we're spoken for,
but-

901
01:42:31,615 --> 01:42:35,035
You never know what's gonna
happen in a relationship.

902
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:38,872
I gotta get rid of my outlaw name.
That's not gonna work any more.

903
01:42:38,997 --> 01:42:41,499
Really?
What would you call yourself?

904
01:42:41,624 --> 01:42:45,962
I don't know. I mean,
my real name's Wyatt Earp, but-

905
01:42:46,087 --> 01:42:49,799
Earp? That's a terrible name
for a cowboy.

906
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:52,301
- Why?
- Bad.

907
01:42:52,426 --> 01:42:53,802
- Really?
- Bad!

908
01:42:53,927 --> 01:42:57,222
-And John Wayne's a great cowboy name?
- Roy, look.

909
01:42:57,347 --> 01:42:59,057
There they are.

910
01:42:59,182 --> 01:43:03,978
Yep. Look at those amateurs.
That's my move!

911
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:06,647
Come on, Roy.
Let's go say "howdy."

912
01:43:06,772 --> 01:43:09,233
Let's go!
Hyah! Hyah!

913
01:43:09,358 --> 01:43:11,360
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

914
01:43:18,867 --> 01:43:20,869
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

915
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:28,834
Scene up.

916
01:43:30,044 --> 01:43:32,212
That which you have promised...

917
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:33,890
you must perform.

918
01:43:35,215 --> 01:43:36,575
Hello.

919
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,511
He was part of your
"rushimiant-"

920
01:43:39,636 --> 01:43:41,554
What? Regiment.

921
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,681
He's one of your bandits.

922
01:43:43,806 --> 01:43:45,516
He's one of your-
He's one of your-

923
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:48,686
He was part of your regiment
