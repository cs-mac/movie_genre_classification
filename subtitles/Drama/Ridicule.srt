00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
1783. Six years before the French Revolution, Loius XVI still ruled - but wit was king.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,800
"In this country, vices are without consequence, but ridicile can kill". -Duke of Guines

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,356
Sir, do you remember me?
Think hard.
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,714

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,231
Have I changed so much?

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,154
Remember...
the "Marquis of Stumblebum"?

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,950
You dubbed me that
when I fell at a ball.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,512
Stumblebum. So very wounding!

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,116
I never lived it down.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,473
Where is your fine wit now?

11
0: 1:12,720 -->  0: 1:13,914
All gone?

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,390
What a loss for society.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,833
Since my exile...

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,479
I've seen many lands...

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,676
with far ruder manners,...

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,431
yet I've never forgotten yours.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,230
Sir, am I tiring you?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,958
I will wait on Madame and let him rest.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,196
She is expecting you.

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,035
I fear that in his joy,
Monsieur forgot himself.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,068
Name of movie: Ridicule

22
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,992
- Go home.
- But, Monsieur...

23
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,592
Your teeth are chattering.
You're sick.

24
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,749
Don't move

25
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,190
We are short of workers.

26
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,198
His father has a fever.

27
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,709
They say the king can cure the sick.

28
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,450
All men can work miracles.

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,638
Don't you believe me.
I promise.

30
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,310
We'll rid this swamp of evil.

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,198
By having masses sung?

32
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,190
No masses...

33
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,396
we'll build dikes and canals,...

34
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,835
plant trees, grow crops.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,230
This region will become
beautiful.

36
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,193
You're home

37
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,909
When you meet with the king,
ask him to bless my medallion?

38
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,113
I will, Leonard.

39
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,196
Let me bless you.

40
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
Your mother worries about you going to Versailles.

41
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,832
You must have hope

42
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,753
I preach hope on Sundays - in God.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,232
At Versailles, one man's will
turned swamps into gardens.

44
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,232
The will of a king!

45
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,073
I'll knock on every door...

46
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,196
right up to the king.

47
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,639
Kneel down.

48
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,633
Take off your hat

49
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,754
God bless you...Amen

50
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,149
Farewell

51
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,196
He is the finest wit of our age.

52
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,959
How funny !

53
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,190
Milletail!

54
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,318
Back from America

55
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,074
I missed the stench of Versailles.

56
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,398
I'm surprised you're here.

57
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,435
I would rather bury him alive...

58
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,196
but God is our master.

59
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
We are praying, gentlemen.

60
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,916
Have dinner with me...

61
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,395
A roasted chicken would be better company!

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,958
Madame de Blayac will grieve for days!

63
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,275
Is this Blayac house?

64
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,278
Yes. Are you the related?

65
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,833
I have an introduction to Monsieur.

66
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,270
You come at the right moment. 
he is receiving guests

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,956
You can recognize him by his widow.

68
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,076
His wit was a shining light.

69
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,196
My husband valued your opinion.

70
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,953
The Academy grieves for him.

71
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,958
He cared for it deeply.

72
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,633
What a loss.

73
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,313
Lord, what a loss.

74
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,034
Your husband was a friend of my father.

75
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,633
And of mine.

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,193
I come from the Dombes.

77
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,591
Do you know Versailles?

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,070
I was born here, as it happens.

79
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,832
A courtier by birth.

80
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,389
Not everyone born in a stable
thinks he's a horse.

81
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,712
God is our judge.

82
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,636
What, friend?

83
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,718
God will forgive the burglar...

84
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,393
if his children are hungry

85
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,078
We meet again.

86
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,713
What a pleasure!

87
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,556
Whom do I have the honour to bleed?

88
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,356
Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy.

89
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,077
Marquis of Bellegarde.

90
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,753
Charlotte, my housekeeper,
and her son Paul.

91
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,073
Paul is both death and mute
but he is an idiot, not evil.

92
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,519
Travellers should be better warned...

93
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,473
about the robbers round Versailles.

94
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
A good doctor must judge blood...

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,309
the way a gourmet judges wine.

96
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,192
A nice hearty red. 
Fluid but with plenty of body!

97
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,079
You live in fresh air...

98
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
and eat lean meat.

99
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,955

100
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,712
I live foul swamp air, and eat mostly fish!

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,393
My God, my plans.

102
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,638
- Are you a water engineer?
- I am.

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,959
I come to Versailles to seek aid
for a drainage project.

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,278
It's easier to be seen than heard.

105
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,956
I will appeal to reason and compassion.

106
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,038
Are you so ignorant
of the ways of Versailles?

107
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,709
Come

108
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,272
I have bled you white.

109
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,398
You need rest

110
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,830
You must stay in the bed for two days, eat light food, and a glass of wine each night.

111
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,959
Night is for sleeping.
You are exhausting yourself.

112
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,835
Thank you

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
"Study Addressed to the Regent...

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Concerning Epidemics in the Dombes and Suggested Remedies"

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,956
Written by the Marquis de Gora.

116
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,673
It was not even opened.

117
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,473
Will your study fare any better?

118
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,432
Thank you for sparing me disappointment.

119
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,159
I have seen so many gentlemen from the country.

120
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,197
I shall plead my case orally.

121
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,957
And here I'll build a sluice to create a storage pool.

122
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,190
His majesty would be interested in this project perhaps.

123
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,479
The king is interested in technical things.

124
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,918
Tell him that the high fever makes many Dombes residents die.
I know he is compassionate.

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,638
This is his weakness

126
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,551
This is the reason that I can't tell his majesty of your plan.

127
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,670
I will keep it from him, along with schemes...

128
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,232
to dig a tunnel to England, to drain the Landes and to make a map of India.

129
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,356
Your plan is all fine, no doubt...

130
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,634
but expensive.

131
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,956
Drain the marshes at least.

132
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,629
You mean drain France's treasury!

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,992
I administer the accounts.

134
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,270
Do you understand the problem?

135
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,756
How much is a life worth?

136
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,953
Less than the destiny of France...

137
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,478
except to philosophers.

138
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,631
Goodbye, Sir. I have work to do.

139
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,956
I will open the king's eyes!

140
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,394
Please do!

141
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,479
Those right wing men are leading the kingdom to bankruptcy

142
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
I am busy on the work of the military defence.

143
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,839
Mr Maurepas is old and careful.

144
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You are young and courageous

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,755
My duties are too great
to permit me to listen to flattery.

146
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,519
In the Left Wing 

147
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,636
we do not deal in favours. Goodbye, Sir!

148
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,474
But, I give you a suggestion

149
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,997
Write a report, and I will circulate it.

150
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,475
The Left Wing is for ministers
who serve the kingdom's needs.

151
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,435
The right wing is for courtiers...

152
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,109
who serve their own needs.

153
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,470
I only want to see the king.

154
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,556
"Only"? You jest.

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,230
We call you people 'suitors'.

156
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,830
There are thousands of you.

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,592
Some succeed!

158
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,994
Help me

159
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,798
Introduce me at the palace

160
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,795
You would be more useful at home.

161
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,194
Versailles Palace is my last hope

162
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,315
You suitors are all the same.

163
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,597
Your head is full of dreams of titles and grants.

164
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,598
The court! The court!

165
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,838
The phrase intoxicates you!

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,878
But I doubt you have what it takes to be heard.

167
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,393
Go back home...

168
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,228
and thank me.

169
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,156
I'm sorry I troubled you.

170
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,831
Double three... or I'll tell the secret of the church.

171
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470
Ah, secret. Do tell.

172
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,594
Well, there is no purgatory basically

173
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,394
Isn't that your patient?

174
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,476
Fresh from the country, you must find
our courtly ways ridiculous.

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,474
"Judge not,
that ye be not judged."

176
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,390
Were the Gospels of any use
at Versailles, I would have heard.

177
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,515
Join us if you wish

178
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,194
we play 10 sols a point.

179
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,835
All I left is my shoe buckles.

180
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,191

181
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,278
You can even admire them
by bending lower from the waist.

182
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,919
What do you want here?

183
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,238
A grant to drain the Dombes swamps 
and get rid of the mosquitos.

184
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,756
Our peasants die young - around 35.

185
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,229
Poor people!

186
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,076
They are not only dying - they are boring.

187
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,799
Remember - besides those mosquitos...

188
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,919
the peasnts also feed the aristocrats.

189
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,837
He's smarter than he looks.

190
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,750
That is where we differ, Monsieur!

191
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,432
Her Majesty the Queen!

192
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,879
Ah Blayac! Can I borrow the Abbot?

193
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,158
At your service, Ma'am.

194
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,278
I am playing piquet with such dull people.

195
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,274
I need some witty company.

196
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,194
Thank you. I will return him to you soon.

197
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,590
But were you busy?

198
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,915
Nothing important.

199
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,915
Your patient has recovered quickly from the "attack"

200
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,116
Is it thanks to you?

201
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,196
Please allow me to believe so.

202
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,795
His tongue is certainly agile.

203
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,277
You never come to my suppers.

204
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,278
I await the pleasure.

205
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,311
Do I have to invite you

206
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,756
Bring your protege.

207
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,629
Double six!

208
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,756
Your first skirmishes went well.

209
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,236
That should bring you hope.

210
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,831
The abbot is close to the Queen, and he dislikes me

211
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,270
Wit opens every door...

212
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,158
and you have plenty of it.

213
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,231
Who cares about the Dombes?

214
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,831
You, of course, but it needs patience

215
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,190
If the palace is interested in you

216
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,832
your Dombes will be taken care of.

217
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,753
I have spent a year's money in just days.

218
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,116
If you do not mind discomfort...

219
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,589
you can stay with me.

220
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,359
I tried to dissuade you, but now I will help.

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,319
Why?

222
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,070
Honesty and intellect rarely live together.

223
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,956
Too much powder makes the teeth look yellow.

224
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,074
Just keep your original complexion.

225
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,674
With a little rouge to add colour.

226
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,154
Does the countess know the king?

227
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,315
Serious topic

228
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,512
Best avoided!

229
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,999
I will restrain myself.

230
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,636
You should be more witty, sharp

231
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,949
and malicious...

232
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,112
and your region will be  developed

233
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,398
No puns. People say puns are "the death of wit".

234
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,159
Voltaire! My bible.

235
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,679
One last thing:

236
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,630
Never laugh at your own jokes.

237
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,519
Redcurrants!

238
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,836
I adore redcurrants!

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,151
I could eat as many as Samson killed Philistines!

240
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,319
We all adore redcurrents.

241
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,033
If Samson had...

242
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,236
If Samson hadn't...

243
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,834
- Where are your estates?
- The Dombes.

244
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,310
A land of swamps and disease.

245
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,158
This is why I came here

246
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
What an unpleasant topic!

247
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,238
Give some champagne to

248
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,834
Mr. Ponceludon

249
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,277

250
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,916
What do you think of the English?

251
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,599
Droll. They have a way of speaking
they call "hew-mah."

252
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,955
This makes them laugh enormously.

253
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,428
Is it like wit?

254
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,353
A kind of mental state?

255
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,108
No really, no.

256
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,557
What is it in French?

257
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,877
It's untranslatable.

258
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,949
Oh come on. Tell us!

259
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,109

260
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,069
Any talk that causes laughter is a form of wit.

261
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,556
No, it's not exactly wit.

262
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,750
There is no French word for it.

263
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,474
Give us an example.

264
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,758
I asked Twickenham
how many mistresses he had.

265
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,434
he answered me without  any expression

266
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,478
"How many constitute <i>several?"</i>

267
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,716
This is the only example that comes to mind.

268
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,519
That comes to mouth!

269
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,154
How did Samson kill the Philistines?

270
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,956
Samson! The Philistines!

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,756
With the jawbone of an ass.

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,958
With the jawbone of an ass!

273
"I could eat as many
as Samson slew Philistines."

274
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,637
"With the same jawbone, Abbot?"

275
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,236
The jawbone of an ass.

276
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,756
I'd have been the talk of the court.

277
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,195
Two hours too late

278
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,669
Age is the enemy, Ponceludon.
A few years ago, I'd have had him.

279
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,075
Wit eludes us all sometimes.

280
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,238
Not everyone.

281
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,879
No, Ponceludon.

282
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,236
Anyway, Bravo!

283
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,559
You scored a point
with "Comes to mouth."

284
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,831
what a pity you laughed,

285
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,074
A tortoise

286
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,635
a bottle of ink

287
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,795
An amethyst

288
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,752
a chinaware trolley

289
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,719
a starfish

290
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,033
a book.

291
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,635
Let me see...

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,795
A snuffbox!

293
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,598
Wrong

294
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,835
Oh, an apple

295
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,154
How could I forget it

296
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,390
You have odd pastimes.

297
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,270
Children's brains are moist and fluid.

298
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,716
When we become old,

299
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,719
our brain will becomes dry

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,639
and the memory declines.

301
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,908
I store every witty remark in here

302
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,839
Double entendres, repartees, quips...

303
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,554
wordplays, retorts, paradoxes.

304
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,639
Your "Comes to mouth" is a repartee.

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,551
I had a strange dream. My head was on the guillotine and the executioner said

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,230
"One quip, and you can be released."

307
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,310
Everyone at court has that dream.

308
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,790
Do not laugh with your mouth open, it is vulgar

309
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,756

310
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,234
Is Mr. De Montalieri dissatisfied?

311
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,355
Your letter made me anxious.

312
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,670
It's a good post, Mathilde.

313
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,276
Being a governess
will aid your ambitions.

314
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,719
Monsieur is pleased with my work.

315
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,835
but...

316
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,869
it'd be indecent to remain
in his wife's home.

317
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,756
"Monsieur de Montalieri...

318
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,919
shall have access
to his wife's bed twice a month.

319
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,237
Her refusal
will invalidate this contract.

320
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,715
Any breach of the contract

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,959
will terminate the income... 

322
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,518
that Mr DeMontalieri bestows on his future wife.

323
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,758
- Are you sure? 
- There's no mention of the workshop I need for my research

324
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,000

325
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,513

326
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,953
It is stiplulated in the appendix.

327
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,715
My future bride defends her interests.

328
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,077
I approve of that...

329
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,839
but I have one more condition:

330
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,638
My bride shall not

331
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,994
before our wedding or after...

332
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,276
for any reason...

333
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,478
appear in Court.

334
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,559
If she does, I shall be freed of my commitments.

335
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,397
Mademoisell Bellegarde, do you accept this term?

336
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,873
My daughter dislikes the corruption of the palace

337
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,519
Don't you, Mathilde?

338
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,716
I won't fix a wedding date...

339
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,839
as Madame de Montalieri
is still... with us.

340
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,399
How is she how?

341
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,029
Yesterday, she could not recognize me.

342
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,115
Help me

343
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It is not sealed completely

344
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,319
You know

345
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,550
How much water pressure at 100ft?

346
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,300
Exactly 3 ounces per sq. inch. I've studied Pascal.

347
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,316
Nature puts crabs under water and girls at home.

348
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,875
Nature gives your peasants fever.

349
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,518
- What oil is that?
- Otter oil. Why?

350
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,795
Seal the joints with tar.

351
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,749
And then observe..

352
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,836
how well it reacts to movement.

353
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,239
Please turn around

354
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,471
Do you love Montalieri?

355
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,394
Love? I don't believe in love.

356
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,634
Why do you choose to get married with him?

357
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,591
It's either that, stay poor, or be a nun.

358
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,479
My father cannot pay for my research.

359
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,229
One day, you will have a lover - like all noblewomen.

360
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,759
You can look.

361
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,950
Do not look at your feet

362
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,197
Now, spin.

363
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,515
Spin.

364
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,074

365
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,276
If only the tyranny of wit had
done away with genealogists!

366
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,789
For a few months, I've been trying to see the king

367
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,079
to plead that my family
be restored its historic title.

368
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,514
The Bishop of Caen is helping me.

369
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,516
I think my summons will come soon

370
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,675
very good

371
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,319
It's very important

372
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,115
I'm in line for a post
at the Academy.

373
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,998
It's a very high paid job

374
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,751
But for now, I am a little short of funds.

375
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,428
I'm sorry.

376
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,390
But I could give you an I.O.U.

377
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,677
I need money too. Sorry.

378
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,190
May I ask what you seek at Versailles?

379
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,359
A grant to drain the marsh

380
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,153
Do you have a sponsor?

381
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,395
None

382
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,879
What about wit?

383
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,955
I know how to speak my mind.

384
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,439
Your best hope is to see the king...

385
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,951
But for this, you must prove your pedigree since 1399.

386
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,837
We belong to the House of Savoy

387
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,000
I see. But I need proof of your family title.

388
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,758
We've always had it.

389
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,838
Perhaps. But I am a geneologist. I need proof of your family title.

390
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,840
I need to see a birth certificate 
of the Marquis,

391
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,460
deceased in 1507.

392
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,558
Our castle was destroyed by fire in 1680. Papers...

393
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,314
Castles have a habit of burning down.

394
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,956
Write to his parish of birth.

395
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,834
They may have baptismal records.

396
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,433
Watch this. Galvani was right.

397
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,751
The electricity affects to the wits of the animal.

398
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,149
You know, I have a theory.

399
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,838
Electricity and wit
are one and the same.

400
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,113
The skin is so smooth.

401
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,759
Like the legs of...

402
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,310
You admire...

403
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,073
my masterpiece.

404
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,632
That diving suit is madness.

405
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,798
Mathilde was born in the age of Rousseau.

406
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,789
I let her choose freely.

407
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,193
But, did she choose this marriage?

408
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,952
Her will is her own, no one forces her.

409
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,355
Thank you.

410
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,074
Excuse me.

411
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,036
Excellent news!

412
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,431
The Duke de Guines invites us to dine.

413
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,913
I told you wit opens doors.

414
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,155

415
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,234
Thank you Paul.

416
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,714
Excuse me, Sir. That boy is both death and mute?

417
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,393
Yes, and a half-wit.

418
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,760
I can help him.

419
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,194
I run a home for such children.

420
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,919
They have a kind of language

421
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,719
He is just fine at our house.

422
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,951
Charles Michel de I'Epee.

423
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,999
I am delighted.

424
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,639
Excuse me!

425
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,072
Age and rank first.

426
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,077
My heritage is clear. We are cousins.

427
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,153
My father's sister is a Ballencourt.

428
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,716
Ballencourt de Merignac?

429
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,679
Ballencourt du Tilleul.

430
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,752
The same family

431
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,954
Look at our grandfather

432
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,552
See the resemblance?

433
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,033
Our grandfather?

434
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,634
His is the one with four legs!

435
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,758
Sir, answer...

436
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,118
with the wit that befits Academy membership.

437
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,436
It never befat one worthier than I.

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,991
"Befat"?

439
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,348

440
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,313
Funny language for...

441
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,755
a would-be Academician.

442
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,078
Don't be surprised.

443
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,794
Every harem has its eunuch

444
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,314
That guard is watching us.

445
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,149
No wonder

446
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,438
This is a lovers' walk.

447
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,636
We look out of place.

448
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,676
Play the lover, then.

449
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,516
Why waste your best years...

450
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,518
With a lecherous old man.

451
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,557
He is a learned person.

452
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,759
Discussing the facts of life 
may bring children!

453
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,914
I have more important things to do. Don't you?

454
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,029
I am trying to save lives.

455
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,913
You are misguided.

456
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,154
Versailles doesn't save lives.

457
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,709
A rotten tree cannot produce good fruit

458
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,558
Is your harvest in?

459
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,069
Almost.

460
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,396
You think me cold.

461
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,434
You are young

462
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,594
You think you do not need anyone.

463
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,195
I have enough. Let's go.

464
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,994
Hurry

465
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,833
The bee will spread pollen

466
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,476
Pollinate these.

467
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,912
Do you oppose my getting married?

468
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,278
What is this variety called?

469
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,079
You did not answer.

470
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,792
You judge me.

471
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,959
The flame of your vital instincts
draws you to me.

472
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,839
Nothing else.

473
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,717
The portrait session!

474
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,395
Enough for today. 
Tomorrow we go on.

475
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,152
It's dark

476
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I will supply the key words,
you write a rhyming epigram.

477
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,072
A dull epigram will count against you.

478
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,676
Quips depend on luck,
epigrams need work.

479
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,233
work strangles inspiration

480
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,398
Be bold, but circumspect.

481
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,230
Don't trust the Abbot. He's a snake.

482
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,312
If he is silent, he is keeping watch on you

483
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,317
If he talks, it is too late

484
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,432
"Eyes, wise."

485
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,550
"Missed, Eucharist."

486
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,155
Verse form?

487
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,319
Iambic couplets.

488
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,553
The one joy here that I have missed...

489
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,072
has been to see our king so wise.

490
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,193
Like Jesus at the Eucharist

491
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,156
Our mouths he feeds but not our eyes.

492
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,998
Ah. Very clever.

493
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,554
It's your turn baron

494
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,675
"Skill, will."

495
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
"Newcomer, summer"

496
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,236
Permit me, Countess?

497
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,833
Is it Flemish?

498
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,592
Beautiful workmanship.

499
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,874
Verse form?

500
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,714
Octosyllables.

501
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,835
The abbot's quick wit has such skill

502
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,517
It inspires every newcomer

503
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,277
He can be so entertaining at will

504
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,714
Two ideas follow one another

505
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,599
One in winter

506
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,359
The other in the summer

507
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,871
The Count of Artois
invited me to chocolate.

508
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,599
You are leaving us?

509
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,039
On with the game!

510
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,035
Madame.

511
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,759
- I see the abbot trusts his memory
more than his wit.

512
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,959
- What is the price of your silence?

513
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,393
Fear not. I will not fan
the winds of gossip.

514
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,069

515
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,631
You should use sealskin.

516
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,318
I will order some.

517
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,039
They come from Canada - they cost a lot

518
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,710
I will soon be wealthy.

519
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,637
- I used to  to swim here. 
- You can swim?

520
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,874
I'll teach you.

521
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,350
Have you seen a person who drowned? 
It's terrible

522
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,638
- Water harms only the fearful.
- Nonsense.

523
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,913
- There are boats and bridges. Why swim?
- For fun!

524
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,273

525
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,598
There must be carp here.

526
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,558
What are the court ladies like?

527
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,716
I hear they bathe in powder.

528
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,955
Many catch rich old goats,
but few can swim.

529
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,672
Perhaps they had no choice.

530
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,994

531
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,716
Is it also true that
suitors fish for favours?

532
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,233
You changed

533
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,397
You enjoy it.
You're becoming like them.

534
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,549
What are you doing?

535
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,834
According to Archimedes' law, I will float...

536
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,953
but how do I move forward?

537
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,159
Push ayour arms back, and move your legs like a frog.

538
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,194
I stand by what I said.
This isn't natural!

539
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I waited more than an hour
yet others see him before me!

540
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,959
Your patience is a sign of aristocracy.

541
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The problem in your case has been solved.

542
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,558
All settled.

543
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,796
But...

544
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,756
how about the birth certificate?

545
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,756
Were proof always required,
most nobles would be commoners.

546
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,353
This is your title.

547
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,192
Signed and sealed.

548
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,799
Good luck

549
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,796
I am deeply grateful.

550
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,834
This is Countess Blayac's doing.

551
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,634
You should reserve your gratitude for her.

552
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,435
A child's godliness is the kingdom's strength.

553
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,318

554
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,036
Your parish will be cared for.

555
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,790
Now please excuse me, Father.

556
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,075
Christ be with you.

557
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
How can I thank you?

558
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,114
Please don't. I'm sorry you caught me dispensing charity.

559
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,793
Your heart is good. 

560
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,592
So many give for show.

561
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,874
My wit is greater renown than my heart...

562
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,513
but you decide.

563
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,109
Are you interested in  engineering?

564
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,595
Since I met you, Mr. Engineer.

565
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,238
Tell me about your project.

566
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,152
Beneath my homeland is a layer of 
clay that traps rain. The drainage -

567
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,000
A muddy subject. It is hard to think of silt in my living room.

568
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,034
I want to hear about new inventions.

569
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,830
The king can tell you more than I. 

570
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,875
He does often talk of them.

571
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,078
You know tales of woe.

572
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,629
I must go. I am imposing.

573
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,075
Thanks are no imposition.

574
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,594
Sit down.

575
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,794
Let's chat.

576
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,710
There is a word that Miss Bellegarde is very attractive...

577
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,872
but nobody sees her.

578
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,511
Does our intimacy embarrass you?

579
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,235
You think me clumsy for...

580
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,431
I am torn between respect for you...

581
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,797
and desire.

582
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,034
How convoluted...

583
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,669
for a man of wit!

584
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,876
Must you dine to shine?

585
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,036
Countess, do not be cruel

586
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,519
I would be flattered
were it not for the fact...

587
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,876
that my bedroom is known
to lead to the king.

588
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,755
You misjudge me.

589
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,436
Swallow your pride.
Let people help you.

590
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,000
Learn to hide your insincerity...

591
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,959
so that I can yield without dishonor.

592
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,954
Remember only that...

593
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,436
and you've profited here.

594
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,310

595
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,119

596
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,673

597
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,150

598
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,629
Hurry,Paul.

599
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,118
The record is 14 minutes.
We can beat it.

600
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,629
Not me. You almost drowned!

601
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,956
I forbade you to do it!

602
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,150
"Forbade?"

603
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,998
Who give you this right?

604
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,031
Not even my father dares.

605
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,952
If I died, is it important to you?

606
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,594
It would finish off your fiance.

607
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,116
His wife finally died.

608
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,232
You will marry soon.

609
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,069
Of course, but after the funeral.

610
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,113
He is kind and patient
and his children love me very much.

611
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,349
I'm keeping this.
Ask me for it next time.

612
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,076
I dread this marriage!

613
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,240
I doubt it, You are cold-blooded.

614
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,710
You belong with the fish.

615
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,111
Give me back the helmet.

616
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,870
I shall miss her.

617
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,957
Don't you have a sweetheart yourself?

618
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,672
I have no property

619
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,839
What can I give her but swamps and fever?    

620
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,998
Fine life for a lady.

621
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,756
To be happy, we need women.

622
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,836
To them, a man's fears
are never ridiculous.

623
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,357
Watch the hat
on the grey horse's rider.

624
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,838
The king is choosing.

625
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,194
Do we have any chance?

626
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,555
Not so loud.

627
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,560
Some have waited months,...

628
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,879
for example Baron de Gueret.

629
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,556
I prefer the swamps to this.

630
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,959
The king heard about your horse quip.

631
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,315
Will it work?

632
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,708
Alas...

633
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,436
the 'eunuch' joke is also
on everyone's lips.

634
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,150

635
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,555

636
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,154

637
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,678

638
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,429

639
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,677

640
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,114

641
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,519

642
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,475
...

643
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,359
Mr Ponceludon

644
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,436
Do not a mistake

645
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,072
What an angel!

646
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,153
Baron De Gueret!

647
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,471
Lend me  your shoes!

648
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,358
I'd be ridiculed!

649
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,238
I beg you! I was called!

650
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,192
Get up, people are staring.

651
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,393
Remember, the nobles made you king -

652
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,193
those whom you now humiliate.

653
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,954
You abase us...

654
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,149
yet give a savage
the cross of St. Louis!

655
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,629
Come, this isn't our place

656
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,955
The Sioux are our friends.

657
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,435
Half naked, with a necklace of bones,
and the name 'Stinking Bear'.

658
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,394
Yet he almost makes us look riduculous.

659
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,392
Ah, Madame Blayac.

660
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,750
We so seldom see you recently

661
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,115
Sire, the Abbot of Vilecourt.

662
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,198
"Every harem has its eunuch!"

663
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,590
Baron Ponceludon.

664
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,593
I have heard of you.

665
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,636

666
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,196

667
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,798
It's nothing. Only de Bellegarde's idiot.

668
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,993
She's here, Madame.

669
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,074
Let her come in

670
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,112
Miss Bellegarde

671
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,354
Your father speaks well of 
you in front of us...

672
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,153
But, he hides you.

673
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,198
Will we see you at court one day?

674
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,076

675
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,677
You ordered my father
to send Paul away.

676
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,998
Please forgive him.

677
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,551
Alas, the harm is done.

678
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,995
He is just a poor deaf and dumb boy.

679
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,994
He would be better with his own kind.

680
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,838
He has always been with us.

681
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,909
You are not here about the boy.

682
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,599

683
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,234
I am well disposed to you.

684
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,790
I like your father very much...

685
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,356
and I help my friends.

686
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,756
One day you will see.

687
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,029
Madame, Paul!

688
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,118
You are still a child.

689
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,952
Forget that half wit.

690
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,791
How is our Mr. Ponceludon de Malavoy?

691
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,558
Such a pretty wit!

692
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,439
He is very well.

693
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,514
Goodbye, madam

694
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,155
I had heard of your learning...

695
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,189
but not of your beauty.
Perhaps you also have much wit.

696
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,874
No, madam

697
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,273
Paul

698
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,875
He'll be fine.

699
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,118
You once said that that place is a jail

700
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,030
The Abbot of I'Epee
runs a very good home.

701
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,597
More straw? Less whip?

702
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,709
Mathilda. I had no choice.
Courtesy demanded it.

703
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,154
Courtesy!

704
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,796
What makes you so gloomy?

705
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,230
Ponceludon de Malavoy!

706
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,756
He saw us cheat at epigrams.

707
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,596
He needs only say a word and he
could shame me in front of the king

708
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,998
Don't worry.

709
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,872
He'll never sit at the king's table.
Leave it to me.

710
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,434
Do you think I've lost my claws?

711
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,031
I'll have a dinner...

712
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,796
and serve Ponceludon de Malavoy
a dish of ridicule.

713
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,639
Good

714
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,879
Is this yours?

715
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,352
The countess won't make
your rendezvous.

716
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,598
She's playing piquet
with Madame de Lamballe.

717
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,715
Love's course
is never a straight line...

718
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,198
Mr. Engineer

719
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,790
I will remember your geometry.

720
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,397
There will have a dinner in her house tomorrow for wits.

721
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,512
You're invited.

722
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,955
Alone.

723
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,636

724
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,032
I don't pretend to inspire passion...

725
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,753
But when she is 30 years old...

726
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,230
Mathilde will be a wealthy widow.

727
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,434
Very wealthy.

728
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,311
With her whole life before her.

729
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,153
A drummer boy
at the battle of Fontenoy...

730
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,319
who had half his head shot off
by a cannonball...

731
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,637
managed to shout out...

732
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,434
"I fear I'm losing my mind!"

733
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,635

734
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,836
Now that took wit!

735
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,917
A carriage at this hour?

736
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,949
It's for me.

737
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,876
A lover's tryst?

738
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,474
I'll leave a lantern out for you. 
Good night.

739
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,073
How unlucky! There is 13 of us!

740
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,990
We must ask a footman to sit with us.

741
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,959
A killing cure! Sit with a footman?

742
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,277
We would look ridiculous.

743
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,350
Then one of us must leave.

744
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,678
The one with the lowest title should go.

745
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,836
I suggest a contest.

746
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,391
He who has shown the least wit
when the soup arrives must go.

747
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,634
A tournament of wit!

748
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,550
So be it.

749
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,958
Let the contest begin.

750
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,311
How is your wife, Monsieur?

751
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,269
Asking a man about his wife...

752
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,954
is like asking about
last year's fashions.

753
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,989
I pray to the Virgin once a month...

754
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,076
to avoid talk
if my wife gets pregnant.

755
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,713
A wife who sleeps with her husband...

756
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,559
is in labor.

757
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,318

758
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
Why not go to a brothel?

759
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,433
The good company there isn't bad...

760
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,116
and the bad company is excellent.

761
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,399
Personally...

762
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,799
I no longer consort with whores.

763
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,194
They're as depraved as gentlewomen.

764
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,513
It's easier to die for a woman
than to find one worth dying for.

765
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,915
I marry only virgins.
I pay dearly
for what any man can steal.

766
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,119
Why do women's confessors
always end up archbishops?

767
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,191
Women are wittier.

768
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,354
If the sinner lacks wit,
the confessor atones for it.

769
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,195
What good is wit?

770
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,475
Without it, one is never bored.

771
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,554

772
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,954
A man of wit who says less...

773
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,479
isn't thought less of.

774
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,593

775
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,918
A silent fool is none the wiser.

776
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,949
Ah, don't denounce the dull.

777
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,073
Without plains,
there would be no peaks.

778
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,034
Wait! Ponceludon must speak.

779
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,076
Wit is like money.
The less we have, the better.

780
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,949
"Wit is the opposite of money".

781
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,117
The less we have, the better."
Voltaire.

782
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,798
Robbers should know whom they rob.

783
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,312
The contest is over.

784
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,628
I'm starved.

785
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,800
Serve me with the footmen.

786
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,040
We're judged by the company we keep.

787
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,439
A misjudgment.Judas kept excellent company.

788
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,835
I'm sorry to miss your wedding.

789
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,231
You're rushing to leave me?

790
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,590
Yes.

791
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,595
A woman who throws herself at a man
always loses him.

792
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,230
Give up your water-flowers
and you'll be ordinary.

793
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,919
Why give them up? 
We  can share them.

794
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,318
Being married to an estate in debt...

795
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,750
will wilt your dreams.

796
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,270
If only I'd never met you!

797
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,194
I could still pretend
I'm not selling myself.

798
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,518
The painter is waiting for you

799
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,198
When he's done,
can we take a last walk?

800
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,116
I must reach an inn before dark.

801
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,556
Is admitting love so hard?

802
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,392
You and I are alike.

803
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,114
Our plans come first.

804
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,678
<i>Is admitting love so hard?</i>

805
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,920
<i>How convoluted, for a man of wit!</i>

806
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,196
<i>You've changed.</i>
<i>You're becoming like them.</i>

807
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,430
<i>You'll be more useful at home.</i>

808
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,276
<i>Poor people!</i>
<i>They're not only dying, they're boring.</i>

809
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,238
<i>Drain France's treasury!</i>

810
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,277
<i>I dread this marriage!</i>

811
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,358
<i>I've seen so many country gentlemen.</i>

812
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,150
<i>Wit debonair</i>

813
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,874
<i>in the age of Voltaire</i>

814
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,592
<i>Was seen as a heaven-sent treasure</i>

815
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,036
<i>Wit opened doors</i>
<i>to the company of Lords</i>

816
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,679
<i>And the tasting of noble pleasure</i>

817
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,351
<i>In the past it was able</i>
<i>to put food on the table</i>

818
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,034

819
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,718
<i>But those days are gone forever</i>

820
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,359
<i>A witty rebuff</i>
<i>or a verse off the cuff</i>

821
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,274
<i>Are no more the coin of the clever</i>

822
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,795

823
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,312
What are you doing?

824
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,949
You're giving up 2,000!
Are you mad?

825
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,799
I want to terminate the contract

826
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,873
On a whim?

827
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,634
Beg Montalieri's pardon.

828
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,516
No, Father. I've decided.

829
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,359
I can't bear to marry him.

830
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,391
Is it Ponceludon?

831
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,440
- No income from our woods?
- I sold the five acres...

832
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,635

833
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,398
to buy a horse
and repair the bridge.

834
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,593
Poor Gregoire.

835
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,797
You'll inherit only ruins.

836
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,676
How was Versailles?

837
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,753
- You saw the king?
- He's very busy, but...

838
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,991
he listens to everyone.

839
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,112
Leonard is sick.

840
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,190
Since when?

841
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,113
Two weeks ago.
He drank swamp water.

842
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,754
From the pond?

843
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,394
Here, Leonard.

844
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,152
The king blessed it for you.

845
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,069
He wants me to tell you

846
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,636
He loves all children in France

847
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,790
Now, the priest will pray

848
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,919
God will hear him.

849
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,115
Why has God sent us this curse?

850
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,436
It's those damned swamps!

851
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,759
Don't blame yourself.

852
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,999
Versailles took everything you had.

853
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,750
Is our cause progressing?

854
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,356
Yes...

855
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,190
but don't stop praying.

856
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,555
"I am everything that is,
was, and ever shall be."

857
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,596
The Egyptians who carved
those words in stone...

858
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,109
believed in only one effect...

859
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,113
and only one cause.

860
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,679
They viewed the universe...

861
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,432
as one giant cause...

862
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,356
- Show-off!

863
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,079
- Who says we have no great preachers?

864
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,518
The prime cause of everything
is absolute and perfect!

865
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,871
There can never be two perfect beings...

866
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,513
or they'd be One.

867
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,472
The perfect Being...

868
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,153
is indivisible.

869
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,753
What is in itself...

870
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,279
does not change.

871
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,311
Time measures change.

872
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,516
Perfection cannot change!

873
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,792
One, unchanging and eternal...

874
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It is He! God!

875
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,798
<i>Causa sui.</i> He's His own cause!

876
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,036
Bravo, Vilecourt! Dazzling!

877
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,596
Well done

878
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,718
It's nothing. This evening I proved
the existence of God.

879
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,877

880
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,836
But...

881
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,272
I can prove the reverse
if it pleases Your Majesty!

882
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,915
I'll see you jailed, Philosopher!

883
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,560
Your Majesty! It was only a jest!

884
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,231
A blaspheming fool!

885
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,118
Sophistic braggart!

886
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,476
So near yet so far.

887
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,155
Ah, madam

888
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,756
The king seems ill-humored.

889
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,672
Will you plead for me?

890
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,075
- I can't help you.
- It was a jest!

891
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,078
Where did I go wrong?

892
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,598
The soul of wit
is to know one's place.

893
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,116
<i>Baron...</i>

894
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,709
<i>Many women would blush</i>
<i>at the endearments I gave you...</i>

895
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,558
<i>yet you left with no word of farewell.</i>

896
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,754
<i>For you have I forsaken</i>
<i>the Abbot of Vilecourt...</i>

897
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,279
<i>my confessor...</i>

898
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,358
<i>I will forgive you</i>
<i>for jeopardizing my soul...</i>

899
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,034
<i>in exchange for some news of you.</i>

900
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,000
<i>A woman's advantage...</i>

901
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,151
<i>lies in the influence</i>

902
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,114

903
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:00,348
<i>she is able to wield at court.</i>

904
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,835
<i>I have wielded mine...</i>

905
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,949
<i>to make you the most-favored</i>
<i>absentee of Versailles.</i>
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

906
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,636
Who rings at this hour?

907
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,395
Mr Ponceludon wishes to see you.

908
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,758
Let him in, quick!

909
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,313
I have, Madame.

910
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,316
The boy died in my arms.

911
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,914
How dreadful.

912
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,279
To your canals!

913
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,359
To your locks.

914
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,472

915
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,719
What are you doing?

916
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,194
You sent for me?

917
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,834
I had a fit of palpitations.

918
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,555
I'm sorry to call you so early.
I was so afraid.

919
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,716
It is important is to set your heart at rest

920
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,672
Do you often get them?

921
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,109

922
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,557
Old friends meet again.

923
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,556
I'll take my leave.

924
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,759
Monitor Madame's heart.
Her palpitations worry me.

925
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,515
What are you staring at?
Have you seen a ghost?

926
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,239
Madame Montalieri is here. 

927
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,793
Miss Bellegarde?

928
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,228
When you were not here

929
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,789
She broke her engagement.

930
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,599
Your guile has no equal.

931
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,878
Be patient, and you'll be thankful.

932
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,035
Why are deaf-mutes isolated...

933
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,953
Do they not perceive objects as we do?

934
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,598

935
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,117
Why do they remain stupid?

936
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,230
Why do they become intelligent?

937
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,194
In the beginning was the Word!

938
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,636
Socrates said...

939
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,118
"If we could not speak
and wanted to communicate...

940
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,756
would we not copy the dumb...

941
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,349
and talk with our hands, heads...

942
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,789
and bodies?"

943
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,994
This is Simon...

944
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,676
the son of a businessman,25 years old,

945
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,512
born deaf and dumb.

946
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,275
He came here when 15 years old

947
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,919
Thanks to sign language, he can read...

948
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,399
By hand language, he can read,
write and count.

949
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,358
He has an artist's talent

950
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,354
This is Antony Pierre...

951
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,836
and |Therese, 19 years old

952
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,959
After 3 years,
she can do 4-figure sums in her head.

953
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,639
She is very devout

954
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,830

955
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,076
This is Paul, 17 years old

956
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,394
and very gifted

957
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,358
He learned my language...

958
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,717
In two months!
He can already converse.

959
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,793
Next spring...

960
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,115
I will marry Therese and Paul, before God

961
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,113
You mock the holy state of matrimony!

962
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,950
I once saw Romeo and Juliet...

963
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,911
played by an ape and a poodle!

964
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,358
Can the groom even read that clock?

965
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,278
It's 3 minutes fast.

966
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,914
Good, Paul

967
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,799
Louder, Miss. He didn't hear you!

968
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,469
Ask him what use a violin serves.

969
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,353
Watteau preferred
seeing one to hearing it.

970
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,992
One question, Father.

971
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,479
Are their lives endurable?

972
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,749
What does he say?

973
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,755
It's untranslatable.
It's a "play on signs."

974
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,998
How do you say, "Bravo"?

975
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,354
Like this.

976
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,799
Out of bed!

977
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,510
This is Signor Panella.

978
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,835
You need a court suit.

979
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,029
But I need nothing!

980
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,559
At 11:00 tomorrow morning,
you will be at the Diana steps.

981
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,994
You will see the king and his courtiers

982
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,599
The rest is up to you.

983
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,994
I'll leave him to you, Signor.

984
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,431
Good.

985
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,950
Is this the man you spoke of?

986
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,076
Mr Ponceludon.

987
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,910
They say you have great wit.

988
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,553
- Sire?
- Indeed, yes!

989
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,109
The countess sings its praises

990
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,993
Come. Show us.

991
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,870
Be witty this minute!

992
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,193
For example, describe me.

993
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,554
Sire, the king is not a subject.

994
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,350
" the king is not a subject

995
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,390
Admirable.

996
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,629
Not a pun, I hope?

997
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,189
No, Sire. A play on words.

998
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,469
Most memorable.

999
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,472
De Malavoy may join us.

1000
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,358
Come here, de Malavoy.

1001
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,911
You are an engineer.

1002
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,993
Handsome design, Sire.

1003
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,076
However, if I may be so bold...

1004
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,516
a sprocket here...

1005
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,113
would maintain the elevation.

1006
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,719
What a good idea!

1007
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,398
Didn't you think of it?

1008
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,630
I hear you have
a hydrographic project.

1009
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,234
To drain the Dombes swamps, Sire.

1010
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,119
Come to talk with me

1011
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,553
Talk to my secretary

1012
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,955
Gentlemen.

1013
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,319
The "Ponceludon" gun:
The butt is wider than the mouth.

1014
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,070
What?

1015
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,353
Your butt is wider than your mouth.

1016
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,513
I demand satisfaction.

1017
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,750
Forgive me.
I had to see you again.

1018
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,518
I am listening

1019
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,635

1020
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,878
No matter what happens...

1021
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,709
we will stay friends.

1022
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,272
Is my friendship important to you?

1023
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,314
You made the suit watertight?

1024
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,836
Promise to be careful.

1025
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,829
I was unaware of your decision about Montalieri.

1026
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,554
Did you come running
when you heard?

1027
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,276
To tell you I bedded the countess
to get to the king?

1028
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,914
For your peasants' sake,
I'd have approved.

1029
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,230
Your logic is impregnable.

1030
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,790
From now on, I'll be true.

1031
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,353
Why these instruments?

1032
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,392
I'm attending a duel.

1033
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,796
Ponceludon...

1034
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,757
and Colonel de Chevernoy..

1035
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,914

1036
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,556
If you come to any harm,
I will die.

1037
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,069
Escape

1038
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,314
Go to my house at St. Bauzile.

1039
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,879
I will meet you there

1040
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,039
Not for me but for your peasants.

1041
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,597
You must live for them.

1042
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,877
Have my bags packed.

1043
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,077
Victor will drive you.

1044
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,914
Come back only for the king.

1045
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,675
<i>Madame...</i>

1046
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,559
<i>If I die,</i>
<i>send my hat and spurs to my mother.</i>

1047
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,638
<i>Give the rest to the poor...</i>

1048
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,550
<i>except my new suit,</i>
<i>an insult to their plight.</i>

1049
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,676

1050
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,397
I'm to drive you to St. Bauzile

1051
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,919
I know, I know!

1052
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Don't worry. Go home.

1053
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,035
Go

1054
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,640
<i>Will the barb-tongued lover die,</i>
<i>a bullet in the head?</i>

1055
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,916
It will be over with the sound of the gun

1056
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,795
<i>Where's the moral in that?</i>

1057
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,239
<i>Maybe I was wrong</i>
<i>to seek fruit from a rotten tree.</i>

1058
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,672
<i>The lover has no regrets.</i>

1059
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,798
<i>I am thankful to have met you.</i>

1060
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,477
<i>You expended some credit</i>
<i>on my behalf...</i>

1061
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,559
<i>and my memory has no bitterness.</i>

1062
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,354
No apology has been tendered.

1063
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,195
We shall now draw lots.

1064
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,315
Mr. De Chevernoy shoots first.

1065
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,034
<i>We embraced without love</i>
<i>and will part...</i>

1066
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,349
<i>without regret.</i>

1067
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,150
<i>But I venture to believe...</i>

1068
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,553
<i>our passion leaves room</i>
<i>for friendship.</i>

1069
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,389

1070
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,039
Ponceludon has killed de Chevernoy.

1071
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,919
Is he with you?

1072
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,279
He left with Miss de Bellegarde.

1073
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,039
He will pay for it!

1074
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,118
Who comes?

1075
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:06,076
Baroness Boisjoli,
Baron Malenval and de Milletail.

1076
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:06,079

1077
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,949
Already?

1078
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,036
They come to see me suffer.

1079
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,350
Tell them I don't feel well.

1080
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,588
Not well?

1081
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,836
- Could it be Smallpox?
- No Madame.

1082
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,639
The honor of a lady jilted by an oaf.

1083
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,836
An oaf dear to the king.

1084
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,956
Soon we'll pay court to him.

1085
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,435
The countess will be avenged.

1086
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,196
At home, when a mad dog is loose,
we sound the alarm.

1087
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,153
You've done it!
You broke the record!

1088
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,593
It will start leaking. Come up!

1089
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,231
I love you, Gregoire!

1090
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,439

1091
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,629His Majesty
The king cannot meet in private with a man...

1092
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,194
who killed one of his officers.

1093
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,158
Not immediately, anyway.

1094
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,234
A gentleman defends his honor.

1095
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,472
You did your duty.

1096
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,958
You're too good.

1097
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,833
Versailles won't help you.
Your land needs you... us.

1098
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,309
Give up? After stooping so low?

1099
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,233
We'll work the land
and make it healthy.

1100
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,799
I'll see the king.

1101
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,516
It's only a matter of time.

1102
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,516
You're not one of them.

1103
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,998
I'm still welcome at court.
You think not?

1104
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,549
"Lovers of the fall,
come to the mystery ball.

1105
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,030
Welcome to the clever-witted.

1106
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,431
Dullards will not be admitted."

1107
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,119
We're invited.

1108
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,994
And if a countess invites you to bed?

1109
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,039
Mathilde.

1110
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,158
You will be my dancing partner tomorrow.

1111
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,870
It's the red beak.

1112
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,518
The red beak

1113
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,836
May I borrow him?

1114
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,479
Do you wear my colors
in memory of my pleasure?

1115
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,877

1116
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,598
Trip him now.

1117
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,508

1118
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,358

1119
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,156
Who is this nimble dancer?

1120
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,472
Accept...

1121
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,232
the title of...

1122
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,429
"Marquis des Antipodes."

1123
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,034
An honour justly earned!

1124
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,236
Like the Antipodeans...

1125
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,709
He dances with the head downward

1126
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,878
Marquis des Antipodes. How clever!

1127
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,114
Worthy of Voltaire!

1128
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,958
- We'll find out who you are.
- The costume renter knows.

1129
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,712

1130
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,877

1131
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,118
Don't bother.

1132
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,630
Children will die tomorrow 
because you ridicule me today.

1133
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,556
You envy Voltaire's wit.

1134
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,112
He would have wept.

1135
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,518
He was ridiculously compassionate.

1136
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,831
Whose turn is next?

1137
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,799
Who gets lashed with wit so sharp...

1138
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,036
his whole family reels?

1139
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,595
You?

1140
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,394
Perhaps you?

1141
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,236
Unless you get the chance
to lash your neighbor first.

1142
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,829
Monsieur

1143
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,239
Take off your mask

1144
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,719
We all want to know who coined
"Marquis des Antipodes."

1145
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,549
I'm going back to my swamps
where I belong.

1146
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,629
I can repair bridges, make canals.

1147
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,397
my bare hands

1148
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:48,722

1149
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:57,349
1794.
The nobility of France flee to England to escape the revolution.

1150
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,109
Wit was the very air we breathed!

1151
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:06,231
Now the bloated rhetoric of Danton...

1152
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,438
rules in place of wit.

1153
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,709

1154
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,918
You'll like it here.

1155
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:16,275
On a clear day you can see France

1156
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,236
Mathilde and Gregoire stayed behind.

1157
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,353
She's helping him drain the Landes.
Or is it the Dombes?

1158
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,635
I can't remember.

1159
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,869

1160
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,517
May the turmoil spare them.

1161
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,992
What talent do you have?

1162
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,909
I can teach children French...

1163
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,151
science, physics, physiology.

1164
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,876
My hat! I've lost my hat!

1165
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,958
Better your hat than your head.

1166
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,073
Ah, humor!

1167
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,435
Ah, it is a humor

1168
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,439
It's wonderful

1169
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I used to keep a list of witty remarks.

1170
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I divided them into: "humor and wit", "
attack by insinuation" ...

1171
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I filed them by category:
Repartees, Quips, Paradoxes...

1172
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000

1173
The first attempts to drain the Dombes began,
