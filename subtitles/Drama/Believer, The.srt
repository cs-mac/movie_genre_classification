1
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,047
And it came to pass
after these things

2
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,916
that God tested Abraham,

3
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,353
and said to him,
"Abraham."

4
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,448
And Abraham said,
"Here I am."

5
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,551
And God said,
"Now take your son--

6
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,893
your only son
whom you love, Isaac,

7
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,023
and go unto
the land of Moriah

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,466
and offer him there
as a sacrifice

9
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:11,004
on a mountain
that I will show you."

10
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,835
So...

11
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,070
everyone, what's really
going on here?

12
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,135
It was a test of Abraham's faith,

13
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,975
of his devotion to God.

14
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,880
Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?

15
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,043
It's not about Abraham's faith.

16
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,451
It's about God's power.

17
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,820
God says, "You know
how powerful I am? "

18
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,983
I can make you
do anything I want,

19
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,492
no matter how stupid--

20
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,620
even kill your own son,

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,925
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."

22
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,684
- Hey, Ueshiva-bukah.
- What?

23
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:55,854
Get up!

24
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,262
Get the fuck up!

25
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,995
What the fuck
do you think this is?!

26
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,241
Do you think this is
a fucking test?!

27
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,404
You think God's going
to provide a fucking ram

28
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,880
instead of you? No!

29
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,050
Do me a favor...

30
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,053
why don't you
fucking hit me, okay?

31
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,456
Hit me.

32
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,522
Hit me!

33
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,223
Hit me, hit me, hit me.
Fucking hit me.

34
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,060
Hit me, please!

35
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,225
You fucking kike!

36
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,936
It will no longer be possible
to say that the country

37
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,535
has a unified set
of core beliefs.

38
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,671
At that point we will cease
to be a nation

39
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,342
in the traditional sense,
and will become instead

40
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,578
a confederation of specific
interest groups

41
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,621
like medieval principalities.

42
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,212
And at the same time,
we will flow into the anonymous

43
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,623
undistinguished sea
of the global market.

44
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,629
The economic advantages of
this arrangement are obvious...

45
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,666
Where I grew up
in South Boston,

46
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,497
when a kid would
walk down the street,

47
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,561
everybody knew his name.

48
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,970
He runs out in front of a car,
some old mick'll say,

49
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,033
"Jimmy Dunn, you get back on
that sidewalk and you stay there."

50
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,942
Then he graduates
high school,

51
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,173
he goes and sees his uncle
down at the gasworks

52
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,079
or a priest's brother
at the shipyards.

53
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,583
He gets
his apprentice papers.

54
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,552
Eight years later
he's making $16.50 an hour,

55
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,622
he's got four kids,
he's playing ball and going--

56
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,487
Hey everybody.

57
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,602
Today, that kid
walks down the street,

58
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,162
it's filled with trash,

59
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,869
half the faces
are black,

60
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,467
shipyard's closed.

61
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,705
Only jobs left at the gasworks
are set-asides,

62
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,645
and by the time he drops out
of high school,

63
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,514
he'd rather get a job
at the Burger King.

64
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,213
So he drinks,
does crack, whatever.

65
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,916
When he hangs himself
on his front porch at 23,

66
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:40,427
the only people that'll mourn him
are a few of his buddies...

67
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,359
and his mom.

68
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,827
The soul of this country

69
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,391
is being destroyed.

70
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,960
And the only thing the present
government can offer us

71
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,997
is free trade,
mutual funds, and IPOs.

72
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:58,909
The average man is crushed
less by accumulated wealth

73
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,915
then by lack of leadership,
lack of community,

74
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,281
culture...

75
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,218
and the sense of emptiness
he cannot fill on his own.

76
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,212
That's why I'm a fascist.

77
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,248
It's the only
form of government

78
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,385
that can address
our fundamental needs.

79
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,429
What about race?

80
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,623
This isn't
the time for that.

81
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,030
I disagree.
I think race is central

82
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,932
to everything
we're talking about here.

83
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,130
Spiritual life comes from race,
from the blood.

84
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,400
Without that,
we're no better than the Jews.

85
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,236
What's wrong
with the Jews?

86
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,370
Carla.

87
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,178
Lookit, the point is the modern
world is a Jewish disease.

88
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,980
- All right?
- What disease?

89
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,816
Abstraction.

90
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,584
They're obsessed
with abstraction.

91
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,455
So what would
you propose, then?

92
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,795
Killing Jews.

93
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,990
That would be
a catastrophic mistake.

94
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,699
People hate Jews.
Do you agree?

95
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,634
They used to.
Today, that's not an issue.

96
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,071
No. No, no.
Deep down,

97
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,574
beneath all the tolerance
that they learn on television,

98
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,234
nothing's changed.

99
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,973
The very word
makes their skin crawl.

100
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,345
It's not even heat,
it's just--

101
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,010
it's like the way you feel when
a rat runs across the floor.

102
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,281
You want to step on it.
You just want to crush it.

103
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,050
You don't even know why.
It's a physical reaction,

104
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,524
and everyone feels it.

105
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,855
Jew.

106
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,658
So which ones
would you kill?

107
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,858
Barbara Streisand.
Kissinger.

108
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,560
- Dershowitz.
- Roseanne!

109
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,830
We don't want celebrity
obscuring the issue.

110
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,200
Which is what?

111
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,705
At first, no one will know
why the victims are being killed.

112
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,468
You wouldn't announce it?

113
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,672
I'd say nothing,
and after about one or two,

114
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,808
people try to find a reason,
an answer.

115
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,249
And when it comes out,
the public will be outraged.

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,151
It will look like
Germany all over again.

117
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,225
Isn't that what we want?

118
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,227
Germany all over again?

119
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,752
Only done right this time.

120
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,630
And when people find out
that rich, successful,

121
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,395
brilliant Jews
are being killed,

122
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,437
they'll be glad.

123
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,736
And they won't say anything,
not even to themselves.

124
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,242
Once someone says it aloud,

125
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,405
they'll think, "That's exactly
what I was thinking."

126
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,315
And it'll all spread
from there.

127
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,853
It always does.

128
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,888
They're not gonna say nothing.

129
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,221
He's got a point.

130
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,694
You're not in school.
What do you do?

131
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,322
I drive a forklift...

132
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,367
over at the Big Boy
warehouse in Queens.

133
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,868
Young man...

134
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,531
Lina Moebius.

135
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,129
And you are?

136
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,538
Daniel Balint.

137
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,508
Balint?

138
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,408
It's German.

139
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,674
Are you with the FBI,
Mr. Balint,

140
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,181
or any other
law enforcement agency?

141
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,088
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

142
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,121
So...

143
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,595
what are you really
after, Daniel?

144
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,028
Hmm?

145
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,964
Do you want
to just kill Jews,

146
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,002
or do you have
something larger in mind?

147
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,503
Curtis thinks your ideas
would marginalize us.

148
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,732
Curtis,
we're already marginal.

149
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,536
That's our appeal.

150
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,100
We're saying what no one else
has the guts to say.

151
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,305
Who would you kill first?

152
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,981
Ilio Manzetti.

153
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,949
Former ambassador to France,

154
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,419
managing partner
at Damon & Schwarzchild.

155
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,649
It's an investment
banking house.

156
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,818
- He's Jewish, Manzetti?
- Totally.

157
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,327
His parents immigrated
from Bulgaria when he was 11.

158
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,494
How would you do this?

159
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,127
I need some time to assess
his routines and his security,

160
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:44,795
but ideally?

161
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,204
On a New York City street,
midday,

162
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,437
with a small caliber automatic
without a silencer.

163
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,444
Why no silencer?

164
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,947
'Cause you want it
to be an event.

165
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,348
Why don't you come
visit us in the country?

166
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,513
We have a retreat.
You might find it interesting.

167
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,050
Bring your friends
if you like.

168
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,964
He reminds me of Karl
when I first met him.

169
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,727
I thought we agreed.

170
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,828
Anti-Semitism is exactly what
we're trying to leave behind.

171
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,236
Killing Manzetti.

172
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,035
Did you see
how they reacted to him?

173
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,906
Yes, of course, in this room,
where people aren't embarrassed

174
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,376
to call themselves Nazis.

175
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,209
It's a romantic movement,
Curtis, it always has been.

176
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:29,613
- Lina--
- Look,

177
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,844
I don't care about the Jews
one way or another,

178
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,409
but it has a power.

179
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,684
A thousand-year Reich
barely lasted a decade.

180
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,485
You really want to go down
that road again?

181
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,719
In America of all places?

182
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,127
Order and discipline aren't
exactly the national virtues.

183
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,097
He's very bright.

184
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,101
He speaks well.

185
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,930
So what do we do with him?

186
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,635
Bring his friends?
We're not his friends.

187
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,837
Hey Danny, you fuck the girl yet?

188
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,813
- He liked her mom.
- Her mom?

189
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,079
That was her mother?

190
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,722
Fuck you!

191
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,785
You, get the fuck
out of the way!

192
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,462
Fucking niggers!

193
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,263
Why don't you go back to Rwanda
and give each other AIDS?!

194
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,531
- Let's go, motherfucker.
- Come on, you fat bitch.

195
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,648
What, you like it in here?

196
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,689
Shut the fuck up.

197
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,089
You ever read "Mein Kampf"?

198
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,060
Hitler had some
of his best ideas in prison.

199
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,620
Daniel Balint.

200
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,690
Hey, shut the hell up.

201
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,034
I'm not going anywhere
without them.

202
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,342
Can I use a credit card?

203
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,889
Be quiet. I don't want
to wake up my mother.

204
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,798
"And the words fell apart
in my mouth

205
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,103
like moldering mushrooms."

206
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,479
A lot of these
are in Spanish.

207
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,012
Yeah, my grandmother's
from Argentina.

208
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,221
My father's family
went over during the war.

209
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,523
Where's your father now?

210
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,599
He's in a mental institution.

211
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,860
Is he a Nazi?

212
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,541
I don't know.
We don't talk about that.

213
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:16,476
I don't think he cares
about all that stuff...

214
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,950
- anymore.
- What's he care about?

215
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,784
Killing himself.

216
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,857
You think people ever commit
suicide out of happiness?

217
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:38,301
That's stupid. Why would they
do it if they were happy?

218
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,202
You're not like
the others, are you?

219
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,009
Like your friends.

220
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,073
Yes, I am.

221
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,643
Basically I am.

222
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,690
Hurt me.

223
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,398
Just do it.
Hurt me.

224
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,201
Ow! Not that hard!

225
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,769
Get up.

226
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,643
You have to go.

227
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,616
What?

228
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,644
Curtis...

229
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:31,452
bring the paper.

230
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:02,249
- Hey, man.
- Punk-ass.

231
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:24,066
Where'd you have it
last, Dad? Try to remember.

232
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,111
Who's that?

233
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,008
Stay back, stay back.

234
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,960
"And offer him there
as a sacrifice

235
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,028
on a mountain
that I will show you."

236
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:57,065
Everyone, what's really
going on here? Schlomo?

237
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,409
It was a test of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.

238
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,345
- Very good.
- Isaac wasn't his only son.

239
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,646
- Ishmael was his son, too.
- The only son he loved.

240
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,846
Oh, they only kill them
when they love them.

241
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,412
Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?

242
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:14,325
It's not about Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.

243
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,159
God says,
"You know how powerful I am?

244
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,494
I can make you do
anything I want,

245
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,534
no matter how stupid--

246
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,433
even kill your own son,

247
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,630
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."

248
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,334
Okay, Danny,
but if Hashem is everything

249
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,137
and we are nothing,

250
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,405
how then are we
to judge His actions?

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,938
We have free will and intelligence
which God allegedly gave us.

252
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,540
Wait, what are
you talking about?

253
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,882
God never lets
Abraham kill Isaac.

254
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,013
He gives him the ram
so he doesn't have to.

255
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,319
Personally,
I think that's a lie.

256
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,792
You think? Based on what?

257
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,726
There's Midrash supporting it.

258
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,560
My father read a book
by Shalom Spiegel

259
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,566
that said Isaac died
and was reborn.

260
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:58,627
- No one follows that Midrash.
- I do. I follow it.

261
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,196
But okay,
say God provided the ram.

262
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,902
So what?
Once Abraham raised the knife,

263
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,104
it was as if he'd killed him
in his heart.

264
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,080
He could never forget that,
and neither could Isaac.

265
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,380
Look at him, he's traumatized.
He's a putz the rest of his life.

266
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,476
Danny, watch your language.

267
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,920
I think the whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred...

268
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,673
Danny?

269
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,850
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

270
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,190
What are you doing?

271
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,825
I just came to get some stuff.
I'll be gone in five minutes.

272
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,128
He's going to die. Huh.

273
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,899
He won't take his medicine,

274
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,533
he eats dairy.

275
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,873
Probably still smokes
when I'm not around.

276
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,742
I asked him
to move in with us.

277
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,874
It was Alex's idea, but
he doesn't want to be any trouble.

278
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,350
Yeah, well...

279
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,147
then he couldn't be
bitter about living alone.

280
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,654
Why deprive him
of his greatest pleasure?

281
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:34,990
Jesus Christ, Danny,
how can you wear that thing?

282
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,660
Linda, don't start with me.

283
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,000
Do you know what it means
to your people?

284
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,733
- They're not my people.
- Yeah?

285
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,037
- Tell that to Hitler.
- Oh, he decides?

286
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,599
Hitler's the chief rabbi now?

287
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,748
- Why?
- There's 50 reasons.

288
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,077
Even if you knew them all,

289
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,946
there'd be another 50
you didn't know.

290
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,883
Do you know them?

291
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,787
I made him some noodles
for dinner.

292
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,526
You can heat them up
and eat with him if you want.

293
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,591
I can't.
I got to go.

294
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,501
You can heat them up
and eat with him.

295
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,462
It's Friday.

296
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,595
Do I give a shit?

297
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,536
The Torah says you can't
light a fire on Shabbos

298
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,702
- 'cause it's work, correct?
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,247
But if alternating current
is running through the wires

300
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,374
every second of every day
and I turn on a switch

301
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,281
sending it here
instead of there,

302
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,547
how is that lighting a fire?

303
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,748
- Do chickens give milk?
- Exactly.

304
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,962
Who's this?

305
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,659
It's Dennis Leary.

306
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,735
Funny?

307
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,770
Mmm, not like
your Uncle Mitch.

308
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,136
He was funny.

309
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,774
Mmm.

310
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:24,503
Hello?

311
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,306
- Daniel Balint?
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,542
This is Guy Danielsen.
I'm a reporter and I'm doing

313
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,517
a piece on right wing groups
post Oklahoma City.

314
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,519
A reporter for who?

315
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,988
"Rolling Stone," "Esquire,"
"New York Times."

316
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,889
- I write for a lot of places.
- "New York Times"?

317
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,723
Yeah, and uh... listen,

318
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,060
I hear you have
a lot of interesting ideas.

319
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,225
- Who told you that?
- Isn't it true?

320
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,962
No.

321
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,766
Yeah, it's true.

322
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,207
How'd you get this number?

323
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,436
Danny.

324
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,411
Hey, Guy Danielsen.

325
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,743
You? You looked different
at that meeting.

326
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,908
Well, you know.

327
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,577
So the other night,
you said that you thought

328
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,554
the modern world
was a Jewish disease.

329
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,113
Can you elaborate on that
a little bit?

330
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,059
In the movement,
this racialist movement,

331
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,857
we believe there is
a hierarchy of races.

332
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,661
You know, whites at the top,
blacks at the bottom.

333
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,897
Asians, Arabs, Latins...
somewhere in between.

334
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,438
Why are you writing this down
if you're recording it?

335
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,870
It helps me concentrate.

336
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:33,074
Danny,
what about the Jews?

337
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,774
Jews, Judaism--

338
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,646
it's like a sickness.

339
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,014
How is Judaism a sickness?

340
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,111
Take sexuality.

341
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,418
- Sexuality?
- Yeah.

342
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,516
- What do you mean?
- You ever fuck a Jewish girl?

343
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,083
What?

344
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,595
Did you ever fuck one?

345
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,530
Well, yeah...

346
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,831
I mean,
I've been out with--

347
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,633
There you go.
What did you notice?

348
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,707
Like what?

349
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,606
Jewish girls
love to give head.

350
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,941
Right?

351
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,981
Yeah, sure. I don't know.
Is that right?

352
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,415
- And Jewish men love to get it.
- Everybody likes to get it.

353
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:15,784
Yes, it's very pleasurable,
but Jews are obsessed with it.

354
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,789
You want to know why?

355
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,815
Yes, why?

356
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,726
Because a Jew
is essentially female.

357
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,824
- Female.
- Yeah.

358
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,028
Real men--
white, Christian men--

359
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:33,698
we fuck a woman, we make her
come with our cocks.

360
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,707
But a Jew doesn't like
to penetrate and thrust.

361
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:40,201
He can't assert himself in that way,
so he resorts to these perversions.

362
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,147
Oral sex is technically
a perversion. You know that, right?

363
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:45,582
Yeah.

364
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,110
That's why after a woman's been
with a Jewish man, she's ruined.

365
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,680
She never wants to be
with a normal partner again.

366
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,487
So the Jew's a better lover.

367
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,189
He's not better.
That's not what I said.

368
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:58,855
I said he gives pleasure.

369
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,797
That's actually a weakness.

370
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,665
All right, so...
it's not that...

371
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,967
the Jew runs the media
or that he owns all the banks,

372
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,031
it's that they're
sexually corrupt.

373
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,305
The Jews clearly control
the media and the banks--

374
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,345
investment banks,
not the commercial ones--

375
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,404
but the point is,
they carry out in those realms

376
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,382
the exact same principles
that they display in sexuality.

377
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,180
They undermine traditional life

378
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,915
and they deracinate society.

379
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:26,152
Deracinate--
tear out the roots.

380
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,592
A real people derives
its genius from the land--

381
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,358
from the sun, from the sea,
from the soil.

382
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,296
This is how they know
themselves.

383
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,358
But, like, Jews don't
even have soil.

384
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,096
He has Israel.

385
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:41,265
- Those aren't Jews.
- Of course they're Jews.

386
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,572
Notice the Israelis.

387
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,577
It's a fundamentally
secular society.

388
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,104
They no longer need Judaism
because they have soil.

389
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:51,616
'Cause the real Jew
is a wanderer.

390
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,710
He's a nomad. He's got
no roots and no attachments.

391
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,778
So he universalizes everything.

392
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:59,087
He can't hammer a nail
or plow a field.

393
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:03,288
All he can do is buy, sell, invest
capital and manipulate markets.

394
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,296
You know, it's like all mental.

395
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,391
He takes the life of a people
that's rooted in soil,

396
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,662
and then he turns it
into this cosmopolitan culture

397
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,865
based on books
and numbers and ideas.

398
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,908
You know, this is
his strength.

399
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:17,910
Take the greatest
Jewish minds ever--

400
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,777
Marx, Freud, Einstein--
what have they given us?

401
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:23,907
Communism,
infantile sexuality,

402
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,814
and the atom bomb.

403
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,751
In the mere three centuries
it's taken these people

404
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,482
to emerge
from the ghettos of Europe,

405
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,956
they've ripped us out
of a world of order and reason.

406
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:35,517
They've thrown us into a chaos
of class warfare,

407
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,426
irrational urges,
relativity,

408
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:42,991
into a world where the existence of
matter and meaning is in question.

409
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:46,766
Why? 'Cause it's the deepest
impulse of a Jewish soul

410
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,104
to pull at the fabric of life till
there's nothing left but a thread.

411
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,474
They want nothing
but nothingness.

412
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:54,342
Nothingness without end.

413
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,142
Wow.

414
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:58,012
Danny, this is great.

415
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,814
You're incredibly articulate.

416
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,251
But one thing--

417
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,051
how can you believe
all of this

418
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:12,461
when you're a Jew yourself?

419
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,133
Excuse me?

420
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,099
Do you know a rabbi
Stanley Nadelman?

421
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:26,976
He was at the congregation
Oheb Zedeck.

422
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,776
Who?
How would I know him?

423
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,941
He said you were
bar mitzvahed there

424
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,248
in March of 1988.

425
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,345
He said--
and you believe that?

426
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,049
And you call yourself
a real reporter?

427
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,115
Okay, so you're saying
that's not true.

428
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:43,458
Do I look Jewish to you?

429
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,190
Look at this.

430
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,858
Were you ever bar mitzvahed
anywhere else?

431
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,198
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with here?

432
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,201
No.

433
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:53,204
Who am I fucking with here?

434
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,706
- Not a--
- Not a what?

435
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,539
Fuck you.

436
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,101
Why would Nadelman lie to me?

437
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,636
To discredit me.

438
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:04,205
- Yeah, right.
- I know who they are.

439
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,219
I already explained this
to you, Guy.

440
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,814
These people will say and do
anything. It's all narrative.

441
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,357
Are you going to put
what he said in your paper?

442
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:16,589
- Give me a reason not to.
- 'Cause it's slander.

443
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,459
'Cause it's reckless disregard.

444
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,897
'Cause I'm gonna sue
your fucking Jew paper, that's why.

445
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,595
So you're denying
that what he said is true?

446
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,159
Yes or no?

447
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,643
All right, you know,
take it easy.

448
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,773
Hey...

449
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,182
look at me, Guy.

450
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,744
You can't even
look at me now, right?

451
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,426
Danny, please don't.

452
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,522
You put that in
"The New York Times," Guy...

453
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,934
and I'm going to kill myself.

454
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:04,903
Avi,

455
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,037
go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.

456
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,082
Danny.

457
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,107
Daniel Balint!

458
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,982
Come back!

459
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,672
Is this it?

460
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,910
Thought there was people here.

461
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,821
I'll go look.

462
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,397
Hey, we're from New York.

463
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,664
Curtis Zampf invited us.

464
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,570
Who?
I don't know no Curtis.

465
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,734
Then what are you all
doing here? Circle jerk?

466
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,471
Yeah, you want to join in?
You look pretty good.

467
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,173
I pitch.

468
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,175
- Whit.
- Billings.

469
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,153
- Hi.
- Kyle.

470
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,722
Danny.

471
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,485
Hey, how are you doing?

472
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,464
- Whoo!
- Damn.

473
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,899
Hey, motherfucker.
Welcome, fuckface.

474
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,770
Hey, come give me a kiss.

475
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,110
You're not
in New York anymore.

476
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,464
Get up!

477
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,933
Get up!

478
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,396
Had enough? Huh?!

479
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:46,066
Which room was his room?

480
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,130
He had the small cabin
down there.

481
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,642
Look, Hitler in '39 took out the RAF,

482
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,219
which he could've easily--
easily have done.

483
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,085
Then he could've taken England.
Then the US would never even--

484
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,181
The final staging ground for the invasion.

485
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,920
But he didn't-- he blew it
by going after civilian targets.

486
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,519
Just the way he blew it
on the Russian front--

487
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,497
- Stalingrad?
- Gettysburg.

488
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:17,024
We're re-fighting it
with World War I technology.

489
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,900
It's a fucking bloodbath.

490
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,969
It's about time somebody
kicked that guy's ass.

491
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,771
He's a fucking animal.

492
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,369
Not anymore.

493
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:29,971
You should've done it.

494
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,913
Yeah, right, like I could do
something like that.

495
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,079
Die, motherfucker.

496
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,385
You guys know anything
about explosives?

497
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,058
Hell yeah.

498
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,099
Good.

499
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,564
Now remember, you control the gun.

500
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,469
Okay? A gun doesn't
control you. Relax.

501
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,770
Take a deep breath and let it out
as you pull the trigger.

502
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,676
Okay, again.

503
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,920
Which one were you
aiming at?

504
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,194
Father.

505
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,263
Check this guy out.

506
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,958
Hey, Drake.

507
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,406
Nice shooting.

508
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,215
The prisoner returns.

509
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,347
Danny!

510
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,915
Help yourself to a drink.
I'll be there in a moment.

511
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,404
Why won't you talk to me?

512
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,315
- When can I see you?
- You can't.

513
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,512
I got to go see my father.

514
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:52,113
- I'm coming to your room tonight.
- No, you're not.

515
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:55,523
- I am whether you like it or not.
- Carla?

516
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,493
Fine.

517
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,657
12:00.

518
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,758
But not through the house,
they'll hear you.

519
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,826
Use the porch roof.

520
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:08,138
I'll leave the window open.

521
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,541
Hey, I was just coming
to say goodbye.

522
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,180
I'm going to Boston.
Convert the lefties.

523
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,989
- Where's Mrs. Moebius and, uh...
- Carla?

524
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,086
She left about an hour ago.

525
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,299
How soon could you
be back in the city?

526
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,063
About a week or so.

527
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,229
There's something I want
to do out here first.

528
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,169
Oh yeah?
What's that?

529
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,134
Make an impact.

530
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,942
Skater boys.

531
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,449
Nice board, kid.

532
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,329
I'll take the Pap smear to go.

533
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,135
- The gentile fish.
- Ooh, I like his hair.

534
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,903
Who does your hair?

535
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:29,209
- What's Drake having?
- He'll have the waiter.

536
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,772
- You guys know what you want?
- We sure do.

537
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:36,618
Could I get a ham and cheese...
on white?

538
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,453
We don't serve ham,
we don't serve cheese.

539
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:42,926
- Well, they serve white.
- What the fuck do you serve?

540
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,987
That's why you have the menus.

541
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,931
Could I have roast beef
with Swiss?

542
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,060
- We don't serve cheese.
- What's wrong with cheese?

543
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,799
This is a kosher restaurant.
We don't serve meat with dairy.

544
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:57,102
What about with chicken?

545
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,767
Chicken's meat.

546
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:02,507
It says in the Bible you don't see
the kid in its mother's milk,

547
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,844
but chicken's don't give milk.

548
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:08,375
You guys want cheese that badly,
there's a pizza place next door.

549
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,945
- You can go there.
- Okay. It's stupid though, right?

550
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,820
I mean, admit that it's stupid.

551
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,621
You ever milk a chicken?

552
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:18,492
No, I won't admit
it's stupid.

553
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:21,328
You can have chicken with eggs
but you can't have it with milk?

554
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,264
Why is that?

555
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,826
- All right. Steve?
- Oh, Steve.

556
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,839
- Maybe Steve can explain it.
- Hi, Steve.

557
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:32,377
Steve, come over here.
You can explain this to us.

558
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,571
- Stevie boy.
- Stevie got a stick.

559
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,240
- I got a stick, too.
- No, no, no, let's ask him.

560
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,976
- Oh, sweetie.
- Hey.

561
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:42,509
- Got a problem here?
- We fucking do, bitch.

562
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,648
We don't understand why
you can't have chicken with milk.

563
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,192
It doesn't make sense.

564
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,093
Religion's not
about making sense.

565
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,690
It's about the incomprehensible,
Steve. Not the idiotic.

566
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,366
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

567
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,167
That explains it.
Now we understand.

568
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:04,469
Don't point your fucking finger
in his face, understand?

569
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,339
Why don't you guys
just get out of here?

570
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,073
-...finger out of my face.
- My store.

571
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,846
Well...

572
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:16,684
since this fight seems to have been
instigated equally by both sides,

573
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,223
I'm going
to give you a choice.

574
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,725
You can spend 30 days in jail,

575
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:25,252
or you can take
some sensitivity training

576
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,198
with some people whose experiences
have been different from yours.

577
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,803
When I refused
to have sex with him,

578
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:37,038
the warden ordered
my sister Esther shot...

579
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,942
right in front of me.

580
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:43,812
Everyone considered it my fault,
so after that, of course,

581
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,817
I did anything he wanted.

582
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:51,581
Who'd want to fuck her, anyway?

583
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,589
I hear one more
remark like that,

584
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,118
and we go back to court
for re-sentencing. Sit down, please!

585
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,792
He was a pig like you,
so perhaps he had no taste.

586
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:06,063
Thank you, Mrs. Frankel.

587
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:11,569
The man was afraid to let us
hide on his farm any longer.

588
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:16,103
But he agreed to take us
to a more remote place.

589
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,706
But on the way,

590
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,945
we were stopped
by a checkpoint.

591
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,545
When the soldiers
found us in the hay,

592
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:30,051
one of them tried to take
my son out of my arms.

593
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:34,098
He began to cry,
so I held onto him.

594
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,761
Not to refuse the soldier,
but simply--

595
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:42,398
simply to assure my son
I was there.

596
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,374
But...

597
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,501
the sergeant became enraged.

598
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,515
He stuck his bayonet...

599
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:56,043
in my son's chest and
lifted him up impaled on it.

600
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,586
My son was three years old.

601
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:05,921
He held him so that
the blood spurting out of him

602
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,228
fell on my face.

603
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,093
Soldiers were laughing.

604
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,167
And when the blood stopped,

605
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:20,643
the sergeant pushed my son

606
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,510
off his bayonet and said...

607
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:28,213
"There, you can
have him now."

608
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,222
What'd you do?

609
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,623
What are you trying to say?

610
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,957
What did you do while the sergeant
was killing your son?

611
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,759
What could he have done?

612
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,992
What could he have done?

613
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,865
Sergeant's killing his kid.
What could he have done?!

614
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,428
He could've jumped the guy,
gouged his eyes out,

615
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,939
- grabbed his bayonet--
- They would've shot him.

616
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,205
He would've been dead
in two seconds.

617
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:53,801
- Who are you to judge?
- So he's dead!

618
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:57,576
Big deal! He's worse than dead now.
He's a piece of shit!

619
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,139
Okay, that's it.
You're going back.

620
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,152
- What should he have done?
- Danny, don't listen to him.

621
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,883
- It's all a bunch of crap.
- What's crap?

622
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:08,256
The so-called holocaust.
It never happened.

623
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,124
- Oh, please.
- It's true, Danny.

624
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,357
There was no six million.

625
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:17,094
At most, 200,000 Jews died
in the camps, and the majority--

626
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:19,433
Have you studied
the deportation figures?

627
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,495
The Nazis kept records.

628
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,803
If Hitler didn't kill
six million Jews,

629
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,139
why in the hell
is he a hero?

630
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,570
He's got concentration camps
all over Europe,

631
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:32,778
and he only manages to get rid
of a measly 200,000?

632
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,546
- He's a fucking putz!
- Hitler wasn't a putz.

633
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:39,318
Hitler was real.
God created him

634
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,689
to punish the Jews
for abandoning the Torah.

635
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:45,456
- For God's sakes, Chaim, not here.
- Remember who you're talking to.

636
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,555
It is you who are putzes.

637
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:51,000
You little pishers...

638
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:53,503
with your dreams
of hatred and killing.

639
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:57,030
What do you think you would
have done if you had been there?

640
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,101
Not what he did.
Just stand there and watch?

641
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,476
How do you know?

642
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:04,140
You've never been tested
like he has.

643
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:07,845
Here in this rich, safe,
stupid country

644
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,547
it is so easy
to imagine oneself a hero.

645
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:15,958
But you have no idea what it was
like. You can't conceive of it.

646
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:19,088
Everything--
all of Europe--

647
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,065
was designed to break
one's will.

648
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:26,594
Millions went to camps.
Many stronger, braver than you.

649
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:28,936
They did nothing,

650
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,271
just as you would
have done nothing.

651
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,278
Where do you think you're going?

652
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,375
We have nothing to learn
from these people.

653
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,477
They should be
learning from us.

654
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:45,955
And what should we learn
from you, Daniel?

655
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,959
Kill your enemy.

656
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,463
- What?
- Let me show you something.

657
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,966
- What is it?
- Black powder,

658
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:04,406
blasting caps,
3/4-inch galvanized pipe.

659
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,910
- Enough to blow up a lot of people.
- Good.

660
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,047
Hey, Danny.

661
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:12,946
- Shit! Where's the light?
- Get off my fucking foot.

662
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,083
- Get the fuck off my foot, man.
- Fuck you.

663
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:16,620
It's over here.

664
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,550
Fucking shit.

665
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,391
Oooh.

666
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:33,801
- Jew world!
- Yeah! Whoo!

667
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,965
Pass! Pass!

668
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,169
- I'm open. Hit me!
- Yeah!

669
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,075
- Hey, over here, over here.
- Touchdown!

670
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,807
Yeah, baby, yeah!

671
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:55,384
Come on, man!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:17,943
Shut up.
Fuck you.

673
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,882
What?

674
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,055
Nothing.
What is it?

675
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:30,152
Let's take one of these panels off,
hook it under the bima.

676
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:43,937
Huh.

677
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:55,851
Wow, man,
look at this thing.

678
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,082
Hey,
what are you guys doing?

679
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,260
Hey, hey, put it back.

680
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,457
- Hey.
- Put it back.

681
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,362
- Fore!
- Look at the fucking thing.

682
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,891
Oh man, it's like a treasure.

683
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,132
Look at this.

684
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:20,944
' If I were king
of the forest '

685
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,310
' Not prince, not duke. '

686
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:25,440
All right,
all right, it's set.

687
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,246
- It's set?
- Mm-hmm.

688
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:30,379
- Okay, we should go.
- Come look at this fucking thing.

689
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,514
- Holy shit!
- Oh, that's weird.

690
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,455
- What the--
- They read right to left.

691
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:36,721
Look like squashed bugs.

692
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,763
- What kind of paper is this?
- Is it ink?

693
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,026
- Is it blood?
- No, they use soy, man.

694
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,931
- Danny, you all right?
- Soy.

695
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,437
Neat calligraphy.

696
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,243
It's called
the flame alphabet.

697
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:58,339
They think it's the word
of God written in fire.

698
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,476
- Cool.
- How come you know all this shit?

699
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:04,650
How come you don't?

700
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:07,156
How can you say you hate Jews if
you don't know anything about 'em?

701
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,819
Fuck you. I hate the Jews
just as much as you do.

702
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:12,125
Really?
What's shatnez?

703
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,687
Tzitzith?

704
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:15,255
- Titties.
- What?

705
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,029
- Tefillin?
- Who cares?

706
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:18,967
You know the kaddish
from the kiddish?

707
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,538
If you do hate something, you study
it so you know why you hate it.

708
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:25,303
Eichmann? He studied the Torah,
the Talmud, the Mishnah--

709
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:28,369
the whole thing.
He hated Jews.

710
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,176
- Who's Eichmann?
- Who's Eichmann?

711
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,615
Eichmann was head of
the Gestapo's Jewish sector.

712
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,585
He deported people
to the camps.

713
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:41,384
- Hey, don't touch the letters.
- Why the fuck not?

714
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:44,291
- Just don't!
- Fucking asshole.

715
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:46,591
Did you see
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"?

716
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,723
What?

717
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,098
That was an ark, man.
That was a Torah.

718
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,397
They fucked around with it
and melted their faces.

719
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:56,906
- That was a movie, asshole.
- Go ahead, touch the letters.

720
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:04,238
- Touch the letters, I dare ya.
- Let me see.

721
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:05,977
Touch it, man.

722
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,050
Hey. Hey!

723
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:13,056
What do you think of that?!

724
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,389
Fuck you!

725
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:20,659
Fuck them!
Fuck you!

726
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,001
Let's go.

727
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,806
Come on, man, let's get
the fuck out of here.

728
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,292
Hey! Let's go!

729
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:16,420
Everyone's wary out here
about what's going to happen next.

730
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:19,319
- Oh shit, guys, this is it.
- Hi, I'm Cindy Pomerantz,

731
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:21,120
- with Channel 8 News...
- Guys! Guys!

732
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,990
- with Rabbi Malcolm Greenwald.
- Guys! Get in here. This is it.

733
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:28,191
How is it that tragedy and disaster
were averted in the Temple?

734
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:32,929
The power cell on the timer
gave out precisely 13 minutes...

735
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,904
- Shit.
-...before it was set to go off.

736
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,669
Once again, God intervened
to save the Jewish people.

737
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:41,303
Cindy, as you know,

738
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:44,143
13 is a mystical number
in the Jewish faith.

739
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:47,207
We believe that God
has 13 attributes

740
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,718
of which the highest
is "Ain Sof,"

741
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:52,245
which means "without end"

742
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,553
or sometimes it means,
"nothingness without end."

743
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:58,152
"Nothingness without end."

744
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,789
Interesting.

745
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,663
It's the purest
form of spirit.

746
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,397
- Fuck.
- Thank you so much, Rabbi.

747
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,063
Somebody turn on cartoons.

748
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,164
I'm Cindy Pomerantz
with Channel 8 News,

749
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:13,005
and I'm standing
in front of Temple...

750
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,379
Danny!

751
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:37,218
- What?
- Phone!

752
00:52:45,697 --> 00:52:49,098
- Hello.
- Hey, Daniel Balint, how you doing?

753
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,297
- Who's this?
- It's Guy Danielsen.

754
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,633
Whatever happened
to your article?

755
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,837
I couldn't get
an editor to run it.

756
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:04,507
But I bet I can now that you put
a bomb in the synagogue.

757
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:07,050
That was you,
wasn't it, Danny?

758
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,749
Hey.

759
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,220
You want to kill a Jew?

760
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,328
It's right up there.

761
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,547
Just park around the corner
and we'll walk back.

762
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:51,061
There's the applause.
It must be over.

763
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:52,891
Lie on your stomach.

764
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,797
Come up on your elbows.

765
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,391
Why me?

766
00:53:57,468 --> 00:54:00,801
'Cause you want to kill a Jew,
and I already did.

767
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,200
Really?

768
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,867
Who'd you kill?

769
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:07,672
Four of them.

770
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,407
But no one this important.

771
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,209
How'd you know
they were Jews?

772
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,775
I can tell.

773
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,812
How?

774
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,882
I was a Jew
in a previous life.

775
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,619
- Thank you all very much.
- Here they come.

776
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:29,497
Thank you.
Thank you again.

777
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,626
Shoot him in the head.
Always shoot a Jew in the head.

778
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:36,196
- I'm a bad shot.
- Just keep him in the crosshairs.

779
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,273
Right there.

780
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:45,305
Squeeze the trigger...
slowly.

781
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,113
- Do it.
- Good night, thank you again.

782
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:49,550
- Oh my God!
- Damn it!

783
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,850
- You missed on purpose.
- No, I didn't.

784
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:54,585
I had him in the crosshairs
like you said. I'm a bad shot.

785
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,127
- What's this?
- What?

786
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:59,288
Fucking kike.
I knew it.

787
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:07,671
It came from over there.

788
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:27,516
The whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred

789
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:31,460
by what happened at Mount Moriah.
And we still live in terror.

790
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,361
Fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.

791
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,092
Fear of God makes you
afraid of everything.

792
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,728
All the Jews are good at is being
afraid and being sacrificed.

793
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:42,534
Do you even believe in God?

794
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:45,337
I'm the only one
who does believe.

795
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,538
I see Him for the power-drunk
madman that He is.

796
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,241
And we're supposed to worship
such a deity? I say never!

797
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:58,083
Avi, go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.

798
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:02,523
And you-- if you had come out of
Egypt you would have been destroyed

799
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:05,585
in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.

800
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,428
Then let Him destroy me now.

801
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:11,764
Let Him crush me like
the conceited bully that He is.

802
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,827
Go ahead.

803
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:16,135
Danny!

804
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,368
Daniel Balint!

805
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,844
Come back!

806
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,758
- How are things going?
- Fine.

807
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:45,029
We'd like to talk to you
about something.

808
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,135
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

809
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:55,442
We are about to launch an aboveground,
intellectually serious,

810
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,446
fascist movement.

811
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:00,551
We want to build bridges
to certain positions in politics.

812
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,849
Works like "The Bell Curve,"
"Sociobiology,"

813
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:04,683
"Earth First,"
"The Genome Project."

814
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,815
We want to have lectures, invite
blacks and Jews and liberals.

815
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:10,258
Chomsky speaks,
Stanley Crouch.

816
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:13,455
You know, I've been waiting my whole
life for something like this.

817
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,964
We want you to help us run it.

818
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,865
Give speeches,
lead seminars.

819
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,938
Handle the fundraising.

820
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,973
Handle the fundraising?

821
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:25,474
We need someone
with intelligence.

822
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:29,137
Well, what about the synagogues
and Manzetti and all of that?

823
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:32,011
We need intellectuals.
We have enough thugs.

824
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,846
I'm not an intellectual.

825
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:36,785
I read, but...

826
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:39,789
fundraising,
it's just-- it's--

827
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:43,157
Danny, we want you
to talk to people.

828
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:45,627
Can you do that for us?

829
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,132
Well yeah, sure,
I can, you know...

830
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:53,067
Do you have a decent suit?

831
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,764
We'll get him one.

832
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,932
We'll sort him out.
We'll...

833
00:57:57,008 --> 00:57:59,704
get him a cell phone

834
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,005
and anything else he needs.

835
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:23,021
- Where'd you get this?
- Where'd I get what?

836
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:26,763
What are you doing?

837
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,594
Where'd you get it?

838
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,126
I stole it from
the synagogue.

839
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:34,896
Can you read it?

840
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:38,567
Lookit, put something on. You're not
supposed to be naked in front of it.

841
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,271
Why not?

842
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:45,511
Because it's-- they think
it's the word of God

843
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:47,607
and it's holy
and the flesh isn't.

844
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:50,482
That's stupid.

845
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:53,387
Yes, it's stupid.
Put something on.

846
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,720
You see, the Jews love
to separate things.

847
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,121
Holy from the profane,
the meat from the milk,

848
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:03,393
wool from the linen,
Sabbath from the week,

849
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:07,198
Jew from the gentile,
as if one little scrap of this

850
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,262
is going to completely
contaminate that.

851
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,370
Who gets contaminated,

852
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,707
the Jews or the gentiles?

853
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:18,078
That's a good question.

854
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,174
How come there's
no punctuation?

855
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:27,055
That was a later invention,
and, you know,

856
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,889
Jews don't really need it because
they know the whole thing by heart.

857
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,155
Every word and every letter.

858
01:00:32,263 --> 01:00:34,663
Do you know it like that?

859
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,665
By heart?

860
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:38,362
No.

861
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,630
But you can read it, right?

862
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:42,229
The Hebrew?

863
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:46,102
- What do you care?
- Because I want to know.

864
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,707
What's this word?

865
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,577
Don't touch it.

866
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,582
Um... that's...

867
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,083
"vayomar."

868
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,819
"And he said."

869
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,915
What did he say?

870
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,741
What does it mean?

871
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,211
"And God said to Avraham,

872
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,579
'Take yourself
away from your land,

873
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:28,675
away from the place you were born,
away from your father's house...

874
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:34,182
and go to a new land,
a place that I will show you.'"

875
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,358
I want you
to teach it to me.

876
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,565
Why?

877
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,329
Know your enemy.

878
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:50,031
Because it's a basic text
of Western culture,

879
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:53,167
and I want to read it
in the original, okay?

880
01:01:53,244 --> 01:01:57,010
Listen, it's extremely difficult.
It would take you years to learn it.

881
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,049
I'm good at languages.

882
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,855
Okay.

883
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,155
Will you get that piece of paper
and that pen over there?

884
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,664
- Aleph.
- It looks like a little swastika.

885
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:24,297
Huh?

886
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,401
It's silent and it takes a vowel.
There aren't any vowels,

887
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:29,969
they're just like little dots
that go underneath the letters.

888
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,241
I'll get you a chumash.

889
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:36,949
- Bet.
- Bet.

890
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:39,551
- Gimmel.
- Gimmel.

891
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:43,192
- Dalet.
- Dalet.

892
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

893
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:49,297
How come you're here
and not with Curtis?

894
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,301
And don't say it's 'cause
of the free Hebrew lesson.

895
01:02:52,403 --> 01:02:54,428
Sex is better.

896
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,335
Even though he's--
he's got such a big dick?

897
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,512
Well, with you there's
a tragic dimension.

898
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,786
How many of you consider
yourself anti-Semites?

899
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:18,957
Good.

900
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,758
Actually the term's
a bit imprecise,

901
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,129
seeing as Jews are only
one of the Semitic peoples.

902
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:26,431
But for our purposes,
we'll say that an anti-Semite

903
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:29,973
is someone that hates
or is against Jews.

904
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,337
Why do we hate 'em?

905
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,139
Let me put it this way...

906
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:39,648
do we hate them 'cause
they go where they don't belong?

907
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:44,252
Or do we hate them 'cause they're
clannish and keep to themselves?

908
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:47,519
'Cause they're tight with money,
or 'cause they flash it around?

909
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,560
'Cause they're Bolsheviks or
because they're capitalists?

910
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:54,257
'Cause they have the highest IQs
or the most active sex lives?

911
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:57,866
You want to know the real reason
why we hate 'em?

912
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,903
'Cause we hate 'em.

913
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,996
'Cause they exist.

914
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:06,338
'Cause it's an axiom of civilization
that just as man longs for woman,

915
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,743
loves his children and
fears death, he hates Jews.

916
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:13,180
There's no reason.
And if there were,

917
01:04:13,284 --> 01:04:15,844
some smart-ass kike would try
and come up with an argument,

918
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,014
try and prove us wrong, which would
only make us hate them even more.

919
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:22,217
Really, we have all the reasons
we need in three simple letters.

920
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:24,818
J-E-W.

921
01:04:24,895 --> 01:04:27,386
Jew. You say it
a million times,

922
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,695
it's the only word
that never loses its meaning.

923
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,268
Jew, Jew, Jew.

924
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:36,329
Jew. Jew. Jew, Jew, Jew,
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew!

925
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:42,976
I'll give your group
1,000 bucks.

926
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:47,349
You gave 50,000
to that college magazine.

927
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:49,909
Things were possible then
that aren't now.

928
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,823
I actually feel this moment
has a lot of possibilities.

929
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,587
I read your piece.

930
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,288
It's very smart...
and very wrong.

931
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:01,331
In what ways?

932
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,960
Forget the Jewish stuff.
It doesn't play anymore.

933
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,799
There's only the market now,
and it doesn't care who you are.

934
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,870
People still need
values and beliefs.

935
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:14,274
No, they don't.
Not the smart ones.

936
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:16,677
Look...

937
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:20,444
I'll give you five grand if you can
document your tax exempt status.

938
01:05:21,552 --> 01:05:24,112
But when you fall
off this horse, come see me.

939
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:26,588
I can show you how
to make a lot of money.

940
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:28,648
I don't care about money.

941
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:31,552
You will.

942
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:35,061
You're a Jew.

943
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,599
You may not realize it,
but you are.

944
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:40,364
Maybe I am.
Maybe we're all Jews now.

945
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:41,961
What's the difference?

946
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,641
What about Drake?

947
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,149
Did he ever show up?

948
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:56,709
No, man, it's weird.
No one's seen him.

949
01:05:56,787 --> 01:06:00,689
This is going to be a completely
different kind of device, okay?

950
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:04,285
Stupid thing. Do you have
any idea how that made me look

951
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:05,794
in front of Curtis and Lina?

952
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,591
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?

953
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:10,895
I got a brand new timer
plus a backup power source.

954
01:06:12,503 --> 01:06:14,232
Gotta kill some Jews.

955
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,568
That's all I ever talk about,

956
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,130
and this time
it's got to happen.

957
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,108
It will.

958
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,147
You should go.

959
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,975
On Shabbos, is it permitted
to pick up the phone

960
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:09,575
if it's been ringing long?

961
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,245
No. It could be
a wrong number.

962
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,221
But if you think it might be
a relative needing help,

963
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,757
you should knock the phone off
the hook with your elbow

964
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,657
and listen to see
who's on the line.

965
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,929
May we peel oranges
on Shabbos?

966
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,867
Danny?

967
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,435
Danny.

968
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:39,072
Hey! It's Stuart.

969
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,640
Schoenbaum. Schlomo.

970
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,779
- Schlomo.
- Danny. God...

971
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:49,849
God, it's been years.

972
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,196
How you doing?
What are you doing?

973
01:08:57,267 --> 01:09:00,293
I'm doing great. I'm at
the rabbinic program up at JTS.

974
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:04,170
- JTS.
- What are you doing?

975
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,798
Something strange I bet.

976
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:10,542
No, just-- it's kind
of an underground thing.

977
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,582
Like an artist?

978
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,811
No, uh...

979
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,978
like a private business.

980
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,519
Hey, you remember Miriam.

981
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:23,591
Yeah.

982
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:25,059
Hey.

983
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:27,255
- Hey.
- She's at Yale Law now,

984
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,026
interning for
the District Attorney.

985
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:31,363
We're getting married
next spring in Jerusalem.

986
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,361
That's great.

987
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:37,202
Maybe Danny'd like to come
to the minyan for Rosh Hashanah.

988
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:40,299
Great idea. We're davening
with a group from the seminary.

989
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,506
Guess who comes? Avi. You two
can go at it like you used to.

990
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:46,879
Danny and Avi used to argue
about everything.

991
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,044
Talmud, Torah,
politics, girls--

992
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,247
- It always ended in a fistfight.
- I remember.

993
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:55,621
- I always won.
- The arguments, anyway.

994
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:59,161
Here, it's up at KI,
up on 101 st.

995
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,026
Try to make it.

996
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,530
It could be fun.

997
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:08,161
Yeah.

998
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,570
' My country 'tis of thee '

999
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:16,101
' Sweet land of liberty '

1000
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:19,671
' Of thee I sing. '

1001
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,382
"To make no graven image
of the Lord

1002
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:55,713
or the form of any figure
or of man or woman

1003
01:10:55,786 --> 01:10:58,778
or of anything that looks
like anything,

1004
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,790
because He's not
like anything."

1005
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:03,724
Not only can you not
see Him or hear Him,

1006
01:11:03,794 --> 01:11:06,854
but you can't even
think about Him?

1007
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,457
What's the difference between that
and Him not existing at all?

1008
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:14,563
There's no difference.

1009
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:19,908
Christianity's silly, but at least
there's something to believe in.

1010
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,808
Or not believe.

1011
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:23,846
I mean, Judaism
there's nothing.

1012
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:26,075
Nothing but nothingness.

1013
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,683
Judaism's not
really about belief.

1014
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:32,278
It's about doing things.

1015
01:11:32,356 --> 01:11:34,483
Keeping the Sabbath,
lighting candles,

1016
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:36,526
visiting the sick.

1017
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,552
And belief follows?

1018
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,063
Nothing follows.

1019
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,795
You don't do it because
it's smart or it's stupid.

1020
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:48,736
You don't do it because you get
saved, because nobody gets saved.

1021
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:51,831
You do it because the Torah tells
you to and you submit to the Torah.

1022
01:11:51,942 --> 01:11:53,705
That is fucked.

1023
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:56,143
Don't swear in front of it,
okay?

1024
01:11:56,246 --> 01:11:58,737
- Why should I submit?
- You shouldn't.

1025
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:04,880
You think I should just
because there's no reason?

1026
01:12:04,955 --> 01:12:07,480
I think you shouldn't.

1027
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:11,687
Judaism doesn't need a God. You have
the Torah. That's your fucking God.

1028
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:13,923
The book's closed.

1029
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,467
I think your Hebrew's
getting real good.

1030
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:25,632
I told you
I was good at this.

1031
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:28,837
You also have nothing else
to do all day, so...

1032
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:32,678
Are you saying I learned it
better and faster than you did?

1033
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:36,315
Maybe it's because
I'm smarter.

1034
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:39,589
You think that's funny?

1035
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,487
You think Jews are
the only smart ones?

1036
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,693
You think I'm Jewish?

1037
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:51,393
It's all you ever talk about.
Jewish, Jewish, Jewish.

1038
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:55,130
Only people that ever talk
about it that much are Jews.

1039
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,571
Nazis talk about it
all the time.

1040
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:59,700
Do they?

1041
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,744
Real ones.

1042
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:04,838
Hitler and Goebbels,
they talked about it incessantly.

1043
01:13:04,915 --> 01:13:07,213
Is that why
you became a Nazi,

1044
01:13:07,317 --> 01:13:09,842
to talk about Jews
incessantly?

1045
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,855
- You want a punch in the mouth?
- Okay.

1046
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:20,426
Let's light candles on Friday

1047
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,997
and say the kaddish.

1048
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,131
Kaddish is a prayer
for the dead.

1049
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:29,467
Kiddish.
Say the kiddish.

1050
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:31,837
Light candles.

1051
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:36,944
Come on.
We could shave my head,

1052
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,210
fuck through a sheet--
all that stuff.

1053
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:42,545
Let's just try it.

1054
01:14:05,509 --> 01:14:07,170
He said to him, "Abraham."

1055
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,404
And then he answered,
"Here I am."

1056
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:12,004
Then he said, "Take your son,
your only son...

1057
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:14,846
whom you love, Isaac...

1058
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,079
It's not his only son.

1059
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:19,155
It's the only one he loves.

1060
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,247
- Hey, Avi.
- Hey.

1061
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:25,054
You only kill the ones
you love, is that right?

1062
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,494
What are you doing here?
I thought you were an anti-Semite.

1063
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:29,360
- Would you grow up?
- He's a skinhead.

1064
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,764
It's just a style.
Avi, there are anti-racist skins.

1065
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:34,360
Danny's the racist kind.
You a fascist, Danny?

1066
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:38,498
- He thinks the Jews are wimps.
- What's a fascist?

1067
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,667
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi.
He always was.

1068
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:43,212
- Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
- The Zionists are not Nazis.

1069
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:46,704
They're racist, and act like
Stormtroopers in the territories.

1070
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,151
And do you hate them because
they're wimps or Stormtroopers?

1071
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,451
- They have no extermination camps.
- They have Sabra and Shattila.

1072
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,286
- Do you just hate them?
- That wasn't genocide,

1073
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:58,156
that was the Lebanese killing each
other. The Israelis knew nothing.

1074
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:01,254
They knew-- Sharon encouraged
the Falangists to murder them.

1075
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,765
- We don't know that.
- Ever read "The New York Times"?

1076
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,461
It was a war. People get killed.
I want to know why the Jews

1077
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:09,835
- are held to a higher standard.
- Because we're the chosen people.

1078
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,408
Isn't that right, Daniel?
Isn't that right?

1079
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:16,639
Read early Zionist and European
Jewry. They sound like Goebbels.

1080
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:17,713
They sound like you.

1081
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:20,249
Just how Nazis did everything
Hitler told them,

1082
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:23,013
- you do what the Torah tells you--
- Stop!

1083
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:25,646
- It's identical slave mentality.
- We don't want that in here.

1084
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,690
- Shhh!
- Not in shul.

1085
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:31,420
Why'd you come tonight?
To see me?

1086
01:15:32,429 --> 01:15:33,987
To study Torah.

1087
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:36,294
I thought you hated Torah.

1088
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:38,163
Doesn't mean
I don't like to study it.

1089
01:15:38,235 --> 01:15:40,795
Expose all the lies
and fucked up thinking.

1090
01:15:43,073 --> 01:15:45,871
You know the joke, a Jew's
shipwrecked on a desert island?

1091
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:48,467
When they rescue him they see
he's built two synagogues.

1092
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,775
They say, "For what you build
two synagogues? "

1093
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:52,576
He says,
"One to pray in,

1094
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:56,745
and one to never set foot in
so long as I live, so help me God."

1095
01:15:58,355 --> 01:16:00,846
You pray in the one
you'd never set foot in...

1096
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,117
and vice versa.

1097
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:06,057
This is me.

1098
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,532
Tell me about Lina Moebius.

1099
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:15,230
- How did you know about Lina?
- I work in the DA's office.

1100
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,035
You go to those meetings, half
the people there are informants.

1101
01:16:19,276 --> 01:16:21,176
Like who,
that "Times" guy?

1102
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,645
- Which "Times" guy?
- There's more than one?

1103
01:16:27,284 --> 01:16:29,081
- Fuck.
- Be careful.

1104
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:37,818
Half the right-wing money
in New York is here tonight.

1105
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:40,124
They've come to see you.

1106
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,357
If you impress them...

1107
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,694
if you do what
I know you can,

1108
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:46,235
this movement will be up
and running by tomorrow.

1109
01:16:46,303 --> 01:16:48,533
And we will be
on the front page

1110
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,506
of "The New York Times"
in six months.

1111
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:53,872
- Here he is.
- Is that him?

1112
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,805
Balint. Daniel Balint.

1113
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:22,967
- Does anyone know what that is?
- A Jewish prayer.

1114
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,567
Do you have any idea
why I would say a Jewish prayer?

1115
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:30,477
Because you're a Jew.

1116
01:17:30,547 --> 01:17:32,708
That could be one reason.
What's another?

1117
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,448
Let me put it this way--

1118
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,852
who wants to destroy
the Jews?

1119
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,725
Who wants to grind
their bones into the dust?

1120
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:46,887
Who wants to see them
rise again?

1121
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,656
Wealthier, more successful,

1122
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:52,258
powerful, cultured,
more intelligent than ever.

1123
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:55,771
You know what we have to do?

1124
01:17:59,476 --> 01:18:01,603
We have to love 'em.

1125
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:04,112
What?
Did he say love the Jews?

1126
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,580
It's strange, I know.

1127
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:08,480
But with these people,
nothing is simple.

1128
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:12,510
The Jew says all he wants is
to be left alone to study his Torah,

1129
01:18:12,589 --> 01:18:14,489
do a little business,

1130
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:17,856
fornicate with his oversexed
wife, but it's not true.

1131
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:20,020
He wants to be hated.

1132
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:23,199
He longs for our scorn.

1133
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:26,861
He clings to it as if it were
the very core of his being.

1134
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:30,929
If Hitler had not existed,
the Jews would have invented him.

1135
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:34,543
For without such hatred,

1136
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:37,546
the so-called chosen people
would vanish from the earth.

1137
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,782
And this reveals
a terrible truth,

1138
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,284
and really the crux
of our problem as Nazis.

1139
01:18:43,353 --> 01:18:44,377
The worse the Jews are treated,

1140
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,388
the stronger they become.

1141
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,481
Egyptian slavery
made them a nation,

1142
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,719
the pogroms hardened them,

1143
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:52,853
Auschwitz gave birth
to the State of Israel.

1144
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,199
Suffering, it seems, is
the very crucible of their genius.

1145
01:18:57,267 --> 01:19:00,470
So if the Jews are,
as one of their own has said,

1146
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:03,132
a people who will not
take yes for an answer,

1147
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:06,400
let us say yes to them.

1148
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:10,071
They thrive on opposition?
Let us cease to oppose them.

1149
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:14,879
The only way to annihilate this
insidious people once and for all

1150
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,782
is to open our arms,

1151
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:18,787
invite them into our homes,

1152
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:21,221
and embrace them.

1153
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,725
Only then will they vanish
into assimilation,

1154
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,727
normality and love.

1155
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,763
But we cannot pretend.

1156
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:29,958
The Jew is nothing
if not clever.

1157
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:33,628
He will see through hypocrisy
and condescension.

1158
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,398
To destroy him

1159
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:38,964
we must love him sincerely.

1160
01:19:40,477 --> 01:19:42,570
Yes.

1161
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:45,478
If the Jews are
strengthened by hate,

1162
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:48,517
then wouldn't this "destruction"
that you speak of,

1163
01:19:48,585 --> 01:19:51,110
whether it's by love
or any other means,

1164
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:54,486
wouldn't that make them more
powerful than they are already?

1165
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:56,957
Yes. Infinitely more.

1166
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:59,426
They would become as God.

1167
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:06,030
Lookit, it's the Jews' destiny to be
annihilated so they can be deified.

1168
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:09,230
Jesus understood this
perfectly.

1169
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,866
Look what was accomplished with the
death of just one enlightened Jew.

1170
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,002
Imagine what would happen
if we killed them all?

1171
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,474
So let us say together...

1172
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:24,911
Are you out of your mind?!

1173
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,047
I was just making a point.

1174
01:20:29,759 --> 01:20:31,522
What point?

1175
01:20:33,263 --> 01:20:36,164
I do not want you
working for us anymore.

1176
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:37,790
Lina!

1177
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:39,562
Lina, come here!

1178
01:20:39,636 --> 01:20:42,434
According to the police,
he had just left the restaurant

1179
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,996
and was walking a block
and a half back to his office

1180
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,269
when the gunman
stepped out of this doorway,

1181
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,174
fired seven times at point
blank range,

1182
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:52,339
then fled on foot. Paramedics
arrived within 90 seconds,

1183
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:55,441
but Mr. Manzetti was declared
dead here at the scene.

1184
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:59,318
The assailant is described
as a white male in his 20s...

1185
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:03,257
- You think that I...
- Danny...

1186
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,089
we don't want to know.

1187
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,638
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.

1188
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:31,918
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.

1189
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,722
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?

1190
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,565
Lina Moebius is saying
the whole thing was your idea.

1191
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,043
She said you proposed it
at a meeting at her house.

1192
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,444
Oh, Jesus, Danny.

1193
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:01,847
- I can't help what I think.
- You don't think that.

1194
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:04,250
- I don't?
- Tell me you think it.

1195
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,151
Are you glad Manzetti's dead?
You really want to kill Jews?

1196
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:09,816
You want to kill me?

1197
01:22:14,864 --> 01:22:16,832
What if all along,
you were actually

1198
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:19,026
infiltrating the Nazis
to expose them?

1199
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:20,899
- I wasn't.
- And killing Manzetti

1200
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,268
was just to convince them
you were a real anti-Semite.

1201
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:25,500
If you had any idea somebody'd
actually shoot the guy--

1202
01:22:25,575 --> 01:22:29,671
- It's not true.
- Think about your father, Linda.

1203
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:32,237
You don't care
about the truth at all, do you?

1204
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:33,873
Danny, I'm trying
to save you.

1205
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,646
Fucking...

1206
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,209
kike!

1207
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,668
I need you to get
Lina Moebius on tape...

1208
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:57,929
telling you to do something.
Something violent.

1209
01:22:58,007 --> 01:23:00,510
I don't care about the truth.

1210
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:02,341
I care about you.

1211
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:05,778
Kol Nidre's at 6:30.

1212
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:08,180
I got to meet Stuart.
Come there if you need me.

1213
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,665
What is this?

1214
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:34,676
It's Erev Yom Kippur.

1215
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:36,974
We'll have dinner,
then go to shul.

1216
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:39,276
Atone for our sins.

1217
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:43,914
Come on, we can be
like Eichmann.

1218
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:47,455
He studied Torah,
he hated Jews.

1219
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,888
Is it like Eichmann?
Are you just goofing?

1220
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:55,587
I don't know.

1221
01:23:55,665 --> 01:23:58,725
- I just wanted to try it.
- Why?

1222
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,327
Because God commands it?

1223
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:04,066
I thought God didn't exist.

1224
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:09,344
He commands it
whether He exists or not.

1225
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:13,814
Look, we can fight Him
and be crushed,

1226
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:16,044
or we can submit.

1227
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:17,313
And be crushed.

1228
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,684
But what if...

1229
01:24:19,756 --> 01:24:23,283
what if submitting,
being crushed,

1230
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,691
being nothing,
not mattering--

1231
01:24:25,762 --> 01:24:29,220
what if that's the best feeling
we can have?

1232
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,966
Look, just light
the candles with me.

1233
01:24:35,037 --> 01:24:37,028
You know, then we can eat.
You have to eat.

1234
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:39,734
You eat first,
then you light the candles.

1235
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:42,004
'Cause once you light
the candles

1236
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,205
it's Yom Kippur
and you're fasting.

1237
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,347
I got to go.

1238
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:02,091
Miriam, pick up the phone.
The holiday hasn't even started yet.

1239
01:25:02,165 --> 01:25:03,132
Pick up-- hello?

1240
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,992
Stuart's davening Ne'ilah
tomorrow, right?

1241
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:09,731
'Cause he always does.

1242
01:25:09,806 --> 01:25:11,569
Tell him
I'm doing it instead.

1243
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:13,871
I'm davening.

1244
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:17,071
Tell him if he gives me any trouble,
I'll beat the shit out of him.

1245
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:19,876
- Did you kill Manzetti?
- No, I didn't kill Manzetti.

1246
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:21,849
Drake did.

1247
01:25:25,388 --> 01:25:28,050
Is this 60th?
Turn here. Turn right.

1248
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,648
- Why? Why?
- Just do it.

1249
01:25:31,928 --> 01:25:33,919
Why so fast?
Would you relax?

1250
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,434
- What time should it go off?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1251
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:51,241
7:30 tomorrow night.

1252
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:56,081
7:30 tomorrow.
19:30 minus...

1253
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:57,881
Shh, shh.

1254
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:08,992
- Hand me the tape.
- Here.

1255
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:13,262
It's all reinforced in here. It
won't blow out the way we want it.

1256
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:15,361
Look, I know this guy
at a lumberyard.

1257
01:26:15,438 --> 01:26:17,963
- I can get some dynamite.
- No.

1258
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,440
It has to be tomorrow.
It's gonna be fine,

1259
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,500
as long as it blow up
the pulpit.

1260
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:25,308
- It's not going to blow out--
- Do it.

1261
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:14,187
Ilio Manzetti was one
of the most respected

1262
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:16,424
and influential men
in New York.

1263
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:18,467
As an investment banker,
diplomat,

1264
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:20,365
advisor to presidents
and mayors,

1265
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:22,836
he helped shape public
and private policy

1266
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,499
for more than three decades.

1267
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:28,134
He'll be missed, though.
This is Michael Porter

1268
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,768
for New York 1.

1269
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:34,208
You're saying that when
he first appeared at your house,

1270
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:36,649
you had no idea
that he was Jewish?

1271
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,246
None whatsoever. But I can't say
I'm terribly surprised.

1272
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:42,450
What do you mean?

1273
01:27:42,525 --> 01:27:45,323
I think anti-Semitism today
is largely a Jewish phenomenon.

1274
01:27:45,394 --> 01:27:46,691
Wouldn't you agree?

1275
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:51,123
In the Third Reich, weren't
a number of high ranking Nazis

1276
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,565
of Jewish origin?

1277
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:01,205
Gut yontiff.

1278
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:20,153
He said to him, "You have
brought this misfortune upon us.

1279
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:22,424
What is your business?
Where have you come from?

1280
01:28:22,498 --> 01:28:25,160
What is your country
and of what people are you? "

1281
01:28:25,234 --> 01:28:28,067
"I am a Hebrew," he replied.
"I worship the Lord,

1282
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,935
the God of Heaven
who made both sea and land."

1283
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,975
Hey.

1284
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:39,374
- What are you doing here?
- Miriam called looking for you.

1285
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:41,643
- She told me about the service.
- Would you be quiet?

1286
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:45,118
- I thought you'd come.
- You got to go, okay?

1287
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:47,382
Look, I understand
you want to daven,

1288
01:28:47,456 --> 01:28:49,390
- but these people--
- Stuart, shut up.

1289
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:52,757
Danny, please.

1290
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,763
Listen, you have to leave.

1291
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,799
- Young man, please!
- Shhh!

1292
01:28:57,867 --> 01:29:01,997
- Hey.
- Can you take this outside?

1293
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:05,563
- You're leaving, that's it.
- I'm trying to read this, okay?

1294
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:08,439
What must we do to you
to make the sea calm around us?

1295
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:11,036
For the sea was growing
more and more stormy.

1296
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:14,571
He answered, "Heave me overboard
and the sea will calm down for you,

1297
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:18,313
for I know that this terrible storm
came upon you on my account."

1298
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:47,108
Let me talk to him.

1299
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,616
Danny, the congregation
is expecting me to daven.

1300
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:52,620
They don't want someone
they don't know.

1301
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,918
Stuart, I got to do this.

1302
01:30:02,298 --> 01:30:03,890
Page 450.

1303
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:19,003
Jesus Christ, you know
who that is? You see the paper?

1304
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:21,174
You read the paper
on Yom Kippur, Barry?

1305
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,808
I saw the paper.
That's not him.

1306
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:25,285
This guy was at Rosh Hashanah
with Stuart and Miriam.

1307
01:30:25,354 --> 01:30:28,721
- That guy would never go to shul.
- You want to bet?

1308
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:32,591
- I'm going to go get a cop.
- Fine, get a cop.

1309
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:36,127
I'm sure it's him.

1310
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:56,171
- Why's he stopping?
- You got to go.

1311
01:31:56,245 --> 01:31:57,974
You wanted to daven,
now daven.

1312
01:31:58,047 --> 01:31:59,674
- There's a bomb.
- Come on, Danny.

1313
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:02,683
I came in here last night and
I put a bomb underneath the beam.

1314
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:06,152
It'll go off at 7:30. You have five
minutes to get everyone out of here.

1315
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:08,315
- What did he say?
- There's a bomb, go!

1316
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,153
A bomb?

1317
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,724
- Oh my God.
- We need to get out of the room!

1318
01:32:15,798 --> 01:32:17,595
David, get your wife
out of here. Go!

1319
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:20,294
We have an emergency. Everybody
needs to exit the building.

1320
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:23,998
Avi, get everybody out.
Everybody go, hurry!

1321
01:32:24,073 --> 01:32:25,267
Outside on the wall.

1322
01:32:28,277 --> 01:32:31,144
- Mother, watch your step.
- Out the door!

1323
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:34,080
Danny, come on! Danny!

1324
01:32:35,684 --> 01:32:37,174
Danny!

1325
01:32:41,824 --> 01:32:43,849
- Let's go!
- What about Danny?

1326
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:46,451
- He's not coming.
- What do you mean he's not coming?

1327
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:53,526
If you had come out of Egypt,
you would have been destroyed

1328
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:56,503
in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.

1329
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:58,597
Then let Him destroy me now.

1330
01:32:58,674 --> 01:33:01,268
Go ahead. Kill me.

1331
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:03,607
Here I am.

1332
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,374
Do it.

1333
01:33:42,351 --> 01:33:44,012
Danny.

1334
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:46,213
Glad you came back.

1335
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,654
I wanted to take up
that discussion we were having.

1336
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:53,194
- I can't right now.
- About Abraham and Isaac.

1337
01:33:53,262 --> 01:33:55,321
You remember what you said?

1338
01:33:55,397 --> 01:33:57,524
That Isaac actually died
on Mount Moriah.

1339
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:01,194
I've been thinking maybe
you were right about that.

1340
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:06,207
You remember what you said? That
Isaac actually died on Mount Moriah.

1341
01:34:06,275 --> 01:34:08,869
I've been thinking,
maybe you were right about that.

1342
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:13,847
Died... and then reborn
in the world to come.

1343
01:34:15,784 --> 01:34:17,581
You remember what you said?

1344
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:20,986
That Isaac actually died
on Mount Moriah.

1345
01:34:21,056 --> 01:34:24,719
I've been thinking maybe
you were right about that.

1346
01:34:24,793 --> 01:34:28,854
Died... and then reborn
in the world to come.

1347
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,660
Danny, stop.

1348
01:34:30,733 --> 01:34:33,497
Where do you think
you're going?

1349
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:35,560
Don't you know?

1350
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:39,100
There's nothing up there.

1351
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:18,072
"...your only son whom you love, Isaac,

1352
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,404
and go unto
the land of Moriah

1353
01:36:20,476 --> 01:36:23,070
and offer him there
as a sacrifice

1354
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:25,613
on a mountain
that I will show you."

1355
01:36:25,681 --> 01:36:27,376
So...

1356
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:31,651
"I will show you."

1357
01:36:57,279 --> 01:36:59,179
It was a test of Abraham's faith,

1358
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:01,546
of his devotion to God.

1359
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:06,379
It's not about Abraham's faith.

1360
01:37:06,455 --> 01:37:09,083
It's about God's power.

1361
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:12,693
Abstraction.

1362
01:37:12,761 --> 01:37:15,559
They're obsessed
with abstraction.

1363
01:37:15,631 --> 01:37:17,565
"Kill your only son,

1364
01:37:17,633 --> 01:37:20,067
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."

1365
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,294
"You're nothing."

1366
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:37,310
Jews.

1367
01:37:37,386 --> 01:37:40,116
Judaism.

1368
01:37:44,126 --> 01:37:46,060
They're still just Jews.

1369
01:37:46,128 --> 01:37:49,359
Differences exist, of course.
All right?

1370
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:51,661
But they're irrelevant,

1371
01:37:51,733 --> 01:37:54,668
'cause for a Jew, his Jewishness
dominates everything.

1372
01:37:54,736 --> 01:37:57,762
And even the ones
who renounce it,

1373
01:37:57,839 --> 01:38:00,967
and who hate its strength and want
to cut it out of their hearts...
