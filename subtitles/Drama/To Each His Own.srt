"You want to be a star?"

"Yes! I mean, my family are up there."

4
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,820
"Right."

5
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:02,093
"I want to become a pretty star."

6
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:07,732
"if you want to become a star,
you must live first."

7
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,007
"What does it mean to live?"

8
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:21,414
"To live is to have hope."

9
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:22,816
"Hope?"

10
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:27,718
"You can't live without hope."

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,824
"What if I lose hope?"

12
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:35,759
"Hope is always there."

13
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:40,038
"You might just lose sight of it."

"Is this heaven?"

15
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,608
"This is..."

17
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:33,082
"I wanna die on Monday morn."

18
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:35,751
"Don't wanna think on Tuesday morn."

19
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,420
"Worst of all is Wednesday morn."

20
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:41,499
"Feeling alright on Thursday morn."

21
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,398
"Feeling hyped on Friday morn."

22
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,337
He's rapping about me.

23
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,367
"Happiest of all is Saturday morn."

24
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,139
"Then I come down on Sunday morn."

"But life ain't all that bad, is it though?"

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,789
Bullshit.

I had trouble finding a job,

36
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:50,063
so when this company accepted me, I was elated.

37
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,505
I can't hear you!

38

39
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,843
Stretch your arms.

40
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:04,179
I had hopes and dreams, and even ambition.

41
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:05,848

Four! Taking leave is unnecessary!

Four! Taking leave is unnecessary!

00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,760
It leads to laziness!

00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,250
Heading out!

Take care!

I thought I knew that,
but the reality was way harsher.

Aoyama!

61
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:08,870
Yes.

62
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,374
Daito Advertising just made a complaint.

63
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:18,583
The logo font's wrong.

64
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,788
But Saito told me to use it...

65
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:26,391
It's your responsibility!

66
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,192
So you should've checked it!

67
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:30,798
Yes.

68
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:36,535
If you want a raise, meet your quota, jerkoff!

69
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:37,833
Yes.

Look here.

71
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,875
I gave you the account despite
your sales record because I'm a nice guy.

72
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:52,682
But you shit on my kindness!
Are you fucking with me?!

73
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,050
N-No sir...

74
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,221
Just go! I said you'd be there in 30 minutes.

Don't you dare be late!

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,826
Yes.

77
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:08,503
I want to contribute to my company.

78
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:15,711
But lately, when my boss yells at me,
my mind goes blank.

Using your prize money to go on a date tonight?

84
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:46,611
But seriously, 17 contracts is brilliant.

85
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,810
Make it 20 next month.

Oh, Aoyama.

Yes.

91
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:02,855
I'll take the money
you lost us out of your salary.

Hang in there.

Goodbye sir!

98
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:36,056
I've worked over 150 hours overtime
for three months in a row.

99
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,360
But I don't get paid for it.

100
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:46,128
All I get is my basic salary.

101
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:00,314
What?

102
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,719
"Oh, Takashi! I finally caught you."

103
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:06,621
What is it? I'm still working.

104
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,192
"Really? This late?"

105
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,289
Come on, make it quick.

106
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:16,196
"Well, if there's anything
you want to eat, I'll send it."

107
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:20,134
Listen, I told you you don't have to anymore.

108
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:22,707
"It's not such a bother, is it?"

109
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,867
It is. Get the message already.

110
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:31,543
"Oh...Hey, when are you coming home next?"

111
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:37,552
Don't ask me that now. I can't say yet.

112
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,793
"I want to eat some nice Tokyo cakes."

"Whenever I call him lately,
he's so irritable."

115
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,819
Work must be stressing him out.

116
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:12,788
Humor him.
He was only ever able to open up to you.

117
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:18,262
But...he hasn't been home
for over a year and a half now.

118
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:24,627
He's busy. Takashi's doing his best.
He'll be fine.

119
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,431
You're right.

120
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,101

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,644
If we work just so we can live...

124
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,858
...can I really call this living?

My body feels as heavy as lead.

128
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,710
I want a break.

I hope tomorrow never comes.

What a blast from the past! I moved, remember?

136
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,336
I lost touch with everybody!

137
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,267
Wow, this is awesome, yeah?

138
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,204
Let's get a drink!

139
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:46,708
- Like sashimi?
- Yeah...

00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:50,247
Then it's a deal! Talk about a coincidence.

141
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,491
Gotta thank the guy upstairs.

Welcome!

143
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,102
Sit down already.

Er, the bathroom...

145
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,769
Bathroom's out back.

146
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,710
- Beer okay?
- Yes...

147
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:25,414
- Two drafts.
- Sure. Two drafts.

148
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,318
Hi, it's Aoyama here.

149
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:33,458
"Oh, Takashi? It's been a while. What's up?"

150
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:38,154
Well, I know this is sudden,
but do you remember a Yamamoto?

151
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,320
"Yamamoto?"

152
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:43,162
Yeah. I think he was in our class.

153
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,425
"What year?"

154
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,765
He said he moved away.

155
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:51,367
"Oh, Kenichi Yamamoto? From Year 3."

156
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,608
Oh, Kenichi Yamamoto!
Yeah, I remember. Kind of quiet.

157
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,219
Hey, the head's gone!

158
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:04,890
Sorry. It was full.

159
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:08,220
Yeah? Okay, let's drink to our reunion.

160

Hey Chef. Sashimi, whale bacon, edamame,

- and fried chicken.
- OK.

162

Sound good?

163
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:22,005
How did you recognize me?

164
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:23,471
You look the same.

165
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:24,438
Really?

166
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,171
You wouldn't know.

167
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,340
I think you've changed though.

168
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:35,381
My Osaka accent?

169
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,155
Osaka makes people funny.

170
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:41,557
Aoyama, watch it. Don't go sayin' that.

171
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:47,393
Don't think all Osaka people are funny.
It raises expectations too high.

172
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,897
Sorry. It does?

173
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:52,902
Hey, I'm only funny if you're my straight man.

174
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:59,171
I can't just say something funny on cue.
That's torture. For real.

175
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,778
Chef! Sardine sashimi.

176
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:09,285
Hey, remember much about elementary school?

177
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,956
You were with us till Year 3, right?

178
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,454
- Your beers.
- Thanks.

179
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:22,265
Aoyama, what did you wanna be back then?

180
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:26,627
- A soccer player.
- Yeah? That's news to me.

181
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:31,232
Remember "Mura-sen"?
Our homeroom teacher. Black tracksuit.

182
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:34,556
- Man, that takes me back!
- Me too!

183
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,824
- Murata?
- Murakami.

184
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:37,748
Murakami! Yeah!

185
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:40,445
Work around here?

186
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,577
Other side of the station.

187
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:47,853
Here.

188
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:51,253
Wow, you're a salesman.

189
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,093
- Phone number?
- Phone number?

190
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,295
- Quit grinnin'.
- I wasn't.

191
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:05,503
Wrong line! Say "You quit grinning"!
Don't leave me hangin'!

192
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:09,682
Work on your comebacks for next time.

193
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:12,249
Yeah. Tell me your number.

194
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,843
Yeah. Oh, tell me yours.

195
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,689
Um, 080...

196
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,756
Aoyama!

197
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,290
Aoyama!

198
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,367
Huh? What the...

199
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,968
Aoyama, you're up?

200
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,673
Day off, right? We're heading out.

201
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:43,804
Haul ass, dude.

202
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:50,717
- Haul ass, dude.
- Um.

203
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,119
Hey. How'd you find my place?

204
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:54,352
You told me, at the pub.

205
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:57,257
I did? I don't remember.

206
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,828
You were drunk.

207
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:00,575
Not that drunk.

208
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,966
Anyway, why were you up that tree?

209
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:05,332
Didn't know which apartment.

210
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,700
I ain't a stalker!

211
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:16,548
Remember this? We used to do it in elementary.

212
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,377
Hey, don't do that!

213
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,246
Just get in!

214
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,381
Huh? Hey! Hey!

215
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,756
Stop, it's dangerous! I never did this!

216
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:34,594
We did! We did!

217
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:39,768
Yamamoto! It's dangerous! Stop!

218
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:44,567
This isn't the quiet Yamamoto I knew!

219
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:49,207
Am I being taken for a ride
by some crazy gay stalker?

220
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,848
This feels great!

221
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:56,354
No it doesn't! Stop!

222
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:59,386
Sorry! I can't!

223
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,732
Ow!

224
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,906
Man, that was close!

225
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,602
Idiot! You could've killed us!

226
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,946
What's funny about that?

227
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:29,082
Check out the sky, Aoyama.

228
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:39,688
I hadn't looked at the sky for a long time.

229
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:46,362
I was glad I hadn't died,
and that surprised me.

230
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:55,145
Had I just forgotten, like Yamamoto said?

231
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,613
We'll pay for it. I mean, he will.

232
00:17:57,783 --> 00:18:01,447
I felt like I was in elementary,
playing with a friend.

233
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:11,389
Whoa! This one's awesome!

234
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,462
Check it out.

235
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:17,065
- See?
- No, no way.

236
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,968
It's way cool, man! It suits you.

237
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:23,165
It's a bit... flashy for sales work.

238
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:26,539
It's just right. It's an ice-breaker.

239
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,707
Huh? Hey! What are you doing?

240
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,150
Your hair looks better like this.

241
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:39,314
See? Soft and non-threatening.

242
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,722
His fashion sense and gestures...

243
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,464
Yamamoto, have you entered
the forbidden zone after all?

244
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,560
This is Tuesday. Tuesday red.
And, this is Wednesday...

245
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:52,637
Sir!

246
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, sorry!

247
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,102
We'll take 'em...all!

248
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,300
N-No no no!

249
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,536
Gotta be fresh and neat in sales.

250
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:07,279
You also gotta smile, and talk real slow.

251
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:10,953
But they'll think I'm making fun of them.

252
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:16,927
They won't. I guarantee it.
They'll think, "He's so comforting!"

253
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,995
Comforting?

254
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,133
Yeah. Like this!

255
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,293
Hey! Hey! What the hell?!

256
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:25,900
Don't scare me.

257
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:28,236
- Thank you sir.
- Thanks.

258
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,566
Thank you.

259
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:36,410
Hey.

260
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:40,080
How can you know so much about sales?

261
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:44,590
Oh. A while back,
I worked for a proper company.

262
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,282
A while back? And now?

263
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,027
- I'm a NEET.
- You don't work?

264
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,254
I kinda work part-time.

265
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:53,092
What about full-time?

266
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:56,497
I can get by without working full-time.

267
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:01,073
You know, I can't figure you out.

268
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:14,715
Good morning.

269
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,756
'Morning. You're early.

270
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,423
You're necktie's different.

271
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,854
Is it strange?

272
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,930
No, it suits you.

273
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:30,233
I'm glad. I need all the help I can get today.

274
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:31,968
Kotani Confectionery?

275
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:33,196
Yes.

276
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:37,474
Good luck. You've courted them for six months?

277
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:39,635
Yes.

278
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,914
It'll be your biggest contract.

279
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:45,949
Yes. But it's small compared to yours.

280
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:50,284
Not at all.
It has plenty of potential for growth.

281
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:52,786
Yes.

282
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:58,463
Aoyama, you seem different lately.

283
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:02,767
You look fresher, and you laugh more now.

284
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,294
Oh. Someone made me open my eyes.

285
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:07,268
A girl?

286
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:12,503
No, a guy. But he's a bit weird.

287
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:14,906
If you need help, ask me.

288
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:18,506
Thank you. Actually, there is one thing.

289
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,887
How do you always win so many contracts?

290
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:29,192
Well...Maybe because I try
to stay focused at all times.

291
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:31,360
Stay focused?

292
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:33,524
How about you?

293
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,532
How are you going to go about it?

294
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,303
Oh, I...

295
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,874
Good question.

296
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:50,673
I want to provide comfort for my clients.

297
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:53,141
Good luck.

298
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:55,879
Yes.

299
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,857
Mr. Noda!

300
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:09,993
Sorry to bother you. I've brought
sample posters for your new campaign.

301
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:11,431
So many?

302
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:15,535
I haven't decided on your company yet.

303
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:22,239
I'm aware of that. I pleaded with
our designer to create four alternatives.

304
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,113
Let's talk about it over there.

305
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,220
You'd spare your time?!

306
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,753
Well, I felt like having a coffee anyway.

307
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:36,261
Thank you sir!

308
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:40,398
For real? Way to go! That's awesome!

309
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,432
Noda, the guy in charge,

310
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,935
said he sensed my passion and sincerity.

311
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:47,300
That's great.

312
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:52,570
Now he even tells me stuff.
His grandchild was born last month.

313
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:55,042
I hope your streak keeps going.

314
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:58,516
Yamamoto, thanks for everything.

315
00:22:58,684 --> 00:22:59,810
Like what?

316
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:03,217
I won this contract because of you.

317
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:06,154
Hell no. It was your talent.

318
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:11,163
If you hadn't reached out to me then...

319
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:18,336
Anyway, you're amazing,
recognizing me after so long like that.

320
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,236
Excuse me.

321
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:26,309
Iwai! Thanks for your help.

322
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:31,314
"Yeah, about that.
I found Yamamoto's contact details.“

323
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:34,817
- I already...
- "Yamamoto's in New York now."

324
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:40,486
"He's a stage director. Amazing, huh?"

325
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,124
Huh? But he's back in Japan now, right?

326
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:48,530
"No, he isn't. Look him up on Facebook."

327
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:52,663
Okay. Thanks.

328
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,009
Aoyama? What's up?

329
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,438
"5hrs - New York - Hello!"

330
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:18,931
"Stage first day today!"

331
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,105
Where were you?

332
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:38,012
What's that?

333
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:44,349
What are you sulking for?

334
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,523
Wanna move?

335
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:49,793
My old classmate is in New York.

336
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:51,088
Wow.

337
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:54,790
Don't "wow" me. We weren't classmates.

338
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:57,061
Oh. You figured it out?

339
00:24:57,937 --> 00:25:01,669
No, at first I thought we were,
but I was wrong.

340
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:06,407
When did you realize that?

341
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:10,238
Remember you mentioned your teacher?

342
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,117
Mura-sen?

343
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:15,151
Yeah. "Hey, he wasn't my teacher!"

344
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,949
Oh man! You knew all along!

345
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:19,056
Did I?

346
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:25,454
You wanted to scam me?
Act like a friend and sell me something?

347
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:26,631
Hell no!

348
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:28,527
Then why the act?

349
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,068
You were so into it, I couldn't!

350
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,866
- Is Yamamoto your real name?
- Yeah.

351
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:39,169
First name?

352
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,539
Jun.

353
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,844
Don't believe me? Check this out.

Sure enough. Even so...

358
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:06,537
I look different now, right?
I was working sales back then.

359
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,365
Oh.

360
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:15,477
It was a mistake at first,
but we're friends now.

361
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:24,011
Or you don't think of me as a friend
because I wasn't your classmate?

362
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,830
Okay, let's start over. I'm Jun Yamamoto.

363
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,362
I'm Takashi Aoyama.

364
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,138
No secrets between us now.

365
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,799
Can I ask you something?

366
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:49,647
Do you...like guys?

367
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:54,643
Hell no! That ain't my style.

368
00:26:55,421 --> 00:26:59,324
Relax, Ta-ka-shi.

369
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,588
Let's drink to our truce.

370
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:16,535
After our talk, we made a rough draft.

371
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:19,542
With larger and more readable text.

372
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:21,205
- It's great.
- It is'?!

373
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:23,509
- Can you go brighter?
- We can!

374
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:29,086
Understood. Next time,
I'll bring a sample using the actual paper.

375
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:30,552
Please do.

376
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:32,554
Will it take long?

377
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:33,556
Excuse me.

378
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,718
We'd like three days...

379
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:38,626
- How about two?
- Sure! Two it is.

380
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:40,493
Hello, Aoyama here.

381
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,177
"Aoyama, come back!"

382
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,192
"Kotani made a complaint!"

383
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,704
Igarashi, what complaint?

384
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:57,907
The paper we used isn't the one
they asked for. Mr. Noda was furious.

385
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,386
Was the order correct?

386
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,448
It should've been. I checked it repeatedly.

387
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:12,161
Did the printers mess it up?
It's happened before. To me too.

388
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:34,283
No. The purchase order's incorrect.

389
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:46,323
How? How could I have got it wrong?

390
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,440
Aoyama, get a grip. Let's go see them.

391
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,111
Huh? But Igarashi, it's not your client.

392
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,013
I took their call. I know the situation best.

393
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,215
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,898
- We're deeply sorry!
- We're deeply sorry!

395
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:24,736
I was going to give you the contract, Aoyama.

396
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:28,002
It's a shame.

397
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,473
- Mr. Noda...
- Aoyama!

398
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,307
I'll talk to Mr. Noda, so wait here.

399
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:36,211
- But it's my...
- Don't worry!

400
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,343
I'll fix this.

401
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,215
I'll fix this.

402
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,535
You angered the client, and screwed us.

403
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,682
Igarashi and I had to fix your mess.
What the hell are you trying to do?!

404
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,545
I'm truly sorry!

405
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:22,059
I thought you'd won a decent contract,
but you put us in the red!

406
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:28,557
You're just a... piece of...shit!

407
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,566
- Igarashi, come with me.
- Yes.

408
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:37,904
Yes sir.

409
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:44,548
I don't mind you fixing his mess,

410
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:49,513
but you've only made 85% of your monthly quota.

411
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:50,889
Sorry sir!

412
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:59,695
You're our ace. If you can't pull your weight,
I'll lose face big time.

413
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:09,805
Don't worry. I'll make up for it
before the deadline.

414
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:13,605
Really?

415
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,070
Yes sir.

416
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:18,939
You'd better.

417
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:23,117
Oh no!

418
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,922
I've got to take a client to dinner. Oh no...

419
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,462
Thanks to you, I'm late!

420
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,828
Goodbye sir!

421
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,907
Aoyama, that's enough for today. Go home.

422
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,506
But...

423
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,447
Do what your senior says.

424
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,248
Yes.

425
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,028
Igarashi?

426
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:13,198
I'm truly sorry. I'll go home now.

427
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:14,634
Bye now.

428
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,203
Goodbye.

429
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:25,346
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

430
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:30,153
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:35,024
"Print Order Management System"

432
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:54,512
I'll take the first train tomorrow.

433
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:59,582
First I'll go and apologize to Mr. Noda again,

434
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:03,051
and to Igarashi too.

435
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:10,561
I've got to get some sleep. I want to sleep.

436
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:16,465
Sleep should make me feel better.
I want to sleep.

437
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:28,139
Calm down. Calm down.
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

438
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,305
Okay.

439
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:46,689
Where are you going?

440
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,891
To Kotani, with a new...

441
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,656
Who said you could?

442
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:57,492
Kotani is in Igarashi's hands now.

443
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:02,333
What?

444
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,340
Don't "what" me. What did you expect?!

445
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:11,180
Give her the new contract. Now!

446
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,443
Yes.

447
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:17,548
- Get it done.
- Yes.

448
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:20,519
I'm sorry. I hope it goes well.

449
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:22,657
I'll do the rounds.

450
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:24,229
Didn't you hear me?!

451
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:29,565
Letting you go out is bad for the company.

452
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:32,997
Look.

453
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:40,703
They were all working happily,
till you sapped their motivation.

454
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,939
Right, Taguchi? Sorry pal.

455
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,711
Happy? Happy?

456
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,385
Apologize!

457
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:51,720
Apologize to everybody here!

458
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:15,573
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:22,618
No no no no. Huh? Hey you.

460
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:30,493
If you were really sorry,
you'd get down on your knees. It's courtesy!

461
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:35,794
Sir! That's...Aoyama has apologized enough.

462
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,196
Igarashi?

463
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:40,062
- Igarashi?
- Yes.

464
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:47,008
Never mind protecting him.
Go to Kotani and fix this retard's mess.

465
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:06,196
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

466
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,197
What are you mumbling?

467
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:15,699
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

468
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,104
Again.

469
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,140
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

470
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:22,977
Again!

471
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,847
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

472
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,351
Again.

473
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:32,283
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

474
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:33,620
Again.

475
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,067
Wait right there.

476
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,472
Keep going!

477
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:56,646
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

478
00:37:57,683 --> 00:38:02,018
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

479
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

480
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:15,430
I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry!

481
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,931
Aoyama...

482
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:23,838
Aoyama! The boss has gone.
You can lift your head now.

483
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,875
I'm truly sorry...

484
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:40,551
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

485
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,497
That ain't cool, Takashi.

486
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:23,532
Yamamoto?

487
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:29,335
You ain't answering my emails or phone calls.
That's cold, dude.

488
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:30,441
Sorry.

489
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,738
I'm so lonely I could cry. Let's go.

490
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,312
- I don't...
- Don't what?

491
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:36,447
Want to drink.

492
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,778
Huh? You shoulda said so.

493
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:41,784
- Today is...
- Yeah yeah, I know!

494
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:49,454
You can relax here without drinking.

495
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:52,630
Beer? I mean, coffee?

496
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,968
They got a helluva menu here.

497
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,947
The pasta looks great!

498
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:02,999
And the pizzas. Carbonara. Gorgon pasta.

499
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,773
Gorgon pizza, penne, and gnocchi too!

500
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,644
Hey Takashi. Which gorgon do you want?

501
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,580
Whatever.

502
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:20,092
Yeah? What's a "beef ajillo"?
Okay, french fries it is.

503
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:26,328
Maybe I will have a beer.

504
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,963
Go for it. I'm fine.

505
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,963
Why won't you drink?

506
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:37,003
I don't want to.
I feel like I don't deserve to.

507
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:38,669
How come?

508
00:40:39,945 --> 00:40:41,538
- Scuse me! Two beers.
- Yes.

509
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,443
I said...

510
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:46,449
Hey Takashi. What happened, man?

511
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,735
Was that really your fault?

512
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:11,507
It was. My purchase order was wrong.

513
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,406
You checked it, right?

514
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:14,536
Yeah.

515
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,812
Before you sent it?

516
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,679
Would I be like this if I had?

517
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,716
I bet somebody changed it.

518
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,386
Who'd want to do that, and what for?

519
00:41:33,432 --> 00:41:37,869
Hey Takashi.
Has anybody got ahead thanks to this?

520
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:40,404
No. My company's taken a big hit.

521
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:41,996
Who took your client?

522
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,270
She got in trouble for helping me.

523
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:53,551
Alright. My bad. I was jumping to conclusions.

524
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,378
It's okay. Thanks for worrying about me.

525
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:05,093
What's wrong?

526
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:09,166
Huh? Oh, I felt a chill.

527
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,999
A cold?

528
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:14,571
No, I'm fine.

529
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:21,907
Hey Takashi. You gettin' enough sleep?

530
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,341
Well, kind of...

531
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:27,851
What about food? Did you eat lunch?

532
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,813
Yeah, on the rooftop.

533
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:33,118
The rooftop? Why the rooftop?

534
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:38,290
Well...No reason.

535
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,296
Hey Takashi.

536
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:46,401
Maybe you should get a new job.

537
00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:03,477
Think of the J-League. Lots of players
start playing great after a transfer.

538
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:10,052
Getting along with
the manager's a big part of it.

539
00:43:11,697 --> 00:43:14,860
You probably wouldn't understand,

540
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:18,997
but full-time jobs are scarce these days.

541
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,765
What's the big deal?

542
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:26,436
Getting married and having kids
is easier with a full-time job.

543
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:30,577
Worry about gettin' a girl first.

544
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:36,485
Anyway, I can't quit my job so easily.

545
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:45,831
Then what'd be easier?

546
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:56,537
For you, compared to quittin' your job,

547
00:43:57,643 --> 00:43:59,543
what'd be easier?

548
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:03,843
What would be easier?

549
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,412
If you had to choose
between quittin' your job or dyin',

550
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,684
what'd be easier?

551
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:18,731
Nobody wants to die.

552
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:19,889
- You do.
- I don't.

553
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:23,595
You do. You tried to on the day we met.

554
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,464
You nearly felt on the tracks.

555
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:33,636
I just...felt dizzy...

556
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:34,975
Hell no.

557
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:41,580
I saw you at the ticket gate,
and I followed you from there.

558
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:47,224
Why did you do that?

559
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:57,263
Because I knew somebody...
who looked like you did that day.

560
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:12,807
Heading out.

561
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:14,113
Take care.

562
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:15,614
Take care.

563
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:21,317
Aoyama, you went back to your drab neckties.

564
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:30,693
I gradually returned
to my old unchanging existence.

565
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:36,772
From now on,
I won't let myself get carried away.

566
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:42,109
I'll be careful. Very careful.

567
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,809
I won't ever cause trouble for others.

568
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,087
If I do that, I'll definitely get weekends off.

569
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:10,574
Then I can keep on living.

570
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:17,505
I don't need dreams or hope.

571
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:26,216
Can you make the yellow and green stronger?

572
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:30,384
The client thought the colors
were weak last time.

573
00:46:30,563 --> 00:46:31,530
Got it.

574
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,063
Is two days enough?

575
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:33,959
Sure.

576
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:34,931
Thank you.

577
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,557
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

578
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:47,737
Aoyama here. I'm leaving the factory
and heading back now.

579
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,975
I'll make arrangements tomorrow.

580
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,662
What's going on with him?

581
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:48,136
That's not the Yamamoto I know.

582
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:59,114
Come to think of it,
I don't know anything about him.

Excuse me, do you stop on the way?

585
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:15,258
No, it's a cemetery shuttle bus.
The city buses are...

586
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,993
Okay, this'll do.

was found dead in front of his workplace..."

No way.

602
00:50:56,795 --> 00:51:00,060
Was Yamamoto trying to prevent my suicide

603
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,768
by coming back as a ghost?

604
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,211
Good morning.

605
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,287
Huh?! How did you get in?

606
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,688
The emergency exit, from the rooftop...

607
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,718
Sorry, did I mess up again?

608
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,923
No, I'm reading your Kotani data.
Sorry I didn't ask.

609
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:41,898
Sorry. Let me help you!

610
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:42,934
I'm done.

611
00:52:43,002 --> 00:52:43,867
Let me help!

612
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:45,404
I said I'm done!

613
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:52,502
The boss told you to stay out of it.
If he finds out, he'll be angry again.

614
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:58,515
By the way, he also told me
to delete your Kotani data.

615
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,543
Could you transfer it to this?

616
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,250
Sure.

617
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:24,371
Hey Takashi!

618
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:27,471
Come on, dude. Don't be so scared.

619
00:53:27,613 --> 00:53:28,375
No...

620
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:31,074
Got time? Let's go get a drink.

621
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,446
S-Sorry! I'm busy today!

622
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:36,212
What? You mad I told you to quit?

623
00:53:36,322 --> 00:53:37,221
N-No I'm not.

624
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:40,987
If I make him angry, will he curse me to death?

625
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:45,627
But if Yamamoto came back
from the dead to save me...

626
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:48,199
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

627
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,509
Ghosts don't have legs.

628
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,851
Thanks!

629
00:54:07,987 --> 00:54:11,287
He plays soccer, does the Kazu dance...

630
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:15,016
A ghost in a Hawaiian pineapple shirt?

631
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:19,364
That felt great. Woulda been better
if you'd joined in.

632
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:26,868
He's no ghost. But what about that blog?

633
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:29,867
Hey Takashi. Takashi?

634
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:31,101
Yeah, what?

635
00:54:31,243 --> 00:54:34,406
Let's make dinner, at my place.

636
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:38,480
It'll be the last thing you do.

637
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:41,845
You won't be able to leave.

638
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:54,363
Was he on his way back to his grave?

639
00:54:56,202 --> 00:54:58,830
A ghost riding a bus?

640
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,838
My cooking's so good...

641
00:55:09,782 --> 00:55:11,409
Gotta take a whiz.

642
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:24,195
If he really is a ghost,
and he came back to help me,

643
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:30,433
maybe the only way to put him to rest
is for me to do my best.

644
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:43,180
Anyway, I'd better do some work now.
I don't know how much I can do,

645
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:48,486
but I'll start by doing what I can, diligently.

646
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,427
- Heading out.
- Take care.

647
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:56,584
Okay.

648
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:04,763
Igarashi, got a moment?
About the Kotani data...

649
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:09,034
Why?! I thought you gave me all of it.

650
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:10,169
I did.

651
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,768
- What is it?
- Nothing.

652
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:14,441
Come with me.

653
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:22,082
What is this?

654
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:28,185
I thought you could use some notes
on what I talked with Mr. Noda about.

655
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:35,233
Like the order process,
his product plans, that kind of thing.

656
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:39,565
I already know about all that! What is this?

657
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:44,103
His hobbies and his grandkids?
It's just small talk!

658
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,709
This is your idea of "comforting"?

659
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:50,647
I'm sorry.

660
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,219
Acting chummy isn't enough.

661
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:55,047
I'm sorry.

662
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:57,790
You think this is useful?!

663
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:01,922
I'm sorry.

664
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,486
There's no more data?

665
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:07,123
You can check if you...

666
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:37,723
Hey you.

667
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:43,798
I hear you bitched to Igarashi,
even after she saved you.

668
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:52,006
You said it was your client.
You'd sewn up the deal.

669
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:55,181
As if she stole it from you.

670
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:57,548
No, I never said that...

671
00:57:57,716 --> 00:58:02,813
Maybe I misspoke. I'm truly grateful to her,
so I wanted to help...

672
00:58:02,922 --> 00:58:04,014
Bullshit!

673
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:08,958
Get this straight. Kotani Confectionery

674
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:13,326
is Igarashi's client,
and she gets all the credit.

675
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:18,800
Your only contribution was
that initial piece of shit contract.

676
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:25,075
This all started with your fuck-up. Got that?!

677
00:58:25,411 --> 00:58:28,972
You'd piss on your only ally to get ahead?!

678
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:30,009
No!

679
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:33,050
And she's a woman, you asshole!

680
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:35,281
Shit!

681
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:38,253
Shit!

682
00:58:45,764 --> 00:58:47,129
You're...

683
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:53,164
...trying to take credit for our hard work!
You fucking leech!

684
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:57,672
Enough! Go back to work!

685
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:17,355
Igarashi, I'm sorry.
I should have made myself clearer.

686
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:26,334
I'm truly grateful. You teach me,
and help me, but I always trouble you.

687
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:30,467
I'll make sure I won't ever again.

688
00:59:35,414 --> 00:59:38,850
Igarashi? Igarashi!

689
00:59:39,552 --> 00:59:42,146
Get lost, idiot.

690
01:00:24,196 --> 01:00:27,166
"Yamamoto"

691
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:08,197
You look relaxed.

692
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,678
Yamamoto, I'm sorry.

693
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:21,947
What for?

694
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:25,774
You tried to help me, but...

695
01:02:27,253 --> 01:02:28,652
Can I join you?

696
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:30,949
No. Don't come.

697
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,659
I'll see you again soon anyway.

698
01:02:38,063 --> 01:02:39,497
What do you mean?

699
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:45,159
Jun Yamamoto died three years ago.

700
01:02:52,445 --> 01:02:58,942
So I'll join you.
Let's go for a drink when I get there.

701
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:05,320
Face me.

702
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:19,396
Face me, dammit!

703
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:26,343
Hey Takashi. Who do you think we live for?

704
01:03:27,113 --> 01:03:31,949
Who is Takashi Aoyama living for?

705
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,778
- Myself?
- Partly.

706
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:38,049
- Others too?
- Yeah.

707
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:39,224
Who?

708
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:42,888
Whoever it is you care about.

709
01:03:44,763 --> 01:03:48,529
- But I don't have a girlfriend.
- I know.

710
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,967
I mean somebody else.

711
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:58,901
Your family! How are they doing?

712
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:07,346
Hey Takashi.
You think you can end it all by dying,

713
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,824
but that's agony.
Agony for the ones left behind.

714
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:22,490
But I've...always been a jerk to my parents.

715
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:25,437
What did you do?

716
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:32,640
I let the vegetables Mom sent me go bad,
took my anger out on her, and...

717
01:04:45,491 --> 01:04:49,621
After I started high school,
my dad was laid off.

718
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:54,824
But he couldn't find another job, and so...

719
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:58,269
...we moved in with my grandmother.

720
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:03,643
I didn't want to live in the country...

721
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:09,643
I cursed out my dad a lot.

722
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,414
Yeah?

723
01:05:14,487 --> 01:05:20,824
I said it was because he was useless.
The same things my boss said to me.

724
01:05:21,894 --> 01:05:23,293
Awful, right?

725
01:05:23,896 --> 01:05:28,993
So he probably won't mind losing a son like me.

726
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:33,034
Man, you are an ungrateful son.

727
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:34,229
I know that!

728
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,740
No you don't!

729
01:05:37,276 --> 01:05:42,715
You've got to find out for sure
how they really feel about you.

730
01:05:44,383 --> 01:05:48,342
If a family's son dies before his time,

731
01:05:48,888 --> 01:05:52,552
and the parents aren't sad, I wanna meet 'em.

732
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:03,361
Let's get out of here.

733
01:06:07,106 --> 01:06:08,471
Let's go.

734
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:25,081
How did you know I was here?

735
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,361
Yamamoto.

736
01:06:29,662 --> 01:06:31,721
What the hell are you?

737
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:35,433
A ghost.

738
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:37,933
Really?

739
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,941
Keep it quiet! I don't wanna be exorcised.

740
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:28,318
I'm home.

741
01:07:32,157 --> 01:07:33,647
Takashi?

742
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:35,654
Why are you here?

743
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,368
You said you wanted some nice Tokyo cakes.

744
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:58,148
Thank you.

745
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:01,553
Hey there.

746
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:07,057
I'm home.

747
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,558
I want to eat your grapes.

748
01:08:13,766 --> 01:08:14,927
I'll pick some.

749
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:16,592
The pricey ones.

750
01:08:17,103 --> 01:08:18,537
You'd better pay.

751
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:21,129
- Me? Pay?
- Of course.

752
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:23,639
You'd charge your son?

753
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:26,304
Want some wine? It's good.

754
01:08:26,445 --> 01:08:27,776
It's tasty.

755
01:08:28,347 --> 01:08:31,510
Not right now. I'm fine. Thanks.

756
01:08:31,684 --> 01:08:32,674
Alright.

757
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,616
Can you stay?

758
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,052
Last train. Work tomorrow.

759
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:40,522
Have dinner. I'll drive you to the station.

760
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:42,258
Okay, I will.

761
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:43,725
Fancy anything?

762
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:45,926
Your houtou.

763
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:49,796
Wow! I'd better get started.

764
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:57,341
The cakes were lovely.
Look, I'm stuffed. I ate so much!

765
01:09:03,683 --> 01:09:07,278
Hey... I'm sorry.

766
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,281
What for?

767
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:13,585
I've taken you two for granted till now.

768
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:15,324
Don't be silly.

769
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:19,295
I didn't think about how you felt.

770
01:09:22,835 --> 01:09:24,303
I'm really sorry!

771
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,473
What if, hypothetically speaking,

772
01:09:29,408 --> 01:09:32,139
what if I quit my job?

773
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,144
That'd be fine.

774
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:44,952
I mean, it's not the only company in the world.
You could come home.

775
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:49,225
You're young. You can afford to make mistakes.

776
01:09:49,362 --> 01:09:50,955
Right, right.

777
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:53,796
Takashi.

778
01:09:54,967 --> 01:10:00,133
In life, as long as you're alive,
you'll get by somehow.

779
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,604
He's right.

780
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:08,977
Listen, Takashi.

781
01:10:10,516 --> 01:10:15,955
When we moved here,
your dad couldn't find a job at all, remember?

782
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:29,632
Our savings kept going down,
and your grandma needed care the most.

783
01:10:30,303 --> 01:10:34,536
You know, it all made me feel so exhausted.

784
01:10:35,174 --> 01:10:39,475
I said to your father,
"Let's all die together."

785
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,883
But I changed my mind.

786
01:10:54,427 --> 01:11:00,628
No matter how we felt,
you had your whole life ahead of you.

787
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:05,763
I wanted to see
what kind of grownup you'd become.

788
01:11:10,609 --> 01:11:14,546
Anyway, call your mom from time to time.

789
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:19,015
She actually holds back from calling you more.

790
01:11:19,351 --> 01:11:20,819
Honey...

791
01:11:21,387 --> 01:11:27,349
She thinks up dumb excuses,
just so she can hear your voice.

792
01:11:32,098 --> 01:11:35,557
Stop it, honey. You're talkative today.

793
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:42,366
Sure. I'll call more.

794
01:12:41,534 --> 01:12:47,337
Yamamoto...Maybe you're...

795
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:54,207
...not a ghost... but an angel?

796
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:11,690
"Mr. Yamamoto. Thank you for deciding."

797
01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:17,326
"Many angels are waiting for you."

798
01:13:18,371 --> 01:13:23,400
"From: Takashi Aoyama. Morning!
Sorry to be so early."

799
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:51,796
Sorry it's so early.

800
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:53,963
No problem. What's up?

801
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:57,342
I wanted to tell you something.

802
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,039
What?

803
01:14:00,379 --> 01:14:02,347
Thank you, for everything!

804
01:14:02,448 --> 01:14:04,815
Knock it off! It's embarrassing.

805
01:14:05,418 --> 01:14:09,013
I'm really grateful to you,
for being my friend.

806
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:18,225
From the moment you met me,
you've done your best to help me.

807
01:14:22,268 --> 01:14:26,535
Listen, I know I asked you to come, but...

808
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:29,973
...could you wait here?

809
01:14:30,876 --> 01:14:33,004
Sure. What's up?

810
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:41,982
I'm gonna go and quit my job.

811
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:54,796
1,2, 3,4! 5, 6, 7, 8!

812
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:02,203
Nine! Obey your superior as your god!

813
01:15:02,341 --> 01:15:05,470
Nine! Obey your superior as your god!

814
01:15:05,611 --> 01:15:08,672
Ten! Abandon your feelings!

815
01:15:08,848 --> 01:15:11,317
Ten! Abandon your feelings!

816
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:14,114
Feelings only make you weak!

817
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:17,084
Feelings only make you weak!

818
01:15:57,263 --> 01:15:58,753
Good morning!

819
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:13,539
You're 15 minutes late.
A 2,000 yen fine, asswipe.

820
01:16:15,314 --> 01:16:16,543
Sir.

821
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:22,619
As of today, I'm resigning from this job.

822
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:27,026
Hey jerkoff.

823
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:34,132
It's too damn early for your bullshit.

824
01:16:42,141 --> 01:16:48,046
This is why young people
these days are so fucking useless! Am I right?

825
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:52,981
Can't do their job,
but they're full of themselves.

826
01:16:53,386 --> 01:16:56,913
No guts either! Am I right?

827
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:01,136
You don't know shit about the real world!

828
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,958
If you can't handle this,

829
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:07,021
whatever you do, wherever, you're fucked!

830
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:11,934
You'll be a loser your whole life,
till you die!

831
01:17:12,705 --> 01:17:17,438
I live for myself,
and the people who care about me.

832
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:23,607
Huh?! You're just giving up
and running away from everything!

833
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:28,919
Don't fuck with me. You're a fucking pussy.

834
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:37,222
Think you can find another job easily?
Think again, jackass.

835
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,968
I don't want to, easily.

836
01:17:47,473 --> 01:17:48,838
What?

837
01:17:50,243 --> 01:17:53,611
I accepted this job too easily.

838
01:17:55,982 --> 01:18:02,752
I was desperate, and took it
without knowing what I wanted to do.

839
01:18:03,856 --> 01:18:07,815
I caused trouble for everyone because of that.

840
01:18:09,128 --> 01:18:10,459
I'm sorry.

841
01:18:10,963 --> 01:18:14,831
You're sorry? Who said you could talk, asshole?

842
01:18:15,668 --> 01:18:22,131
Our rules state you've got to give
a month's notice before you quit!

843
01:18:22,275 --> 01:18:24,607
Didn't you know that either?

844
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:30,210
If you still want to quit,
you'll get a disciplinary dismissal.

845
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:36,314
That's fine with me.

846
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,624
What?!

847
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:47,456
Until three days ago,
I felt like jumping off the roof.

848
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:56,164
But even a guy like me
could turn my life around tomorrow.

849
01:18:56,976 --> 01:19:00,002
Someone I care about taught me that.

850
01:19:01,947 --> 01:19:03,278
Huh?!

851
01:19:05,584 --> 01:19:11,216
Right now, I still don't know
what I want to do, and what I can do.

852
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:18,559
But from now on, I want to smile up
at the blue sky, and be true to myself.

853
01:19:19,632 --> 01:19:25,401
Don't fuck with me, shithead.
This ain't a toothpaste commercial!

854
01:19:25,504 --> 01:19:29,065
Want to smile up at the blue sky, retard?

855
01:19:29,241 --> 01:19:33,269
You think you can make a living doing that?!

856
01:19:37,349 --> 01:19:40,979
Sir. I have one last request.

857
01:19:42,188 --> 01:19:44,885
People here work very hard.

858
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:50,722
I'd like you to recognize their efforts.
Please do it, sir.

859
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:56,398
Please do it!

860
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:06,605
Thank you, sir.

861
01:20:15,354 --> 01:20:16,651
Fuck you.

862
01:20:18,824 --> 01:20:22,727
If possible, please take some time off, sir.

863
01:20:30,803 --> 01:20:32,271
Fuck off!

864
01:20:34,407 --> 01:20:36,466
Shit!

865
01:20:37,043 --> 01:20:38,943
Ow!

866
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:41,476
Shit! Ow!

867
01:20:41,614 --> 01:20:43,082
Sir, are you alright?

868
01:20:43,182 --> 01:20:47,642
Shit! Ow!

869
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:54,026
Aoyama!

870
01:20:54,427 --> 01:20:55,895
Igarashi?

871
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:02,391
Thank you for everything.

872
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:10,632
About...that purchase order...
The one you made.

873
01:21:12,678 --> 01:21:14,703
I changed it.

874
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:22,053
If you'd won that big contract,
my quota would've increased!

875
01:21:22,154 --> 01:21:25,920
I...couldn't have coped with that.

876
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:32,962
You...started to look happier,
and I felt like you'd improve.

877
01:21:33,132 --> 01:21:37,467
That scared me, so my only choice
was to steal your data...

878
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,602
...or kill myself.

879
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:46,468
It was hard for me too. I wanted to run.

880
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:52,107
But this company is all I have.
No other place would hire me.

881
01:21:52,652 --> 01:21:56,384
I'm...worn out.

882
01:22:01,627 --> 01:22:03,117
I'm sorry.

883
01:22:04,964 --> 01:22:10,562
Back then, I don't know why,
but I was jealous of you.

884
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:14,840
So...you don't have to quit!

885
01:22:19,645 --> 01:22:23,206
No, I'm done. I depended on you too much.

886
01:22:25,318 --> 01:22:28,481
I never knew that you felt that way.

887
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:34,485
Thank you for telling me the truth.

888
01:22:45,237 --> 01:22:49,834
Igarashi, I still wish I was more like you.

889
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:54,774
Thank you for everything.

890
01:24:05,484 --> 01:24:11,548
And, just like that, Yamamoto was gone.

891
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:18,956
"Twice-Cooked Pork"

892
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:33,936
"Yamamoto"

893
01:24:35,548 --> 01:24:40,213
The number you have called
is no longer in service.

894
01:24:40,853 --> 01:24:43,220
Please make sure...

895
01:24:59,705 --> 01:25:06,338
Yamamoto, just who were you exactly?

896
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:13,349
Will I ever see you again?

897
01:25:13,486 --> 01:25:15,511
"Mii's Blog"

898
01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:19,685
"Hi there."

899
01:25:19,825 --> 01:25:22,760
Hey, Yamamoto.

900
01:25:23,196 --> 01:25:25,426
"Takashi Aoyama"

901
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:31,535
Whenever I was in trouble,
you were there to help me.

902
01:25:33,906 --> 01:25:36,534
But...when...

903
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:45,176
...you were with me, how did you feel?

904
01:26:04,503 --> 01:26:06,232
- Hello.
- Hello.

905
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:20,949
I'll go ahead!

906
01:26:21,153 --> 01:26:22,416
Wait up!

907
01:26:23,055 --> 01:26:27,720
Mii got in touch too last night.
She grew up here.

908
01:26:27,993 --> 01:26:33,454
She told me that the principal
knew Yamamoto better than anyone.

909
01:26:33,633 --> 01:26:39,629
Yes, very well. From the day he came here.

910
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,604
- Hello.
- Hello.

911
01:26:41,741 --> 01:26:43,368
You grew up here too?

912
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:47,036
No, My father used to be the principal here.

913
01:26:47,513 --> 01:26:52,474
So those boys were like younger brothers to me.

914
01:26:52,818 --> 01:26:54,252
Those boys?

915
01:26:56,989 --> 01:27:00,789
Your friend, and his twin brother Jun.

916
01:27:01,327 --> 01:27:05,628
His real name is Yu Yamamoto.

917
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,901
Yu...Yamamoto?

918
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:17,334
Jun and Yu came when they were five.
Their parents died in a car accident.

919
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:26,942
They were identical in every way,

920
01:27:27,286 --> 01:27:31,655
as if they were born from the same soul.

921
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:35,021
The same soul?

922
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:44,537
When they first came,
only Jun could get close to Yu.

923
01:27:45,304 --> 01:27:49,502
Yu wouldn't open up to me, or anyone else.

924
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,468
Yamamoto wouldn't?

925
01:27:53,145 --> 01:27:59,050
Right. But then one time,
Jun showed Yu this photo book.

926
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:08,852
And said this to him.

927
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:16,427
"These children lost their moms and dads too.
But they're smiling.

928
01:28:16,936 --> 01:28:19,428
So you should smile with them."

929
01:28:22,141 --> 01:28:26,772
Then Yu put on a smile so big,
I was blown away.

930
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,380
So Yamamoto got his smile from Jun.

931
01:28:33,085 --> 01:28:36,544
He told me once.

932
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:41,193
"Reiko, our parents gave us names

933
01:28:41,427 --> 01:28:48,026
meaning 'pure' and 'kind,'
so we'd grow up that way."

934
01:29:02,181 --> 01:29:07,984
Those two little boys thought that
if they went to the heavenly islands

935
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:09,916
of beautiful Vanuatu,

936
01:29:10,122 --> 01:29:16,255
their mom and dad would be
there to hug them again.

937
01:29:32,612 --> 01:29:37,106
Yu would grow up to become a teacher,
and Jun a doctor,

938
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:39,985
and then they'd go.

939
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,616
That became their dream.

940
01:29:45,157 --> 01:29:46,750
"Three!"

941
01:29:46,926 --> 01:29:47,825
"Eight and?"

942
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,450
"Two!"

943
01:29:49,628 --> 01:29:50,618
"Nine and?"

944
01:29:50,796 --> 01:29:51,854
"One!"

945
01:29:51,998 --> 01:29:54,330
"Okay, let's sing together."

946
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:57,002
"Add to make 10."

947
01:29:57,169 --> 01:30:01,037
"One, one, one and nine"

948
01:30:01,173 --> 01:30:04,939
They wanted to go to university
on scholarships.

949
01:30:05,144 --> 01:30:09,206
But Jun's cold got worse on
the day of his exams.

950
01:30:10,716 --> 01:30:14,311
He'd caught it while caring for the others.

951
01:30:16,589 --> 01:30:21,117
The poor boy
couldn't keep living here to try again.

952
01:30:21,794 --> 01:30:24,161
He could only stay until he turned 18.

953
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:25,661
"Hey!"

954
01:30:25,865 --> 01:30:26,957
"You're back?"

955
01:30:27,066 --> 01:30:28,693
"Today. You good?"

956
01:30:31,337 --> 01:30:37,333
So Jun had to find a job.
But he was optimistic.

957
01:30:37,877 --> 01:30:44,044
He said he'd work and study,
and get into med school, so he'd be okay.

958
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:46,916
He told me that with a smile.

959
01:30:49,155 --> 01:30:54,286
But he didn't get in the next year either.

960
01:30:55,194 --> 01:30:59,927
The company he worked for was
what they call a "sweatshop."

961
01:31:10,243 --> 01:31:12,473
- Morning.
- You alright?

962
01:31:13,879 --> 01:31:16,348
- Morning.
- Morning.

963
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:26,557
Yu worked his way through university,
then began volunteer work in Vanuatu.

964
01:31:27,593 --> 01:31:30,392
So Yamamoto went there first?

965
01:31:31,263 --> 01:31:32,230
Right.

966
01:31:33,432 --> 01:31:39,394
They'd been inseparable,
but now they were going their own ways.

967
01:31:40,072 --> 01:31:42,234
"I'll take this."

968
01:31:50,216 --> 01:31:51,411
Hey Jun.

969
01:31:53,286 --> 01:31:56,221
I'm goin' to Vanuatu again next month.

970
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,551
Oh.

971
01:32:08,134 --> 01:32:12,093
Jun. How 'bout we go together?

972
01:32:14,173 --> 01:32:16,471
My company's busy.

973
01:32:17,576 --> 01:32:20,136
I can't be the only one
to take a long vacation.

974
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:26,143
Jun, Vanuatu really is an awesome place.

975
01:32:26,786 --> 01:32:30,416
They got no orphanages. Know why?

976
01:32:32,124 --> 01:32:35,253
They got orphaned kids, like us.

977
01:32:35,494 --> 01:32:41,627
But you know, those kids are
raised like family by the other villagers.

978
01:32:42,134 --> 01:32:46,628
So they don't need orphanages.
Ain't that amazin'?

979
01:32:49,842 --> 01:32:53,301
Really. That's great.

980
01:32:54,246 --> 01:32:55,577
Hey Jun.

981
01:32:58,851 --> 01:33:04,119
Why don't you quit, or find another job?

982
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:09,962
Yu.

983
01:33:11,997 --> 01:33:14,967
I've gotta become a doctor
before I can go to Vanuatu.

984
01:33:18,771 --> 01:33:19,932
You know,

985
01:33:21,274 --> 01:33:26,872
when our parents had that accident,
and were gettin' operated on,

986
01:33:27,646 --> 01:33:30,206
you held my hand, and I thought,

987
01:33:32,485 --> 01:33:38,857
I wanna become a doctor,
so I can save Mom and Dad.

988
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:46,355
Jun... You've felt that way...

989
01:33:47,066 --> 01:33:51,162
...all this time? Why didn't you tell me?!

990
01:33:51,237 --> 01:33:52,864
How could I?

991
01:33:57,576 --> 01:34:00,375
You should smile with those kids.

992
01:34:02,915 --> 01:34:05,043
I said that to you.

993
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:17,424
If you'd found out
I never got over our sadness,

994
01:34:19,298 --> 01:34:22,268
you never woulda smiled again.

995
01:34:31,944 --> 01:34:33,878
I'll go too one day.

996
01:34:38,884 --> 01:34:40,045
Okay.

997
01:34:42,054 --> 01:34:46,514
I'll be waitin'. So you better come.

998
01:34:56,135 --> 01:34:59,002
Jun's name means "pure".

999
01:34:59,839 --> 01:35:02,934
Maybe he was too pure and kind
for his own good.

1000
01:35:05,745 --> 01:35:11,616
Yamamoto's the same. He's pure and kind too.

1001
01:35:14,487 --> 01:35:15,545
Right.

1002
01:35:18,691 --> 01:35:24,323
So when Jun committed suicide,
Yu blamed himself...

1003
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:04,803
Yu?

1004
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,435
Yu...

1005
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,577
Yu...

1006
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:16,700
Long time no see! It's me! Yamamoto!

1007
01:37:47,306 --> 01:37:52,506
Hey Takashi. Maybe you should get a new job.

1008
01:38:00,019 --> 01:38:03,785
Long time no see. It's me! Yamamoto!

1009
01:38:13,065 --> 01:38:15,363
Aoyama!

1010
01:38:16,869 --> 01:38:19,702
Aoyama!

1011
01:38:24,043 --> 01:38:25,340
Takashi?

1012
01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:29,546
Takashi?

1013
01:38:29,982 --> 01:38:34,180
Hey Takashi! Hey Takashi!

1014
01:39:27,506 --> 01:39:28,735
Um...

1015
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:35,940
Up until recently, I was thinking
of killing myself, just like Jun.

1016
01:39:40,086 --> 01:39:43,579
But Yamamoto saved me.

1017
01:39:47,026 --> 01:39:48,289
Even so...

1018
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:52,388
he never said a thing to me.

1019
01:39:54,267 --> 01:39:56,634
About Jun, or how he felt.

1020
01:39:58,604 --> 01:40:04,099
Nothing. Not a single word.

1021
01:40:08,214 --> 01:40:15,086
Yu came here a couple of weeks ago.
To say he was going away.

1022
01:40:16,455 --> 01:40:17,752
Going away?

1023
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:22,523
He hadn't been back here for such a long time.

1024
01:40:23,796 --> 01:40:26,595
It was the first time since Jun died.

1025
01:40:28,567 --> 01:40:33,095
Back then, he told me.

1026
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:40,772
He said he'd made a friend,
who'd inspired him to start over.

1027
01:40:48,087 --> 01:40:49,885
Yu told me.

1028
01:40:51,023 --> 01:40:55,256
"Reiko, ever see a grown-up guy in a suit

1029
01:40:55,461 --> 01:41:00,922
swinging his briefcase and
skipping over a pedestrian crossing?"

1030
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:13,005
He looked so happy when he smiled.

1031
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:22,988
But...he said there was something
he forgot to say to you.

1032
01:41:24,123 --> 01:41:25,488
Oh?

1033
01:41:28,794 --> 01:41:30,523
"Tell him, 'thank you."'

1034
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:39,536
Why?

1035
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,672
I should be thanking him.

1036
01:41:48,547 --> 01:41:49,946
Thank you.

1037
01:41:59,358 --> 01:42:02,919
That boy...is waiting for you.

1038
01:42:06,299 --> 01:42:11,863
He told me,
"When he comes here, give him this."

1039
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,518
Look on the back.

1040
01:42:34,727 --> 01:42:37,706
"My angels."

1041
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:42,361
"Wanna come and smile with them?"

1042
01:43:08,027 --> 01:43:09,620
“Hey Yu.“

1043
01:43:11,097 --> 01:43:15,398
"What if someone loses hope?"

1044
01:43:16,803 --> 01:43:18,532
"Hope is always there."

1045
01:43:18,804 --> 01:43:23,537
"You might just lose sight of it."

1046
01:43:26,012 --> 01:43:28,538
"Is this heaven?"

1047
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:32,642
"This is..."

1048
01:43:36,155 --> 01:43:42,253
"This is the entrance to heaven.
A heaven called hope."

1049
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:56,973
Hey, Yamamoto. I believe you now.

1050
01:43:58,344 --> 01:44:00,403
In life, there's always pain.

1051
01:44:02,014 --> 01:44:06,178
But, somewhere, there's always hope.

1052
01:44:08,454 --> 01:44:13,984
If you lose hope, look for it.
If you can't find it, make it.

1053
01:44:14,494 --> 01:44:15,859
And if

1054
01:44:16,328 --> 01:44:22,358
you even lose hope in doing that,
just start over.

1055
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:29,370
Hey Yamamoto. Isn't that the only way forward?

1056
01:44:31,811 --> 01:44:37,716
Isn't that how Yu Yamamoto
has always lived his life?

1057
01:44:49,995 --> 01:44:52,123
- "Okay, Jessica?"
- "10."

1058
01:44:52,498 --> 01:44:54,159
"10! Okay?"

1059
01:44:54,233 --> 01:44:55,029
"How much?"

1060
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:58,195
"Me! Me! Me! Me!"

1061
01:44:58,371 --> 01:44:59,202
"Mariontin?"

1062
01:44:59,371 --> 01:45:00,202
"8."

1063
01:45:00,739 --> 01:45:02,673
"8. Okay."

1064
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:03,740
"How much?"

1065
01:45:03,809 --> 01:45:06,107
"Me! Me! Me! Me!"

1066
01:45:06,278 --> 01:45:06,972
"Naomi?"

1067
01:45:07,146 --> 01:45:08,045
"7."

1068
01:45:08,648 --> 01:45:10,343
"7, okay."

1069
01:45:18,424 --> 01:45:19,755
"Everyone got it?"

1070
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:23,190
"Hey Mr. Yu!"

1071
01:45:23,596 --> 01:45:24,392
"What's up?"

1072
01:45:24,497 --> 01:45:27,194
"I wanna be a teacher like you."

1073
01:45:27,633 --> 01:45:29,624
"You wanna be a teacher?"

1074
01:45:29,802 --> 01:45:32,100
"Okay! Excellent!"

1075
01:45:32,304 --> 01:45:34,272
"Swing me too!"

1076
01:46:18,384 --> 01:46:21,445
So these kids are your angels.

1077
01:46:23,322 --> 01:46:27,225
Yeah. They're my angels.

1078
01:46:30,663 --> 01:46:34,497
Takashi. Good to see ya.

1079
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,365
Yeah.

1080
01:46:43,843 --> 01:46:44,867
"Who's he?"

1081
01:46:46,512 --> 01:46:48,446
"He's my good friend."

1082
01:46:49,548 --> 01:46:50,879
Hey Yamamoto.

1083
01:46:54,654 --> 01:46:59,922
This time, is there anything
I can do to help you here?

1084
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:09,230
You gotta start as a volunteer.

1085
01:47:13,606 --> 01:47:15,233
"What's your name?"

1086
01:47:17,276 --> 01:47:18,573
Your name!

1087
01:47:22,548 --> 01:47:28,317
"My name is Takashi Aoyama.
From Japan. 24 years old!"

1088
01:47:29,021 --> 01:47:32,047
Oh man. You need a crash course.

1089
01:47:32,257 --> 01:47:34,055
Yeah. Please teach me.

1090
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,820
Okay, let's get to work.

1091
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:39,155
But what do I do?

1092
01:47:39,231 --> 01:47:41,063
Start with easy stuff.

1093
01:47:41,233 --> 01:47:44,726
"Hide and seek. Takashi's it. Everyone run!"

1094
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:49,539
Run! That's your first job!

1095
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:26,943
Hey Jun.

1096
01:48:28,381 --> 01:48:33,217
Life...ain't so bad after all, is it?

1103
