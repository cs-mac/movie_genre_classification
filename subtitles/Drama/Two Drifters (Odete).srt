1
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:45,079
Alright, let's sort the buyers from the
spyers, the needy from the greedy

2
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,477
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

3
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,779
Because if you can't see
value here today,

4
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:52,465
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

5
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:55,343
You see these goods?
You've never seen daylight, moonlight,

6
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,645
Israelites,
Fanny by the gaslight.

7
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:00,809
Take a bag, come on, take a bag.
I took a bag home last night,

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,729
it cost me a lot more than ten pound,
I can tell you.

9
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:05,127
Anyone like jewelry?
Look at that one there.

10
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,717
Hand-made in ltaly,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,402
It's as long as my arm, I wish
it was as long as something else.

12
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:13,280
Don't think 'cos these boxes
are sealed up, they're empty.

13
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,582
The only man who sells empty
boxes is the undertaker.

14
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:19,707
And by the look of some of you lot
here today, I'd make more money
with my measuring tape.

15
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,433
Here, one price, ten pound.

16
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,544
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

17
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:24,886
That's a bargain. I'll take one.

18
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:28,722
Squeeze in if you can. Left leg,
right leg, your body will follow.
They call it walking.

19
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:32,080
Do you want one as well darlin'?
You do, that's it, they're waking up.

20
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,479
Treat the wife,
treat somebody else's wife.

21
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,589
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

22
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,562
Hold on, you want one as well?
OK, darlin', show me a bit of life, then.

23
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:41,768
It's no good standing out there
like one o'clock half struck.

24
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,454
My own you'd better buy'em,
these are not stolen,

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,290
they just haven't been paid for,
and we can't get them again,
they've changed the bloody locks.

26
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,688
Here, one for you. No good coming
back later when I've sold out.
- Nice bit of stuff.

27
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,128
- "Too late, too late"

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,197
will be the cry when the man with
the bargains has passed you by.

29
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,020
If you've got no money on you now,

30
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,130
you'll be crying tears as big
as October cabbages.

31
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:00,953
Bacon, cozzers!

32
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,314
'Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there.'

33
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,711
'But his real talent
lies in cards'

34
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,014
'and gambling with cards.'

35
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,139
'Bacon could see that his days'

36
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,879
'of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered.'

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,237
'It's time to move on
and he knows it.'

38
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:56,298
What you talking about?
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

39
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,121
Yeah, yeah, 'course you are. All right?

40
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:01,671
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure.
Tom, what have you been eatin'?
- I've been tellin' him..

41
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,109
- Enough, already!

42
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,124
You two, join me in my office.

43
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,783
So how much is it then, Tom?

44
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,222
You know how much is, Nick.

45
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,812
- And that includes the amp, yeah?
- No.

46
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,826
That does not include the amp.

47
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,991
Shit, Tom. I thought
it included the amp.

48
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,445
Well, it doesn't. I'll throw in one
of these telephones if you like,

49
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,130
but it does not include the amp.

50
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,049
Very nice.

51
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:30,543
I hope it includes the speakers.

52
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,324
It doesn't include the speakers
it doesn't include the amp.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,106
And it's not supposed to include me getting
the hump with your stupid questions.

54
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:38,216
Now you want it, Nick, you buy it.

55
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,463
What else do I get with it?

56
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:42,053
You get a gold-plated Rolls Royce,
as long as you pay for it.

57
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,835
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

58
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:48,960
Seems.. well, this seems
to be a waste of my time.

59
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:51,837
That is 900 nicker in any shop
you're lucky enough to find one in

60
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,372
and you're complaining
about 200?

61
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,577
What school of finance
did you study?

62
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:57,113
It's a deal, it's a steal.

63
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,031
It's the sale
of the fucking century.

64
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:02,388
In fact, fucking, Nick, I think
I'll keep it.

65
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,170
All right, all right, keep your alans on.

66
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,446
Here's a ton.

67
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:11,501
Jesus Christ!

68
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,899
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that,

69
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,200
and you're haggling over 100 pound.

70
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,928
What d'you do when you're
not buying stereos, Nick,

71
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,366
finance revolutions?

72
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,764
£100 is still £100.

73
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,162
Not when the price is £200, it's not.

74
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,232
And certainly not when you've got
Liberia's deficit in your sky rocket.

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,342
Tighter than a duck's butt you are!

76
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:33,179
Now come on, let me feel
the fibre of your fabric.

77
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,248
'The skinny one is Tom.'

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,551
'And he's the entrepreneur
of the bunch.'

79
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,564
'He's got a couple of
dirty little fingers'

80
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,292
'in a couple of dirty little pies.'

81
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,976
'Nick, here, however,
has made it his business'

82
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:47,662
'to have all 20 fat
little fingers and toes'

83
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,869
'in every dirty, bent
and stolen pie in London.'

84
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,994
'Between the two of them, there ain't
much you can't get hold of.'

85
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,460
That's my 25 grand.

86
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:03,106
It's all there, it took me a long time
to earn that, so you treat it with respect.

87
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:05,408
What about the chef?

88
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,578
What've you come as?

89
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,401
Cupid, stupid.

90
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,662
That's the last time I'm getting
anymore fruit off of you, Tom.

91
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:31,978
You call that fresh? There was more
small hairy armoured things in your
fruit than it was fruit.

92
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:34,185
You should open a butchers,
not a grocers.

93
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,007
Well if you will order stuff
from Kathmandu,

94
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,789
don't be surprised if it picks up
a few tourists on route.

95
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:41,187
Anyway, enough about that.
Where's the money?

96
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,736
Oi! Keep your fingers
out of my soup!

97
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:46,270
'Soap is called Soap'

98
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,724
'because he likes to keep his hands
clean of any unlawful behaviour.'

99
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,793
'He's proud of his job
and even more proud that it's legal.'

100
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,575
'He represents the more
sensible side of the four.'

101
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:01,618
Are you sure you can afford 25?

102
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,632
It depends on
how you look at it.

103
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:07,374
I can afford it as long as I see it again,
if that's what you mean.

104
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,100
Got the rest from
the fat man and Bacon?

105
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,826
Fat man, Bacon
and myself.

106
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:13,896
Looks like it's time
to make that call to Harry.

107
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:15,910
Who's this fat man, then, ey?

108
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:17,541
Ey?

109
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,474
D'you want a sandwich, Bacon?

110
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:26,462
'It's not easy to take
a seat at this card table.'

111
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,435
'The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards'

112
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:31,737
'and there's no shortage
of punters.'

113
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,903
'The man who decides whether
you can play or not is this man -'

114
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,643
'Harry, or as some,
including himself like to call him,

115
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,274
'Hatchet Harry.'

116
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:42,193
You got it all?

117
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,550
100 grand.

118
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:49,291
Well, If you got it, you got it.
Now, if you don't mind..

119
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:57,060
- What's this Eddie like then?
- He's a fucking thief!

120
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:59,554
'Harry has a colleague,
a monster of a man, '

121
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:00,897
'Barry the Baptist.'

122
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,775
'The Baptist got his name
by drowning people for Hatchet.'

123
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,172
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay?
- Yeah, I'll pay!

124
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,475
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay?
- I'll pay, yeah! Yes, I'll pay!

125
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,050
'Barry makes sure'

126
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:12,312
'the administrative side of the
business runs harmoniously.'

127
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,518
The boy's got a rare ability.

128
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,683
He seems to make cards
transparent. He's got..

129
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,889
All right, all right,
so we can say he's good.

130
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:24,110
Oh no, he's better than good.
He's a fucking liability.

131
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:27,178
Yeah, hold on, what
do you think of these?

132
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,961
- We're selling hundreds.
- Very nice, Harry.

133
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:31,975
What's it for?

134
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,716
Oh, don't play innocent with me,
Bazza. Spanking!

135
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,291
There's 25 from me,
Tom, Soap and yourself.

136
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,128
It's a 100 grand to the pound. So
why the fuck are you counting it?

137
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:21,950
Because I like to.

138
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,828
So a reasonable return should be
in the reason of 120 grand.

139
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:28,473
As for 25 grand invested,
going on previous experience.

140
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:29,912
Going on optimism.

141
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,693
Whatever it's going on, it should be
enough to send you on a cooking course.

142
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,242
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat

143
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,544
and look as though you
should be, but you're not.

144
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,134
Fat! Who you calling..
Jesus!

145
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,628
It's good in here, innit?
Handy for the tube,

146
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,738
great electrics - I can
see why you moved in.

147
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:48,616
Don't knock it, it's "CHEEP",
like the budgie.

148
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,877
And nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

149
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,851
- Anti-social to say the least.
- What d'you mean?

150
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,153
He means they're
thieving bastards.

151
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,127
I mean when they're not picking
peanuts out of poop,

152
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,292
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their own earned drugs.

153
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:09,431
Ssh. Not exactly thick,
these walls.

154
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,788
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

155
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,407
Is that it?

156
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,517
How many times must
I tell you, Plank?

157
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,970
You'll find a job worth doing, you'll
find your share improving.

158
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,697
Have you got a problem
with that?

159
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,401
You know, Charles, this gear
is getting heavier.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,444
I've a strong suspicion we should've
been rocket scientists or..

161
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,665
Nobel Peace Prize winners..
something..

162
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:56,912
Peace Prize?

163
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,900
Be lucky to find your penis for a piss
if you keep smoking.

164
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,806
Who the hell's that?

165
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:17,823
All right, Willie?

166
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:22,331
Does it look like I am all right?
Take this.

167
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:26,360
I'm in danger of breaking
sweat at any second.

168
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,237
Charles,
why've we got that cage?

169
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,115
Security.

170
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:35,952
That's right.
That's right. Security.

171
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:40,076
So what's the point in having it
if we're not gonna fucking use it?

172
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,666
Well, I would've used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

173
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,352
- And Willie lives here.
- Yes, Charles.

174
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,997
But you didn't know it was Willie
until you opened the door, did you?

175
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,450
Chill, Winston. It's me.

176
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:56,383
Charlie knows it's me,
what's the problem?

177
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:59,259
The problem is, Willie,
that Charles and yourself

178
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,562
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times.

179
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:07,126
So do as I say and keep
the fucking cage LOCKED!

180
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:10,194
- What is that?
- That's Gloria.

181
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:12,977
Yes, I know that's Gloria.
What's THAT?

182
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:15,951
Err.. fertiliser.

183
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,212
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter.

184
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:21,226
And you come back with
a semi-conscious Gloria

185
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,432
and a bag of fertiliser?

186
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,830
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

187
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,845
We need fertiliser, Winston.

188
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:30,339
We also need a money counter.

189
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,161
This money's gotta
be out by Thursday.

190
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,176
I'm buggered
if I'm gonna count it.

191
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:38,012
Oh, and, if you do have to buy
sodding fertiliser,

192
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,602
could you just be
a little more subtle?

193
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,904
What do you mean?

194
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:47,125
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

195
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,947
Yeah.

196
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:53,360
And you're carrying a wasted
girl and a bag of fertiliser.

197
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,909
You don't look your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

198
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,443
That's what I mean, Willie.

199
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:27,699
- How long's he been in there, son?
- About..20 minutes.

200
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:32,016
- Is he on his own?
- Yeah, just carrying a bag.

201
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,908
Let's pay him a little visit then,
shall we?

202
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,567
'Big Chris settles debts
for Harry.'

203
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,828
'The only thing he cares
more about than an unsettled debts'

204
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:49,377
'is his son and heir,
Little Chris.'

205
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:07,698
This is one of them..
high-powered jobs, innit?

206
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,096
Aaagh!

207
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,207
I've got some bad news
for you, John.

208
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:13,837
What the fuck!

209
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,619
Mind your language
in front of the boy.

210
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,825
Jesus Christ!

211
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,758
That includes blasphemy as well.
Now tell me, John,

212
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:26,691
how can you be concentratin'
on improving this lovely tan -

213
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:28,321
and it is a lovely tan by the way-

214
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,007
when you've got more pressing
priorities at hand?

215
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:34,748
Tell Harry.. l mean Mr Harry,

216
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,817
I've been busy,
I'm nearly there.

217
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,832
Check his locker, son.

218
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:46,259
I don't suppose there's any chance of you
lifting this sunbeam up, Chris, isn't it?

219
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:52,206
He's not poor! He's got over a monkey,
and that's just in his wallet!

220
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:55,754
Fuckin' hell, John, you always walk round
with that in your pocket?

221
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:59,112
Oi! Use language like that again, sun,
you'll wish you hadn't!

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,646
Sorry, Dad.

223
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,661
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

224
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,498
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight, John.

225
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,127
You owe what you owe.

226
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,869
And by the time this tan's faded
you wanna have paid.

227
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,405
- You never would've paid.
- Who would pay for shit?

228
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:25,202
Exactly. I mean we just had to..

229
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:26,545
What the hell
are you doing here?

230
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,463
What's up?

231
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,917
Let me guess,
my foot in your arse.

232
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,890
Game o'cards - Hatchet Harry?

233
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:37,001
You're supposed to be
getting your rest in, boy.

234
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,125
You playing cards
tonight, son?

235
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:43,811
With Harry?

236
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:48,511
Don't be silly, Dad. I wouldn't
have anything to do with that.

237
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,158
Where did
he get a hundred grand?

238
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,748
He's got adhesive mates -
I mean they're like brothers.

239
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,571
They've tossed up
between 'em.

240
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,161
And JD is his dad,
and owns the whole property?

241
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,079
No mortgage, no debts.

242
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,765
Lock, stock - the fucking lot.

243
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:14,026
Don't you worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

244
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,520
Good. You can get this
under contol now.

245
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,918
It seems that Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money.

246
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:21,124
And these little beauties
are up for auction.

247
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,098
But I'm not paying a quarter
of a million quid for 'em.

248
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,208
If you know what I mean,
Barry.

249
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:29,565
Make sure we get everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

250
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,292
I don't want to know who you use,

251
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,498
as long as they're not
complete muppets.

252
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:37,047
And don't tell 'em
what they're worth, Barry.

253
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:46,927
Right, where was we?

254
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,723
Shotguns.
What, like guns that fire shots?

255
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,353
Oh, you must be the brains, then.

256
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,176
That's right,
guns that fire shots.

257
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:59,397
Make sure you bring everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

258
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,274
There'll be a load of old guns.
That's all I want.

259
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,822
Everything else outside the cabinet,
you can keep, it's yours.

260
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:07,550
Oh, thank you very much.

261
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,564
There'd better
be something there for us.

262
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,483
It's a fucking
stately home,

263
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,497
of course there'll
be something there.

264
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,087
- Like what?
- Like fucking antiques.

265
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:20,020
Antiques! What the fuck
do we know about antiques?

266
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:22,130
- We rob post offices.
- We steal cars.

267
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,720
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

268
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,269
If it looks old,
it's worth money - simple.

269
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:32,010
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

270
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:34,887
So who's the guv?
Who are we doing this for?

271
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:38,436
You're doing it for me -
is all you need to know.

272
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,794
You know
because you need to know.

273
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,302
I see. One of those on a
"need to know basis" things, is it?

274
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:49,563
Like one of those
James Bond films.

275
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,016
Careful, remember who's giving
you this job.

276
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,853
Right, I'm off.
Call me when you're done.

277
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:58,388
Ta-ra.

278
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,951
Fucking northern monkeys.

279
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,707
I hate these fucking
southern fairies.

280
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,203
'Ed has been playing cards
since he could lift 'em up.'

281
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,601
'And he soon discovered
that he had a big advantage.'

282
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:23,135
'It's not that he's good with cards, '

283
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:24,862
'or even good at counting them.'

284
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,164
'It's that he's good
with reading people's reactions'

285
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:29,178
'no matter how subtle.'

286
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:32,344
'And everybody has reactions.'

287
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,756
'Especially when
it comes to money.'

288
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,089
- Invitations.
- Invitations?

289
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:55,365
Yeah, invitations, you know, four pretty
white pieces of paper with your names on.

290
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:58,337
We got 100,000 bits of paper
with the Queen's head on.

291
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,489
Will that do?

292
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,805
Just you. The others, they can wait
next door in Samoan Jo's.

293
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:06,300
Samoan Jo's?
You mean the pub? Hold on..

294
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:10,233
Hold on to your fuckin' tongue and
I'll hold on to my patience, OK, sonny?

295
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,974
No one in here tonight but card players
and I do mean: no one.

296
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:23,182
Evening, Fraser. Don, Phil.

297
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:25,388
It's a bit dramatic, innit?

298
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:28,602
Is it supposed to be symbolic?

299
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,280
Apparently it's for security.

300
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,774
Yeah? I'd have brought my gloves
if I'd have known.

301
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,843
You must be Eddy, JD's son.

302
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:41,023
You must be Harry.
Sorry, didn't know your father.

303
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:45,340
Never mind, son, you just might
meet him if you carry on like that.

304
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:48,409
Evening, Tanya. Been a while.

305
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,040
All right, Ed.

306
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,622
Right, we call each other Kenny,
OK, Gary?

307
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:12,773
All right, Kenny.

308
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,171
You gonna put your stocking on, or what?

309
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,376
I spent 120 quid on my hair -

310
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:19,870
If you think I'm pulling a stocking over,
you're very much mistaken.

311
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:21,885
You're gonna have to put something on.

312
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,298
This is three card brag, gentlemen.

313
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:29,080
That means three 3s are the highest,
then three aces,

314
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:30,614
then running down accordingly.

315
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:34,163
Then it's a running flush,
a run, a flush and then a pair.

316
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,561
An open man can't
see a blind man.

317
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:39,823
And it will cost twice the ante
to see your opponent.

318
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:41,836
Now don't fuck around, fellas.

319
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:45,770
You know the rules.
And you know I won't stand for it.

320
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,474
What are you doing?
Put that back.

321
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,489
We're here to rob the guns.

322
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,134
Put it back - it's crap anyway.

323
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:13,683
Come on.

324
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,059
What sort of pub is this here?

325
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,785
It's a Samoan pub.

326
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:36,704
What's that?

327
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,389
It's a cocktail -
you asked for a cocktail.

328
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:43,418
No, I asked you to give me
a refreshing drink.

329
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:46,392
I wasn't expecting
a fucking rainforest.

330
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:49,077
You could fall in love
with an orangutang in that.

331
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,476
You want a pint, go to the pub.

332
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,737
I thought this was a pub.

333
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,559
It's a Samoan pub.

334
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,396
Then whatever it is, can you get
your man to turn the TV down?

335
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,274
You can ask him if you like.
If I was you I'd leave him well alone.

336
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,576
Yeah. Get rid of that.
Bring us a Diet Coke.

337
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:09,892
'Scuse me, can you
turn that TV down?

338
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:16,799
No.

339
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:22,074
Oooh!

340
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,364
Whoa, whoa, Kenny.

341
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:31,091
What are you doing?

342
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:35,215
I am trying to find out
where they keep their money!

343
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,244
You twat. Can't you see
these people have got no money.

344
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,354
They can't even afford
new furniture.

345
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,752
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you?

346
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:47,013
Every time we do a job,
you have to go burn people's feet.

347
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,452
What's wrong with you?

348
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,154
You wanna be more careful, old fella.

349
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:03,512
You very nearly took my man's
head clean off with that.

350
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,622
You all right, Kenny?

351
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,253
Kenny?

352
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,214
Ten grand, blind.

353
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:19,915
Twenty grand, open.

354
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,176
Deep end, eh?

355
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,053
Fold.

356
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,046
Gotcha!

357
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:58,091
Twenty grand, open.

358
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,024
I fold.

359
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:06,148
Don't go spending that
all at once, boy.

360
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,302
Bloody 'ell!

361
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:15,932
What?

362
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,851
I thought you said there'd
be no staff, Barry.

363
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,673
Did you get those guns?

364
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,688
You wanna see
what they did to poor Gary!

365
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,949
Gary, Gary.

366
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:27,059
I said, did you get those guns?

367
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,978
Yes, we got them!

368
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:32,047
Good. I'll speak to you later.

369
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:34,733
Gary, if you can hear me,

370
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:37,323
get back in the car now, mate, it's OK.

371
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,817
Barry.. Barry!

372
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:44,612
Fucking, sodding,
shandy-drinking bastard!

373
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:45,955
Gary!

374
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,016
Give me my money!

375
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,414
Give me back my money!
You fucking slags!

376
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,923
Give me my money!

377
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:56,841
Give me back my money!

378
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:58,951
Give it back!

379
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:01,829
Wankers! Wankers!

380
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:08,256
Come on, you. Not now, please.

381
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:11,229
Not now, oh you fucking bastard!

382
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:20,150
Fuck.. you bastard.

383
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:23,027
Oh, my good God!

384
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,042
We'll take you to the cleaners!

385
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,881
Twenty grand open.

386
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:38,758
Thirty thousand.

387
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,965
Back to you already, Eddie.

388
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,801
Fifty grand.

389
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:49,214
Eighty grand.

390
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:51,804
One hundred grand.

391
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,584
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Look, fellas, I know..

392
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,927
I know you're not in,

393
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:58,614
which means no one cares
what you know.

394
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:01,875
Two hundred and fifty.

395
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,959
That's quite a raise.

396
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:10,508
That's one hundred and fifty
on my one hundred.

397
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:14,057
Yeah, and is there anything else
you want to say?

398
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:18,470
As you know, this puts us
in an awkward position.

399
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,635
I don't have enough
to continue.

400
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,472
We will have to see both your cards if no
one loans Eddie the money to continue.

401
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,486
It's a loan
or we see both your cards.

402
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,256
I will.

403
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,284
You will what?

404
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,217
I will loan you the money.

405
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,877
No, I think I'd rather
just turn 'em over.

406
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:51,658
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

407
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,864
I wanna keep going.

408
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:56,166
I'm also offering you the money.

409
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:00,291
So we don't have to turn 'em over
because you can borrow.

410
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,703
I need two hundred
and fifty grand.

411
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:08,348
No, you need five hundred
grand to see me.

412
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,706
That's if I wanna see you.

413
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:15,063
Well, you're gonna have a problem
carrying on, ain't ya?

414
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:19,475
I'll see you.

415
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,039
OK, before I loan you this,
I expect -

416
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,669
- if you lose, of course -

417
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:28,780
my money back within a week.

418
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,425
Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

419
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,393
Is that it?

420
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:05,229
Now let's see his fucking cards.

421
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,444
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

422
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,266
I know your friends

423
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:19,856
are responsible
for most of the cash..

424
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,829
so I'm gonna give you
one week to find it.

425
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:26,474
Otherwise I will take a finger

426
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,777
of each of you
and your friends' hands

427
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:31,750
for every day that passes
without payment.

428
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:33,764
And then when you've
run out of digits -

429
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,601
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

430
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,328
All right, my son?

431
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,936
This doesn't look good.

432
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:05,226
'He then proceeded to explain the
unfortunate position they were in.'

433
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:08,488
'Harry was going to start sizing up
all their fingers in a week.'

434
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:11,941
'Because he knew there was no way Ed
could settle that debt on his own.'

435
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:14,339
'Harry saw it
as their money on the table, '

436
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,312
'so it was also their debt
off the table.'

437
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:20,957
'Ed would hate to admit it, but he could've
kissed the old bastard for that.'

438
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,163
'lf he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own, '

439
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,315
'it would have been a lie.'

440
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:28,535
I wish to Christ he would've
let me settle the debt on my own.

441
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:34,003
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Stop fucking about, Tom.

442
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:37,648
Now think about what
we're gonna do. Now sit down.

443
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,787
What's all the fuss
about Harry?

444
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,705
Why don't we just
boycott the payment?

445
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,501
Let me tell you
about Hatchet Harry.

446
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:55,489
Once was this geezer, called Smithy
Robinson, who worked for Harry.

447
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:57,695
But it was rumoured
that he was on the take.

448
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,765
Harry's invited Smithy round
for an explanation.

449
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,067
Smithy didn't
do a very good job.

450
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:04,410
Within a minute..

451
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,040
Harry's lost his rag.

452
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,575
Reached out for the nearest
thing at hand -

453
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:10,357
which happened to be
a 15-inch black rubber cock.

454
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:15,057
He's then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

455
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,908
Now that was seen as
a pleasant way to go.

456
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,320
Hence Hatchet Harry
is a man you pay if you owe.

457
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:30,404
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

458
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:01,962
Golf - the best way
to spoil a good walk.

459
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,595
Winston Churchill said that.

460
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,664
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world.

461
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,967
And I got
bigger teeth than you two.

462
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,146
I think our friend is trying
to tell us something.

463
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,216
Perhaps not. Perhaps I should take
another swing just to make sure?

464
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:26,038
Give me a five iron, John.

465
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,573
Certainly, Dog.

466
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:32,369
Now, keep still.

467
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes, Gordon, is there something
you'd like to tell us?

468
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,141
- It's in the fireplace.
- Shut it, you idiot, he'll kill..

469
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,882
Yes, Gordon, you were saying?

470
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:53,663
It's in the fireplace.
Just pull it out. It's in the bottom.

471
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,829
It's in the fireplace, Frank.
Just pull it out.

472
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,172
It's in the bottom.

473
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, Dog, I think you might wanna
have a look at this!

474
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:05,941
You gonna let me down now?

475
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,915
No, I'm not
finished with you yet.

476
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,409
Steel.

477
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,205
Help! Help!

478
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,919
Oh, Dog.

479
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,360
Who the hell's that?
It's only 12 o'clock.

480
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,909
Use the cage,
that's what it's there for.

481
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:40,665
Who is it?

482
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,297
We have got security
for a reason, Willie.

483
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:52,751
Chill, Winston. It's only Plank.

484
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:57,738
This weed's getting quite a rep,
you know, fellas, all right?

485
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:58,890
Easy.

486
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:00,616
Jesus!

487
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:02,822
Never saw you there.

488
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:05,124
Hello, love,
enjoying yourself?

489
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,002
Is she compos?

490
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:09,537
What do you think?

491
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,661
Boo!

492
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,484
Fuck me!

493
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,402
Clean that up, Charles.

494
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,033
Sod you, you clean it up.

495
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:22,678
Sorry, fellas, but that stupid cow
scared the fucking life out of me!

496
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:27,378
Never mind. Can you just
sit down, stay out the way?

497
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,270
Look, how much is it you want?

498
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,764
I'm.. after an half weight.

499
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:39,272
Right. Well, that's 1,500 then.
Pass the scales, Willie.

500
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:42,725
Give us some gear, J.

501
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:50,015
Any chance of actually
seeing the.. money?

502
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:00,183
The odds are 100-1.

503
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,581
All is we need is five grand.

504
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,746
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rockin' horse.

505
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:10,063
The odds are 100-1 for a good
reason, Bacon - it won't win!

506
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,091
- Where's Eddie?
- Where do you think?

507
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:17,160
The bottom of a bottle,
and has been for two days.

508
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:20,325
- It's hit him hard.
- Yeah, it's hit us all hard!

509
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,299
Yeah, but he's got to tell his dad
he's about to lose his bar.

510
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,451
Listen to this one.

511
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:28,096
You open up a company, called
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club"

512
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,974
- You what?
- You take out an advert in the back
page of some gay mag,

513
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:35,002
advertising the latest
in arse-intruding dildos.

514
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,688
You sell it with.. I dunno..

515
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,989
"Does what no other
dildo can do until now"

516
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,099
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology"

517
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,923
"Guaranteed results or money back",
all that bollocks."

518
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,896
Now, these dilds cost 25 quid a pop

519
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:50,253
that's a snip for the amount of pleasure
they're gonna give the recipients.

520
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,748
They send their cheques
to the other company name.

521
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:57,159
Nothing offensive, "Bobby's Bits"
or something, for 25 quid.

522
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,421
You take that 25 quid,
you stick it in the bank until it clears.

523
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:02,052
Now this is the smart bit.

524
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:05,409
You send back the cheque
for 25 pound

525
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:07,136
from the other company name

526
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:10,013
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club"
saying "We're sorry,"

527
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:13,371
we couldn't get the supplies from
America - because they ran out of stock.

528
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:16,728
Now you see, how many people
cash that cheque.

529
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:19,126
Not a single soul.

530
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:23,826
Because who wants their bank manager
to know they tickle arse when he is
not paying in cheques!

531
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:26,608
So how long do you have to wait
till you see a return?

532
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:28,525
Probably
no more than four weeks.

533
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:35,528
A month? So what fucking good is that
if we need it in six - no, five days?

534
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:37,447
Well, it's still a good idea.

535
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:43,297
He may know we smoke a lot, burn a bit
of profit, but he can't have any idea

536
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:46,175
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

537
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:49,437
I don't know. Do you know?

538
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:53,274
We can just.. slice it
off the top.

539
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,205
You guys have got
to realise who this chap is.

540
00:36:57,206 --> 00:37:00,372
He might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

541
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,633
If he gets the slightest inkling
we're not throwing straight dice,

542
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:04,879
you and me are gonna know

543
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,237
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

544
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,059
So you know these geezers well?

545
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,018
Well enough -

546
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,225
I've been buying gear off one
of 'em for a coupla years.

547
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,485
- So what they like, then?
- Poofs! Nothing heavy.

548
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,597
Four public school boys,
soft as shite.

549
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,714
They ponce around in funny hippy
clothes all day talking bollocks

550
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:43,728
they're just good at
growing weed, that's all.

551
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:46,222
Business has got bigger
than what they could handle.

552
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:48,908
They can't all be stupid, can they?

553
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:53,032
Think about it, they got a container
load of cash in shoe boxes,

554
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:54,567
they're selling class A gear -

555
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:57,061
can't you figure out there's
someone sensible involved?

556
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:58,403
What about security?

557
00:37:58,404 --> 00:38:00,802
There's one steel gate as you go in,
but they never lock it.

558
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:03,680
What d'you mean they never lock it?
Why've they got it for there, then?

559
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,886
I must've been there 50 times -
it's never locked.

560
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,955
They're not suspicious. Everyone
that goes there's a toff.

561
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:10,490
They're all into that karma crap -

562
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,984
"If I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

563
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:14,998
No way they can get back to you?

564
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:17,972
Even if they could, they'd be
too shit scared. I'm a geezer.

565
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:20,466
They got no muscle.. gutless faggots.

566
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:23,823
Fancy one?

567
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,852
What's all the flapping about?
You told the old man yet?

568
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:30,154
Hoping I won't need to.

569
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,415
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

570
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,460
- Hello, boys.
- Harry.

571
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:48,283
Do you want a drink?

572
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:51,160
Hello, my son.
D'you want a lolly?

573
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:52,983
Piss off, you nonce.

574
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,901
Oi, watch it!

575
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,491
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

576
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,505
Nice shooter.

577
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:02,479
Yeah, one of a pair -
Holland and Holland.

578
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:03,630
D'you wanna hold it?

579
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:05,740
No, not my thing, thanks, Harry.

580
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,234
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

581
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,112
Four young fellas got in deeper
than they could handle.

582
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,798
They owe me
half a million pound.

583
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,675
- How much?
- Half a million.

584
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:20,512
I'm game.

585
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:23,582
Me too.

586
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:26,843
Oh, God!

587
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:31,159
Right. We hit 'em
as soon as they come back.

588
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,941
We'll be prepared. Waiting.

589
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:36,819
And they're armed.

590
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:38,929
What was that? Armed?

591
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,998
What d'you mean armed?
Armed with what?

592
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,068
Bad breath, colourful language,
feather duster?

593
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,658
What do you think
they're gonna be armed with?
Guns, you tit!

594
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,617
Guns?

595
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,111
You never said
anything about guns.

596
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:53,413
A minute ago this was
the safest job in the world.

597
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:55,715
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia!

598
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,209
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

599
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,087
- I've thought about that and..
- And what exactly?

600
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:06,073
And.. all we have to do is find out
who's carrying 'em.

601
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:09,815
Carying them?
Well, they could all be carrying 'em
for what we know.

602
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,693
No. Only one of 'em carries
them going to the job.

603
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:16,818
So I assume the same one will be carry
'em when they come back from the job.

604
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:18,544
Oh - you assume, dear?

605
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,422
And what did I say about assumption -
being the brother of all fuck-ups?

606
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,243
It's the mother of all fuck-ups,
you stupid!

607
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,450
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker.

608
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,369
It don't make any difference.

609
00:40:28,328 --> 00:40:32,645
They're still fucking guns and
they still fire fucking bullets!

610
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:37,537
Soap, if you have a better idea
how to get £500,000

611
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,606
in the next few days,
let us know.

612
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,004
In the meantime, Tom,

613
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,210
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

614
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,227
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

615
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:56,817
It's some fucked-up skunk, Class A,

616
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,119
"I can't think
let alone move" shit.

617
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:00,558
Doesn't sound
very good to me.

618
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,147
Oh, neither me - it depends
what flicks your switch.

619
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:05,929
And the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

620
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:08,039
Anyway, do you know anyone?

621
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,341
I know a man, yes.

622
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,795
Rory Breaker.

623
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:16,001
Not that madman with an afro?

624
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,015
I don't want anything
to do with him.

625
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:21,085
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

626
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:23,579
No can do.

627
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,456
What's that -
a place near Kathmandu?

628
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:27,990
Meet me half-way, mate.

629
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,813
It's all completely
chicken soup.

630
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,171
- It's what?
- It's kosher.. as Christmas.

631
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:35,185
Jews don't
celebrate Christmas, Tom.

632
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,350
No, I never mind that.
I'm gonna need some artillery, too.

633
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:39,981
Coupla sawn-off shotguns.

634
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:42,475
This is a bit heavy. This is London,
not the Lebanon.

635
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:44,201
Who d'you think I am?

636
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:46,983
I think you're Nick the Greek.

637
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,422
Hold those two.

638
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:53,314
I don't normally have
anything to do with weed, Nick.

639
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,424
But if it is
what he says it is,

640
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:58,110
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

641
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,371
That is if it is what he says it is.

642
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,386
I don't want to see it
after a sample,

643
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:05,592
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

644
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:08,757
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

645
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,154
He'll sort out the details.

646
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,361
But just let me tell you
one thing..

647
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:19,884
If the milk turns out
to be sour,

648
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:23,049
I ain't the kind
of pussy to drink it.

649
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,503
D'you know what I mean?

650
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:34,272
- Rory Breaker.
- Rory?

651
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,629
You don't know Rory. He's not
to be underestimated.

652
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:39,452
He's a funny-looking
fucker, I know.

653
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:42,138
But you've got to look past the hair
and the cute cuddly thing.

654
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,728
It's all a deceptive façade.

655
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:49,715
A few nights ago
Rory's roger iron busted.

656
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:53,456
So he's gone down the battle cruiser
to watch the end of the football game.

657
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:56,814
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel over.

658
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:59,403
A fat geezer's north opens.

659
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:02,089
And he wanders up
and turns the lizar over.

660
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:05,063
"Now fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

661
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:07,077
Rory knows claret is imminent,

662
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:08,804
but he doesn't want to miss
the end of the game.

663
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:12,161
So calm as a coma, picks up
the fire extinguisher,

664
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:15,134
walks straight past the jam rolls
who were ready for action

665
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,245
and plonks it outside
the entrance.

666
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,217
He then orders an aristotle
of the most ping-pong tiddly

667
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:23,767
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer.

668
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:26,453
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

669
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:28,755
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory.

670
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,824
And he gobs out a mouthful of booze,
covering Fatty.

671
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:34,127
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest

672
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,196
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

673
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:40,170
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

674
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:43,431
His team's won, too. Four nil.

675
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:01,656
Oi! ls your hair supposed
to look like that?

676
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,246
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

677
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:07,603
Listen, the next time we do a job like this
we're gonna want more money, Barry.

678
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,481
Or we're going back
to post offices and cars. Fuck that!

679
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:12,399
Where's the others?

680
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:14,318
There was no others.

681
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:17,003
Stop fucking around.
The others - the old ones.

682
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,154
I don't know what you mean.

683
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,457
There were two old guns there.
Where are they now?

684
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:22,949
Not in the cabinet, there wasn't.

685
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,636
Oh, there was a couple of old hammer-lock
muskets the butler was carrying.

686
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:29,665
- But they were ours. We sold them.
- Well you better un-sell 'em, sharpish!

687
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:31,008
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

688
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,310
I am not fucking interested.

689
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:36,955
If you don't wanna be counting
the fingers you haven't got,

690
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:41,559
I suggest you get those guns.
Quick!

691
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:26,738
Jesus! if I pick 'em up,
will they stay in one piece?

692
00:45:27,026 --> 00:45:28,368
Where'd you get them?

693
00:45:29,424 --> 00:45:32,109
I got contacts. Listen, Tom -

694
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:34,891
you point them at me, I'll shit
myself or do whatever you say to do.

695
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:36,618
Either way you get
the desired effect.

696
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,112
Oh, they look very nice, I agree, but

697
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:41,606
well, they're lacking in criminal
credibility, ain't they?

698
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:42,948
I might get laughed at.

699
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,483
How much d'you want
for these muskets?

700
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,825
700 each.

701
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,224
And what's that, a pound for every year
they been about?

702
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,869
I know they're antiques, but I ain't
paying antique prices.

703
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:56,665
They're a bit long, ain't they?

704
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,296
Sawn-offs are out.

705
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:00,694
People want a bit
more range these days.

706
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:04,627
Range? I don't wanna blow the arse
out of this country grounded,

707
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:07,216
but I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry either.

708
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,806
I want to look.. fucking mean.

709
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:11,725
Of course you'll look mean.

710
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,451
You'll look really scary.

711
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:16,329
Enough about that. What about
this geezer who sells drugs?

712
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:18,535
Rory Breaker's standing by.

713
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:22,276
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy?

714
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:29,470
I understand if this has come
as a bit of a shock.

715
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,293
But let me tell you
how this can be resolved

716
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,691
by you, the good father.

717
00:46:33,786 --> 00:46:35,513
Go on.

718
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:38,774
- He likes your bar.
- Yes.

719
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,172
He wants your bar.

720
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:43,665
And?

721
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,064
D'you want me
to draw you a picture?

722
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,516
Look, that boy doesn't know
his arsehole from his earhole.

723
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:52,778
This is my bar. It's got
nothing to do with him.

724
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:53,930
What, and I care?

725
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:56,998
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage

726
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:59,110
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

727
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:01,028
And you do have a reputation

728
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,425
so I'll choose my words
very carefully.

729
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:06,495
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

730
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,443
Now..

731
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:17,718
I'll put that down to shock.

732
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:19,157
Only once.

733
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:24,241
Only once can I, or shall I,
let you get away with that.

734
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:28,174
Your son's got three days
to find half a mill.

735
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,339
But make up your mind
which you prefer -

736
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:35,559
your bar.. or your son.

737
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:41,123
Plank goes in first.

738
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:44,000
There's a cage, but it's never
locked, is it, Plank?

739
00:47:44,096 --> 00:47:46,974
- Never.
- You don't wanna be..

740
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,235
All right, once he's got himself set,
he gets the rest of us in.

741
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:54,264
Now we'll get nasty with a couple of'em,
shit 'em up, ok, or whatever.

742
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:56,662
Now these wankers shouldn't
give us any problems.

743
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,827
Like any cowboys - there'll
be a few tools lying around.

744
00:48:00,115 --> 00:48:03,664
When the job's done, we come
straight back here and unload.

745
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,158
And Robert's
your father's brother.

746
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,268
Everyone savvy?

747
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,379
Sweet.

748
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,489
Have a look at these.

749
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:16,326
And what are we supposed
to do with these?

750
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:19,490
Put them on your head, stupid.

751
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:21,410
Christ!

752
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:24,190
If you think I'm gonna
turn up there clean-shaven,

753
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:26,973
and greet them with a grin on my face,
you've got another think coming.

754
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,986
Now these fellas,  they're your neighbors.

755
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:32,920
I thought it might be a good
idea to disguise ourselves a little.

756
00:48:33,304 --> 00:48:36,949
Right.. er, yeah, good thinking,
Soap. Well done.

757
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,251
I brought weapons as well.

758
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:41,553
Weapons?
What do you mean weapons?

759
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:44,910
These.

760
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:47,212
Jesus!

761
00:48:47,596 --> 00:48:49,706
Let's keep 'em covered up.

762
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,159
Couldn't you get
anything a bit bigger?

763
00:48:54,406 --> 00:48:56,900
What, like that?

764
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,531
What d'you think?

765
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,464
I think you need help.

766
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:05,341
Bar steward, can we have
a coupla drinks, please.

767
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:07,260
Have you seen your dad?

768
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,850
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

769
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:11,864
Oh, shit. When?

770
00:49:13,591 --> 00:49:15,605
Crazy.

771
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:28,650
Where'd you get these,
a fucking museum?

772
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:30,952
Nick the Greek.

773
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:33,734
How much did you part with?

774
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:35,269
700 for the pair.

775
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,091
Drachmas, I hope.

776
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,873
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

777
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:42,750
These are gonna do
more harm than good.

778
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,067
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

779
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:49,753
I don't know. Look nice though, don't they?
I rather like 'em.

780
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:51,863
Oh, that's top of the list of priorities,
is that it?

781
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:55,988
Ladies, back to more important
issues, if you don't mind.

782
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:00,112
We've only got two real guns -
apparently that's what they are.

783
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:02,318
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

784
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,387
We wait till it sounds out the right
time, then we, jack-in-the-box,

785
00:50:05,388 --> 00:50:09,033
look nasty and stuff, cocoon 'em
in gaffer tape, nick their van,

786
00:50:09,225 --> 00:50:12,678
swap the gear into the new van
and bring it all back here.

787
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,267
As long as we're all out
of our hiding places quickly,

788
00:50:15,268 --> 00:50:17,186
it's the last thing
they're gonna expect.

789
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:21,694
Oh, & if Tom or anyone else for that matter
feels like giving 'em a bit of a kicking,

790
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:23,805
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

791
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:27,450
Yeah, little bit of pain
never hurt anybody.

792
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:29,656
If you know what I mean.

793
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:33,205
Also, I think knives
are a good idea.

794
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,987
Big, fuck-off shiny ones.

795
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,960
Ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

796
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,838
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise.

797
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,291
And the less noise they make,
the more likely we are to use 'em.

798
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,785
Shit 'em right up.

799
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:50,183
Makes it look
like we're serious.

800
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:53,924
Guns for show,
knives for a pro.

801
00:50:54,691 --> 00:50:57,856
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

802
00:50:58,144 --> 00:51:01,981
I'm not sure what's more
worrying, the job or your past?

803
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:07,736
Come on, girls.

804
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,741
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

805
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,947
I thought this was meant
to be a robbery.

806
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,441
Where'd they get those outfits?

807
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:28,647
Not a bad idea that.

808
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,141
All right, it's Plank.
Is Willie there?

809
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,922
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

810
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,362
Perhaps you can help.

811
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:38,527
Perhaps I can't, Plank,
if you know what I mean.

812
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:42,268
Look, if you could just open the door
so I could talk without shouting.

813
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:44,473
I can't help you, Plank.

814
00:51:44,474 --> 00:51:47,256
I think you'll find
it's in your interest.

815
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,695
Hold on, OK?

816
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:52,435
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.
He says it's in our interest.

817
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:55,601
Listen, I don't care if it's
King-fucking-Kong,

818
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,998
he's not coming in here,
not today.

819
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:01,548
Hold on. We are in business
and.. correct me if I'm wrong, but..

820
00:52:02,123 --> 00:52:03,274
that is business.

821
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,728
Corrected. That's a walking
accident that we can do without.

822
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:10,564
Jesus. He's OK.. He knows
only to buy weights now.

823
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,250
We're looking at at least
a couple of thou'.

824
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:14,977
What do you think, Winston?

825
00:52:16,607 --> 00:52:19,005
Willie, this is
the last time. All right?

826
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:21,212
But you and the money
are going out the back.

827
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:22,842
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

828
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,761
And just clear this shit up!

829
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:28,406
- What, now?
- Yes! Now!

830
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:30,612
Just get rid of him quick.

831
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:32,818
All right. Just coming.

832
00:52:36,463 --> 00:52:37,902
What the fuck is he doing?

833
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:44,137
Come on, I can't wait
out here all day!

834
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:46,727
All right. Just coming.

835
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,057
I thought you was gonna
leave me out there all day.

836
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:55,072
I didn't know you were
a removals man, Plank.

837
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:58,813
Lives and learns, don't ya?
Keep the gates locked now here?

838
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,073
Ya, sorry. Gotta
do business like this now.

839
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:03,801
Can't be too careful these days.

840
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:04,952
I know.

841
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:08,883
Shut it! You say a fucking word, the right
ear goes, another one - and your left!

842
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,185
- What are you doing, Plank?
- What do you think I'm doing?

843
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:13,201
Hang on, what are you doing?

844
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:16,366
Unlock the gate!
Oi! I say unlock the fucking gate!

845
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,532
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

846
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:24,422
What the fuck's going on?

847
00:53:24,423 --> 00:53:26,438
Just hang on, I've got the keys.

848
00:53:26,726 --> 00:53:29,891
The gate's locked! I thought they weren't
gonna get the fucking gate locked.

849
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,041
What've you done to Fauntleroy?

850
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,960
I didn't touch him.
He just passed out.

851
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:36,605
Don't you stand there.
Get the fucking  shut!
D'you want the world to see this?

852
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,018
What's going on down there?

853
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:44,471
Shit!

854
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,871
Charles, get the rifle out.

855
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,173
We're being fucked.

856
00:53:56,365 --> 00:53:57,324
It must be this one.

857
00:53:57,612 --> 00:54:00,490
Hold that gun. Plank, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Plank.

858
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:03,080
Don't point that at my bollocks!
Point it in there!

859
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:06,437
Planks of wood. I'm working
with fucking planks of wood.

860
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:07,492
Shit!

861
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,465
What the fuck is that?

862
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:13,151
- What the fuck's that?
- IT'S ME BREN GUN!

863
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,413
Don't you think you could've brought
something a little bit more practical?

864
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,962
Don't none of you slags move.
I'll kill the fucking lot of you!

865
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:22,264
Who you gonna kill, Plank?
There's no one fuckin' there?

866
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:28,019
Aaagh! They fucking shot me!

867
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,225
Well, shoot 'em back.

868
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,829
Jesus, Plank! Couldn't you get
smokeless cartidges?

869
00:54:34,925 --> 00:54:36,364
I can't see a bloody thing!

870
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,242
Aaagh! Shit, I've been shot.

871
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:42,023
I don't fucking believe this.
Could everyone stop getting shot?

872
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,763
John, sit down and patch
yourself up, you tart!

873
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,587
It's a fucking air rifle!

874
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:56,699
- What the fuck was that?
- Well, that was the Bren gun.

875
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:59,481
You fire that gun again, you're a dead man.
Understand? Dead!

876
00:54:59,673 --> 00:55:02,358
- No ifs, no buts, you're a fucking dead man!
- All right, all right!

877
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:04,757
I've got bollock ache with this.
Where's my fucking gun?

878
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:14,828
All right. Now I've got your attention.
Firstly, I'm gonna blow his toes off.

879
00:55:17,035 --> 00:55:18,282
There go his toes.

880
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:21,159
Now if you want me out of here,
in five minutes flat,

881
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:24,516
open the fucking gate
'cause I'm gonna blow his leg off!

882
00:55:26,051 --> 00:55:28,257
They're gonna fucking kill us
if we do, man.

883
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,231
Poor J'll certainly get it
if we don't. He's serious.

884
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:33,629
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls!

885
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:37,082
It's all right, all fucking right!

886
00:55:37,849 --> 00:55:40,247
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here.., just..

887
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:44,372
Sort something out.

888
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,129
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

889
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:00,774
- There's only three of us here.
- I don't believe you.

890
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:05,187
- Fuck, I'm gonna blow his leg off.
- I mean it. There's only three of us!

891
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:09,120
- Plank?
- Yeah, one of 'em's out.

892
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:14,779
Now open the gate.

893
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:38,759
Up, up, up, there's a good lad.

894
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,519
John, get them tied up.
Plank, where's the money?

895
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,396
There, in those shoe-boxes.

896
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,581
- Where?
- Out the back.

897
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,499
- And the weed?
- Out the back.

898
00:57:22,979 --> 00:57:24,801
- Point.
- With what?

899
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:27,871
- Your fucking hands, now!
- I'm tied up.

900
00:57:28,254 --> 00:57:29,693
Well, nod your head or something!

901
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:31,803
Check it out.

902
00:57:32,475 --> 00:57:35,161
Plank, get Paul out that van lively.

903
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,083
Knife.

904
00:57:55,784 --> 00:57:58,661
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

905
00:57:59,045 --> 00:57:59,908
How you doing, Mick?

906
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,073
How d'you think I'm doing?
He's fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

907
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:13,721
Jesus Christ.

908
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:19,860
Gordon Bennett.

909
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:21,778
What the fuck's
been going on here?

910
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,807
Shut up, you idiot.
It's Hanukkah.

911
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,629
Don't just stand there.

912
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,644
Look at the bags, can you fit it all in?

913
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,536
There's a lot.. I can't
get Epping Forest in my van.

914
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:38,468
'Can't'. I don't hear 'can't'.
Bollocks to 'can't'.

915
00:58:38,564 --> 00:58:41,634
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

916
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:47,773
Bollocks!

917
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:52,473
You got a ticket already. Now if you
don't move it, we will move it for you.

918
00:58:52,569 --> 00:58:54,775
- I'll only be a minute.
- You've already been 15.

919
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:58,612
- Look, come and have a look.
- At what exactly?

920
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,681
- Well, the van's half full.
- So?

921
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:05,614
So, all I've got to do
is fill it up, put you in it..

922
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:06,765
What?

923
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:11,657
..and I'm off.

924
00:59:19,426 --> 00:59:21,441
Do you think you can carry
more than one bag this time?

925
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:23,743
- I can't. My neck, Dog.

926
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,100
- How many more bags?
- Just a couple.

927
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:30,457
Mick, you dead yet?

928
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:35,637
I'll be all right. Once I've
dealt with that lanky prick.

929
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:37,939
Do it quietly.

930
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,311
It's time to say "Goodnight, nurse".

931
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:27,147
Where the fuck
did she come from?

932
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:36,451
That is it. Tie her up.
We're out of here.

933
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:42,782
Not like that,
you idiot. Give it us here.

934
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:07,241
What you doing, Ed?

935
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:08,680
D'you want one?

936
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,654
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make a cup of tea, Edward.

937
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:15,107
The entire British Empire
was built on cups of tea.

938
01:01:15,203 --> 01:01:16,738
Yeah, and look what happened to that.

939
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:19,999
And if you think I'm going to war
without one, mate, you're mistaken.

940
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,726
Going to war with what?

941
01:01:22,109 --> 01:01:25,562
Have you forgotten
those guns, you dozy prat?

942
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:47,816
You won't get away with this.

943
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:52,516
- Paul, what's that?
- It's a traffic warden.

944
01:01:52,804 --> 01:01:55,586
I can see it's a fuckin' traffic warden,
what's he doing in the back of the van?

945
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:57,216
He was gonna call the cozzers.

946
01:01:58,943 --> 01:02:02,396
Fair enough -
we'll deal with him later.

947
01:02:04,506 --> 01:02:06,137
How we doing, Tom?

948
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:07,768
Right as rain.

949
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:10,069
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

950
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,988
Keep us posted.

951
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:17,935
All right, mate, do you do airports?

952
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:22,347
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

953
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:27,719
Don't complicate things.
Just hide.

954
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,011
We're on.

955
01:02:58,318 --> 01:02:59,757
They weigh a pound or two!

956
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:01,675
Shut up and back up!

957
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:05,991
Spin round, big boy.

958
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:09,924
Fuck!

959
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,994
Stay down. Stay down!

960
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:21,627
Tie 'em up. Tape 'em up.
Hands and face.

961
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,833
On the floor!

962
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:26,135
Bend over the fucking desk.

963
01:03:31,315 --> 01:03:34,384
Keys. I want keys, now.

964
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:37,070
I'll find ya.

965
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:39,564
'Course you will, sweetheart.

966
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,098
I'll find ya.

967
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:44,168
What d'you think this is?
Fucking hide-and-seek?

968
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:46,758
That one. Search that one.

969
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:59,611
Right, I'll see you in the van, when
you've finished with handsome here.

970
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:19,083
Jesus. That wasn't
too bad, was it?

971
01:04:23,975 --> 01:04:26,853
When the bottle in my arse has
contracted, I'll let you know.

972
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:30,402
Bacon, see what we've got.

973
01:04:30,594 --> 01:04:32,320
Let's have a butchers, ey?

974
01:04:37,116 --> 01:04:38,939
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

975
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:42,871
We've got God knows how much
of this stinking weed.

976
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:46,037
A shitload of cash.

977
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:49,394
And a traffic warden.

978
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:50,449
What?

979
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,053
Jesus, Ed.
We got a traffic warden.

980
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,507
I think he's still alive.

981
01:04:58,986 --> 01:05:01,288
He's got claret
coming out of him somewhere.

982
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:03,493
What did they want
with a traffic warden?

983
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,221
I don't know.
I don't think we need him.

984
01:05:05,413 --> 01:05:07,427
Knock him out and dump him
at the lights.

985
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,537
Knock him out? What d'you mean,
knock him out? Knock him out with what?

986
01:05:09,729 --> 01:05:12,031
I don't know! Use your imagination.

987
01:05:17,403 --> 01:05:19,417
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out.

988
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:20,856
I'll knock you out in a minute!

989
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:23,734
Look, you wanna knock him out,
you knock him out.

990
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:27,187
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

991
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:41,095
It's about time you gave my
young friends a visit, Chris.

992
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,947
Tomorrow's the day
and mum's the word.

993
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,577
Now I can't have that,
can I, Baz?

994
01:05:48,673 --> 01:05:50,400
No, Harry, you can't.

995
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:52,606
I mean it's a liberty.

996
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:55,867
And I can't have a liberty taken,
can I, Chris?

997
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:57,690
No, Harry, you can't.

998
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:01,814
I mean, it's enough
to give me the arsehole.

999
01:06:03,061 --> 01:06:05,172
And I can't have the arsehole,
can I, boys?

1000
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,857
No, Harry, you can't.

1001
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:16,298
All right, that's it.
We're done.

1002
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:18,216
We're off.

1003
01:06:18,217 --> 01:06:20,807
Here, Ed, are you sure it's a good
idea taking this back to yours?

1004
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:23,109
Why, it's the only place we can take it,
and the last place they're gonna look.

1005
01:06:23,205 --> 01:06:25,986
Anyway, fuck it. The battle
is over and the war is won.

1006
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:30,399
Now, Tom, you take this to Nick the
Bubble and we get rid of it quick.

1007
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:45,938
This skunk
is as good as it gets.

1008
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,885
All right.
We'll take it. Half price.

1009
01:06:53,228 --> 01:06:54,763
I don't think he'll like that.

1010
01:06:54,859 --> 01:06:57,928
And you said three five a key.
And.. and you know that's a good price.

1011
01:06:58,216 --> 01:06:59,942
That was yesterday I said three and a half.

1012
01:07:00,038 --> 01:07:02,149
And now it's today
if I'm not mistaken.

1013
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:05,506
We'll take it tomorrow.
Half price.

1014
01:07:05,985 --> 01:07:08,671
If he wants to get rid of it
quick, he'll have to take it.

1015
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:13,563
Now look, I've got a race coming up in a
minute, so if you'd just be kind enough to..

1016
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,196
Lenny,

1017
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:24,978
take that round to Snow White
and the three little chemists.

1018
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,991
They should have
a gander of that.

1019
01:07:26,992 --> 01:07:29,678
I want a second opinion.

1020
01:07:33,898 --> 01:07:35,721
Hang on a minute, Nathan,
something stinks.

1021
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:37,927
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1022
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:39,845
Fuck you, funny man.

1023
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:42,819
For God's sake, help me.

1024
01:07:42,915 --> 01:07:46,751
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain, Jesus!

1025
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:47,999
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1026
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:50,301
Fuck you, funny man.
You go first.

1027
01:07:50,397 --> 01:07:52,315
Just get the fuck in there, will you?

1028
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:55,576
I want this house searched for bugs,
I mean I want it stripped.

1029
01:07:55,768 --> 01:07:59,030
Where is the poin in that?
Even if there was a bug,
they'd have taken it with 'em.

1030
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,236
It's a bit late
for you to start thinking, John.

1031
01:08:01,428 --> 01:08:03,634
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1032
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:07,853
I want you to strip this place.
I want every slag this side of Ceylon
pulled in.

1033
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:10,636
And tortured.. badly.

1034
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:12,363
I want to know
who's responsible for this,

1035
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,857
otherwise I'm gonna hold
you all responsible.

1036
01:08:22,626 --> 01:08:24,161
Not a bad day.

1037
01:08:25,504 --> 01:08:27,902
That pile takes care of Harry.

1038
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:30,682
What's left over?

1039
01:08:30,683 --> 01:08:32,602
Give me half a chance
to count it.

1040
01:08:34,137 --> 01:08:36,151
What about this gear, then, ey?

1041
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:44,208
Oh, what, you want
a toke on that?

1042
01:08:44,592 --> 01:08:46,606
No. I don't think I want any
of that horrible shit.

1043
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:49,388
Can we lock up
and get drunk now, please?

1044
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:54,855
We shot one of them..
in the.. er, throat.

1045
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:55,911
What d'you want, a medal?

1046
01:08:56,102 --> 01:08:59,556
I'll shoot you in the fuckin throat
if I don't get my ganja back.

1047
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:03,584
The one you shot.
Is he still in there now?

1048
01:09:03,776 --> 01:09:05,215
No, it was another one.

1049
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,284
That's more like it.
Where is he?

1050
01:09:09,148 --> 01:09:10,970
Well, they.. they
took him with them.

1051
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,752
He's still, still alive.

1052
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:17,301
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1053
01:09:21,713 --> 01:09:26,605
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1054
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:29,195
You don't say.

1055
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,648
Who could it be?
Where do we start, Rory?

1056
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,895
Mr Breaker.

1057
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:37,924
Today my name is Mr Breaker.

1058
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,130
You think this
is a coincidence?

1059
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:42,048
This white shite
steals my things

1060
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:44,062
and thinks that he can
sell it back to me!

1061
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,269
He's got less brains
than you, Lenny!

1062
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:49,051
Get Nick - the greasy wop

1063
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:53,270
shistos pezavengy gammore
Greek bastard round here now,

1064
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:56,629
if he's still stupid enough
to be on this planet.

1065
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,425
Your stupidity might be
your one saving grace.

1066
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,576
Uuh?

1067
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:31,781
Don't uuh me, Greek boy.

1068
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:34,850
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1069
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:37,632
thought that they might be able
to steal my cannabis

1070
01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:39,551
and then sell it back to me?

1071
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:41,757
Is this a declaration of war?

1072
01:11:41,758 --> 01:11:44,635
Is this some white cunt's joke
that black cunts don't get?

1073
01:11:45,019 --> 01:11:48,184
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Ni-ko-las!

1074
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:51,925
I know you couldn't
have known my position,

1075
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,515
'cause you're not that stupid
that if you did,

1076
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:56,817
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse,

1077
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:01,517
with that "what's going on here" look
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1078
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,601
But what you do know
is where these people live.

1079
01:12:12,548 --> 01:12:14,850
If you hold back anything,
I'll kill you.

1080
01:12:15,426 --> 01:12:18,783
If you bend the truth, or I think you
are bending the truth, I'll kill you.

1081
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,085
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1082
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:25,306
In fact, you're gonna have to work
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1083
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:27,992
Now do you understand
everything I've said?

1084
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:32,500
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1085
01:12:32,692 --> 01:12:38,159
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak..
you may enlighten me.

1086
01:12:41,516 --> 01:12:43,243
So we've got a bit
of a problem, don't we?

1087
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,545
Er, well.. yeah, yeah, we do.

1088
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:49,285
Yea, yeah, we do. In fact, this is
a little bit more than looking a
bit of a problem, isn't it?

1089
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:52,354
On the scale of things, you could say it's
the Mount fucking Everest of problems!

1090
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:55,136
And the reason it's such a
mon-fucking-struosity of a problem is..

1091
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,110
you don't have the first idea
who did this to us, have you?

1092
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,701
Dog, we've.. we've been up all night.
It's no one from round here.

1093
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:02,331
We've had 'em all lined up
against the wall.

1094
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:04,440
If it was a toerag
from round the manor, we'd know.

1095
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:07,703
- We'd know.
- You'd know? You'd fucking know?

1096
01:13:07,799 --> 01:13:10,388
You wouldn't know if it was
the next door fucking neighbours!

1097
01:13:10,389 --> 01:13:11,826
Now get out there and find them!

1098
01:13:11,827 --> 01:13:16,527
I'm sick of the fucking sight of you!
Get out of the fucking sight!
You look shit!

1099
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:31,107
"Scarf ace" -
I've watched "Scarf ace".

1100
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:35,136
If you want to know how to do
a drug deal, you watch "Scarf ace".

1101
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,069
That really inspires confidence.

1102
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:42,042
- This guy, Rory Breaker..
- Rory Breaker?

1103
01:13:42,426 --> 01:13:44,345
The psychotic black dwarf with an afro?

1104
01:13:44,536 --> 01:13:45,783
That'll be the same man, yes.

1105
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:48,565
I've heard of him -
he's a fucking lunatic.

1106
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:51,154
Well, he can afford to do the deal
at the price we're selling.

1107
01:13:51,155 --> 01:13:52,402
It's not worth him
giving us any trouble.

1108
01:13:52,498 --> 01:13:55,183
Cause he knows we'll be a pain in the arse.
And who needs a pain in the arse?

1109
01:13:55,184 --> 01:13:57,102
I'd take a pain in the arse
for half a million quid.

1110
01:13:57,486 --> 01:13:59,020
You'd take a pain
in the arse for air miles.

1111
01:13:59,404 --> 01:14:01,130
Tom, the fatter you get,
the sadder you get.

1112
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:02,953
Will you two stop flirting
for a minute?

1113
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:07,461
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up..

1114
01:14:07,845 --> 01:14:10,531
nearly 200,000 pounds each.

1115
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:14,080
That's not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1116
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:25,974
So they had the cash.

1117
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,029
And the puff.

1118
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:30,099
Cheeky bastards. Count it.

1119
01:14:30,195 --> 01:14:32,113
Shit, Dog. There's a lot.

1120
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:34,511
Do you want to do it next door?

1121
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:36,045
We're not going next door

1122
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,540
'til we've flayed
them dead men walking.

1123
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:40,266
We'll count it upstairs.

1124
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:42,952
I don't want them to see you
fingering the money when
they walk through the door..

1125
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:44,775
Dog, look..

1126
01:14:46,118 --> 01:14:49,379
Give it us here.. dozy bastard.

1127
01:14:51,873 --> 01:14:54,175
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1128
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:58,204
You wait till they get right inside
the door, then you give it to'em.

1129
01:14:58,683 --> 01:15:02,040
Give me them shooters,
you can use your own.

1130
01:15:12,112 --> 01:15:12,879
Yeah.

1131
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,702
That's no way
to answer the phone.

1132
01:15:14,798 --> 01:15:16,141
Is that you, Dean?

1133
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:18,730
No, it's Lord fucking Lucan.
Who do you think it is?

1134
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:19,882
What can I do for you?

1135
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:22,663
You know those guns I sold you,
I need them back.

1136
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,349
Not likely I'm afraid. I don't think
I'll be seeing them again.

1137
01:15:25,829 --> 01:15:27,459
Look, I've got the money
to pay for them.

1138
01:15:27,747 --> 01:15:30,241
I'm sure you do.
But don't think you understand.

1139
01:15:30,337 --> 01:15:32,639
I ain't gonna be seeing them
or the guns again.

1140
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:34,174
We can't get them.

1141
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:35,996
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1142
01:15:36,476 --> 01:15:38,393
Well, you'll have to fucking get them.

1143
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:40,887
We made a fucking deal for
everything inside the cabinet.

1144
01:15:40,888 --> 01:15:44,054
Inside, out-fucking-side -
I don't give a shit.

1145
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,506
- You get those guns because if you don't..
- Oh yeah, Bazza, or what?

1146
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:49,425
Have you heard
of Harry Lonsdale?

1147
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:53,070
Otherwise known as "Hack You
Up With an Hatchet Harry"?

1148
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,181
Well, this is..

1149
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,058
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1150
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:02,087
When you dance with the devil,
you wait for the song to stop.

1151
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:04,005
Know what I mean?

1152
01:16:08,418 --> 01:16:11,583
I mean find 'em,
torture 'em and kill 'em.

1153
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,693
And bring back
what belongs to me.

1154
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:18,393
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1155
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,504
Who was that?

1156
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,806
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1157
01:16:22,902 --> 01:16:24,340
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1158
01:16:24,436 --> 01:16:27,506
Shit, they were
his fucking guns we sold.

1159
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,137
We've got to find them.

1160
01:16:29,616 --> 01:16:33,645
Now no fucking about now, Nick.
Where can I find those guns?

1161
01:17:04,915 --> 01:17:06,928
Six black cocks
and a little white kitten

1162
01:17:06,929 --> 01:17:08,752
sitting on the side
of the road.

1163
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:14,219
We're gonna do
a proper decoration job.

1164
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:17,481
I want the grey skies
of London illuminated.

1165
01:17:18,248 --> 01:17:20,262
I want that house painted red.

1166
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:25,633
All right, there's this brass
standing on the corner, right?

1167
01:17:25,634 --> 01:17:28,320
Dwarf walks up to her
carrying a suitcase..

1168
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,525
Winston there
is gonna come along

1169
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,348
and see if he recognises
any of them.

1170
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,842
Now watch out for these fellas -

1171
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:39,446
they've got a bit of an arsenal
and they don't mind using it.

1172
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:42,036
And I'm taking down her panties..

1173
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,448
Now does everyone here know
what they got to do?

1174
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,175
Yeah.

1175
01:18:55,128 --> 01:18:57,238
What the fuck is going on?

1176
01:19:39,156 --> 01:19:41,266
You got something here
for me, have you?

1177
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:45,295
Come on, chop-chop.

1178
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:54,023
Thank you very much.

1179
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:58,148
- He's got the guns. Go ahead you get them.
- Why me?

1180
01:19:58,436 --> 01:19:59,874
You're supposed
to be the hard case..

1181
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,560
You go get the guns!
I drive the car!

1182
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:08,699
Good boy.

1183
01:20:08,795 --> 01:20:13,208
- Go get the fucking guns.
- I'm not going get the fucking guns!
YOU get the fucking guns!

1184
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:15,030
You fucking big..

1185
01:20:18,387 --> 01:20:20,018
All right. Wrap them guns up.

1186
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:21,457
Count the money.

1187
01:20:22,224 --> 01:20:23,567
Put your seat belt on.

1188
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:27,979
Fucking guns, we've got to get the
fucking guns or we're dead!

1189
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,766
..so I made sure I fucked
the one that was coughing.

1190
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:01,743
Out of the car, you yuppy fucker!
Aaaaaaaagh!

1191
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,232
He's the one
we shot in the neck.

1192
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:33,206
Is that right, Mr Botanical?

1193
01:21:58,241 --> 01:22:00,351
Jesus!

1194
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:15,123
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1195
01:22:15,411 --> 01:22:16,754
Jesus.

1196
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,454
The money. The gear.

1197
01:22:32,485 --> 01:22:33,923
This is fucked.

1198
01:22:34,307 --> 01:22:36,801
No money. No weed.

1199
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:40,254
It's all been replaced
by a pile of corpses.

1200
01:22:40,638 --> 01:22:43,802
All right. Don't panic.
Let's think about this.

1201
01:22:43,803 --> 01:22:46,681
No, fuck that,
you can think about it.

1202
01:22:46,777 --> 01:22:49,271
I'm panicking and I'm off.

1203
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,959
How did you get your hands
on these, then?

1204
01:22:59,055 --> 01:23:00,206
The boys had 'em.

1205
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:01,549
I know you like
these sort of things -

1206
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:03,659
wondered if you wanted 'em.

1207
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:05,865
Yeah, I'll have 'em.

1208
01:23:06,057 --> 01:23:09,222
- Was it hard getting the money?
- Not especially.

1209
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:12,484
Upset a few characters, though.

1210
01:23:14,018 --> 01:23:14,978
Have you counted it?

1211
01:23:15,169 --> 01:23:16,992
Yeah, it's all there,
to the pound.

1212
01:23:17,184 --> 01:23:19,294
- And they were gonna pay?
- Looks like it.

1213
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,172
But who knows?
The opportunity was there.

1214
01:23:22,268 --> 01:23:25,145
In my experience it's best
to take that opportunity -

1215
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:27,159
if it's there.

1216
01:23:27,735 --> 01:23:29,557
Good work, Chris.

1217
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:37,807
We've got to get those guns.

1218
01:23:37,999 --> 01:23:40,492
This is dangerous shit there.
We don't even know who lives there.

1219
01:23:40,588 --> 01:23:42,410
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1220
01:23:42,411 --> 01:23:45,959
All's I know is that it's preferable
to death by Hatchet.

1221
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,838
Fair enough. Let's go.

1222
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,297
I don't think
it's the right move.

1223
01:24:14,065 --> 01:24:14,928
It's either that

1224
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,477
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1225
01:24:19,244 --> 01:24:21,929
- I'm gonna phone him.
- As if he'll care.

1226
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,808
He'll care, all right? That was
supposed to be his money.

1227
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,014
Whether he cares about us
or not, is different.

1228
01:24:27,206 --> 01:24:29,028
Pass me the phone.

1229
01:24:43,992 --> 01:24:46,678
Yeah? That you, boy?

1230
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:48,692
It's Ed,
if that's what you mean.

1231
01:24:49,076 --> 01:24:50,802
'Pay day, ain't it?'

1232
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:54,351
Yeah.. l wanted
to talk to you about that.

1233
01:24:54,447 --> 01:24:56,174
I'll bet you do.

1234
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,805
I got half
a million nicker sitting here,

1235
01:24:58,188 --> 01:25:00,107
which means
some poor sod doesn't.

1236
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,601
You've been upsetin' a few people, boy.

1237
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:06,342
But that really
isn't my concern, is it?

1238
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:10,178
What does concern me..
is the guns you had.

1239
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:12,193
'I want to talk to you
about that.'

1240
01:25:12,768 --> 01:25:16,221
So get your arse over here now.
And I do mean now!

1241
01:25:49,986 --> 01:25:54,590
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1242
01:26:03,127 --> 01:26:05,813
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1243
01:26:06,772 --> 01:26:10,609
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1244
01:26:21,064 --> 01:26:24,229
Job well done. We made
a few quid out of that one.

1245
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:25,667
Son..?

1246
01:26:25,668 --> 01:26:27,682
Made a few quid, did you?

1247
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:29,793
Where's what I want, now?

1248
01:26:31,136 --> 01:26:32,383
You all right down there, mate?

1249
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:35,452
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?

1250
01:26:36,315 --> 01:26:37,946
I've just left it in the office.

1251
01:26:38,042 --> 01:26:39,673
Well, we'd better go to
the office and get it,

1252
01:26:40,056 --> 01:26:42,454
that is if you want
your son to see his next birthday.

1253
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:46,483
- Now chop-fucking-chop.
- All right. Fair enough.

1254
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,169
Where you going?

1255
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,622
It's a thirty second drive
or a five minute walk.

1256
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:57,226
I couldn't have parked outside,
I'd have got a ticket.

1257
01:26:57,802 --> 01:26:59,240
I suppose that don't
matter now, does it?

1258
01:26:59,336 --> 01:27:01,255
Just be careful.

1259
01:27:01,351 --> 01:27:02,885
Right.

1260
01:27:09,696 --> 01:27:10,751
You and me.

1261
01:27:10,847 --> 01:27:11,614
You and who?

1262
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:13,820
You know where
the door handle is, Tom.

1263
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,760
Oh, no. Not again.

1264
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:56,121
That's it. I'm off.

1265
01:27:56,889 --> 01:28:00,822
Tom.. that is our bag.

1266
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:20,869
- Ed..!
- Hold on.

1267
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:34,778
This is our bag.

1268
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:37,943
That's it. We're off.

1269
01:28:38,327 --> 01:28:41,107
- I'll see you in the car.
I'm gonna take these guns.
- Tom, don't fuck about!

1270
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:44,561
- I'll see you in the car.
- Tom!
- It'll only take a minute.

1271
01:28:59,141 --> 01:29:00,676
What is going on?

1272
01:29:00,964 --> 01:29:05,856
I don't know, but what I do know
is there's no more Harry.

1273
01:29:06,336 --> 01:29:08,158
Which means
there's no more debt.

1274
01:29:08,638 --> 01:29:11,899
And if there's no more debt,
there's no more problem.

1275
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:15,736
And there's no problem with the
neighbours - because they're all dead.

1276
01:29:15,928 --> 01:29:19,189
And I think,
if I get this right,

1277
01:29:19,764 --> 01:29:23,218
we haven't done anything wrong
and we're in the clear.

1278
01:29:54,967 --> 01:29:56,694
Never ever..

1279
01:29:56,982 --> 01:30:01,010
has anyone
been as fucking rude..

1280
01:30:01,394 --> 01:30:02,737
..to me..

1281
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:08,013
as you, YOU.. FUCKING.. BASTARD!

1282
01:30:24,607 --> 01:30:26,238
You all right, mate?

1283
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,499
Cheeky bastard!

1284
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:49,067
'Now this was an embarrassing
position for Tom to be in.

1285
01:30:49,354 --> 01:30:51,943
'But Chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding

1286
01:30:51,944 --> 01:30:54,438
'what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns.

1287
01:30:54,918 --> 01:30:58,179
'And Tom had to respect the fact
that they were not loaded.

1288
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,345
'So without anybody
losing too much face,

1289
01:31:01,632 --> 01:31:05,181
'Tom left through a side door
and Chris left with the money.

1290
01:31:05,277 --> 01:31:07,867
'And everybody else got arrested.'

1291
01:31:11,608 --> 01:31:13,239
He's not one of 'em.

1292
01:31:27,723 --> 01:31:30,313
I think your dad would like
a word with you, Ed.

1293
01:31:34,245 --> 01:31:35,205
Where are the others?

1294
01:31:35,492 --> 01:31:38,466
They got out yesterday.
They're back at the bar.

1295
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:54,389
All right, Dad?

1296
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:56,499
I'm all right.
How about yourself?

1297
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:01,199
I'm all right.
Could do with a drink, though.

1298
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,077
All in good time. All in good time.

1299
01:32:04,556 --> 01:32:07,338
So, are you in the clear?

1300
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:10,120
More importantly.. am I?

1301
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:12,614
It appears so.

1302
01:32:13,477 --> 01:32:18,369
Appears? You'll have to do
better than fucking appears, my friend.

1303
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:19,903
Well, everybody's dead, Dad.

1304
01:32:19,904 --> 01:32:22,206
I think that's about as clear
as it can get.

1305
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:24,796
How about that drink?

1306
01:32:24,892 --> 01:32:26,522
You know where the bar is.

1307
01:32:26,618 --> 01:32:27,769
Eh?

1308
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,647
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

1309
01:32:30,935 --> 01:32:33,716
Alan's got to sit there.
Alan!

1310
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,225
You're lucky
you're still breathing,

1311
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,527
let alone able to walk.

1312
01:32:41,102 --> 01:32:44,843
I suggest you take
full advantage of that fact.

1313
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:11,509
You took your time.
Where the hell have you been?

1314
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,619
Sit down. I'll tell you.

1315
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,116
The traffic warden identified
the neighbours' bodies.

1316
01:33:23,691 --> 01:33:26,569
Which sort of
puts us in the clear.

1317
01:33:26,665 --> 01:33:29,254
The only thing connecting us
with the case..

1318
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:31,173
..is those shotguns.

1319
01:33:31,365 --> 01:33:33,475
And Tom took care of them.

1320
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:37,696
You did take care of the shotguns,
didn't you, Tom?

1321
01:33:39,326 --> 01:33:40,861
I wanted to talk to you about that.

1322
01:33:41,053 --> 01:33:42,204
Well, talk.

1323
01:33:43,355 --> 01:33:46,328
Well, actually.. no.

1324
01:33:47,863 --> 01:33:50,165
I've got them sittin' in the car, I.. I was
gonna sell 'em back to Nick the Greek,

1325
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:52,275
but I am having a bit of a problem
gettin' hold of him.

1326
01:33:52,563 --> 01:33:53,906
You dippy bastard.

1327
01:33:54,002 --> 01:33:59,757
So.. the only thing
connecting us with the case

1328
01:34:00,045 --> 01:34:02,827
is in the back of your car,
which is parked outside!

1329
01:34:03,115 --> 01:34:06,760
They costed 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw 'em away.

1330
01:34:07,431 --> 01:34:10,309
And they're hardly likely to trace
'em back to us, are they?

1331
01:34:10,405 --> 01:34:13,282
Do you really think it's worth taking the
the risk for £700?

1332
01:34:13,474 --> 01:34:15,488
Tom, you're a dick!

1333
01:34:15,968 --> 01:34:18,366
Now you take those guns
and you throw 'em off a bridge.

1334
01:34:18,846 --> 01:34:20,860
And throw yourself off while you're at it.

1335
01:34:21,148 --> 01:34:22,874
Now.. Tom.

1336
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:29,972
- Look, all I'm..
- Now, Tom!

1337
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:37,838
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1338
01:34:37,934 --> 01:34:40,332
I'm busy. Get it yourself.

1339
01:34:56,063 --> 01:34:58,749
It seemed Hatchet
underestimated you lot.

1340
01:34:59,036 --> 01:35:01,147
And it seems to have cost him.

1341
01:35:02,106 --> 01:35:04,600
I ain't gonna make
the same mistake now, am I?

1342
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:08,053
So I've decided
to bring your bag back.

1343
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,424
I think the word you're looking
for, gentlemen, is "thank you".

1344
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:15,631
Thank you.

1345
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:19,372
Now you've presented me
with a problem.

1346
01:35:19,468 --> 01:35:21,674
I've lost my employer.

1347
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:27,141
So I've taken care
of meself and me son.

1348
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:31,362
Now if you think that's unfair,
you come and pay me a little visit.

1349
01:35:31,554 --> 01:35:33,472
But you better be
waving a white flag,

1350
01:35:33,568 --> 01:35:37,117
high and clear
so as I can see it.

1351
01:35:37,501 --> 01:35:39,707
Or it'll be the last little visit
you ever make.

1352
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:43,160
You understand?

1353
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:47,380
That's all I've come to say.

1354
01:35:48,627 --> 01:35:50,930
There is one more thing..

1355
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:54,862
It's been emotional.

1356
01:36:21,432 --> 01:36:25,365
We are now officially in the
money-lending business, all right, son?

1357
01:36:26,132 --> 01:36:27,571
Put your seatbelt on.

1358
01:36:28,243 --> 01:36:30,065
We're out of here.

1359
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:40,329
It's empty.

1360
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:49,967
What's his number?

1361
01:37:55,818 --> 01:37:58,888
Don't! Don't! You'll jam the line!
I'll call him!

1362
01:38:05,794 --> 01:38:07,232
My fucking batteries!

1363
01:38:07,233 --> 01:38:10,782
- No, you muppet!
- Give me the phone!
Give me the fucking phone!

1364
01:38:10,974 --> 01:38:13,180
- I'll dial it!
- Tell me the number!

1365
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:27,472
- Now give me your phone!
- You'll break it!

1366
01:38:30,925 --> 01:38:33,514
- You give me the phone!
