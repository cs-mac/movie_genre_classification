1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,222
This film is based on a true story

2
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:40,841
Come on, this way!

3
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:42,941
Come get me! Come on!

4
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:49,353
Can I play, too?

5
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:51,618
Okay, but you're 'it'.

6
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,319
Give him the blindfold.

7
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,152
Come on, over here!

8
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,163
Chicken!

9
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:07,301
Watch out!
Get out of the way!

10
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:10,035
- Watch out!
- Come on, Mirco!

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,969
Let me see.

12
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,037
Try and catch me!

13
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,981
Gotcha!

14
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:39,796
TUSCANY, SUMMER 1970

15
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,127
Gaetano! Here.

16
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,202
The leftover papers.
I'll give the money to Silvana.

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,168
Thanks, Achille. See you tomorrow.

18
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,171
- Let's go.
- Dad, listen.

19
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:54,303
If people can come in here
and read the paper for free,

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,511
...why should they buy one?
- It's more convenient.

21
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:02,080
At home, you can read it when you want.
On the sofa, at lunch.

22
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:07,088
Why don't we buy a television?
It's like the newspaper.

23
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,056
You take the cinema home
and watch movies when you want.

24
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,990
- Who's going to put up the money?
- You! With your truck.

25
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,062
Sure! Just like that!

26
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,256
Please! Everybody's got one.

27
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:21,097
All right, we'll put some money aside
and get one, too.

28
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,929
Can we play the dream game?

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,075
<i>This is Vittorio Bonini</i>
<i>live from the Quirinal Hill, </i>

30
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:29,870
<i>where the President of the Republic</i>
<i>Giuseppe Saragat, </i>

31
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,378
<i>is meeting with Emilio Colombo</i>
<i>to charge him with forming... </i>

32
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,081
Now you broke it, be careful!

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,221
- It's always the same story.
- I'll glue it later.

34
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,186
Just like your toy train.

35
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,791
It's been a year,
and there are still pieces all over.

36
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,255
Let him do it!

37
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,091
That way, he'll learn
how things are made.

38
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:55,457
Here, Mirco.
Screws, screwdriver...

39
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,201
Fix the pot for your mom.

40
00:02:58,404 --> 00:02:59,871
It's about time.

41
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,267
Dad, it's late.

42
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,270
For what?

43
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,904
You said you'd take me.

44
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:10,845
I don't want to sit in the last row.

45
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,278
All right.

46
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,746
Come on! Hurry up!

47
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:34,270
Dad!

48
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,496
He took a shot at the Mexican.

49
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:56,914
- Who's first?
- You start!

50
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:58,284
Go on!

51
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:03,927
No! On the first shot!

52
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,429
I'll go glue it
I'll be right back.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,323
Hurry, okay?

54
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:10,798
- Who starts?
- I do...

55
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:00,135
Cool!

56
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,440
Mirco!

57
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:46,380
RED LIKE THE SKY

58
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:58,228
All done! Good boy, Mirco,
we're all done.

59
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,465
Go wait in there
while I talk with your dad.

60
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,538
We'll be through in a minute.

61
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:14,178
Take your jacket and glasses.
Put them on!

62
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,015
Wait over there.

63
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:22,147
Mr. Balleri, what can I tell you?

64
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,914
As I understand it,
Mirco was lucky.

65
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:30,459
If he'd been shot full in the face,
he wouldn't be alive.

66
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,632
Yeah, at the hospital in Pisa
they couldn't believe it.

67
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,493
I had you come in because...

68
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,270
I can't send Mirco
back to school.

69
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:47,075
Why not? He hasn't got
an infectious disease.

70
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:50,406
It was only an accident.
He's better now, he's doing fine.

71
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:54,144
Your son can only see
shadows, now.

72
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,682
Didn't they tell you, at Pisa...

73
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,715
He'll improve... with treatment...

74
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,186
I realize he'll have to catch up.

75
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:08,295
But he's always been a good student.

76
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,431
If you won't take him,
where will I send him?

77
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,965
Mr. Balleri,
I know this isn't easy for you.

78
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,795
It's not up to us,
it's the law.

79
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,937
He can't attend a regular school,
it's against the law.

80
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,734
He needs to go to a school
for children like himself.

81
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,673
We'll have to find
an appropriate institution,

82
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,211
and I can suggest
the one I consider the best.

83
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,014
- Cassoni Institute.
- Where exactly is it?

84
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,351
- In Genoa.
- In Genoa?

85
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,849
- That's so far away.
- It's a boarding school.

86
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,322
It's run by a religious order.
You can visit him every month.

87
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,326
But Mirco's only ten.

88
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,698
He needs me, he needs his mom,
more than when he was a baby.

89
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,336
How can we send him off to school
in Genoa, where he doesn't know...

90
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,771
It's not up to us. It's the law.

91
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,973
Pass it to me!
Over here!

92
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,850
- Mirco, come play with us!
- No, I don't want to.

93
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,219
I'm tired.

94
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,849
Okay. Come on, keep going!

95
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,119
Come on, hurry!

96
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,163
This way.

97
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:08,770
The director is waiting.

98
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:13,336
You've made the right choice.

99
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:17,071
He'll learn a trade
suited to his abilities.

100
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,181
He can be a weaver,
or a switchboard operator.

101
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:25,982
Yes. The important thing is,
now he can finish grade school.

102
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,385
As far as figuring out
what he wants to do.

103
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,520
Well... there's time.

104
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:35,488
The problem is not what he wants
to do, but what he's able to do.

105
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:39,162
I'm convinced that
if he gets treatment...

106
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,301
If Mirco can get better, he will.

107
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:47,399
The most important thing is
for you to accept what has happened.

108
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:50,333
Otherwise, you can't help him.

109
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,841
All right, I think we're finished.

110
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,311
Mirco doesn't like vegetables.

111
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,879
You have to coax him to eat them.

112
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,389
And he likes a light on,
on his night table,

113
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:10,026
because he's afraid of the dark.

114
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,018
Even now.

115
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:16,097
A night light won't bother
the other children,

116
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,132
will it?

117
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,466
Here you go, here's your place.

118
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,069
Attention!

119
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,130
Starting today,
we have a new boy.

120
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:42,033
His name is Mirco Balleri.

121
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:46,479
I'm sure you'll make him
feel welcome right away.

122
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:49,206
And we'll give Mirco
his own little bag.

123
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,046
It's empty now, but every time
he does a good deed,

124
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,846
we'll add a kernel of corn.

125
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,923
When it's full,
you'll get a special prize.

126
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:09,399
We thank Thee, O Lord...

127
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,403
Hi, I'm Felice.

128
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,133
That's a name?

129
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:23,136
You kidding?
Yeah, that's my name: Felice!

130
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,116
Where are you from?

131
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,289
Pontedera, near Pisa.

132
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:37,553
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

133
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,367
What are you doing?

134
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:53,302
Nothing. I just want to know
what you look like.

135
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,704
Leave me alone.

136
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,103
Hey, up Juventus!

137
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:56,197
- Who's down there?
- It's Mirco. Who're you?

138
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,192
Hi, Mirco! It's Felice!

139
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,097
Where are you?

140
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,771
Up in the tree, come on up!

141
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,469
The gardener's ladder
is down there.

142
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:22,349
- What are you doing up here?
- Relaxing.

143
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:27,249
And hiding from the meanest
of the mean kids. His name's Valerio.

144
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,058
- How come?
- Because he's a bully.

145
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,656
Why don't you fight back?

146
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,399
How? The whole class
does whatever he says.

147
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,503
If they catch me, they'll beat me up!

148
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,035
Listen...
what do kids do here?

149
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:47,268
Nothing special...
eat, study, sleep.

150
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,111
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot!

151
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,808
We get to go on a trip once a year,
and visit a sanctuary.

152
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,122
Hey, Mirco... can you see?

153
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,622
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

154
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:09,786
- How long have you been like this?
- Since I was born.

155
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,467
- What are colours like?
- They're great!

156
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,696
What's your favourite?

157
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,365
Blue.

158
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:23,601
- What's it like?
- Blue is like riding a bike...

159
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:26,678
when the wind hits you in the face.

160
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:30,045
Or... like the sea.

161
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,746
And brown... feel this.

162
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,749
It's like the bark on this tree.
Feel how rough it is?

163
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,590
It's really rough!

164
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,191
- And red?
- Red...

165
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,853
is like fire.

166
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:46,862
Like the sky at sunset.

167
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:50,162
Listen to them! Talking about colours,
like a couple of girls!

168
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:53,097
What's pink like?
What's red like?

169
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:57,504
- Are you guys in love?
- Come down, or I'll take the ladder.

170
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,199
- Just ignore them!
- No, let's get down!

171
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:02,541
Move it!

172
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,104
Hurry up, fatso!

173
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:06,807
Stupid!

174
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:09,643
Out of the way!

175
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,816
- Let's make them eat a snail.
- Leave me alone!

176
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,854
Shut up, or I'll hit you!

177
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,619
I told you he'd beat you up!

178
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,223
Show him who's boss!

179
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,231
Stop that! What's going on!

180
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,193
Get up! Well?

181
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,733
- What happened?
- He started it.

182
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,065
- That's not true!
- Off to a good start!

183
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,641
You should both be ashamed!
Shake hands and make up!

184
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:40,505
I said to make up!

185
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,205
Don't ever let me see you
doing this again!

186
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,074
- I'll make you pay for this!
- Fuck you!

187
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:50,912
We don't use bad words here.
I'm only going to say it once!

188
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:54,090
Now, line up!
Recreation is over!

189
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,160
Everybody inside! Line up!
You, too!

190
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,336
Balleri...

191
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,971
go to your room!

192
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:42,114
<i>He realized there wasn't enough</i>
<i>for everyone. </i>

193
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:46,790
<i>He took the loaves and fishes and</i>
<i>looking up at heaven, blessed them. </i>

194
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,556
<i>The bread, He gave His disciples. </i>

195
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,733
<i>His disciples gave it to the crowd, </i>
<i>and everyone ate... </i>

196
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:57,752
Cool!

197
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:16,469
Make sure they're all tucked in.

198
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:21,212
All right...
where did we leave off yesterday...

199
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,542
Deep in hell,

200
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:28,209
the devils curse,
and howl and shriek.

201
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,856
The damned suffer awful punishments
for the sins they have committed..."

202
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,058
Fuck you!

203
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,570
- Come in!
- Good morning, everyone!

204
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,440
On your feet, boys!

205
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,334
This is Mirco Balleri.

206
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,741
He arrived yesterday. He's from Pisa.
He was in fourth grade there.

207
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:01,741
He missed the first few months
and he's very far behind.

208
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,784
The director said to put him
in the first row, and help him along.

209
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:07,854
All right.

210
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,123
His name's Mirco?

211
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:11,718
I'm right here.

212
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:14,689
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No problem.

213
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,697
Boys, make room for Mirco.

214
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:19,889
Valerio, Davide, Andrea, Eugenio.

215
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,598
Move back one row, one back.

216
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:26,097
One desk back.

217
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:28,401
Slowly.

218
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,738
Feel the chair, here.

219
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:35,168
All right... let's get back
to our lesson.

220
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:38,344
We were talking about geography.

221
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,549
Let's pick up where we left off.

222
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:44,744
<i>The Earth is a sphere, suspended</i>
<i>in space, with a pole at each end. </i>

223
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:48,686
<i>It rotates around itself, </i>
<i>which creates day and night. </i>

224
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,191
<i>It's revolution around... </i>

225
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,260
Felice, pay attention!

226
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:57,188
<i>... creates the four seasons. </i>
<i>Every season lasts three months. </i>

227
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,493
All right. Now, write it down.

228
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:04,697
The Earth is a sphere
suspended in space

229
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,205
with a pole at each end.

230
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,506
Now...

231
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,817
This is the tablet, feel it?
This is the punch.

232
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,819
Now... feel these spaces?

233
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,684
All right... this is how you write.

234
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,359
You make a hole for each letter.

235
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:31,358
For example, 'A' is a hole
on the upper right.

236
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:32,964
Now you try.

237
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,357
Not like that!

238
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,494
What happened?

239
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,439
Nothing happened.

240
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,473
A tablet fell on the floor.
Let's get back to work.

241
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,379
We'll just pick it up
and put it back where it belongs.

242
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,806
Anyway,
I put some things on your desks.

243
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:55,508
Pine cones and branches,
some chestnuts.

244
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,913
Dried fruit.

245
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:01,752
Touch them.
Feel what pine needles are like,

246
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,455
how strange they are...

247
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:07,891
These needles have to survive
the winter, the snow...

248
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:11,332
pass them around.

249
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:16,335
This afternoon, I want you
to write an essay on the seasons.

250
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,473
Describe what happens

251
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,006
when we pass
from one season to another.

252
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:26,541
What things change, in the country,
in the city, in human life.

253
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,679
So, Mirco.

254
00:23:35,723 --> 00:23:39,818
Aren't you interested in doing
what your classmates are doing?

255
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,688
I don't need to.
I can see.

256
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,762
I can see, too.
It's not enough.

257
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,624
When you see a flower,
don't you want to smell it?

258
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:54,539
Or when it snows,
don't you want to walk in it?

259
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:58,571
To touch it, watch it melt
in your hands?

260
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:02,877
I'll tell you a secret,

261
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:06,980
something I noticed
watching musicians play.

262
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:10,447
They close their eyes.
You know why?

263
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,054
To feel the music
more intensely.

264
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:18,486
Because the music transforms,
the notes gets bigger, more intense.

265
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:22,593
It's as if music was
a physical sensation.

266
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,426
You have five senses, Mirco.

267
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,331
Why use only one of them?

268
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,964
Did you hear that?

269
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:41,007
<i>RAI Italian Radio and Television</i>
<i>presents</i>

270
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:43,315
<i>"The Adventures of Moby Dick"</i>

271
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:46,680
<i>a program based on the book</i>
<i>by Herman Melville. </i>

272
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,412
<i>Adaptation by Armando Nicoloci. </i>

<i>Episode Three. </i>

275
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,963
<i>One morning, Captain Ahab</i>

276
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,463
<i>ordered the whole crew</i>
<i>to assemble on the bridge. </i>

277
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,929
<i>Some of you have already heard</i>
<i>of the white whale. </i>

278
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,931
<i>Now, take a good look at this</i>
<i>Spanish doubloon. </i>

279
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,371
<i>It's worth 16 dollars. </i>

280
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:16,979
<i>Mr. Tambar! </i>
<i>Give me that hammer. </i>

281
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:20,040
<i>Now pay close attention. </i>

282
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:24,111
<i>The first one of you to show me</i>
<i>a whale with a white head</i>

283
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,613
<i>and three holes in its tail</i>

284
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:30,384
<i>will have this ounce of gold. </i>

285
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:32,652
Francesca, what are you doing?

286
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:35,123
Nothing, just looking out.

287
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,728
Leave them alone.
Go do your homework.

288
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:40,868
And turn that off!

289
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,711
- What do you want, dimwit!
- What are you doing, you dope?

290
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:07,286
- That's my business.
- Why don't you eat that cookie?

291
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:10,958
It's a sacrifice, so the sister
will give me a kernel of corn.

292
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,297
Here, take this!

293
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,673
- What is it?
- A candy.

294
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,480
Give that to the sister, too,
and you'll get another kernel.

295
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:37,009
- Can you really see?
- Yeah.

296
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:41,184
- How much.
- A bit.

297
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:45,558
Go to the end of the wall,
go down the stairs,

298
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:48,695
go to the rusty door
and wait for me.

299
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,174
Wait, I'm coming.

300
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,614
This way.

301
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:15,681
In here.

302
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:19,323
- What is this place?
- I think it's...

303
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:23,221
the place where the nuns throw
the stuff they don't need anymore.

304
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:26,488
- Why'd you bring me here?
- To show you my bicycle.

305
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:29,325
Come on, I'll show it to you.

306
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,632
Here it is!

307
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:35,338
But I can't use it.
It's broken.

308
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,598
My mom told me
that when I go to middle school

309
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:42,573
she'll get me a bigger one.

310
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:49,084
I was thinking, maybe the candy
is big enough for the sacrifice.

311
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,187
If you give her the cookie, too,
maybe...

312
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:55,288
she'll only give you one kernel.

313
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,618
Nothing's wrong with this.
The chain just fell off.

314
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:02,391
- Will you help me turn it over?
- Sure.

315
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:14,800
That was a neat story I heard before.
Do you have a television?

316
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,802
No, it's a radio.

317
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:19,202
Want to know the rest of the story?

318
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:21,470
Let me finish this.

319
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,348
All set, let's go for a ride.

320
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,618
Are you crazy?
You'll get in big trouble.

321
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:40,127
One time,
this kid wet the bed

322
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:43,629
and they made him sleep
in the same sheets for 10 days.

323
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:47,201
- Who told you that?
- My mom. It really stank!

324
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:50,237
Another time,
a kid spit in church.

325
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,136
They made him stand in there
and pray all night.

326
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:58,245
The nuns don't scare me.
Come on, let's go for a ride.

327
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,541
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, what are you waiting for?

328
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,511
He's nuts!

329
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:06,177
What're you doing, aren't you coming?

330
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,618
What was that for?

331
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:12,122
- To keep us from getting caught.
- Don't be silly!

332
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:17,597
There's a hole in the fence here.
But nobody knows.

333
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,289
- A secret passage!
- Yeah.

334
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,126
This place is cool!

335
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:26,703
- There's lots of stuff, isn't there?
- Yeah.

336
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,841
- You know there's a cinema nearby?
- Really?

337
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:34,304
My mom never takes me.
She says it's a waste of money.

338
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,708
Hop on, and we'll go.

339
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,815
- You sure?
- Yeah!

340
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:42,242
All right, but go slow.

341
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,923
Come on, hop on the seat.

342
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,555
- Want to go to the cinema?
- Yeah, but...

343
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,464
All right!

344
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:02,866
But the minute something goes wrong
I'm steering.

345
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,207
Slow, okay? Go slow.

346
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,434
- Cinema, here I come!
- Slow down!

347
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,811
Slow down! Stairs!

348
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,875
It's downhill, go slow!

349
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:19,515
- How long is it?
- Really long!

350
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:22,383
Careful! Help!

351
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:27,558
Watch out for the people!
Right! No, left!

352
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:36,398
- Why do you live at the school?
- My mom's the caretaker.

353
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:40,197
She does the cleaning.
The train!

354
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,708
She doesn't want me to play with you.

355
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,404
- Why not?
- Because you're boys, and blind.

356
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,108
The nuns told her if they see me
playing with you kids

357
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,314
they'll fire her.

358
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,423
But you know something?
I'm not scared of the nuns.

359
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,027
I'm scared of the director.

360
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:09,358
That man with the dark glasses.
He looks like a bat, all in black.

361
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,895
He looks like a monster.

362
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,899
Are you nuts?
He's just a poor old blind guy.

363
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,606
It's really steep!

364
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:19,600
Help! Slow down!

365
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,079
- Are you hurt?
- No. Are you?

366
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:36,549
A little.

367
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,619
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

368
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:43,053
Oh, it's no big deal.

369
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:46,959
The cinema's right here.

370
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,497
What's the film?

371
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:55,473
The Clan of the Two Borsalini

372
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,700
I've already seen it.
It's really funny!

373
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:04,507
Franco is 35 years old
and he's still in first grade.

374
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,683
- You know why?
- Why?

375
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:11,343
He found a hole in the wall
that goes into a jewelry store

376
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:14,818
and he convinces the teacher
to break in with him.

377
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:17,789
But they get arrested.

378
00:32:17,994 --> 00:32:20,758
It says, "Coming Soon",
maybe we can come see it.

379
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:23,693
Yeah, I'll take you.
Let's go.

380
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:35,833
- What's that sound?
- I don't know.

381
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,883
The street's full of people!

382
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,423
So many people!

383
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,929
It's a demonstration.

384
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,965
Hey kids, be careful!

385
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,927
- Who are you with?
- We're by ourselves.

386
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:08,933
Ettore!

387
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:16,744
There are some kids here.
I think one of them's blind.

388
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:18,938
They're right in front of us.

389
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:21,011
Who are you?

390
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:25,616
I'm the daughter of the caretaker
at Cassoni.

391
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,317
But, who are you?

392
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,924
My name's Ettore. What's yours?

393
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:33,518
Mirco.

394
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,063
- How come you two are here?
- We're playing hooky.

395
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:41,860
Good for you.
Smart kids!

396
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,833
You could tell?

397
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,836
Let's get you out of this mess.
Come with me.

398
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,770
- Where?
- Back where you came from.

399
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,774
- Want me to come, too?
- No, don't bother. I'm fine.

400
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:53,841
You coming?

401
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,106
This way.

402
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:57,450
Let me turn the bike.

403
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,782
Are you really blind?

404
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:06,249
No, I just pretend
when I'm crossing the street.

405
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,427
Didn't your parents
send you to the Institute?

406
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:14,065
How do you think I know the way?
I was there for 10 years.

407
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,734
- And you never ran away?
- Nope.

408
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:21,265
I grew up, came of age
and then I left.

409
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,804
So much for your director!

410
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,109
What do you do now?

411
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:30,178
I do what I want.
I study at the University

412
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,076
and I'm a switchboard operator
at the blast furnace.

413
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,847
Aren't you scared? My mom says
there's a terrible fire inside

414
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,653
that burns all day long.

415
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:43,451
I don't have to see it, like you.
I can imagine it the way I want.

416
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,353
What's it like?

417
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:48,785
What's it like...

418
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:53,259
It's very high, and wide,
and colourful.

419
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,271
Like a bakery that only makes
pastries for greedy children.

420
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:01,273
You've got quite an imagination!

421
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:04,635
Tell me where we are now.

422
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,413
Via del Pastorino.

423
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:13,410
Okay. You have to turn right,
go up the hill, then

424
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,552
go straight ahead and you're home.

425
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,121
Okay. Bye, Ettore!

426
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:24,361
Next time you run away,
come and see me!

427
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:27,087
- Where?
- At the blast furnace.

428
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,660
Okay! See you later!

429
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:38,499
- Ettore's nice, isn't he?
- Yeah, he is.

430
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:42,872
He sounds just like that actor
I always hear on the radio.

431
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:46,374
By the way, you know I'm going to
make a recording, too?

432
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:50,144
- About what?
- I can't tell you, it's a surprise.

433
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,217
- But I'll let you hear it.
- Swear.

434
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:55,413
- OK, I swear!
- Careful with the bike!

435
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:03,823
MIRCO

436
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,627
Where are you?

437
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:16,476
Shut up, you'll scare away
the birds!

438
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:20,374
The birds?
Have you gone crazy?

439
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,672
Listen, you have to help me.

440
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:24,372
Do what?

441
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,744
I want to do research on the seasons.

442
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,149
But with the tape recorder,
and there's only one reel.

443
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,653
- So?
- We have to find some others.

444
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,486
- Where will we get them?
- In the teachers' room.

445
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,430
The "talking books".

446
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,225
But we can't do that...

447
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,926
And besides, I like
some of the stories.

448
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:51,204
Then we'll take the Gospel tapes.
Nobody listens to those.

449
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,276
You're definitely going to
get me in trouble!

450
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,914
- Felice!
- What?

451
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:08,381
What do we do now?

452
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:12,886
They're leaving, I can tell.
Come on, let's go.

453
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,818
Shut up!

454
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:28,197
Come on, hurry up!

455
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:32,701
Wait a minute.

456
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,759
- Where are you?
- Right here.

457
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,299
Felice!
Turn it higher!

458
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,698
Turn it off!
I'm getting wet!

459
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,431
Turn it off!

460
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,423
Research?
What research?

461
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:06,122
- About jobs.
- So?

462
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,161
He said to start with yours.

463
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:12,391
If Don Giulio says so,
but be careful not to get hurt.

464
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:15,730
And don't get in the way,
because we've got work to do.

465
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,936
Take a look around.

466
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,943
Great!

467
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,551
Listen to this.

468
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,475
- Did you hear that?
- What's it supposed to be?

469
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,974
The wind, right?

470
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,978
You should've told me before!

471
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:06,144
I know how to do the wind,
I hear it all the time!

472
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,419
Hear that?

473
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,987
What about bees?

474
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:25,689
We can't do bees,
we'd need a real hive.

475
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:30,738
I got it!
We'll do them with our lips.

476
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,403
Right! And I can do bumble-bees.

477
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:34,768
Listen...

478
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,137
Wait, stop.

479
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:46,797
This story is dedicated to you.

480
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:51,808
The title is: "The rain is over,
here comes the sun."

481
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:46,139
Was this your research
on the seasons, Balleri?

482
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,342
Good.

483
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,411
Explain to us, Mirco.

484
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:56,988
What do all these sounds
and noises mean to you?

485
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,986
It's nature, her voice.

486
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:02,120
Ah, of course!

487
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:06,199
Why were you the only one who knew?

488
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:10,029
And who authorized you

489
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:12,637
to take the school tape recorder

490
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:16,973
and ruin tapes that belong
to everyone, just for fun?

491
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:23,343
Your teacher gave you an assignment.
Why didn't you do it,

492
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:25,540
as he asked?

493
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:31,112
Don Giulio...

494
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:33,991
Stand up!

495
00:44:36,995 --> 00:44:39,623
Keep me informed
of his behavior

496
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:44,034
Boy, you sure are smart,
wise guy.

497
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:48,399
Please do it again
so they'll send you back home.

498
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:50,972
I liked it, though.

499
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:54,375
Because you're a retard,
like him.

500
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,545
Sit down, boys.

501
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,432
What are you doing?

502
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:00,535
It doesn't work.

503
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:04,336
The bulb is burned out.

504
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,085
Shall I leave you this?
In case you get hungry later?

505
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:31,497
You can't go on like this,
you need to eat.

506
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,092
Remember that
God loves you.

507
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:39,635
If He loved me, He wouldn't have
let me play with that rifle.

508
00:46:57,623 --> 00:47:01,820
Let's bring him home.
He needs his mother and father.

509
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:05,821
We'll get a private teacher.

510
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:11,431
Oh, yes, how will you pay him?

511
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:18,436
- How will you pay him?
- Teresa!

512
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:40,224
Oh, Holy Mother!
Where can he have gone?

513
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,657
I have something for him...

514
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:48,099
Maybe I'll just leave him a note.

515
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:50,734
Yes... all right.

516
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:52,627
Here we go.

517
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:55,398
Dear Mirco, this is your teacher.

518
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,802
I'm writing in the name
of your classmates, too.

519
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:01,271
We all miss you very much.

520
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,779
And about your research
on nature...

521
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,078
it really wasn't that bad.

522
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,650
Even if it was a bit strange.

523
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:16,223
Maybe we judged it
a bit too hastily.

524
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,321
So, your teacher
brought you something

525
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,525
that might come in handy.

526
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:26,826
But don't show it to anyone.
It's our secret.

527
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:32,205
But Mirco hasn't learned Braille.
He doesn't want to learn it.

528
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:36,168
So he won't find this.

529
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:40,308
I guess I'll take it away with me.

530
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:44,480
- Shall I take it away?
- No.

531
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:50,515
But I'd really like Mirco
to learn Braille.

532
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:55,361
So he can read my messages.

533
00:48:55,562 --> 00:48:58,258
- Will he learn Braille?
- Yes.

534
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:00,494
Good.

535
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:07,838
It sure is cold in here!

536
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:11,643
I wonder how anyone
can lie on the floor.

537
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:44,695
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

538
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:51,210
You're still my little boy.

539
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:53,609
Understand?

540
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:04,615
- Listen, mom?
- Yes?

541
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:09,985
- Do the kids at home remember me?
- Of course they do.

542
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:14,466
They stop us in the street.

543
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:17,926
They ask your dad and me:
"When is Mirco coming back?"

544
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:22,471
And we tell them you're coming
for summer vacation.

545
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:27,310
I don't know
if I want to see them again.

546
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:32,244
I want to be with you
and Dad the whole time.

547
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:03,173
Francesca, now we can record
all the sounds we can think of.

548
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:07,480
Then we'll make a really neat story.
Do you know a story?

549
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:10,045
Well...

550
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,144
OK, go.

551
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:16,220
Once upon a time there was a Princess
who had 15 brothers.

552
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:19,286
One day, their father the King died.

553
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,257
The Queen called in the children
and told them:

554
00:51:23,028 --> 00:51:27,021
I don't want you, you're not mine.
Go away and never come back!

555
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,658
Wait a second.

556
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:32,102
All right...

557
00:51:36,508 --> 00:51:37,600
Go!

558
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:44,670
The children began walking
through a big forest.

559
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:48,276
They walked... and walked...

560
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:51,477
It seemed like the forest
was endless.

561
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:15,200
Suddenly, night fell.

562
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:22,172
The children were cold and hungry,

563
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:25,647
but worst of all,
there were mysterious,

564
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:28,078
scary sounds in the darkness.

565
00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:35,115
At last,
they came to a castle.

566
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:39,094
It was very big and gloomy.

567
00:52:39,298 --> 00:52:42,756
The doors opened
and a huge drawbridge came down.

568
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,674
F, G, A.
Do you understand?

569
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,168
Yes.

570
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:54,503
- Who wants to go first?
- I do.

571
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:57,509
Mirco, do you want to try?
Come on, hurry up.

572
00:52:57,714 --> 00:53:00,376
One at a time.
You'll all take turns.

573
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:03,415
Sit here. Careful.

574
00:53:07,256 --> 00:53:09,724
What are you doing?
Stop it.

575
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:13,619
Quiet! Don't you understand?
That's contemporary music.

576
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,390
Go sit down.

577
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:19,328
- I can play like that, too.
- Who's next?

578
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:21,024
Me!

579
00:53:40,853 --> 00:53:43,151
But the Princess was sad,

580
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:44,687
because the Dragon

581
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,289
had imprisoned her in a tower.

582
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:48,755
She wept every day, saying:

583
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,556
"Brothers, help me!
Come and save me!

584
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,557
I miss you so much!"

585
00:53:56,468 --> 00:53:59,095
- No. That's no good.
- Why not?

586
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:02,503
You can tell it's the same voice.

587
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:05,569
You can't be the Princess
and the Narrator, too.

588
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:09,473
It would be better
if we had more voices, and music.

589
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,982
That's impossible. It's too hard.
We'll never be able to do it.

590
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,478
All right, children.

591
00:54:20,022 --> 00:54:23,549
Today we begin rehearsals
for the annual school play

592
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,324
we perform for your parents.

593
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:28,860
You children won't all
get a poem to learn

594
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:30,928
because there are too many of you.

595
00:54:31,365 --> 00:54:34,926
The theme this year
is the Marian month.

596
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:39,837
The first names I've chosen
are: Barcellona, Barbieri...

597
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,271
Costa, Lunardi, Farina

598
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:45,068
and Giordano.

599
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:49,104
The boys I've called
should come up to the stage now...

600
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:53,979
- Why didn't he call us?
- Good thing. No rehearsals!

601
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,847
But we won't be in the show.

602
00:54:57,056 --> 00:54:59,149
Then we'll do our own show.

603
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,487
But our parents won't get to see it.

604
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:06,863
But ours will be better!
We'll use the stuff we like.

605
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:09,590
Have you two finished
chatting back there?

606
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:12,366
Now twist! Faster, go!

607
00:55:13,337 --> 00:55:14,634
Come on!

608
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:19,233
- When do we start?
- Today. In the storeroom.

609
00:55:22,345 --> 00:55:25,678
- What are you doing?
- A really neat show!

610
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:29,415
With a lot of battles
where everybody kills each other.

611
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,581
- Can I be in it, too?
- I don't know.

612
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,925
We'll see.
It depends on what you can do.

613
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,094
I can do anything!

614
00:55:40,562 --> 00:55:43,121
Can I be in it, too?

615
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:46,299
Arms up, quickly.
Clap your hands.

616
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,297
One, two...

617
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:52,305
Here we are.

618
00:55:57,343 --> 00:56:00,141
- It's so dusty in here!
- Hi!

619
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,006
- Who's that?
- A friend of mine, Francesca.

620
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:06,045
- What?
- No!

621
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:08,845
The caretaker's daughter!
You must be nuts.

622
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:11,113
- She's bad luck!
- What do you mean?

623
00:56:11,323 --> 00:56:14,086
You see?
I told you so.

624
00:56:14,592 --> 00:56:18,119
- She made up the story.
- All right.

625
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:22,490
What do I say?
What do I do?

626
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,029
You're the Prince.
She's the Princess, your sister.

627
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:28,466
- What does the Prince do?
- I'll explain later.

628
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:33,502
- What do we do?
- I want to be a Prince, too!

629
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:37,607
- Will there be battles?
- Yes, but later on.

630
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,608
- When?
- Let's get started.

631
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:43,540
You have to do the stepmother.

632
00:56:44,086 --> 00:56:46,553
What?
Are you crazy?

633
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,981
I don't want to do the stepmother.
She's a woman.

634
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:54,287
- It's only two lines!
- Have Francesca do them.

635
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:57,261
She's already doing the Princess.

636
00:57:17,115 --> 00:57:20,278
So, you two are
running around again, huh?

637
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:24,250
- What are you doing here?
- We're recording.

638
00:57:24,456 --> 00:57:27,117
We need some scary sounds.

639
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,884
Then you came to the right place.

640
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:34,154
Osvaldo, come with me.
Let's show these kids the steel mill.

641
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,254
A sea of lava surrounded by towers,

642
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:03,923
and Elisa, a prisoner,
wept every day.

643
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,649
Where are you, dear brothers,
I miss you so much.

644
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:10,120
Her brothers
were playing happily.

645
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:16,527
But one day, all of a sudden,
they remembered their sister.

646
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:20,171
- It's been so long since we saw her.
- Where can she be?

647
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:24,069
But every time they asked the Dragon,
he became so big and horrible

648
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:27,478
that they ran away, terrified.

649
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,248
- Fantastic!
- It turned out good, didn't it?

650
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:35,419
But where did you find the Dragon?

651
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,587
Oh, come on! It's not a real dragon.
You dope!

652
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,484
But when it roared, I thought it was.

653
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:45,252
You thought it was!
It's all fake, it's not real!

654
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:47,692
- I wasn't scared a bit.
- I was!

655
00:58:48,265 --> 00:58:50,096
Do you have a part for me, too?

656
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,200
It's a long fairytale,
it's got lots of other characters.

657
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:56,132
What other characters!

658
00:58:56,338 --> 00:58:58,169
You'll break it!

659
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:00,171
And it's not stupid!

660
00:59:00,376 --> 00:59:04,402
If you two do this
I'm telling the nuns.

661
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:07,206
No, don't do it!

662
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:09,280
You're not supposed to do this.

663
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:11,213
- Who said?
- The director.

664
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:13,409
- The nuns!
- Run!

665
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,346
Run!

666
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:18,352
Quiet! Time to go to sleep!

667
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,685
Go on!

668
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:23,291
- We still have to do the battle.
- Great!

669
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:25,123
Great nothing, you idiot!

670
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:27,322
Are you a big deal because
your dad is rich?

671
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,194
Leave him alone.

672
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:43,303
- Is that you?
- We all came to do the fairytale.

673
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,478
I brought everybody, even Valerio.

674
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:51,246
I didn't say anything to the nuns
this time, but...

675
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,722
you better give me a good part.

676
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,822
These are the crickets.

677
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:12,733
These are the children's footsteps
when they run from the Dragon.

678
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,542
How did you do that?

679
01:00:19,714 --> 01:00:21,443
Listen...

680
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,685
Cool! Can I touch them?

681
01:00:26,886 --> 01:00:28,717
- Fantastic!
- Neat, aren't they?

682
01:00:31,524 --> 01:00:32,786
Great!

683
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,050
How did you get the idea?

684
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,460
It's how they do it in films.

685
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:41,792
How many times
have you been to the cinema?

686
01:00:41,867 --> 01:00:44,665
I don't know, maybe 50 times.

687
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,897
- I'd like to go to the cinema, too.
- But you don't understand anything.

688
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,008
So says Archimedes Pythagoras.

689
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,145
- What would we do there?
- Anybody can go to the cinema.

690
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:57,503
Even if they can't see.

691
01:00:57,881 --> 01:01:02,113
You understand the film anyway
because there are sounds and words.

692
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:05,353
By the way, there's one
right out front.

693
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:09,490
- I saw it when we ran away.
- Cool!

694
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:11,588
How did you do that?

695
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,451
You're crazy!

696
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:16,063
Well, do you want to go?

697
01:01:17,265 --> 01:01:19,995
- How old is your sister?
- Seventeen.

698
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:24,971
- Has she got tits?
- She's got melons this big!

699
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:27,367
- I don't believe it!
- It's true!

700
01:01:27,574 --> 01:01:31,635
You better believe it!
I bet Felice touched them too much!

701
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:36,277
I would never dare touch
my sister's tits!

702
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:39,550
- What's your sister's name?
- Simona.

703
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,057
Come on, let's go!

704
01:02:08,546 --> 01:02:10,103
Cool! Come on!

705
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:15,112
Let's go, come on!

706
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:19,677
Giulio, please.

707
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:24,654
Did you hear?
Concettina said, "Don Giulio"!

708
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:28,223
Oh, come on!

709
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:32,388
- She said, "No, Giulio!"
- No, "Don Giulio."

710
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,694
Concettina is in love
with Don Giulio.

711
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:39,373
Francesca, where are you?

712
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:43,266
I'm here.

713
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:48,345
- Is she coming?
- Yeah. Here she is.

714
01:02:48,715 --> 01:02:50,182
Let's go.

715
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:00,618
Under the fence.
Be careful.

716
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,956
- I'm so scared!
- Of what?

717
01:03:04,162 --> 01:03:06,756
- Of the dark!
- Right, of the dark...

718
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,894
Oh, cool!

719
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,159
Shut up or you'll wake the nuns.

720
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:15,099
Do you understand,
you'll wake the nuns?

721
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,205
Come on, get in line.

722
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:20,240
Valerio, don't be a jerk tonight.

723
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:22,071
Right!

724
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,650
- Are we there yet?
- It's here in front.

725
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:32,343
- Is it big?
- It must be huge, let's go!

726
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:36,650
- We have to buy tickets.
- Who's got some money?

727
01:03:40,328 --> 01:03:43,092
- Are you there?
- Why do I have to pay for everybody?

728
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:45,356
Cough it up, cheapskate!

729
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:48,091
I'll pay this time,

730
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:49,894
but next time you're on your own.

731
01:03:50,104 --> 01:03:52,038
- No, we're not!
- Yes, you are!

732
01:03:59,245 --> 01:04:00,769
Seven tickets.

733
01:04:02,115 --> 01:04:03,673
Are you by yourselves?

734
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:07,076
They're my cousins.

735
01:04:07,286 --> 01:04:10,050
We didn't want to miss
the start of the film

736
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:13,190
and our parents
are still in the pizzeria.

737
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:16,750
If it's okay with them...

738
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:21,999
Thank you.

739
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:33,005
Find a seat.

740
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,438
Shut up!

741
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:39,270
<i>Attention. Whoever can translate</i>
<i>this sentence, raise their hand. </i>

742
01:04:40,783 --> 01:04:41,977
<i>I can. </i>

743
01:04:42,484 --> 01:04:45,180
<i>- Franchetti, come up here. </i>
<i>- But I didn't raise my hand. </i>

744
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:47,045
<i>That's why I chose you. </i>

745
01:04:47,255 --> 01:04:50,224
- Where are they?
- In a classroom.

746
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:53,861
- Who are the characters?
- Ciccio and Franco.

747
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:56,291
<i>Translate. </i>

748
01:04:56,997 --> 01:04:59,488
<i>- Into what language? </i>
<i>- Franchetti, don't play the fool. </i>

749
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:02,267
<i>I'm not, I'm serious. </i>
<i>Into what language? </i>

750
01:05:02,502 --> 01:05:03,730
<i>Really? </i>

751
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:07,838
<i>You mean you can translate into</i>
<i>a language other than Italian? </i>

752
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:10,869
<i>- What would that be? </i>
<i>- Turkish, with your permission. </i>

753
01:05:15,848 --> 01:05:17,110
What's happening?

754
01:05:17,316 --> 01:05:21,775
Ciccio's trying to make him translate
a sentence in Latin

755
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:25,218
but Franco is so dumb
he doesn't understand anything.

756
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:29,154
What did you write?

757
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,228
- What does that mean in Italian?
- I only translate into Turkish.

758
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:36,027
- Quiet, everyone.
- Quiet!

759
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,928
You shut up!

760
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,793
- Now, translate this.
- Into Italian?

761
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,530
- Into Italian.
- How about Russian or Chinese?

762
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,002
Listen to the way that one laughs!

763
01:06:44,828 --> 01:06:46,420
You know what, guys?

764
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:50,532
I heard a lady at the cinema saying
that next week there's going to be

765
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:52,595
a fantastic film!

766
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:55,363
It's called
"City of the Argonauts"!

767
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:58,798
No, it's not!
It's "City of the Astronauts"!

768
01:06:59,008 --> 01:07:00,032
Don't be so fussy!

769
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:02,971
You guys, just remember something,

770
01:07:03,178 --> 01:07:05,237
next time we come,
I'm not paying.

771
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:06,671
Miser!

772
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,916
- Hey, aren't you coming?
- Go on ahead, I'll catch up.

773
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,217
All right, let's go.

774
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:21,352
- They really had a good time.
- Yeah.

775
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:24,961
Listen, are you sure
your mother doesn't know?

776
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:29,929
Nothing wakes her up,
not even a cannon.

777
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:33,637
We forgot the tape recorder!

778
01:07:34,873 --> 01:07:37,103
Let's go get it!

779
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:52,949
Careful!

780
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:56,250
- I can't see a thing!
- I'll lead you.

781
01:08:18,446 --> 01:08:23,315
Touching a person's face you can tell
if they're beautiful or ugly.

782
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,381
You need to hear their voice, too.

783
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:50,204
- Why are you laughing?
- It tickles.

784
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,337
Now it's my turn.

785
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,216
- What is it?
- I feel shy.

786
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,016
Me, too.

787
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:20,029
Now that I'm your girlfriend,
will you ever leave me?

788
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:21,928
No.

789
01:09:22,737 --> 01:09:25,763
Even if you meet other girls
when you grow up?

790
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:28,407
I don't want any other girls.

791
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:33,741
Let's go now.

792
01:09:38,918 --> 01:09:40,681
After 3 years and 3,000 nights

793
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:44,849
Elisa, imprisoned in the castle,
was still waiting for her brothers.

794
01:09:45,325 --> 01:09:47,020
What will become of me?

795
01:09:47,227 --> 01:09:50,662
Will I be forced
to pine away in this castle

796
01:09:50,863 --> 01:09:52,262
and die of sadness?

797
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:56,357
Is that the castle where
our sister is hidden?

798
01:09:56,735 --> 01:10:00,170
Yes, and there is a Dragon
guarding the door.

799
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:04,068
- How will we ever get in?
- I'm afraid. I don't want to go in!

800
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:08,142
Me, neither! That Dragon
can shoot fire out of his eyes.

801
01:10:08,346 --> 01:10:10,711
- But what can we do?
- I have an idea.

802
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:12,743
With eyes closed we can't see him.

803
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:15,383
- You're crazy!
- Maybe he's right.

804
01:10:15,752 --> 01:10:17,185
It's true!

805
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:21,880
Even when we close our eyes
we know our way around.

806
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:23,818
Oh Lord, who gave

807
01:10:24,026 --> 01:10:25,391
His only begotten Son to win,

808
01:10:25,861 --> 01:10:27,829
with His death and resurrection...

809
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:31,898
All right.
What can we do at this point?

810
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,466
We could have
the little angel appear.

811
01:10:34,836 --> 01:10:39,136
Felice could do it... Felice Cordero.

812
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,467
Is Felice here?

813
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:44,168
Boys, where is Felice?

814
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:48,205
Where is everyone?

815
01:10:58,457 --> 01:11:01,255
Listen, Brothers!
The Dragon is coming.

816
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:04,826
We're not afraid,
in our blindfolds, we're invincible!

817
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:06,926
To arms!

818
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,259
Attack!

819
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:22,845
Save me!

820
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,853
What is going on here?

821
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,055
Have you all gone mad?

822
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,251
What are you doing here?

823
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,123
Aren't you ashamed?

824
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,465
- Look what they've stolen!
- The tape recorder!

825
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,760
What are you doing with this?

826
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:52,064
Who is responsible for this?

827
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:54,468
- Whose idea was this?
- Oh, no, sir!

828
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:59,301
We were just having fun
like the time we went to the cinema.

829
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,072
What cinema?

830
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:05,915
- Sister Santa, what cinema?
- I know nothing about this.

831
01:12:10,155 --> 01:12:12,146
Here you are, you naughty girl!

832
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:16,282
Do you want to get me fired?

833
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:18,825
Is that what you want?

834
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:23,491
I'm sorry, sir, it's all my fault.
But it won't happen again.

835
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:26,165
It certainly is your fault!

836
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:29,031
- Take your daughter inside.
- I see...

837
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,474
that the boy responsible for this

838
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:35,903
has made you all forget
what it means to be honest.

839
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:38,979
I know quite well who it is.

840
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:41,342
He's not getting away with this.

841
01:13:01,268 --> 01:13:04,897
This is Balleri's last day.
He's going home tomorrow.

842
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:06,972
That's all there is to it.

843
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,337
- What happened?
- Better not ask too many questions.

844
01:13:12,145 --> 01:13:15,911
Let me have the best homework
later this morning,

845
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:18,483
to read to the parents.

846
01:13:21,953 --> 01:13:23,978
I'm going home.
See you tomorrow.

847
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:25,888
See you.

848
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,969
<i>In the castle, there was also</i>
<i>a terrible Witch, </i>

849
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:53,047
<i>the Dragon's assistant. </i>

850
01:13:53,248 --> 01:13:57,048
<i>Beware. The flames of hell</i>
<i>will devour you</i>

851
01:13:57,252 --> 01:13:59,846
<i>until your skin</i>
<i>falls from your flesh</i>

852
01:14:00,055 --> 01:14:02,648
<i>and your very bones</i>
<i>turn to dust. </i>

853
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:09,292
May! With your gown
embroidered with flowers

854
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:12,124
and your splendid blue mornings.

855
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,633
You perfume every path

856
01:14:15,235 --> 01:14:18,671
and show us the way
through the darkest straits.

857
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:24,473
I brought you the best homework.

858
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:58,774
<i>Next time you run away, </i>
<i>come and see me. </i>

859
01:14:58,975 --> 01:15:01,000
<i>- Where? </i>
<i>- At the blast furnace! </i>

860
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,336
<i>- Sure! </i>
<i>- Bye, Ettore!</i>

861
01:15:24,164 --> 01:15:26,257
You may keep these.

862
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:29,963
Did you at least listen to them?

863
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,864
It's the end of the year.
I have no time to waste.

864
01:15:34,073 --> 01:15:38,702
It's not a waste of time!
I know he gets carried away.

865
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:42,574
But he has his own way,
a unique way,

866
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:47,149
of looking at things,
discovering and telling about them.

867
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:49,285
He's completely different.

868
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:52,121
There's nothing wrong with that.

869
01:15:52,323 --> 01:15:55,758
You do know that this school
is over 100 years old?

870
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:00,227
In all that time, life here
has gone very smoothly.

871
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,864
With no problems whatsoever.
And do you know why?

872
01:16:03,066 --> 01:16:06,228
Because we have rules here.

873
01:16:07,203 --> 01:16:10,604
To some people, they might seem
stupid and out-of-date.

874
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,867
But they permit these children
some kind of life outside

875
01:16:15,077 --> 01:16:17,203
after they finish school.

876
01:16:17,412 --> 01:16:20,245
These kids can't see, it's true.

877
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:23,906
But they're alive! They're full
of enthusiasm and imagination!

878
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:27,678
We aren't helping if we deny them
the freedom to express themselves.

879
01:16:27,888 --> 01:16:31,984
- To hurt themselves?
- Why not? It's part of learning.

880
01:16:32,826 --> 01:16:35,795
You spend time with them.
But I am one of them.

881
01:16:37,797 --> 01:16:41,130
Freedom is a luxury that
we blind people cannot afford.

882
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:45,626
We, we... listen, I know what
your problem is.

883
01:16:46,138 --> 01:16:49,868
30 years ago, you could see.
You weren't in here as a child.

884
01:16:50,075 --> 01:16:52,066
You could study and travel.

885
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,371
Why don't you want to give these kids
the same opportunities you had?

886
01:16:56,748 --> 01:16:59,443
Because they don't have them!
They're blind!

887
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:03,879
- Maybe because you deny them.
- Are you finished?

888
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:07,323
I was the one
who gave Mirco the tape recorder.

889
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:10,348
Do you think I didn't know that?

890
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:14,390
That was very wrong. Anyway,
that doesn't justify his behaviour.

891
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:19,061
One undisciplined boy may not
jeopardize the good of the others.

892
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:34,771
How's it going?

893
01:17:36,517 --> 01:17:37,484
Okay.

894
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:44,250
- Are you glad you're going home?
- Yeah.

895
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:52,296
I listened to your tapes.

896
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:56,461
They're great.
I liked them a lot.

897
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:00,764
Listen, Mirco.

898
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:04,405
Listen.

899
01:18:05,076 --> 01:18:08,170
You have something special inside.

900
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:11,504
Something unique,

901
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,511
that only you have,
that nobody else has got.

902
01:18:18,155 --> 01:18:20,749
Promise me, when you leave here

903
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:24,256
you won't let anyone
take it away from you.

904
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:31,297
I really hope that
you'll be able to keep studying.

905
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:34,160
- Don Giulio?
- Yes?

906
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:36,730
You don't have to worry.

907
01:18:36,938 --> 01:18:40,897
I didn't tell anyone that
you gave me the tape recorder.

908
01:18:55,922 --> 01:18:57,480
Good morning, Don Giulio!

909
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,059
- Concettina?
- Yes?

910
01:19:05,297 --> 01:19:07,094
Tell me something.

911
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:10,932
You've been here a long time.

912
01:19:11,136 --> 01:19:14,627
What good is this school?
Who does it help?

913
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:21,869
We teach these children
to cane chairs, to obey us.

914
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:24,740
We boast

915
01:19:24,948 --> 01:19:28,782
that we make good weavers
or switchboard operators out of them,

916
01:19:28,985 --> 01:19:31,954
but you know what we really do?

917
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:36,557
We rob them of the best thing
they have at their age.

918
01:19:36,759 --> 01:19:38,522
Their dreams.

919
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:42,029
I'm not educated.
I don't understand all this.

920
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:45,200
But if you don't like it
why don't you speak up?

921
01:19:45,566 --> 01:19:47,534
I wish it was that easy, but...

922
01:19:47,735 --> 01:19:50,533
I'm not the one in charge here,
there's a director.

923
01:19:50,772 --> 01:19:55,106
I know, but if no one ever tells him
he won't know he's making a mistake.

924
01:19:56,743 --> 01:19:59,610
If you're sure, do something.

925
01:20:00,113 --> 01:20:04,675
Remember, it's important in life
to say what you really feel.

926
01:20:05,285 --> 01:20:09,812
Even if someone else doesn't like it.
You don't want to have regrets.

927
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,893
DOWN WITH THE HEAD
OF THE CASSONI INSTITUTE

928
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:20,997
REFORM THE SCHOOL

929
01:20:27,304 --> 01:20:30,296
UNITED IN STRUGGLE
WORKERS AND STUDENTS

930
01:20:44,654 --> 01:20:48,180
<i>Down with the head of Cassoni! </i>

931
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,788
<i>Down with the head of Cassoni! </i>

932
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:05,071
Sir, excuse me.

933
01:21:06,273 --> 01:21:08,833
The mayor's office
is calling.

934
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:12,944
The mayor wants to talk to you.
He sounds very angry.

935
01:21:14,347 --> 01:21:16,645
What in the world do they want?

936
01:21:17,217 --> 01:21:19,980
It seems all the students in the city
are on strike,

937
01:21:20,185 --> 01:21:22,210
and there's a delegation of workers
from the steel mill.

938
01:21:22,421 --> 01:21:24,286
What's it got to do with me?

939
01:21:25,424 --> 01:21:28,951
They say that if we don't re-admit
the student who was expelled,

940
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:31,128
they'll close the blast furnace.

941
01:21:41,037 --> 01:21:42,800
Mirco Balleri is staying.

942
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:45,735
I will take responsibility.

943
01:21:46,143 --> 01:21:48,611
And I'm changing the show.

944
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:51,644
Don't get involved, Don Giulio.

945
01:21:56,051 --> 01:21:57,643
What's the use?

946
01:21:57,953 --> 01:22:01,183
What's the use of showing these kids
to their parents for a few hours

947
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:03,547
pretending that they're normal?

948
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:06,022
These kids are normal!

949
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:11,127
The parents know their children.
They know what they feel.

950
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:13,597
And if the kids do something good

951
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:15,826
do we have to negate it
because it wasn't our idea?

952
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:19,062
What are you talking about?

953
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:23,039
I'm taking care of the show
from now on.

954
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:26,507
My idea is better than yours.

955
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,013
I am still the director here.

956
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:32,277
Not for long.

957
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:40,047
Mirco, where are you?

958
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:43,018
Francesca, come down!

959
01:22:45,763 --> 01:22:47,321
Look what I found!

960
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:50,223
Put those down, wait!

961
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:52,999
I'll take these, let go.
Sit down.

962
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:55,226
Don, these are the footsteps.

963
01:22:57,774 --> 01:22:59,298
Kids, be careful.

964
01:22:59,676 --> 01:23:02,008
There was stuff to hang over there.

965
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:04,270
What do we do with these?

966
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,910
Give them to me, I need them.

967
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,109
These were over there, would someone
please put them back?

968
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,914
Okay, I'll do it.

969
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:18,323
Kids, I'm counting on you
to do your very best, okay?

970
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,627
I wonder what my dad will say!

971
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:23,053
Now, let's try to be serious.

972
01:24:11,941 --> 01:24:13,670
Welcome, everyone!

973
01:24:16,178 --> 01:24:19,613
I wanted to tell you that
this year the kids and I

974
01:24:19,814 --> 01:24:22,806
have decided
to do a different kind of show.

975
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:27,853
Sometimes we grownups ask ourselves
what's the right thing to do,

976
01:24:28,055 --> 01:24:30,489
but we don't always know the answer.

977
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:33,626
Anyway, this time
we wanted to try something new.

978
01:24:33,827 --> 01:24:37,820
Because we believe that imagination,
and the right to a normal life,

979
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:41,000
are things that nobody
should have to give up.

980
01:24:42,769 --> 01:24:45,067
All we ask before we begin

981
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:49,098
is that you put on the blindfolds
you were given at the door.

982
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:55,546
Put them on now.

983
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:59,007
Don't be afraid.

984
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:09,756
Good. We're ready to start.

985
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:37,884
What I'm about to tell you now

986
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:41,944
is a story that happened
in another time and place.

987
01:25:43,957 --> 01:25:46,790
Long, long ago, in the land of Awaka

988
01:25:46,994 --> 01:25:50,953
there lived a Princess
and her 15 brothers.

989
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:02,464
One day, their father, the King,
passed away.

990
01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:10,010
Their stepmother,
her hair all in a mess,

991
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:12,808
called the children and told them,

992
01:26:13,017 --> 01:26:16,418
<i>"I don't want you. </i>
<i>You're not mine." </i>

993
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:20,021
<i>"Go away. Leave my kingdom</i>
<i>and don't ever come back."</i>

994
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:37,170
The children were cold and tired.

995
01:26:37,539 --> 01:26:41,134
But worst of all, the forest
was full of mysterious sounds.

996
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,636
Everything frightened them.

997
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:40,728
His older brothers teased him.

998
01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:43,692
Children can't fly,
they said.

999
01:27:44,733 --> 01:27:48,168
But the littlest brother began
to try every day,

1000
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:51,596
while the others were wondering
how to escape from the castle.

1001
01:27:51,806 --> 01:27:54,604
We could climb down a rope
from the window!

1002
01:27:54,809 --> 01:27:58,767
But what if the Dragon sees us
while we're escaping? He'd attack us.

1003
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:00,808
How dare we face the Dragon

1004
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:04,142
when just the sight of him
makes us freeze in our tracks?

1005
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:07,547
The littlest brother got an idea.

1006
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:10,550
Let's close our eyes.
That way, we can't see him.

1007
01:28:10,756 --> 01:28:15,193
Right! We know our way around here
perfectly well without looking.

1008
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:18,792
If we wear blindfolds,
the Dragon can't scare us

1009
01:28:18,997 --> 01:28:21,727
with his terrible face.

1010
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:32,934
To the attack!

1011
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,994
Only the littlest brother
was unafraid.

1012
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:59,624
He took Elisa by the hand
and opened the window of the tower.

1013
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:04,168
- Come, Elisa, let's jump out.
- No, I can't! I'm afraid.

1014
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,801
Give me your hand, come on!

1015
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,103
The two jumped into space.

1016
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:15,712
And were transformed
into beautiful seagulls.

1017
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:20,479
Let's jump after them!
Did you see?

1018
01:29:20,686 --> 01:29:23,450
They can fly,
it wasn't impossible.

1019
01:29:23,656 --> 01:29:24,816
Come on!

1020
01:29:25,024 --> 01:29:27,822
They all decided to follow.

1021
01:29:28,027 --> 01:29:33,589
And one by one they, too,
were changed into white seagulls.

1022
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:39,594
And that is how the 15 brothers
along with their sister

1023
01:29:39,804 --> 01:29:41,862
flew far, far away.

1024
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:46,532
And they lived happily together
all the rest of their days!

1025
01:30:34,286 --> 01:30:36,754
In 1975, after years of pressure,

1026
01:30:36,955 --> 01:30:40,049
the Italian government approved a law
abolishing schools for the blind

1027
01:30:40,259 --> 01:30:43,592
and allowing blind students
to attend public schools.

1028
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:49,825
Mirco left the school when he was 16.

1029
01:30:50,034 --> 01:30:52,594
Although he never recovered
his sight,

1030
01:30:52,803 --> 01:30:56,670
he became one of the most renowned
sound editors in Italian cinema.

1031
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:07,911
- We're almost there aren't we, Dad?
- Yes, kiddo.

1032
01:31:26,633 --> 01:31:29,796
- Can I play?
- Hi, Mirco!

1033
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:37,803
Yeah, but you're the last one in
so you have to be 'it'.

1034
01:31:38,144 --> 01:31:39,668
Come on, he's...

1035
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:42,643
He's right. The rules are the rules,
I'm the last one in!

1036
01:31:42,848 --> 01:31:45,180
So, I'm 'it'.

1037
01:31:58,128 --> 01:31:59,254
One...

1038
01:32:00,998 --> 01:32:02,090
Two...

1039
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:03,959
Gotcha!

1040
01:32:04,168 --> 01:32:06,898
You cheated!
It's not fair!

1041
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:11,032
- You're too easy to catch!
- We missed you, Mirco!
