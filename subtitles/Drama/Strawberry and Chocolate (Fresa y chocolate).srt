Havana, 1979

2
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:53,474
Couldn't we have gone elsewhere?

3
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,570
The place doesn't matter, Vivian.

4
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,183
It's like we've come here
to do something wrong.

5
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:03,145
We already discussed that.

6
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,155
Yes, but...

7
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:09,057
bringing me to a cheap motel
with holes in the walls!

8
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,097
There are no holes, love.

9
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,583
It's so hot!
I'm taking my shirt off.

10
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,844
Take off your blouse.

11
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,548
Turn off the light.

12
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,879
I have to go to the bathroom.

13
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,135
You invite me to the movies
but it was really for this!

14
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,980
I love you, Vivian.

15
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,415
And you show your love
by bringing me to this place?

16
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,987
All you want is sex,
like all men.

17
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,359
I want you, not sex.

18
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,008
I'll prove it to you.

19
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,411
I won't touch you
until we're married.

20
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:04,785
And in a five-star hotel.

21
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,992
Get dressed, we're leaving.

22
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,721
What?

23
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:19,897
STRAWBERRYAND CHOCOLATE

24
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,499
Vivian! Vivian is coming!
My God, she is beautiful.

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,878
After reading articles 24-28...

29
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:03,641
do you still want to marry?

30
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,012
Yes.

May I?

36
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,177
I couldn't resist the temptation.

37
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,973
I love strawberry!

38
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,356
It's the one good thing
made in Cuba.

39
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,665
Soon they'll export it,
and for us, water and sugar.

40
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,970
Today is my lucky day!

41
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,944
I'm finding wonderful things.

42
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,546
Fly on the wings of imagination.

43
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,852
It's the only way we can.

44
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,457
I've got le <i>Cahier du Cinéma.</i>

45
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,303
Interested in Vargas Llosa?

46
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,832
He signed this for me
but I have another copy at home.

47
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,311
I've also got the works
of Severo Sarduy and Gaytisolo.

48
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,110
Shall we go get them?

49
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,777
I don't visit strangers.

50
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,286
Don't pass this up, honey.

51
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,481
Where else would you find
these books?

52
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,888
Got it!

53
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,231
You only read books authorized
by the Youth League!

54
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,794
Cover them, friend...

55
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,635
Be imaginative!

56
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,870
I don't have to.
I'll read what I please...

57
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,574
and I don't feel like talking.

58
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,378
I know you.

59
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,913
I've seen you many times
leaving the University.

60
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,419
It wasn't me.

61
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,352
Of course it was you!

62
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:32,582
It wasn't!

63
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,922
Excuse me!

64
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,825
Comrade Torvald.

65
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,188
I just wanted
to lend you some books...

66
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,326
and give you a photo
of you from "A Doll's House."

67
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,869
Pictures of me?

68
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:50,499
Nora and Torvald...
You were wonderful.

69
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:54,204
- And those pictures?
- From the play.

70
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,509
I'm a photographer; I have many.

71
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,572
Everyone who sees them goes crazy.

72
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,311
So give them to me!

73
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,183
If you want them, they're yours.

74
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,118
Where are they?

75
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,247
In my apartment.

76
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,916
I live close by.

77
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:11,826
With my parents, nephews
and aunts, who never go out.

78
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,968
Okay, let's go,
but I want them all!

79
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,495
Let me finish my ice cream.

80
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,748
Ready!

81
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,146
Hold these.

82
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,557
- You'll pay for both?
- Yes. Keep the change.

83
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,568
Come, sweetie, you can't leave
without your photos.

84
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:57,370
Get out, sweetie! We are packed
like sardines back here.

85
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,225
What now?

86
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,463
One thing...
Don't get the wrong idea.

87
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,902
What do you mean, baby?

88
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,649
<i>They say you want me dead</i>

89
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,815
<i>For harming your reputation</i>

90
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,022
Who is she?

91
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,290
The Neighborhood Vigilance.

92
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,696
- So what?
- I don't like her.

93
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,898
Welcome to my hideaway.

94
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,380
Not everybody is welcome here.

95
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,042
Come right in.

96
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,487
Don't be afraid.

97
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,887
These sculptures...

98
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,289
are great.

99
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,694
Made by a young artist, Germán.
He is very talented.

100
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,095
We're having a show...

101
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,633
that will be a success...

102
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,134
although we still need
a few things...

103
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,694
that I'm getting
from a friend at an embassy.

104
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:41,507
Where is everybody?

105
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,978
Mom!

106
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,675
Dad! Aunt Chucha!

107
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,482
Twins!

108
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,846
They must be out
lining up for food.

109
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:55,956
Suit yourself.

110
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,087
That way we'll make it easier
for the neighbors.

111
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,755
I'll make tea to relax us.

112
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,733
No! I don't drink tea.
Give me the photos.

113
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,133
The photos?

114
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,468
Yes, but I have to find them...

115
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,973
Last time I saw them...

116
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:15,508
I think they're in this box!

117
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,081
You check while I make some tea.

118
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,278
I can't be rude
to such an important guest.

119
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,288
Make yourself at home.
Sit in this armchair.

120
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,324
It's special.

121
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,621
Rocco, you're dripping again!

122
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,927
Dummy!

123
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,661
Rocco, I'm getting tired of this!

124
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,191
You didn't find them?

125
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:44,360
Don't worry, we'll look for them
in that other box.

126
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,902
Do you take lemon?

127
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,767
No tea.
I don't have a stomachache.

128
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,401
Forget it and get my photos.
I must be somewhere at 5:00.

129
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,741
Then I'll give you coffee!

130
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:59,715
Civilized people drink tea,
but not us.

131
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,378
We prefer coffee.

132
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:11,759
<i>All us blacks drink coffee</i>

133
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:25,875
Make yourself at home, friend.
Sit in the armchair; it's special.

134
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,776
When I read John Donne
or Cavafis, I sit there.

135
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,780
Wonderful poets.
Heard of them?

136
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:36,217
How can a country move forward...

137
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:39,688
if its youth don't know
John Donne or Cavafis! Here...

138
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm always leading them
to young people.

139
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,297
You can be next.

140
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,568
I'll put on some music
so the neighbors can't hear us.

141
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:56,471
I learned it from the Vigilance
woman who got it from Security.

142
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,303
Let them listen.

143
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,683
God, what a voice!

144
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:11,081
Why can't this island
produce a voice like that?

145
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,253
We need another voice so badly!

146
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,624
We've had enough of Maria Remolá!

147
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,995
<i>Come out, neighbors.!</i>

148
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>Onions have finally arrived</i>
<i>to the market</i>

149
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,043
Onions have arrived?

150
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,620
No.

151
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:23,058
I'm sorry!
I thought Dieguito was alone...

152
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,061
since the door was open.

153
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,498
Who was it?

154
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,297
The Vigilance woman.

155
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:35,865
What did I tell you...

156
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:39,039
Those aren't yours.

157
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,110
Well, give me mine.

158
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,583
First, the coffee.

159
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:53,749
Sit down, kid.
Don't worry, I won't bite.

160
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,428
I'm sorry!
My God! Did I burn you?

161
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:03,024
I'm so embarrassed!
How could that happen?

162
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,124
Let me see.

163
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:06,931
Hurry, take off your shirt.
It'll come out.

164
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:10,030
- Get me a wet cloth.
- No, take off your shirt!

165
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:13,201
How embarrassing!
It was so quick that...

166
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,838
- Give me something to put on.
- Sure.

167
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,181
Take this.

168
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:25,484
Why did this happen to me?

169
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:27,319
My brand-new shirt!

170
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,122
Look, not a trace of a stain.

171
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,255
I'm sorry.

172
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,954
I know...
I'll make it up to you.

173
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,337
Try this tea.

174
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,578
It's from India.

175
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,646
Dostoyevski's characters
drank tea...

176
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,591
and the English, of course.

177
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,185
At 5:00, all of England...

178
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:42,528
sits down to tea.
What time is it?

179
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,593
5:00. See, I told you
I had to be somewhere.

180
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,501
This is magic!

181
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,137
Try it and tell me.

182
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,975
So?

183
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,608
It needs more sugar.

184
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:04,677
That would be criminal.
Try it again.

185
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,590
It's all right.
I'll drink it.

186
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,596
But please,
give me the photos.

187
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,097
The photos...

188
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:27,340
I can't find anything here.

189
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,539
I'll look for them, and give
them to you some other day.

190
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:33,105
Some other day?
No way.

191
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,783
A promise is a promise.

192
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,148
Isn't it wonderful?

193
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,353
People out there
pushing each other on buses...

194
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,798
everyone shouting,
and you and I here...

195
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,334
listening to Maria Callas...

196
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:30,066
and drinking Indian tea
from French china...

197
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,700
that belonged
to the Laynaz del Castillos.

198
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:39,880
Well, look, I don't have time
to sit here talking nonsense.

199
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,681
Forget the photos, get my shirt.
I'm leaving.

200
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:44,948
You're right.

201
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:48,014
Let's talk about
more serious things.

202
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,823
Do you know Oscar Wilde?
Gide? Lorca?

203
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,385
Yes.

204
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:56,024
They all had something
in common with me.

205
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,036
But not only them.
The list is endless, dear.

206
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:04,598
Even the bravest
and most famous warriors like...

207
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,542
Alexander the Great, Hercules.

208
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,704
Achilles was Patroclo's boyfriend!

209
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,680
And some even say...

210
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,742
that Hemingway...

211
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:19,380
Yes, the guy with the shotguns,
hunting lions.

212
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,515
By the way...

213
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:26,294
A Marxist book on sexuality...

214
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:28,160
claims... very interesting...

215
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:31,395
that 60 percent of men...

216
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,936
have had
a homosexual relationship...

217
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,995
with no change in personality.

218
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:41,009
A. Raskolnikov.

219
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:44,241
If they say so,
it must be true, right?

220
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,784
I'm in the other 40 percent.

221
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:54,821
The best is not to be shocked
by anything...

222
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:57,190
and sip from every cup.

223
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:03,765
Here's how I became a fag.

224
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,270
Wait! I don't have
to listen to this!

225
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:10,864
Wait, dear,
you didn't understand me at all!

226
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,932
Why are you acting like that?

227
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:18,213
Hey, kid.
What's this?

228
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,409
You have the wrong idea!

229
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:21,951
What about the photos?

230
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,580
David, your Vargas Llosa book!

231
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,454
David, the book!

232
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,391
Fuck!

233
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:40,165
You let me open my mouth
and talk like a parrot!

234
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:47,969
Bring him back
or you'll live on bread and water!

235
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,242
And you, I hope
the coast guard gets hold of you!

236
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,831
What's wrong with you?

237
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,731
Listen to this.

238
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,039
I was having an ice cream...

239
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:23,375
and this guy comes
and sits at my table.

240
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,039
A weird guy.

241
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,639
Weird?

242
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:28,708
A faggot, man.

243
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,755
How did you know?

244
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,813
You can tell right away...

245
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,382
There was chocolate,
he took strawberry.

246
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,791
That's a good one.

247
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:41,524
He also started talking very
ironically about the Revolution.

248
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:43,327
And you let him?

249
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,332
Well, I was suspicious.

250
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:50,032
So I let him sit and talk
all he wanted.

251
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,234
And then?

252
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:53,674
He invited me home.

253
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,575
To his place?

254
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,671
David, he wanted something else!

255
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:00,012
Shit, man, this is serious!

256
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,108
He showed me some foreign books...

257
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:04,051
you can't find anywhere.

258
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,282
He used them as bait...

259
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:07,789
And you went?

260
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,655
To see if he was into something.

261
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,690
His place
is full of weird things...

262
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,028
strange sculptures...

263
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,091
I don't know, there's
something fishy about them.

264
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,501
They seemed religious.

265
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:24,063
Religious?

266
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:25,631
His friend made them...

267
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:28,439
and they are planning
an exhibit with help...

268
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:32,278
- from an embassy.
- An embassy?

269
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,510
Shit, that's really serious.

270
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:38,582
Do you have his address?

271
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:41,488
Could you find the place?

272
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:43,549
Sure.

273
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:46,423
<i>Miguel is right.</i>

274
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:49,260
<i>What do these fags think?</i>

275
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,893
<i>The embassy thing is serious.</i>

276
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,130
<i>This one picked the wrong guy.</i>

277
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,811
<i>Sex.!</i>

278
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:14,255
<i>Everybody...</i>

279
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:16,315
<i>thinks about sex all the time...</i>

280
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,860
<i>as if it were</i>
<i>the only important thing.</i>

281
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:22,728
<i>Sex.!</i>

282
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,091
<i>Vivian too.</i>

283
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:28,831
<i>She pretended to be romantic...</i>

284
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:32,642
<i>very spiritual...</i>

285
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:37,169
<i>but deep down,</i>
<i>that's all she wanted.</i>

286
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:16,483
Hey, Vivian!

287
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:18,111
What a coincidence!

288
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,919
Coincidence?

289
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,689
You were following me.

290
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,225
Come on... come on!

291
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:40,171
David, I want to live well,
have a family, dress nice.

292
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:43,041
And I want to do it now...

293
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,876
not when I'm too old!

294
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,351
You never loved me.

295
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:50,818
You just played with me.

296
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,363
You can't love that man.

297
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,408
Don't feel so sorry for yourself.

298
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,637
You'll find someone
better than me.

299
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,009
I don't want that!

300
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:19,512
See?

301
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,051
See what I mean?

302
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:27,079
You're not the only one
who suffers.

303
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:30,854
You think it's easy for me
knowing you're so nearby?

304
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:41,566
My husband is being sent to Italy.

305
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,810
For at least two years...

306
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,378
maybe three.

307
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,443
We're going soon.

308
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,527
I've been thinking...

309
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,962
Before I leave...

310
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,296
- Maybe we...
- I don't want to be your lover!

311
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:15,569
And don't pity me!

312
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,675
And I won't follow you
or go by your house ever again!

313
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:37,993
David!

314
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,370
What's up?

315
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:50,235
I checked on your case.

316
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:51,296
What case?

317
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:54,673
What?
About the fag.

318
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:57,907
Forget it.
It's no big deal.

319
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:01,439
Are you crazy?
What you said was right.

320
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,383
- Find out more.
- Like what?

321
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:08,049
Everything!
The embassy, the exhibit.

322
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,060
Find an excuse
to go and visit him.

323
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:15,030
- Why? He's just a faggot!
- Exactly.

324
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,295
This is important.
It's a mission!

325
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:22,797
The man's unfaithful
even to his own sex!

326
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,056
David!

327
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:43,524
Come on in.

328
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:48,425
I came because...
I left a book here the other day.

329
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:51,524
Yes, but please come in.

330
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:00,405
Are the sculptures still here?

331
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:03,037
Yes.

332
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:05,240
When is the exhibit?

333
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,476
Soon. We're already into it.

334
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:12,281
Well, make yourself at home.

335
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,585
Sit down.
I'll start making tea.

336
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,786
Okay? I'll be right back.

337
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:21,661
I'll sit in the chair...
What was the poet's name?

338
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,323
John Donne.

339
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:33,007
Remember, I'm next in line
to read it.

340
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,271
Where's he from?

341
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:37,643
England.

342
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:39,272
A friend of yours?

343
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,044
Friend?

344
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:42,744
Do you write to each other?

345
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,218
He died in 1630.

346
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,826
Don't be embarrassed.

347
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,885
You can't know everything.

348
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,755
I owe you an apology.

349
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:22,314
You don't owe me anything.

350
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:25,623
I should apologize to you.
I'd had a bad day!

351
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,826
I was being silly.

352
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,059
I don't know what came over me.

353
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:34,365
I got nervous.
I don't know.

354
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:35,802
I don't...

355
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:39,035
I'm not really like that.

356
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:42,135
I believe in friendship.
I think we can be friends.

357
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:45,545
Me too.
Friendship!

358
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:47,014
Not anything else.

359
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,185
Then this deserves more than tea.

360
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,593
Will you toast
with the enemy's drink?

361
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,001
Why not?

362
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:14,409
I'll get some ice.

363
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:23,077
Rocco, what's that water?
You're so stupid!

364
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:27,189
I'm getting tired of you!

365
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,418
I should throw you
over the balcony.

366
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:48,536
How do you get the whisky?

367
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:50,511
First, the "orishas."

368
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:09,464
Couldn't this affect you
ideologically?

369
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:14,797
- If one has firm principles...
- Well said.

370
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:19,134
A toast to this meeting.

371
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:22,469
I'll put on some music.

372
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:55,670
Your dad?

373
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:57,212
Who?

374
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,804
The one with the cigar.

375
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,083
You're so funny!

376
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,989
That's Lezama, the maestro.

377
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:12,221
One of the great writers
of this century.

378
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:14,422
A universal Cuban.

379
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,042
What a piano that man plays!

380
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:35,951
Where's he from?

381
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,510
Obsessed with nationalities!

382
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:39,850
A Cuban, Lecuona.

383
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,775
Look, David...

384
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:04,976
let's put our cards on the table.

385
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,448
Well, you know...

386
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,315
what I am...
I'm also religious.

387
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:15,580
I'm a dialectic materialist,
so why talk about it?

388
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:17,955
Today you seem different.

389
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:21,758
No, this is the way I am.
The other day I wasn't myself.

390
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,661
But there's more.

391
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:28,067
I've had problems with the system.

392
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,338
Like what?

393
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,334
Imagine, all sorts.

394
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,937
The neighbors watch me,
I don't do voluntary work.

395
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,811
They're after me at work.

396
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,650
Well, I think...

397
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:47,952
we all have the right to do
what we want with our lives.

398
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:54,128
The Revolution needs
more militants like you.

399
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:59,258
I'll show you
Communists are not savages.

400
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,304
That sounds marvelous.

401
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,480
I have a favor to ask you.
Not because of me...

402
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:19,355
but you know how people are.

403
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,356
I can come here...

404
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:22,686
but...

405
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,159
Got it.

406
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:27,753
If I see you on the street,
I don't know you.

407
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:35,771
And...

408
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,370
I'd rather you call me David...

409
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:45,039
not my "love," "baby"
or anything, just...

410
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:46,974
David!

411
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,523
This deserves
another toast, David.

412
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,756
We're giving humanity a lesson
with the whisky of the enemy.

413
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:05,330
Long live democratic communism!

414
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,982
You'll see, you'll feel better now.

415
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:29,053
Next time, take soda with it.

416
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,150
If he's got whisky,
he's got soda also.

417
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:37,993
Hey, you're getting
a nice fat ass! No wonder!

418
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:45,997
The whisky clue is good.

419
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:49,101
It's supplied by foreigners.
That's clear.

420
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,808
- And this is pure poison.
- He's religious.

421
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:56,351
He doesn't do voluntary work.

422
00:40:56,419 --> 00:41:00,412
I think he's even had problems
with the police.

423
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,755
This is not a police issue.

424
00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:06,590
It's political and moral.

425
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:08,961
See how I was right?

426
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,466
What about the exhibit?

427
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:15,129
Nothing. I ask him
but he won't say anything.

428
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,831
You must get it out of him!

429
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,203
It's not easy.

430
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:20,469
He's smart.

431
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,205
- He even knows I write.
- Great!

432
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:24,541
Use it.

433
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,210
I won't show him my writings.

434
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:31,344
Fuck, David,
getting him is what matters!

435
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,137
Watch her hands!
Watch it!

436
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:05,580
Come with me!

437
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,919
Wait, not so many!

438
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,017
Please, he's her brother
and I'm her husband.

439
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,722
Get in!

440
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,634
If I were to commit suicide
every time I had a problem...

441
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,772
Sorry I can't donate more blood;
she's run me dry.

442
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:07,876
When we're finished we'll go home
and I'll make you a steak.

443
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:16,183
She'll go to the psychiatrist
even if I have to drag her.

444
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:20,961
You still like her?

445
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,261
No, but I can't forgive her
for these things.

446
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,200
One day I'll have a heart attack.

447
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,865
She's charming,
but when she gets depressed...

448
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:35,803
- Does she have family?
- In the country.

449
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:39,405
This is about the fifth time.
I don't call them anymore.

450
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:46,686
David, I'm so grateful!

451
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:47,814
It was my duty.

452
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,984
She's a comrade...
and a Vigilance.

453
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,994
I donated blood for Tashkent.

454
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,530
Enough.

455
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:58,624
She doesn't deserve all this talk.

456
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:02,035
I can't eat all this.

457
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:05,301
I'll wrap it up for you.
Then you can take it to your dorm.

458
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:09,936
If you think this is a lot,
wait for the lunch a la Lezama.

459
00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:12,344
How so?

460
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,479
You'll love it, you little beast.

461
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:20,553
I mean... David.

462
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:30,393
Tea constipates you.

463
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:34,994
Yes, that's why
nobody shits in England.

464
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:40,307
Look at this!
Rocco, dripping again?

465
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:43,472
I can't stand you!

466
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,009
He works when he feels like it.

467
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:52,748
Tell me.

468
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:56,314
Why study Political Science
if you like literature?

469
00:44:57,593 --> 00:45:01,893
I think one should study
what society needs most.

470
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:03,522
And I'm in the University...

471
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,191
thanks to the Revolution.

472
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,965
Comrade,
vocation must be respected.

473
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:13,634
David, you're fighting yourself!

474
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:17,440
I have a friend
who had talent for the piano...

475
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:23,315
but his father was against it,
arguing art is for gays.

476
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:28,722
Today he's 60, he's a queer
and can't play the piano.

477
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:35,859
A smile on this unlucky day!

478
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,658
Sorry, David...

479
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,862
but you have
such a beautiful smile!

480
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:46,402
Don't worry.
I can keep my promises.

481
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:47,999
What's your sign?

482
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:51,912
- Virgo.
- Virgo?

483
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:54,381
Wonderful for a writer!

484
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:58,951
I'm Scorpio.
We're not as bad as they say.

485
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:01,717
And Rocco is Leo.
Listen to him.

486
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,990
Diego, Dieguito!

487
00:46:39,662 --> 00:46:40,890
It's me.

488
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:45,298
I just left the hospital.

489
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:46,733
Let's go to the beach.

490
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:50,533
- Forget it, I'm pissed off!
- Why?

491
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:53,632
I'm sick of these stupid
bureaucrats. We have no say.

492
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,006
But what happened?

493
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,170
They banned Germán's exhibit...

494
00:46:57,246 --> 00:47:00,443
and you can't argue
since they control everything!

495
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,543
Bring me some water, please.

496
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:08,523
They only accept naive painters
or official ones...

497
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:13,153
or those pretending to be modern,
that are purely decorative.

498
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:15,197
Look, you like it?

499
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:17,255
Just bring me some water.

500
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,198
Don't take it out on me...

501
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:21,736
I'm in treatment.

502
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,101
Don't be like that.

503
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:25,732
How do you want me to be?

504
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:27,901
You want me to laugh?

505
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:29,501
I didn't keep quiet.

506
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,944
- What did you say?
- What I felt like saying.

507
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,642
There's no freedom in socialism,
bureaucracies...

508
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:37,880
Don't say that
without music, Diego!

509
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:40,251
And all for these sculptures...

510
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,414
What?

511
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,958
These sculptures are weird,
depressing.

512
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,721
They don't transmit good feeling.

513
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,285
You too now.

514
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,957
What a revolution!

515
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:52,023
Even whores are art critics!

516
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:54,035
Don't call me that
or I'll jump.

517
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:55,400
I'm not a whore!

518
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,300
Come, jump!

519
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:00,601
You need a push?

520
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:04,579
Look, sweetie...

521
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:07,980
Art makes you feel and think.

522
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,484
Art does not transmit.

523
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:12,680
The government radio does that.

524
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,818
You are too trusting.

525
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:22,227
Germán doesn't deserve it.
He's a son of a bitch!

526
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,792
That thinking will lead
to a nightmare.

527
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:28,632
There will be danger everywhere.

528
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:30,968
Next they'll ban children's songs.

529
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,564
Children's songs?

530
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:33,733
Heard this one?

531
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:38,109
<i>Things are frightening</i>
<i>Really horrible</i>

532
00:48:39,748 --> 00:48:42,478
Oh, God.
I'll make some tea.

533
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:57,325
Hey, poet!

534
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,860
You're hard to find, man.

535
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:03,131
I've been busy studying.

536
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:06,538
Hey, I found out about the faggot.

537
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,840
The exhibit could be considered
ideological propaganda...

538
00:49:09,912 --> 00:49:11,607
especially with foreigners' help.

539
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,808
At least 10-15 years in jail.

540
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:16,977
They're crazy!

541
00:49:17,052 --> 00:49:19,520
They're not even having
the exhibit...

542
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,453
and I'm not going back there!

543
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:27,826
Are you being recruited
by that faggot?

544
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,525
Nobody recruits me but me!

545
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:36,394
- How beautiful!
- Cool it, let's go.

546
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:37,962
You're so controlling!

547
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,803
Don't be such a queen.

548
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,343
Does this gallery owner
know about art?

549
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:44,879
Well, he likes what I do...

550
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:46,881
but he had some comments.

551
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:51,352
He thinks this isn't
the right moment...

552
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,354
for some of the pieces.

553
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:55,583
What do you mean?

554
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,649
That we have to take some out?

555
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,426
We must be realistic.

556
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:03,659
Like he said,
better some than none.

557
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:05,529
Please, try to understand.

558
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:08,365
Germán, I won't argue anymore.

559
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:11,838
We've fought hard for the exhibit!

560
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:14,501
We can't sell out
for a trip to Mexico.

561
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:19,105
All the pieces must go!
You hear me?

562
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:22,048
Otherwise,
we'll put it up in the street.

563
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:28,479
Now leave, I'm expecting company.

564
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:34,722
I hope your new comrade...

565
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:37,095
helps you get
your feet on the ground.

566
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,656
You hear?

567
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:45,062
Okay.

568
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,836
- Dye and deodorant.
- Forty.

569
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:54,876
Next week,
pantyhose and children's shoes.

570
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,850
I'll come by.

571
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,287
Don't look at me like that.

572
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:07,090
I'm not abusing anyone.

573
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:08,891
Look, it's all high quality.

574
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:13,794
I'm the one taking a chance
with the police.

575
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:15,564
Besides, it's my business.

576
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:17,606
I can't live on candles like you.

577
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:21,632
If they want the good stuff,
they'll have to pay for it!

578
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,178
And that's enough, leave me alone.

579
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,974
Are you okay?

580
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,305
What do you think?

581
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:58,636
I wanted to thank you.

582
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:06,176
Come and have coffee
or coconut dessert.

583
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,128
I really enjoy life.

584
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:23,797
There's no reason to kill myself.

585
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:26,340
It really was an accident.

586
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:28,968
With a knife, peeling potatoes.

587
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,874
Both wrists?

588
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:33,847
It was double-edged.

589
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:38,412
I'm glad you're okay then.

590
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:42,082
Of course I'm okay.
I have your blood.

591
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:44,853
- Diego said you tried...
- Don't believe him.

592
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,485
He's a liar.

593
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,763
But he was so caring and scared.

594
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,097
He needs me alive.

595
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:56,126
Are you close friends?

596
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:00,107
I'm in the League...

597
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:03,110
but he's getting me some books.

598
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:06,511
The Communist League?
I better put on some music.

599
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:08,311
Since you're Vigilance here...

600
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,113
I wanted to ask you...

601
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:13,484
What's Diego like,
you know, politically?

602
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,490
- You shouldn't visit him.
- Why?

603
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,527
It's not good for you.

604
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:21,859
He's a great person,
a wonderful guy.

605
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:23,921
I love him like a brother.

606
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,661
Nancy, do you have my scissors?

607
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:29,067
Diego!
We were just talking about you!

608
00:53:29,138 --> 00:53:31,038
You were? Hey...

609
00:53:31,106 --> 00:53:34,132
I didn't know you were here.
I was waiting for you.

610
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:37,303
Well, thanks for the coffee.

611
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,908
Thanks for checking on me, David.

612
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,653
Stay away from him, you slut!

613
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:08,534
What sad music.

614
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:12,269
Of course it is.
It was composed by...

615
00:54:12,347 --> 00:54:15,009
Ignacio Cervantes
when he had to leave Cuba...

616
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:19,315
or rather,
when the Spaniards kicked him out.

617
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:21,583
That's why it's called...

618
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:23,488
"Farewell to Cuba."

619
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,420
This one is called...

620
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,020
"Los Illusions."

621
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:09,036
Damn it.
Why are you like that?

622
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,662
Like what?

623
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,234
Do you have family?

624
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,141
I didn't come out of nowhere.

625
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:18,873
For sure they rejected you.

626
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,780
No, I'm Mom's favorite son.

627
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:27,254
But your father
didn't care for you and left you?

628
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:33,259
Dad's a saint.

629
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:37,822
I was taught not to speak
with my mouth full.

630
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:41,996
I have his eyes.
Thank God, because...

631
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,630
Mom's a saint,
but she looks like a toad.

632
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:46,765
Then what happened?

633
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:50,903
- Why are you...?
- A fag? Because.

634
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:52,378
And my family knows.

635
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:55,350
It's their fault.

636
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:57,442
Who says?

637
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,283
Why not take you to a doctor?
It's in the glands.

638
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:04,951
Please, David!

639
00:56:05,594 --> 00:56:07,323
What a theory...

640
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:09,523
coming from a University student.

641
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:11,259
You like women...

642
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,631
and I like men.

643
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,329
It's perfectly normal.

644
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:18,601
Since the beginning of time.

645
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:20,141
I'm still decent...

646
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,197
and patriotic.

647
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:22,607
But not revolutionary.

648
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:26,770
Who says I'm not?

649
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:35,221
I've had illusions too, David.

650
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,589
When I was 14, I volunteered
for the Literacy Campaign.

651
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:41,722
I picked coffee in the mountains.

652
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:43,822
I wanted to become a teacher...

653
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,526
and what happened?

654
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:50,038
This is a thinking head
but if you don't always say yes...

655
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:53,006
or you think differently,
you're ostracized.

656
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:56,340
What ideas are you talking about?

657
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:59,312
Setting up exhibits
with those horrible pieces?

658
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:01,349
- What do you believe in?
- Cuba.

659
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:03,646
So do I.

660
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,051
So that people know
what's good about it.

661
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:08,985
I don't want Americans
or anybody...

662
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:11,287
coming here telling us what to do!

663
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,420
All right.
But with your posturing...

664
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,555
nobody can take you seriously.

665
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:18,497
Yes, you've read
all those books...

666
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:20,194
but all you think of is men.

667
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:24,500
I think about men
when I need it...

668
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:26,734
like you do about women!

669
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:34,005
And I don't posture
and I'm not a clown.

670
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:37,347
Of course, to you,
anyone different is.

671
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:41,583
Because a guy on a street corner
saying "Hey, man, what's up?"...

672
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,090
is normal to you.

673
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:45,591
But I am not.

674
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:48,562
To accept me,
they have to say I'm sick.

675
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,325
Fuck it, I'm not!

676
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:56,633
Go ahead...

677
00:57:57,806 --> 00:57:59,364
laugh at me...

678
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:00,908
I laugh at you too.

679
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:05,776
I'm part of this country,
like it or not!

680
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:08,145
And I have the right
to work for its future.

681
00:58:08,216 --> 00:58:11,743
I'm not leaving Cuba
even if they burn my ass!

682
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:15,813
Without me, you're missing
a piece, you stupid shit!

683
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:19,756
- Dieguito!
- Keep the fucking scissors!

684
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:31,836
Now, please leave.

685
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:10,476
If you don't want me
to burn you up...

686
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,703
make him come back!

687
01:00:01,463 --> 01:00:04,660
Be reasonable
or I won't go to Mexico...

688
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:06,325
and you know I want to!

689
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:09,598
Are you an artist or a tourist?

690
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:13,072
You know
I'm more of an artist than you!

691
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:14,972
What's more, I did this alone.

692
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:17,443
I'm not kidding!
Leave that.

693
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,412
They are mine!

694
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:22,507
Give me that!
The show must be complete!

695
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:25,085
I can't stand you!

696
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:27,781
You're crazy, damn it!

697
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:30,420
This is definitely over!

698
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:32,653
Of course, it's over!

699
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,659
The sculptures are mine!

700
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,937
Always...

701
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:42,022
Hello.

702
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:01,181
Shit! What happened here?

703
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,240
You don't want to know.

704
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:08,220
You wrote these?

705
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:11,282
Look, they're some
of the first things I've written.

706
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,156
They're just drafts.

707
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:16,664
I have better things
but I can't find them.

708
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:19,029
- Give them to me.
- Don't show anyone.

709
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,829
I promise.

710
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:24,531
A friend typed it,
so any misspellings...

711
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:25,903
Give them to me.

712
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:28,442
What's important is the content.

713
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,102
The rest is irrelevant.

714
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:33,238
I'll read it tonight.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

715
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:36,682
We'll see if you deserve
the lunch a la Lezama.

716
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:40,585
- Did you like the Zenea.
- Yes, I have it right here.

717
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:44,147
It's amazing Cubans
wrote like that in the 1800s.

718
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:46,193
I'll put it right here.

719
01:02:57,605 --> 01:02:59,129
What are you doing, dear?

720
01:02:59,207 --> 01:03:00,572
Don't be rude.

721
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:02,974
Wait until I show it to you.

722
01:03:03,044 --> 01:03:04,272
Who's this to?

723
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:07,838
A gallery director,
with many copies sent.

724
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,076
What for?

725
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,311
To tell him a few things...

726
01:03:11,386 --> 01:03:13,684
he needs to be told.

727
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:15,689
They rejected the exhibit again?

728
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:18,419
Worse than that.
They <i>bought</i> him.

729
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:30,967
Well, it's for the best.

730
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,337
It would have meant trouble
for you.

731
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,503
Thanks.

732
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:40,844
But they'll be stunned
when they receive my letter.

733
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:44,442
When will they understand
that art is one thing...

734
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:46,180
and propaganda another?

735
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:48,188
If they don't want to think...

736
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:51,885
there's TV, newspapers,
radio and the rest.

737
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,224
Somebody has to tell them.

738
01:03:54,295 --> 01:03:56,525
- But why you?
- Why not?

739
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:59,498
He's taken a wrong road...

740
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:02,730
the exhibit, the communist kid.

741
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:05,170
You know I feel things.

742
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:09,275
Help him. You won't regret it.

743
01:04:30,665 --> 01:04:32,223
<i>The weak submit...</i>

744
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,291
<i>while the strong go forward.</i>

745
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:38,203
<i>This is a task for the strong.</i>
<i>José Marti.</i>

746
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:52,083
Well...

747
01:04:52,153 --> 01:04:54,587
How are things
back at the commune?

748
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,481
Why do you say that?

749
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,255
Because of this.

750
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,489
It's no good?

751
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:07,762
It's just not literature.
No life in it.

752
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:09,394
Only slogans.

753
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:13,737
You only forgot the proper term
for "former" is "muzhik."

754
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:17,608
You didn't like any of them.

755
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,909
Not even the one
about the strikers?

756
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:21,414
That's the worst.

757
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:25,476
Where did you hear that sugar
subsidy was in Machado's time?

758
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,889
The spelling mistakes and typos...

759
01:05:28,957 --> 01:05:32,188
made by your typist friend
are in red.

760
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:35,954
It looks like measles.

761
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:58,216
But don't feel bad, dear.

762
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:03,523
You have talent.

763
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,287
Among all the rubbish
are some nuggets of pure gold.

764
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:12,558
Think so?

765
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:14,924
Of course.

766
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:16,868
And you've found
the right teacher.

767
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,530
I mean...

768
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,665
if you accept me as a tutor.

769
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:24,740
All right.

770
01:06:24,812 --> 01:06:26,575
But one condition:

771
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:30,047
Forget the exhibit,
don't send the letter.

772
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,383
Bye-bye, exhibit.

773
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,291
We live in one of the world's
most beautiful cities.

774
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:41,961
You can still enjoy it...

775
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,590
before it collapses in shit.

776
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:47,999
Don't be unfair,
there are too many things...

777
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:50,435
They're letting it collapse,
you know it!

778
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,704
We're small and struggling.

779
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:57,541
But it doesn't pain them
to see the city this way.

780
01:06:57,612 --> 01:07:00,080
Some care.
You and I care.

781
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:52,783
Aren't they Cubans?

782
01:08:58,733 --> 01:08:59,893
Look, Diego...

783
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:02,128
you can't judge the Revolution...

784
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:03,465
through <i>your</i> experience.

785
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:06,735
Look at me, I study
in the University and who am I?

786
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:08,070
A peasant's son.

787
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:10,007
Like Stalin.

788
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:11,045
Seriously...

789
01:09:11,112 --> 01:09:14,343
all we want
is to be independent...

790
01:09:14,415 --> 01:09:15,746
to do whatever we want.

791
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,978
They can't stand it,
same as you...

792
01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:19,485
but as a nation.

793
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,489
Understood.

794
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:23,888
It's a whole campaign.

795
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,420
Hungary in 1956,
Czechoslovakia in '68, Stalin.

796
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:32,125
How does it concern us?

797
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,191
World War II was in 1945.

798
01:09:34,268 --> 01:09:35,997
Stalin died in 1953.

799
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,594
I wasn't even born yet.

800
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,299
Americans should be reminded...

801
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:42,434
that Truman Capote
dropped the "A" bomb.

802
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,603
Harry Truman, rather.

803
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:47,113
Truman Capote never; he was gay.

804
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:49,149
Don't justify Stalin with Truman.

805
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:53,313
It's sad, mistakes happen
like sending Pablo Milanés...

806
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:55,379
to the UMAP camps.

807
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:56,946
There were many more.

808
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,889
That's over now!

809
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,155
Only the famous ones were freed.

810
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:02,787
Is that a way to educate us?

811
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:04,957
That's part of revolution...

812
01:10:05,032 --> 01:10:09,128
but not <i>the</i> Revolution!
Understand?

813
01:10:09,203 --> 01:10:12,195
Yes, but who pays
for these mistakes?

814
01:10:12,273 --> 01:10:14,070
Who'll speak for them?

815
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:17,373
Someday there'll be
more understanding for everyone.

816
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:19,470
That's why it's a revolution.

817
01:10:20,248 --> 01:10:22,216
So...

818
01:10:22,283 --> 01:10:24,877
Communism will make us fags happy?

819
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:29,621
Yes, homosexuals
and non-homosexuals.

820
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:34,655
So someday I'll be able
to show any exhibit I want?

821
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,798
And I could say hello
to you in public?

822
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,263
I once had those hopes, David.

823
01:10:47,408 --> 01:10:49,342
But it won't come from heaven.

824
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,378
We must fight...

825
01:10:51,446 --> 01:10:53,073
especially with ourselves.

826
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:55,173
But until then...

827
01:10:56,517 --> 01:10:58,815
at least
inside these four walls...

828
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:00,818
give me a hug?

829
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:04,415
Why does it always
come down to the same thing?

830
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:08,087
You want me to respect you
as you are, but you won't...

831
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:10,027
do the same for me.

832
01:11:11,732 --> 01:11:15,293
It's not a matter of men,
homosexuals or...

833
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,201
I just need it so!

834
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:23,266
I'm afraid.

835
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:30,481
What's wrong?

836
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,382
Tell me...

837
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:33,977
I'm your friend.

838
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:42,054
<i>Militarily and politically...</i>

839
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:45,496
<i>defeated by the Sandinistas,</i>
<i>Somoza flees to the U.S.</i>

840
01:11:47,502 --> 01:11:51,268
<i>Somoza's dynasty was one of the</i>
<i>most brutal tyrannies in America.</i>

841
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,285
Where were you?

842
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:10,418
What's it to you?

843
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:15,723
So you didn't want to deal
with the fag?

844
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:18,264
The fag's name is Diego.

845
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:20,197
Diego?

846
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:22,168
He's no longer the fag,
now he's Diego.

847
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:26,632
He has more guts and principles
than you think.

848
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:28,004
You don't say!

849
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:29,940
So, he's no longer
a counterrevolutionary.

850
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,569
You set him straight?

851
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,474
I can imagine how.

852
01:12:36,918 --> 01:12:40,410
Miguel, try to understand!

853
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:42,285
We must give him a chance.

854
01:12:42,356 --> 01:12:44,586
Yeah? What's this?

855
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:47,457
French communism, Prague spring?

856
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:50,156
Look, David, right there...

857
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:52,358
90 miles away, is the enemy!

858
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:55,334
And the weak and the critics
are on that side.

859
01:12:55,403 --> 01:12:59,601
But we're here,
so why can't he be revolutionary?

860
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:01,733
'Cause it wasn't
rammed up his ass!

861
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,847
Somebody wants you downstairs.

862
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,865
Will you write me?

863
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:43,170
What's wrong with him?

864
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:44,404
It's been hours.

865
01:14:44,478 --> 01:14:47,276
He even asked for a drink
when he came in.

866
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,487
Oh, Diego, he's so cute!

867
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:02,726
Just like a man of the '40s!

868
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:07,364
What's wrong
with paying compliments?

869
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:12,668
- I wanted to ask you for a favor.
- Go ahead.

870
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,914
Get me a bottle of whisky.

871
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:27,047
I finally sold your watch.

872
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:28,816
I didn't get much for it but...

873
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:29,981
Better than nothing.

874
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:34,619
That makes 300 dollars total.
Count it, please.

875
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:38,825
Forget it, honey,
that was one hell of a favor.

876
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:43,893
I can't sell anything else for
you now. It's bad on the street.

877
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:46,906
- How was the meeting?
- Well, they got my letter...

878
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:49,306
They didn't even let me speak.
They fired me.

879
01:15:49,376 --> 01:15:51,810
I can't work
in any cultural agency.

880
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:53,574
What will you do now?

881
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,346
I won't let them get me.

882
01:15:57,418 --> 01:15:59,716
I have a surprise for them.

883
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,584
Diego!

884
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:05,858
I got the interview
with the embassy!

885
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:07,393
That's great!

886
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:11,226
But, Diego...

887
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,601
Keep this
in case they search here.

888
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:23,870
That serious?

889
01:16:23,944 --> 01:16:26,037
You shouldn't have sent
those letters.

890
01:16:27,882 --> 01:16:29,679
This is for a present for David.

891
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,277
What?
You'll need hard currency, honey.

892
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,618
He needs clothes
for the lunch a la Lezama.

893
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:39,022
That's at least 100 dollars!
You're crazy!

894
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:40,788
He deserves it.

895
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:42,488
He's talented and works hard.

896
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:45,726
Sure. Germán too
and look at what he did!

897
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,563
But he has it!

898
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:50,263
To be an artist
one needs more than talent!

899
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:53,862
By the way.

900
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:58,537
Don't tell him anything,
not even a hint.

901
01:16:58,612 --> 01:17:01,843
I'll tell him I asked
for a leave of absence.

902
01:17:04,885 --> 01:17:07,615
He shouldn't come so often...

903
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,747
being a communist and all.

904
01:17:09,824 --> 01:17:12,315
One day he'll realize that.

905
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:15,021
You're very interested
in my dumping him.

906
01:17:15,095 --> 01:17:17,256
Me? Why?

907
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:19,060
To pick him up.

908
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:22,198
I've seen you looking at him.

909
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:23,793
Okay, I'm leaving.

910
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,203
<i>Water that you mustn't drink</i>

911
01:17:27,474 --> 01:17:29,840
If you go to jail,
that's your problem.

912
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:33,346
The favor has to do with him.

913
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:36,349
He's never gone to bed
with a woman.

914
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:40,545
So?

915
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,554
Why don't you initiate him?

916
01:17:46,493 --> 01:17:48,358
How dare you!

917
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:49,760
Who do you think I am?

918
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:53,766
- Forgive me, you're wrong.
- I'm no whore!

919
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:56,064
You've misunderstood me!

920
01:17:56,136 --> 01:17:58,969
I understand perfectly!
Let him fuck a fish!

921
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:00,836
And don't count on me anymore!

922
01:18:01,742 --> 01:18:03,903
Please, let me explain!

923
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:06,071
Don't explain anything.

924
01:18:19,193 --> 01:18:20,854
You have a better idea?

925
01:18:20,928 --> 01:18:22,520
So I like the boy.
So what?

926
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,550
<i>Lonely spirit...</i>

927
01:19:21,622 --> 01:19:23,920
<i>get into David Alvarez's heart...</i>

928
01:19:23,991 --> 01:19:28,360
<i>Don't let any woman,</i>
<i>black, white, Chinese or mulatto...</i>

929
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:31,421
<i>be with him.</i>
<i>Tie him to me.</i>

930
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:35,867
<i>I'll drink his heart's blood</i>
<i>and take his heart from him.</i>

931
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:38,097
<i>Make him come to my feet...</i>

932
01:19:38,172 --> 01:19:42,768
<i>like our Lord Jesus came</i>
<i>to Pontius Pilate's feet.</i>

933
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,618
Oh, sweet Virgin!

934
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:34,324
Help me control myself!

935
01:20:35,696 --> 01:20:37,960
And don't tell your pal
at my place.

936
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:21,170
- What am I doing here?
- You're not here.

937
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:22,868
It's a dream.

938
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:24,604
You're dreaming about me.

939
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:29,246
And Diego?

940
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:32,945
Why include Diego in this dream?

941
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:36,352
He left.

942
01:21:36,423 --> 01:21:38,914
He asked me to feed you
and take you out.

943
01:21:40,594 --> 01:21:43,859
- Take me out?
- Yes, take you out.

944
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:45,421
Well, do it.

945
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:53,768
- Aren't they pretty?
- Beautiful.

946
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:55,706
I'm always giving myself flowers.

947
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:59,542
When I'm happy and when I'm sad.

948
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:05,011
You were dead yesterday.

949
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:07,144
But alive today.

950
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:09,018
That's dialectics.

951
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,885
What do you want
to know about me?

952
01:22:15,896 --> 01:22:17,830
Your family, anything.

953
01:22:17,898 --> 01:22:20,765
They live in Cabaiguán,
I was born there.

954
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:22,768
Look how pretty the sea is.

955
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:25,697
When is your birthday?

956
01:22:25,772 --> 01:22:28,935
I'm Pisces, and you?
No, don't tell me.

957
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:31,133
You're Virgo.

958
01:22:31,211 --> 01:22:33,839
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

959
01:22:35,749 --> 01:22:38,411
Virgo men and Pisces women
get along very well.

960
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:42,180
- Where do you work?
- Let me see your hand!

961
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:45,623
- The left or the right?
- The right.

962
01:22:45,692 --> 01:22:47,353
The left
is what you are born with.

963
01:22:47,427 --> 01:22:49,418
The right,
what you achieve in life.

964
01:22:51,165 --> 01:22:53,599
What do you see?

965
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:55,897
Your intelligence line.

966
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:57,402
Look, very deep.

967
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:00,930
This is your love life.

968
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:03,909
I see a love ending here...

969
01:23:05,245 --> 01:23:08,874
another beginning suddenly
that drives you crazy.

970
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:12,886
- The ferry! Let's go.
- Okay.

971
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,022
Well...

972
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:54,160
This is it.

973
01:23:55,662 --> 01:23:58,096
We had a very beautiful day...

974
01:23:58,165 --> 01:24:00,963
although you have talked
very little.

975
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:02,763
I've had a nice time.

976
01:24:02,836 --> 01:24:05,737
I was feeling bad
but today I feel better.

977
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:10,671
May I come in?

978
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:12,904
It's too late.

979
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,038
Come on!

980
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:15,342
No, no, no.

981
01:24:16,516 --> 01:24:18,313
See you tomorrow.

982
01:24:19,519 --> 01:24:20,611
Good night.

983
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:39,131
Santa Barbara,
don't let me screw up!

984
01:24:40,374 --> 01:24:41,898
Nancy...

985
01:24:41,975 --> 01:24:44,239
Nancy, I know you're home.

986
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:46,108
I didn't mean to offend you.

987
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:47,646
Open up.

988
01:24:47,714 --> 01:24:50,842
I did myself in
and left a note blaming you.

989
01:24:50,917 --> 01:24:53,181
Don't do anything crazy!

990
01:24:53,253 --> 01:24:57,155
Nancy, look, I feel bad
and I don't want to be alone.

991
01:24:57,224 --> 01:24:58,919
Get your little friend then.

992
01:25:00,193 --> 01:25:01,888
I brought you some rice pudding.

993
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:20,377
- I'm going to do it.
- What?

994
01:25:21,548 --> 01:25:22,947
Go to bed with David.

995
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,782
Forget I asked you to do that.
I really want you to change.

996
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:29,549
I won't do it because you asked.

997
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:32,148
I want him to learn
about love through me.

998
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:34,455
Are you in love with him?

999
01:25:35,495 --> 01:25:37,895
Handsome, we have recreated...

1000
01:25:37,964 --> 01:25:41,229
the banquet
that Dona Augusta gives...

1001
01:25:41,301 --> 01:25:43,769
in the pages of <i>Paradise.</i>

1002
01:25:43,837 --> 01:25:48,797
The most glorious novel
ever written on this island.

1003
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:51,969
Chapter 7, Cuban edition.

1004
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,780
Now, you will soon belong...

1005
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:58,113
to the fraternity
of Lezama's worshippers.

1006
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:02,153
Once you read it,
you too will understand.

1007
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,317
It's a gift.

1008
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:08,259
A first edition,
signed by its author.

1009
01:26:17,337 --> 01:26:18,269
A toast.

1010
01:26:18,338 --> 01:26:23,037
To the "lazy shrimp
and flaming baroque!"

1011
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,908
No, seriously.
To friendship.

1012
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:31,007
- And to love.
- Yes, love!

1013
01:26:43,663 --> 01:26:47,565
- I'm leaving. It's late.
- What do you mean?

1014
01:26:47,634 --> 01:26:50,831
Diego, don't go, please.

1015
01:26:50,904 --> 01:26:53,202
I have an appointment,
I'm sorry.

1016
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:57,805
I'll leave this with you.
Have a good time.

1017
01:26:57,878 --> 01:26:59,846
Have you got your passport?

1018
01:26:59,913 --> 01:27:01,141
What passport?

1019
01:27:01,214 --> 01:27:05,446
No, his I.D. card.
That's what he calls it.

1020
01:27:08,922 --> 01:27:11,447
Listen to this.
I was saving it for you.

1021
01:27:14,327 --> 01:27:15,726
Give me a drink?

1022
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:36,141
Behave! And if you want
to misbehave, wait for me.

1023
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,021
Listen to that!

1024
01:27:48,295 --> 01:27:49,660
Let's dance...

1025
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:50,957
Come on.

1026
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:46,578
I want to kiss you.

1027
01:29:02,269 --> 01:29:03,759
Where do these stairs go?

1028
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:20,074
What do they say, Godfather?

1029
01:30:24,484 --> 01:30:25,917
My life?

1030
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:28,720
My age?

1031
01:30:29,889 --> 01:30:31,584
Age doesn't exclude love.

1032
01:30:32,592 --> 01:30:33,684
My past?

1033
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:35,951
I'll explain...

1034
01:30:37,364 --> 01:30:39,457
and he'll understand.

1035
01:30:39,532 --> 01:30:41,363
He'll know...

1036
01:30:41,434 --> 01:30:43,368
there's something clean
inside me...

1037
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:45,870
that nobody can dirty.

1038
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:47,873
That's what I offer him...

1039
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:50,068
you know it.

1040
01:30:53,446 --> 01:30:55,346
Don't take him away.

1041
01:30:58,685 --> 01:31:00,778
Don't let her take him away.

1042
01:31:05,558 --> 01:31:06,525
Diego, right?

1043
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:13,995
I'm a friend of David.

1044
01:31:16,836 --> 01:31:17,962
May I come in?

1045
01:31:19,372 --> 01:31:20,396
Come in.

1046
01:31:52,372 --> 01:31:54,465
These are for Diego.

1047
01:31:56,776 --> 01:31:58,209
Aren't they pretty?

1048
01:32:00,947 --> 01:32:03,108
And look, for you.

1049
01:32:07,387 --> 01:32:09,014
Kick him out of college?

1050
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:11,717
Do you know
what you're asking me?

1051
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:13,349
Take it easy.

1052
01:32:13,426 --> 01:32:16,088
Don't get nervous.
It isn't about you.

1053
01:32:16,162 --> 01:32:18,096
It's better if you sign this.

1054
01:32:18,164 --> 01:32:19,859
I told you I won't sign anything!

1055
01:32:19,933 --> 01:32:21,525
And please leave!

1056
01:32:24,137 --> 01:32:26,731
Hey, keep it down.

1057
01:32:26,806 --> 01:32:30,139
- I know what you're doing.
- I do what I feel like doing!

1058
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:33,641
And I told you to leave!

1059
01:32:33,713 --> 01:32:35,408
A scandal would ruin you.

1060
01:32:35,482 --> 01:32:37,973
Do you think
I'm afraid of scandals?

1061
01:32:40,487 --> 01:32:42,148
You want a scandal?

1062
01:32:42,222 --> 01:32:46,215
David is forty times
the man you are!

1063
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:47,919
Look how he defends his man!

1064
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:50,155
Man, my ass, you faggot!

1065
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:53,026
I've had it!

1066
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:55,493
Take it easy, girl.

1067
01:32:57,203 --> 01:32:59,296
What's going on here?

1068
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,735
Let me go, David!

1069
01:33:03,643 --> 01:33:05,338
This won't end here!

1070
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,209
I wanted to catch you
bringing flowers to your lady.

1071
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:13,514
- This is not over, you hear?
- What's not over?

1072
01:33:13,586 --> 01:33:15,451
You're both faggots.

1073
01:33:16,923 --> 01:33:18,618
You'll pay for this, David.

1074
01:34:15,415 --> 01:34:17,747
I thought things
had to be clear between us.

1075
01:34:19,652 --> 01:34:22,052
Why were you in a diplomatic car?

1076
01:34:27,227 --> 01:34:28,387
I'm leaving the country.

1077
01:34:31,097 --> 01:34:32,223
Oh, yes?

1078
01:34:40,173 --> 01:34:42,164
What are you doing?

1079
01:34:42,242 --> 01:34:45,006
Not because I want to;
they're kicking me out.

1080
01:34:45,078 --> 01:34:47,342
Who is?

1081
01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:48,778
The exhibit...

1082
01:34:48,848 --> 01:34:51,078
the letter I sent...
All that got too far.

1083
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:52,879
Nobody is kicked out for that.

1084
01:34:52,952 --> 01:34:54,647
No? Look.

1085
01:34:56,723 --> 01:34:59,954
Do you think that
with these reports in my record...

1086
01:35:00,026 --> 01:35:02,426
someone will give me a job?

1087
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:04,963
Only in agriculture
or construction.

1088
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:08,000
And what do I do
with a brick in my hand, what?

1089
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:14,532
I thought I could speak out...

1090
01:35:14,607 --> 01:35:15,801
but no.

1091
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:20,276
You people decide
what is "revolutionary."

1092
01:35:20,346 --> 01:35:21,813
You can't leave!

1093
01:35:21,881 --> 01:35:24,247
You'll have
the same problems there.

1094
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:29,247
Do you think I'm leaving
because I want to?

1095
01:35:29,322 --> 01:35:32,291
Can't you see I have no options?
No other choice!

1096
01:35:37,096 --> 01:35:39,690
I have only one life, David.

1097
01:35:39,766 --> 01:35:42,257
And I want to do things...

1098
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:44,326
make plans, like everybody else.

1099
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:48,505
Be what I am, damn it!

1100
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:50,838
Why shouldn't I have that right?

1101
01:35:51,811 --> 01:35:53,142
Let me try it...

1102
01:35:53,212 --> 01:35:54,702
at least.

1103
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:32,850
Isn't it wonderful?

1104
01:36:40,393 --> 01:36:42,486
Let me have a good look.

1105
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:45,224
It's my last chance.

1106
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:49,164
Why the last?

1107
01:37:03,282 --> 01:37:05,216
Do you know
what my enemies call me?

1108
01:37:06,152 --> 01:37:08,177
The Red Queer...

1109
01:37:08,254 --> 01:37:10,245
because I've spent
so much time with you.

1110
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:15,325
Others think you recruited me...

1111
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:18,364
that I'm actually a Mata Hari
going to Europe.

1112
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:22,657
So, how did you become a fag?

1113
01:37:22,735 --> 01:37:24,066
Are you crazy?

1114
01:37:24,137 --> 01:37:26,105
If you knew you'd freak.

1115
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,571
You tell me...

1116
01:37:29,642 --> 01:37:31,269
What was your first time like?

1117
01:37:31,344 --> 01:37:33,073
You can't fool me.

1118
01:37:33,146 --> 01:37:37,674
The face of an angel,
but a devil in bed, I bet!

1119
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,945
- If you only knew.
- Go on, tell me.

1120
01:37:41,587 --> 01:37:43,020
You won't believe this.

1121
01:37:43,089 --> 01:37:44,613
My first time was with Nancy.

1122
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,954
No! Impossible.

1123
01:37:47,026 --> 01:37:49,153
Such an attractive guy!

1124
01:37:49,228 --> 01:37:52,857
- Guess where?
- At Nancy's, right?

1125
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:54,661
At the hideaway, in your bed!

1126
01:37:54,734 --> 01:37:56,827
Shame on you two!

1127
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:09,974
- And what will you do now?
- About what?

1128
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:12,310
Nancy.

1129
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,988
I like her a lot.

1130
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,824
Nancy is a little sparrow.

1131
01:38:20,893 --> 01:38:23,191
She seems strong and bright.

1132
01:38:23,262 --> 01:38:24,593
But she's a sparrow...

1133
01:38:24,664 --> 01:38:26,859
that anybody can hurt.

1134
01:38:28,935 --> 01:38:30,232
Nobody will.

1135
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,760
She's with me.

1136
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:42,470
If you knew how delicious
a woman can be.

1137
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:45,674
How disgusting!

1138
01:39:17,016 --> 01:39:19,143
It's the only good thing
they make here!

1139
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,947
A strawberry!

1140
01:39:23,022 --> 01:39:25,547
Today is my lucky day!

1141
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:26,751
Anybody want one?

1142
01:39:28,961 --> 01:39:31,122
You're so beautiful.

1143
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:33,495
The only problem is
you're not gay.

1144
01:39:36,269 --> 01:39:37,531
Nobody's perfect.

1145
01:39:57,857 --> 01:40:00,121
I'm not as noble as you think.

1146
01:40:12,538 --> 01:40:15,371
When we met in Coppelia,
I was with Germán.

1147
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:21,973
And I bet him
I'd get you into bed.

1148
01:40:26,085 --> 01:40:28,781
Spilling the coffee on you
was part of the plan.

1149
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:32,346
Your shirt outside
signalled victory.

1150
01:40:36,362 --> 01:40:38,557
Then Germán spread the word.

1151
01:40:40,866 --> 01:40:43,130
And I didn't say anything...

1152
01:40:43,202 --> 01:40:45,762
because I liked
being associated with you.

1153
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:55,738
I didn't realize I could harm you.

1154
01:41:00,052 --> 01:41:01,314
That's why...

1155
01:41:02,722 --> 01:41:05,247
That's why I asked
for a hug so often.

1156
01:41:06,792 --> 01:41:10,091
I thought hugging you...

1157
01:41:10,162 --> 01:41:12,130
would make me feel cleaner.

1158
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:26,769
I love you very much, David.

1159
01:41:30,816 --> 01:41:32,408
What can I do?
