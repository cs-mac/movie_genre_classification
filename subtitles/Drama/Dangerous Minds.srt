1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,213
As I walk through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,550
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothin' left

3
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,219
'Cause I been blastin'
and laughin' so long

4
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,389
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

5
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,225
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,061
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,022
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,985
On my knees in the night
sayin' prayers in the street light

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:13,824
Been spending most their lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

10
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:19,830
They been spending most their lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

11
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:25,836
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

12
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:31,341
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

13
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,178
Look at the situation
they got me facin'

14
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,181
I can't live with no hope
I was raised by the state

15
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,184
So I gotta be down
with the hood team

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,228
Took much television-watchin'
got me chasin' dreams

17
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,273
I'm a educated fool
with money on my mind

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,234
Got my tin in my hand
and a gleam in my eye

19
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,279
I'm a loc'd out gangsta
set trippin' banga

20
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,990
And my homies is down
So don't arouse my anger

21
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,035
Fool, death ain't nothin'
but a heartbeat away

22
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,413
I'm livin' life do or die
What can I say

23
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,416
I'm 23, never will I live
to see 24

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,877
The way things is goin'
I don't know

25
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:12,883
Tell me why are we
so blind to see

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,015
That the ones we hurt
are you and me

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,979

We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

30
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:43,622
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

31
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,708
Power and the money
Money and the power

32
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,753
Minute after minute
Hour after hour

33
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,007
Everybody's runnin', but half
of them ain't looked what's
goin' on in the kitchen

34
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,592
But I don't know what's cookin'

35
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,637
They say I got to learn
but nobody's here to teach me

36
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,890
lf they can't understand it
how can they reach me

37
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,184
I guess they can't
I guess they won't

00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,634
Oh, God, is that today?
Hal, it's-it's not a good time.

46
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,720
Well, she came in.

00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,472
All right. Uh, I'm gonna have to

48
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,393
Louanne, I'd like you to meet, uh,

Oh. No, only-- only good.

56

And I must say, it-it isn't often
that we have an applicant...

57
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,797

60
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,682
- You don't look like a Marine.

61
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,809
Long sleeves. Hides the tattoos.

Uh, fully accredited, except for one
term of, of supervised student teaching.

63
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,907
Why did you stop so close
to being certified?

64
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,161
Well, I met my husband and
started working for his company.

65
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,663
Uh, w-we're divorcing.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,170
W-Well, it would be no problem to
get you emergency certification.

67
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,465

- Start?

68

69
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,512
Miss Johnson,
I'lI-I'll cut to the chase.

70
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,266
One of our, uh, academy
teachers, Mrs. Shepherd, left,

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,061
and since then we've had
three substitute teachers.

72
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,982
The last one, Mrs. Gingrich,
fell ill just this morning.

73
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,485
So we have a fulI-time position

00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,381
Uh, special kids. Passionate,

91
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,254
I'm afraid Mrs. Gingrich
is no longer with us.

92
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,925
- Carla, they--

93
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,595

00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,263

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,224

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,725
Thank you.

97
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,770
- Full time.

98
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,357
-Hal!
-Louanne, d-did she t-tell you
about, uh, the academy programme?

99
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,025
Yeah, yeah. No,
she told me all about it.

100
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,528
She said, you know,

101
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,947

00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:49,451

I'll know who to ask, right?
- Yeah. I'll be counting on it.

103
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,040
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

104
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,584
Save me

105
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,462
Just another young nigger
havin' thangs

106
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,465
Just a-havin' thangs

107
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,677
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

108
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,679
Why must I feel like that

109
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,725
Just another young nigger
havin' thangs

110
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,731
lt's to your right.

111
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,821
I guess Miss Shepherd's lesson
plans will be in her desk.

112
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,241
Very possibly.

113
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,457
This is your classroom.

114
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,549
- Noisy bunch, aren't they?
- Yes, but if you stand there
long enough,

115
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,342
they'll usually quiet down.

116
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,344
Don't try and shout over them.

117
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,264
Right. Thanks.

118
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,187
Louanne.

119
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,023
- I'm right next door.
- I wrote this about my life because
it's my shit you never heard before

120
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,692
- Why don't you live in my world
That's my point that you
been searchin' for

121
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,196
I know that you need to relax
A supported fact

122
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,698
A little history
and history of government--

123
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,867
lmmobilizing your physical
and your brain

124
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,869
With the emotion
of subliminal motivation

125
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,414
- Look at that!
- No, no, no. Not yours.

126
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,084
- White bread.
- Snappin' my fingers
appropriately when I rip

127
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,129
You get flipped and then I pass
the microphone to my homegirl Chris

128
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,799
Now I see you runnin'
I'm comin', boom, how stunnin'

129
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,052
Fast as I step
Got to earn a big rep

130
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,013
For huntin' homies like deer
Crack a beer and some heads

131
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,892
Then go find another poor person
I can trap in my cage for a night

132
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,436
Let loose, fool, run
'Cause my first meal is done

133
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,482
- May I have your attention, please?
- How long y'all been together?

134
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,526
You run, I'll shoot
'Cause your homies said 'boo' to me

135
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,153
Your life is a joke
Smoked by the A to the K

136
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,907
You went to bed without a trace
lnfrared dot marks the spot

137
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,077
-So duck or find your ass shot
-What happened to Miss Shepherd?

138
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,621
- Better not do that.
- What?

139
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:02,918
- What happened to Miss Shepherd?
- Ooh, no, she ain't askin' about
Miss triflin'-ass Shepherd.

140
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,254
You playin' yourself.
Playin' yourself.

141
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,216
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Listen up! Yo, listen up!

White Bread wanna know

143
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,515
We killed the bitch.

144
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,017
Kick it, kick it, kick it,

I was beginning to like

146
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,982
Ohh! No, no, no.
Everybody, everybody. Emilio ate her.

147
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,195
Bullshit.

148
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,581
- That bitch was too ugly to eat.
- Yeah!

149
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,209
Fed her to my dogs.

150
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,011
But I'll eat you.

151
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,648
What is your name?

152
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,484
Emilio Ramirez.

153
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,909
- Now, Emilio!
- Emilio, you in trouble!

154
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,337
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio!

155
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,548
- Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
- Oh, my God.
- What's that?

156
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,551
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. You know
what they're like. Come on.

157
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,639
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!

158
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,033
Madison surrendered
to the nationalists.

159
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,791
Hamilton himself could have already have
composed the message that embraced--

160
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,923
Donna. Donna,
take over the class.

161
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,722
Shut up!

162
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,648
What happened to Miss Shepherd?

163
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,025
- Well, she quit.
- Why?

164
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,320
Well, she was a very
high-strung individual.

165
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,406
What, did she have a breakdown?

166
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,741
No. She quit before that.

167
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,327
One of the substitutes,
she had a breakdown.

168
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,039
- That's how they weed them out.
- Who are these kids, rejects from hell?

169
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,586
No. They're bright kids with
little or no educational skills...

170
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,797
and what we politely call
a lot of social problems.

171
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,799
Damn it, Griffith,
you could've warned me!

172
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,053
Hey, Louanne,
you said you wanted to teach.

173
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,097
- Now, is that a load of bull or what?
- No!

174
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,682
- So teach.
- I ca--
- What?

175
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,101
I can't teach them!

176
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,606
Yes, you can. All you gotta do
is get their attention.

177
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,484
Or quit.

178
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm back!

179
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,733
"She decided that if Brian broke a rule
she would utilize these consequences:

180
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,529
The first time he broke a rule his name
would be put on the board."

181
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,713
This is the life

182
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:24,304
This is the life

183
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,808
This is the life

184
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,522
Okay, you little bastards.

185
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,148
- Come on
- Put your back into it

186
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,358
- Come on
- Put your back into it

187
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,027
- Come on
- Put your back into it

188
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,737
- Come on
- Put your back into it

189
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,407
- Come on
- Put your back into the beat

190
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,075
Achieve the goals
in which you seek

191
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,827
Don't let nobody
steer you wrong

192
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,704
Or you'll be singin'
that same old song

193
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,039
- How someone's always holdin you down
- There she is.

194
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,749
- Just keep your two feet on the ground
- Girl, you didn't get enough yesterday?

195
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,586
And when you come you be direct
'cause punks get no respect

196
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,255
- My eyes to the west side
- East side, west side

197
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,435
How you doin'? Yeah.

198
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,277
Hey, everybody, everybody, look!
A cowboy!

199
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:24,031
Put your back into it
Put your back into it

200
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,994
- Put your back into it
- Don't talk about-- Don't talk
about yourself like that.

201
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,456
"I am a--"

202
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,418
- Shut up! Y'all sound
like them fifth-graders!
- You shut up!

203
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:43,091
"Does... anyone...

204
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,760
know--"

205
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,183
- What's "karate"?
- Karate, you stupid asshole.

206
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,562
- You're so stupid.
- You're a Marine? A for-real Marine?

207
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,857
- Discharged, but yes.
- Estupido.

208
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,860
I'll try some karate
with you, Miss Johnson.

209
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,992
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to touch a student.

210
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,496
But if you really think you know
what you're doin', come on up here.

211
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,666
Hey, sounds like a challenge to me,
ése. You'd better get up there.

212
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,837
Oh, I know what I'm doin'.
There's no sense doin' it though
if you can't touch me.

213
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:25,050
Okay, anybody else know
any karate? What about you?

214
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,554
- Durrell Chang Chang.
- I know some motherfuckin' karate.

215
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,432
Whoo! Durrell, gimme it!

216
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,434
- Durrell.
- Shit.

217
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,150
- What about you? You know any karate?
- Raul. Yeah, I know enough.

218
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,236
- Okay, Raul.
- Go on up there.

219
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,613
Come on up here.

220
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,283
- All right. Yeah, shit. I'm
gonna take that motherfucker.

221
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,160
Shit. All right.
Come on, let's go, ése.

222
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,829
Let's go.

223
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,800
Shit!

224
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,178
You guys--
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

225
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,514
You guys don't know shit.

226
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,225
-"l don't know shit," man.
I know what I'm doin', lady.
-You don't even know any throws.

227
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:20,898
Now, I heard that a Marine
can kill a man with his, uh,
bare hands. ls that true?

228
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,192
Absolutely.

229
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,361
Oh, shit.

230
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,743
Okay, h-here's how it starts.

231
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,496
Um, okay, where's a-- Can you two move
that desk down there a little bit?

232
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,545
Um, okay, everything is
slow motion at first.

233
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,381
- Um, Durrell.
- Yeah.

234
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,427
Okay, you, um, you move into
Raul like you're gonna hit him.

235
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,471
Yeah, I can do that.

236
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,889
- Okay.
- Nacho.

237
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:58,101
Now, Raul, you're gonna
step into Durrell...

238
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,021
and you're gonna
grab his wrist, okay?

239
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:07,236
You're gonna turn your body
away from him so that your butt
is in his stomach. Okay?

240
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,572
Fuck you!
Get the fuck off me, man!

241
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,408
What you gonna do?

242
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,911
- Man, you wish, homes! You wish, man!
- Bring it on, homes!

243
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,497
- Fuck you! Get your hands off me!
- Bring it on, Nacho.
- You wish, man!

244
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:22,209
- Bring it on.
- Now, it's a hip throw.
lt's a hip throw.

245
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,879
- Okay, take your fighting
stance again, okay.
- Nacho.

246
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,131
Okay, grab his wrist.
Okay.

247
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,425
Now, now this time,
as you move in,

248
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:34,096
you're gonna take this hand,
you're gonna grab onto this shoulder.

249
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,098
Okay? Ready?

250
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,309
Oh, shit!

251
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,313
Thank you! Hey! Hey!
All right!

252
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,608
- Ow, man! I'll kick your
motherfuckin' ass, ése!
- Sucker! Sucker!

253
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,327
Well, that was "A" work.

254
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,329
You'd make good Marines.

255
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,042
ln fact, from this moment,

256
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,795
each one of you
is like an inductee...

257
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,215
- Who's a duck?
- with a clean record.
- Quack.

258
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:15,387
- So, if you wanna pass,
- Quack quack.

259
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,389
all you have to do is try.

260
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,395
Oh, homes.

261
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:28,942
Because at this point,
everyone has an "A."

262
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,528
- What?
- ls she serious?

263
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,036
But it's up to you to keep it.

264
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,499
-Bullshit.
-Yo, why don't you shut up, man.

265
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,170
What if it ain't bullshit? Ain't
never had no fuckin' "A" before.

266
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,382
I once knew a man
who couldn't read

267
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,468
He said it ain't no thang
'cause I graduated twice

268
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,844
With the game I possess

269
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,387
Bulletproof vest
to the chest

270
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,890
But when his kids needed help
to prepare for a test

271
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,851
lt was stress 'cause Pops
didn't achieve any academics

272
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,229
And true, indeed
This problem is an epidemic

273
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,649
Who want to work five long hard days
through it and get taxed

274
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,234
So that's a message
for your mind

275
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,820
The story's been told
about a thousand times

276
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,531
So here's a message
for your mind

277
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,825
One thousand-one
One thousand-two

278
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,744
So here's a message
for your mind

279
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,254
Morning.

280
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:38,345
- Okay, today we are going
to conjugate some verbs.
- What?

281
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,514
Hey, what about karate?

282
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, I can't just teach you karate.
I'll show you another hold next week.

283
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,436
Get outta here!

284
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,738
Belt it out, too.
I wanna hear it.

285
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,625
We eat green beans for dinner.
What you do with 'em?

286
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,836
"We eat green beans for dinner."

287
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,756
- Okay--
- Hey, Pam. Pam!

288
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,761
Ye-- Yo, Chris!

289
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,397
Hey. Hey. Hey, what's up?

290
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,448
Hey, man, it's not
a big deal, okay?

291
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,623
ls that true?

292
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,542
lf we wanna die?
Shit, no.

293
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,004
We want you to die.

294
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:58,467
- ls that true?
- Well, if it was between
you and us, hell yeah.

295
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,553
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! I don't care
if I live or die!

296
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,475
- What about that?
- Suicide, man.
- What's all this bullshit with dying?

297
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,646
- You want us dead?
- No, darlin', but I do
want you to keep your "A."

298
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,648
So, no, I'm gonna make it
real easy on you, okay?

299
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:18,028
All you have to do is tell me the verb
that makes this sentence true.

300
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,156
We choose to do some karate.

301
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,076
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, give me a verb
instead of "choose."

302
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,912
- We're going to die?
- We must die, okay.

303
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:31,667
- Okay, "we must die." ls "must"
a verb? Can you, uh--
- No, "must" ain't no verb.

304
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:36,338
- Can you "must" something?
- Yeah. I must piss right now.
You'd better believe it.

305
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:47,015
Okay, what verb that we used
today is the most powerful?

306
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,768
- Die.
- Piss.

307
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,187
Oh, you so stupid!

308
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,150
- Choose.
- Choose.

309
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,027
- What's your name?
- Callie.

310
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,530
Callie, why?

311
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,575
Because that's the difference between
owning your life and being afraid.

312
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,368
Saying "l choose"
no matter what.

313
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,370
You mean, like a guy's got
a gun to your head...

314
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,206
and he's pulling the trigger
and you say, "l choose to die"?

315
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,253
No, you ain't choosin' to die,
but you can choose to die
without screaming, right?

316
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,547
I mean, you could always
choose somethin'.

317
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,883
- Not where I live.
- Shit.

318
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,093
Did you read that somewhere
in this class?

319
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:31,894
No. ln our class we readin' this book
called My Darling, My Hamburger.

320
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,729
- From this.
- My what?

321
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:36,732
- My Darling, My Hamburger.
- Hamburger?

322
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,029
Possessive pronoun, noun,
possessive pronoun.

323
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,907
- Oh, watch it, girl.
- Let's see.

324
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,950
E-Excuse me.

325
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,911
- Excuse me, Miss Johnson.
- Uh-- Oh, yes.

326
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,206
Would you stop by the principaI's office
before your next class, please?

327
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,501
Mr Grandey would like
to speak to you.

328
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,629
The principal!

329
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:02,090
Oooh, White Bread in trouble!

330
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,988
Yes. I'll talk to you later.

331
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,574
Bye-bye.

332
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:31,578
Miss Johnson, this is an office.
We knock before we enter.

333
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,291
Please.

335
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:46,802
Now, Miss Johnson,
I'm taking into consideration
the fact that you're new...

336
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,973
and therefore don't know that teaching
karate is against school policy...

337
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:55,018
and can lead to a lawsuit
in case of an injury.

338
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,313
But you can avoid this kind of error--
you simply follow the curriculum...

339
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,816
dictated by
the Board of Education.

340
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:08,240
Well, um, sir, that's
almost impossible, um--

341
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,952
Most of my students don't
even know what a verb is.

342
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,704
lf you're going to teach them,

343
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,584
I'm sure there's a better sentence
than "We choose to die."

344
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:22,004
I'm sure there are, but I--
I-l needed a sentence that
would get their attention...

345
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,633
- Mmm.
- and, well, it had to
be better than this.

346
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:32,306
Miss Johnson, that is the approved
curriculum for second period.

347
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,600
Your class.

348
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:38,145
Now, I know the newer the teacher,
the smarter she is,

349
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,775
but I-I'm afraid you're just
going to have to go along
with our policies,

350
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,778
even if you don't
agree with them.

351
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,241
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,494
What a fuckin' idiot.

353
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,002
- Griffith.
- Don't let them get to you.

354
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,297
I'm not. I-ln fact, I'm about to
challenge the entire curriculum.

355
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:10,719
- lf I could just find the paper
in the Xerox room.
- You can't. There isn't any.

356
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,388
- What do you mean?
- I mean there isn't any.

357
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:17,684
I mean, we're out of Xerox paper and art
paper and we're short on pencils.

358
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,730
But we do have plenty of students.
I guess that, uh, balances things out.

359
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,901
Thanks.

360
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,827
Another fuckin' idiot.

361
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,872
No, I can't run, I can't hide
from all this pressure

362
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,084
lf I sell out, that means
I'm coppin' to a lesser charge

363
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,170
- And whenever there's a will
baby, there's a way
- Shit!

364
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,215
Each one teach one I always say
the murder rate is risin'

365
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:52,427
Society ain't scarin' me
Life is like a puzzle
Ain't no tellin' when they'll bury me

366
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:56,390
- Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em
- So, what's on today's lesson plan?

367
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:00,435
A little kickboxing?
Some, uh, target practice, huh?

368
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,605
No. My own little
secret weapon.

369
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,525
Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em

370
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,782
Okay, so, "never" is--

371
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,076
- lt's a verb!
- Adverb! Adverb!
- Adverb! Adverb!

372
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,328
Adverb! Fantastic!

373
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,789
- Whoo!
- You guys'll be reading poetry soon.

374
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,333
- You guys are sharp.
- Oh, my--

375
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,169
- Whoa!
- Okay.

376
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,423
- Homeboy!
- King of the calle!

377
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,800
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

378
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,681
- Sit down.
- Honourable sensei. Hmm.

379
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,643
lt's obvious that "homeboy"
is a noun.

380
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,814
Noun is correct!

381
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,734
Well, give me my damn candy bar.

382
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,277
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

383
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:53,655
Boy, poetry will be a piece
of cake for this crowd.

384
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:57,868
Yo, how come you keep sayin' poetry?
What's poetry got to do with this shit?

385
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,704
Poetry? WelI--

386
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,665
Because if you can read poetry,
you can read just about anything, hon.

387
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,419
- When you're ready for poetry,
you're ready for bear.
- I say bring on the bear!

388
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:10,881
- I'm always ready for bear. Shit.
- I'm always ready to see you bare.

389
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:15,093
- Whoa!
- Oh, shut up, you stupid!
- Oh, yeah? Ohh! Ohh!

390
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:19,306
Well, okay, here's the bear.

391
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,476
So what the fuck is that?

392
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:28,398
- I just happen to have copies
of-of-- of a poem...
- Wait for me! Shit!

393
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:32,194
- That's okay.
- written by the greatest poet.

394
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,363
My Darling, My Hamburger.
How's that?

395
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,909
- Okay, here's the deal.
- She was joking about the bear.

396
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:43,288
When we finish this assignment,
I am gonna take...

397
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,165
all of you...

398
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,251
to a place that has...

399
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,963
the highest parachute jumps,

400
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,048
the biggest roller coaster,

401
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,175
the best rides,

402
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:58,011
the most delicious hot dogs,

403
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,763
the hardest games...

404
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,892
and the best prizes
in the world.

405
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,103
- You're kiddin'.
- For real?

406
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,147
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Huh?

407
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,109
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Not a penny.

408
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:15,237
So then, who pays?

409
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,823
The Board of Education.

410
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,075
- Lord, did you hear that?
- I don't believe it.

411
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,913
- Sound good?
- Hey!

412
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,209
That's bullshit, man!

413
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,504
I'm sorry?

414
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,426
Since when has the Board of Education
done anything for us, huh?

415
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:40,429
Yeah, man, we fuckin'
barely get lunch.

416
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,683
Well, I'm sorry you feel
that way, Emilio.

417
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,396
Good.

418
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:53,942
- Uh, Durrell, you wanna read
the first four lines?
- Oh, man, you trippin', man.

419
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,028
I ain't readin'. You trippin'.

420
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,825
- Okay, how about the f--
- You've got to read it.
- How about the first line?

421
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,330
I'm scared to death, motherfucker,
all right? That's all.

422
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,803
- Move slowly to the right, people.
- Yep, yep

423
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,723
Miss Johnson.

424
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,476
- You better be for real.
- Yep, yep

425
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,273
- Yep, yep
- Miss Johnson?

426
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,609
Yes, Callie?

427
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:39,029
lf you wanna get the class
to listen, get Emilio.

428
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,325
- Yep, yep
- lt's all right

429
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,453
- lt's all right
- As you may have heard

430
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,205
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one

431
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,208
- To smoke a fat one
- And drink a Thunderbird

432
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,127
- Drink a Thunderbird
- lt's okay

433
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:57,130
- lt's okay
- To play this loud

434
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:03,178
- Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down
- Wait

435
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,557
- I'll get you, you little fucker.
- Yep

436
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,518
- Poetry?
- Poetry, yeah.

437
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,062
- These kids?
- Why not these kids?

438
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,398
Well, hey, go for it.

439
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,985
No, but I gotta find a gimmick
first, you know. Something
that'll grab their attention.

440
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,195
- Who's your favourite poet, Griffith?
- My favourite?

441
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,156
- Oh, there are so many.
How do I choose?
- I'm serious.

442
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,993
Mmm. Serious. Okay.

443
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,453
- Big D. Dylan.
- Get out!

444
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,455
Why not?

445
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,000
Well, I don-- He's n-- You know,
he's not for everybody.

446
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,044
I mean, he's a little
long-winded, don't you think?

447
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,380
I suppose that's 'cause
he wrote drunk.

448
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,299
He had a drinking problem?

449
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,759
Well, the guy's Welsh.
There ain't a lot to do there.

450
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,179
I thought he was from Minnesota.

451
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:48,473
You know, if the guy's your
favourite poet, you might want
to read up on him a little bit.

452
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,726
He was Welsh and
he drank himself to death.

453
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:54,021
Dead? He's not dead.
I saw him yesterday on MTV.

454
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,775
You saw Dylan Thomas on MTV.

455
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,945
No. Bob Dylan.

456
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,323
Oh--

457
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,576
-Bob Dylan? Ohh!
-He looked dead. He looked dead.

458
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:11,205
- Ohh!
- Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

459
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,458
Play a song for me

460
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:18,253
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man--"

461
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,422
- Tambourine!
- Tambourine!
- Tangerine.

462
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,258
"T-Tambourine Man,

463
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,595
Play a song for me

464
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:30,891
I'm not sleepy and there is
no place I'm going to"

465
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,684
Wow, he can read.

466
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,728
Thank you. Taiwana?

467
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:40,067
The next three lines, Taiwana.

468
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,361
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

469
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,821
Play a song for me

470
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:48,575
ln the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you"

471
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,661
- Good.
- All right.

472
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,621
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

473
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,123
What do you think it means?

474
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,209
What, some guy's
got a tambourine...

475
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:00,754
and this other guy wants him to
play it 'cause he can't sleep.

476
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:03,549
- Okay.
- Yeah, but how come he want
to play the tambourine?

477
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,385
Don't he got a radio or somethin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

478
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:11,431
Well, you kn-- That's a good point.
I mean, i-i-it's-- it's a weird choice.

479
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,894
So, what if I told you
that Mr Tambourine Man...

480
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,771
is a code name?

481
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:21,233
- A code name for what?
- James Bond.

482
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,902
- A drug dealer.
- ls it?

483
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,904
Well, a lot of people think so.

484
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,116
You know, this song is from the '60s,
when you couldn't sing about drugs,

485
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,368
so they had to make up codes.

486
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:36,999
So what was the code?
What does "Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me" mean?

487
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,169
- Well, you figure--
- "Play a song for me"
means "give me the stuff."

488
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,046
Yeah, it's like that nigger
been out drinkin' all night
and smokin' some shit...

489
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,549
and everybody broke out on his
ass, you know what I'm sayin'?

490
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:49,761
And he's high-- he's still high,
but he's kinda low and shaky.
You know-- "jingle-jangle."

491
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:53,182
Yeah, and he needs something, like
a big hit of crack or cocaine and shit.

492
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,350
He's crazy, okay?

493
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,478
So, what do you think, Emilio?
Do you think that Raul is right?

494
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:05,194
- All right, it's too
personal to discuss.
- What?

495
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,655
You mean you choose not to
participate in the discussion?

496
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,075
- Boy's too slick.
- Not about somethin' so personal.

497
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,541
Wanna draw for it?

498
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,710
What?

499
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:25,589
High card, you don't have to
discuss anything.

500
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,344
Why do I gotta draw for it?
That's the way it is now.

501
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,365
Listen to this.

502
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,077
Name one of the most influential
presidents of the 20th century.

503
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:58,080
- Roosevelt.
- Simple, right?

504
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,708
Wrong.
A history teacher's nightmare.

505
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,254
How about Snoop Doggy Dogg
for an answer?

506
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,841
Joe Montana. Winston Churchill.

507
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:14,054
But this-- this is the best.

508
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,183
"l will not answer this question on the
grounds that it is culturally biased...

509
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,727
against individuals
such as myself."

510
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,149
Actually, for this answer I'm
gonna give him partial credit.

511
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,779
Louanne, you lose your
sense of humour, it's over.

512
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,449
Uh, here.
New pictures of the rug rats.

513
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,703
- Oh, God. People are supposed
to ask first, Griffith.
- Shut up.

514
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:43,125
Ohh. They look like Maggie.
Thank God.

515
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:46,795
Oh, I don't know. Harry with his thumb
in his mouth, he kinda looks like me.

516
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,965
ls that his thumb?
I thought that was a cigarette.

517
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,301
- How is Maggie?
- Good.

518
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,469
She wants you to come over
for dinner.

519
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:58,974
We had some fun times, you and Maggie
and me and-- what's his name?

520
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:02,728
- I remember.
- Yeah.

521
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:09,484
I remember too. That's why it's
hard for me to come to dinner.

522
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,989
- Seeing anybody?
- No.

523
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,327
How do you do that? You walk around
with a bag over your head?

524
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,246
- No.
- Louanne, it's over six months.

525
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,248
I'm not ready, Hal.

526
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:31,673
You know, I thought you guys
always stuck together. What are
you sitting here with me for?

527
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:36,803
You know, he was my best friend,
Louanne. "Was" is the operative word.

528
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,599
He isn't worth your spit.

529
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,485
What was that for?

530
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:55,072
Just tell Maggie
she's a lucky lady, Griffith.

531
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,867
Yeah, when they made me they
broke the mold. Both of them.

532
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,165
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

533
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,384
We gotta stop meeting like this.

534
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:21,849
You sound awful.

535
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,600
I refuse to take
medical advice...

536
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:28,188
from somebody who eats Cheetos
at 8:00 in the morning.

537
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:32,234
Yeah, well, you shouldn't smoke.
Listen to that cough!

538
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,404
You know--

539
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,075
- I'll see you inside.
- You're gonna finish
the cigarette, aren't you?

540
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,787
No, I'm not. Really.
Honest. I swear.

541
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,249
Here! Right here! Yeah!

542
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,971
- Guys are off playin' pool.
- You wanna smoke a cigarette?

543
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,807
- I gave you your money, man. 350 bucks!
- Three-fifty?

544
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:06,059
What are you talkin' about, homes?
Are you callin' me a liar?

545
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:09,605
- What, do you think I'm fuckin' stupid?
- Yo, man, no.
Don't get loud, motherfucker!

546
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,482
I'm gonna kick your fuckin'
spic ass!

547
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:15,319
- Fuck you, man!
- Jump back, motherfucker!
- Fight! Fight!

548
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:18,572
- Get back, get back.
- You fuckin' pendejo!
- Okay, okay, okay!

549
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,450
Back off! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

550
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,827
- iPuto!
- One of you makes a move,
I will call security!

551
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,663
- Aw, bullshit!
- Big fuckin' deal.
- They don't care.

552
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:31,460
Okay, get to your classes.
Okay. lt's all over. Move!

553
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,135
-You are stronger than these two
put together, and you know it!
-Bullshit, man!

554
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,678
- iVato!
- He wishes, man!

555
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:50,103
You could all be expelled if I report
this to the office, and you know that.

556
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,858
Okay, if you give me your word that
it ends here, I'll forget it.

557
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,611
ls it over?

558
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,656
Yeah.

559
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,658
How about you?

560
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:05,827
- Yeah, simón.
- Absolutely.

561
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:13,001
Okay, I trust you.
Now get to your classes.

562
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,047
See you later, puto.

563
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,299
Catch you later, ése.

564
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:29,810
lf you hit those kids,
you'll pay for it. I swear.

565
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,112
Get to your class
and behave yourself.

566
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,284
You shouldn't have done that.

567
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,371
- Oh? Why not?
- 'Cause you just shouldn't
mess with Emilio.

568
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,916
Raul knows that if you make a deal
with Emilio and you fuck up on him,

569
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,918
you get your locker smashed in
with your head.

570
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,546
Everybody knows that.

571
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,048
Well, maybe they'll all have
time to think about it...

572
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,884
before they get to
the locker-smashing stage.

573
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,012
They're gonna fight,
no matter what they tell you.

574
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,057
What do you mean?

575
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,727
When? Now?

576
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,565
Where? Angela! Where?

577
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,237
- Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
- Get him!

578
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,739
Keep fightin'!
Keep kickin' his ass!

579
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,410
Shit! Fuck!

580
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,872
Ohh!

581
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,962
Oh, shit.

582
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,551
- Come on! Fuckin' come on!
- Fuck that!

583
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,053
Shit!

584
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,934
Come on, break it up!
Break it up!

585
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,270
- Get the fuck off me!
- Get outta there!
- iPuto! You motherfucker!

586
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,650
Get back! Now!
Get back! Get back!

587
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,110
All of you! Comin' through!

588
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,617
- Watch your head.
- Kickin', man.

589
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:12,120
No. Wait a minute. Wait. No, no.
Gimme-- G-- Just give me a minute.

590
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:17,668
- You promised!
- Yeah, but we had to,

591
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,629
or we couldn't walk around
with our heads up no more.

592
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:24,341
We got a reputation to protect.
You a Marine. You understand.

593
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,593
Like, if America didn't stand up
everyone would attack it.

594
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:29,805
Well, in our neighbourhood if you don't
stand up you can't walk down the street,

595
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,099
'cause everyone will attack you,
you know?

596
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,770
Rata, you fuckin' puto.

597
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,148
- Man, I cracked that
motherfucker's head, ése.
- See you in the fuckin

598
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,737
Okay, I see.

599
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:51,159
And I made it worse and I made you and
Gusmaro look bad in front of everyone...

600
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,495
by saying that Emilio was
stronger than the both of you.

601
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,164
Yeah, well, you thought
you was helpin' us.

602
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,751
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We really have to go.
I gotta get 'em home.

603
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,171
Nasty cut.

604
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,137
You mind telling me what the fight
was about in the first place?

605
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:53,931
Yeah.

606
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:01,688
I really would like to know
what happened. I'm not gonna
make any trouble for you.

607
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,025
- I just wanna know, was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

608
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,195
- Why?
- Because it felt good
hittin' him in the face.

609
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,406
- I got him good, man.
- Yeah, you like to hit people?

610
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,408
Yeah, I like to hit people.

611
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,413
Why?

612
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,124
You feel angry
a lot of the time?

613
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,169
So now you're gonna
try and psychologize me?

614
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,923
You're gonna try and figure
me out? I'll help you.

615
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,093
I come from a broken home,
and we're poor. Okay?

616
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:35,430
I see the same fuckin' movies
you do, man.

617
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,562
I would like to help you,
Emilio.

618
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:45,774
Thank you very much. And how
would you like to do that?

619
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:49,111
You gonna give me some good
advice? "Just say no"?

620
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:52,614
You gonna get me off
the streets? Well, forget it!

621
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:55,826
How the fuck you gonna
save me from my life, huh?

622
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,668
Yep, yep

623
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,671
Karen?

624
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,883
I have three, uh,
student files here...

625
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,261
- and I can't find a phone
number in any of 'em.
- Yep, yep

626
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,638
Well, sometimes they don't
give a number...

627
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,224
- and sometimes
they don't have a phone.
- Yep, yep

628
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,353
- lt's all right
- lt's all right
- As you might have heard

629
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,481
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

630
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,318
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird

631
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:31,653
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

632
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,656
- To play this loud
- Oh, play it loud

633
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:39,745
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

634
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,997
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

635
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:44,541
- As you may have heard
- Yeah

636
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,252
- To smoke a fat one
- Smoke a fat one

637
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:52,174
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird, now

638
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,678
lt's okay

639
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,438
Come on. Come on.

640
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,441
Do your homework.

641
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:34,383
- You have a lovely family,
Mrs. Sanchero.
- Thank you.

642
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,890
We know why you're here,
Miss Johnson.

643
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,436
I warned Raul to
stay out of trouble.

644
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,898
He's first in our family to
maybe graduate high school.

645
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:53,110
- So he gonna get punished big
for what he done.
- N--

646
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,697
Don't you worry about that.

647
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,700
But he didn't do anything wrong.

648
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,579
-But he expelled for three days.
-l know. No, I know.

649
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:08,375
But he didn't start the fight. He was
defending himself from a bigger boy.

650
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,086
He was protecting himself.

651
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:14,006
- Uh, why they send him home?
- lt's just school policy.

652
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:17,426
I-I-lt gives the other boy
time to cool down.

653
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,012
Actually,

654
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:24,391
I'm here because I just wanted
to tell you both personally...

655
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,478
what a pleasure it's been having
Raul in my class this semester.

656
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,023
You must be very proud.

657
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,944
Yes.

658
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,072
He's, um--
Well, he's very bright...

659
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,618
and funny, articulate.

660
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,748
The truth is, he's--
he's one of my favourites.

661
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,252
Uh, soy Louanne Johnson.

662
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,176
Oh.

663
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:46,348
"l will not go down underground

664
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:49,184
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

665
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,813
Okay, this is another
Dylan poem.

666
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:57,150
Now, is that a code, or does
that just mean what it says?

667
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:07,911
"And I will not carry myself
down to die

668
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,205
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

669
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,791
"My head will be high."
What does that mean?

670
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,962
Anybody.

671
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:23,051
Nobody.

672
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:25,554
ls there something
I should know?

673
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:28,724
Yeah. I'll tell you.

674
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,561
You ratted on Raul,
Gusmaro and Emilio.

675
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,230
Yeah. You got Emilio
put into detention.

676
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,399
lt wasn't none of your
business, chismosa.

677
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,735
And you got Raul
and Gusmaro suspended.

678
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,154
- Now they're gonna get
their fuckin' asses kicked.
- And you got Emilio--

679
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,448
- Hey, I didn't rat on anybody.
- Wasn't none of your business
anyway, you chismosa.

680
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:47,826
- Bullshit.
- Let this--
- Told you she was full of shit.

681
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:51,997
- Snitches get stitches, bitch.
- Do you wanna talk about this?

682
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:55,584
On you, shit. Whatever
floats your boat, teach.

683
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,961
We don't have no choices
in this room.

684
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,797
Well, if you all feel that strongly
about it, leave the room.

685
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:03,133
- What?
- Hey, listen.

686
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,014
Nobody's forcing you to be here.
You have a choice.
You can stay, or you can leave.

687
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:12,100
Lady, why are you playin' this
game? We don't have a choice.

688
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:15,604
You don't have a choice? You don't have
a choice on whether or not you're here?

689
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:19,107
No. lf we leave, we don't
get to graduate. lf we stay,
we gotta put up with you.

690
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,318
Well, that's a choice, isn't it?
You have a choice.

691
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,570
You either don't graduate
or you have to put up with me.

692
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,448
lt may not be a choice you like,
but it is a choice.

693
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:29,743
Man, you don't understand nothin'. l
mean, you don't come from where we live.

694
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,789
- You-- You're not bussed here.
- Do you have a choice
to get on that bus?

695
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,291
Man, you come and live in my
neighbourhood for one week...

696
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,752
and then you tell me
if you got a choice.

697
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:43,298
There are a lot of people who
live in your neighbourhood who
choose not to get on that bus.

698
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:46,176
What do they choose to do?
They choose to go out and sell drugs.

699
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:49,596
They choose to go out and kill people.
They choose to do a lot of other things.

700
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,974
But they choose not to
get on that bus.

701
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,353
The people who choose to get on
that bus, which are you,
are the people who are saying,

702
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,814
"l will not carry myself
down to die

703
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:01,775
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

704
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,111
That is a choice.

705
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,613
There are no victims
in this classroom!

706
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,121
Why do you care anyway?
You just here for the money.

707
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:16,832
Because I make a choice to care.
And, honey, the money ain't that good.

708
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,334
- Whatever.
- Read it again, Miss Johnson.

709
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:23,338
- What?
- Read those lines you just read again.

710
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,605
"l will not go down underground

711
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,650
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

712
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,240
Does that mean
just what it says?

713
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,537
No, it don't mean
just what it says.

714
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:58,207
Because...

715
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:00,709
you wouldn't go
under the ground...

716
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:04,588
if someone told you
death was comin'.

717
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:08,300
But you would go into the ground
if you were already dead.

718
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:19,061
Do the rest of you
agree with that?

719
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:28,445
Well, I kinda agree with it,

720
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:32,491
but I think
it just means that...

721
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:34,368
he ain't gonna help death out,
you know?

722
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,204
lt's not like he's just gonna
lay down and wait for it.

723
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:41,917
I think he's gonna choose-- No,
I think he's gonna make the choice--

724
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,919
to die hard.

725
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,048
Mm-hmm.

726
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,551
- Yeah, I agree with that.
- Yeah, me too.

727
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,594
- That's what it sounds like to me.
- Okay.

728
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:56,306
Well, what about, uh,
the rest of it? Um--

729
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,433
"When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

730
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,270
"Head will be high."
What does that mean?

731
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:05,274
- You're gonna die with pride.
- Right.

732
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,943
- See you tomorrow.
- Callie, wait up!

733
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:33,510
You went to RauI's house last
night, and Gusmaro's too, right?

734
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,221
Mm-hmm.

735
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,557
Yeah, that's what they told me.

736
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,311
That's cool.

737
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:57,367
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

738
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,787
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

739
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:08,587
What you want
Baby, I got it

740
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,840
What you need
Babe, you got it

741
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:15,093
All I'm askin'
is for a little respect

742
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:20,557
Yo, kick it, homes!
What you waitin' for, man?

743
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:23,852
- Are you trying to steal my $2.50, ése?
- Ah, go, go, go.

744
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:28,273
Man, that ain't shit.
Go faster, man. Go faster, man.

745
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:37,157
- Come on, come on
- Faster, man, faster!
- You got to gimme, gimme

746
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,661
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

747
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:44,081
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- You got to gimme, gimme

748
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:47,501
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

749
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:49,336
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Come on, get back.

750
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:52,548
Are you all right, man? That looked
like a real bitch right then.

751
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:56,677
Hey, get the fuck
out of there, man. Look at you!
You look like my grandma, man.

752
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,099
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Miss Johnson,

753
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:05,310
the-- the School Board would have every
right to insist on your dismissal.

754
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,605
You informed no one.
You got no permission slips.

755
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:13,193
Oh, but there was no one to inform.
All the kids just decided to go to
the amusement park at the last minute.

756
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,029
And then they let me come along.

757
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:19,324
- Did they pay for you?
- No, I paid for them.

758
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:25,998
I was just so moved
by the invitation.

759
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,212
This wasn't, by any chance,

760
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:36,967
their reward for reading
poetry, was it, Miss Johnson?

761
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:41,805
ln my class, Mr Grandey,
poetry is its own reward.

762
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:49,813
Angela, would you read
the first line?

763
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,318
"Appetizers. Freshly cut bay shrimp
grilled to perfection."

764
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:58,071
- This is a Xerox of a menu.
- That is correct.

765
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:02,242
lt's from The Flowering Peach,
the best restaurant in town.

766
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,495
- Ever hear of it?
- Yeah, we heard of it.

767
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:07,915
lt's supposed to be like
some special restaurant or somethin'.

768
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,250
Mm-hmm.
So, does it sound good?

769
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:16,590
Because whoever wins the, uh,
the-- the Dylan-Dylan contest...

770
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:19,092
- The what?
- goes there for dinner with me.

771
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:22,179
Hey, what's the Dylan-Dylan
contest about?

772
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:24,181
Well.

773
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,394
There's Bob Dylan,

774
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,105
who we've been reading.

775
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:34,107
And then...

776
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:38,612
there's Dylan Thomas,

777
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,447
who also wrote poems.

778
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:44,076
lf you can find the poem
written by Dylan Thomas...

779
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:49,122
that is like a poem
written by Bob Dylan,

780
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,542
you win the Dylan-Dylan contest.

781
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:56,463
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

782
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:02,636
I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to

783
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:07,891
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

784
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:10,477
ln the jingle-jangle morning

785
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:14,147
I'll come following you

786
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:31,373
Yo, every fuckin' poem Dylan Thomas
wrote is about death, man.

787
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,750
Now, how we supposed to know
which one to write?

788
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:37,254
"The sniper laid him low,
and strewed his brains.

789
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,464
One would not think
the greenness of this valley...

790
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,592
could let a day be sick
with so much blood."

791
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:45,053
Man, that's some Rambo-Schwarzenegger
bullshit you found.

792
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,055
- That's how it's supposed to be, right?
- No.

793
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:49,433
- There's supposed to be killing shit.
- But it-- But it don't--

794
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:52,311
But it don't even mean the same as
"l will not go under the ground."

795
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,690
Now you're some sort of
poetic critic, now, right?

796
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:59,026
- Oh, well, it don't.
- Thank you.

797
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,737
Okay. Listen to this.

798
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,700
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

799
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,412
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.

800
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,541
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light."

801
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,086
Where's the code?
Where's the death?

802
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:20,881
Night. All that stuff
about night. That's death.

803
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,551
So it's "Don't go gentle
into that good death."

804
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:28,222
Yeah, but I think "good"
is sarcastic.

805
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:32,559
When he say, "Do not go gentle,"
that's like sayin', "Don't go easy."

806
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:36,271
- So it's the same as
"l will not go down."
- We just won us

807
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,815
Shh.

808
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,818
This is the life

809
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,989
Everyone has to be somewhere

810
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,662
Oh

811
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:56,834
I am here

812
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:06,343
This is the life

813
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,472
This is the life

814
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,811
- This is my
- Well, the results of the
Dylan-Dylan contest are in.

815
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,938
- Life
- The winners are--

816
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:21,942
- That's me. Right here.
- Sit down. I am Bob Dylan. Sit down.

817
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,070
- Yo, shh! Shh!
- Sorry, Miss Johnson.

818
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,531
- Shh.
- Shh.

819
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:32,202
Raul, Durrell and Callie!

820
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:39,293
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

821
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:42,546
- Here's your certificate.
- Hey!
- Congratulations.

822
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,632
Congratulations, Callie.

823
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,177
Okay!

824
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:51,138
But there are no losers in this class.
You guys did great.

825
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,599
You all get to pick a prize
from the box.

826
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,977
How come they get a prize
when they got the wrong answer?

827
00:57:57,144 --> 00:58:00,647
Well, because sometimes
it takes a lot of wrong answers
to get to the right one.

828
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:04,067
Hey, everyone can't be right,
'cept for us!

829
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:08,530
Come on up.

830
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:19,124
- Miss Johnson?
- Hey, Callie.

831
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:22,961
- Um, I wanted to talk to you
about the restaurant.
- Uh-huh.

832
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,506
- I can't go.
- Why?

833
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,592
Because I have to work at this
supermarket every night until
June and I already told them--

834
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,594
Oh, isn't there any way
to get out of it?

835
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,306
No. Because of the schedule
and everything, I have to do it.

836
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:38,352
- But thank you anyway.
- Well, o-okay. Well.

837
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:41,021
Shoot.

838
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:45,692
Well, no, it's okay. lf you
can't come to dinner, then, uh,
well, we'll bring dinner to you.

839
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:49,446
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

840
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,449
- Thank you.
- I'm taking orders, Miss Roberts.

841
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,877
I couldn't find
a parking space.

842
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,879
lt's okay.
I just got here myself.

843
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:08,549
- Oh, you look very handsome.
- How 'bout this jacket?

844
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:10,551
lt's fantastic.

845
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,678
Go ahead, touch it.
lt's real leather.

846
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:15,556
- Ooh!
- Hey, where's Callie?

847
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:17,933
Oh, she had to work.
Where's Durrell?

848
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:21,645
- Oh, he had to work too.
- Oh.

849
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:25,399
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, handsome.

850
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,401
I guess so.

851
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,321
Oh. Ladies first.

852
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,323
Thank you.

853
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:43,166
- Hey, are you sure they got chicken?
- Mm-hmm.

854
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,382
May I tell you a little
about this evening's specials?

855
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:55,929
The chef is featuring foie gras
with smoked duck and figs
on a hill of bulgar.

856
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:59,516
Uh, salmon tartar
in potato gaufrette...

857
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:02,477
over wild mushrooms,
and fennel salad.

858
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,855
Uh, for the entree
we're featuring...

859
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,775
a complex shellfish
pan roast with orso,

860
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:12,738
a touch of comfit and a broth
thickened with lobster shell oil.

861
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:15,824
All very, very good.

862
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:20,662
- Could we have a few minutes, please?
- Ah, yes.

863
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,123
Thank you.

864
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,459
- Are you sure they got chicken?
- Yes.

865
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,462
Here. See, it's right there,
sweetie. You see? Poulet.

866
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:33,884
And when the waiter comes back,
you may as well talk to him.

867
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:37,304
lt'll be good practice
for your summer job interviews.

868
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,140
I can't talk to that guy. He probably
thinks I'm weird or something.

869
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:44,645
He does not. He can't help
but notice your natural charm.

870
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:48,607
You just look him straight
in the eye and you talk to him
like you would anyone else.

871
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,527
Now, go ahead and call him over.

872
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:58,408
Go ahead. Just give him
a little nod.

873
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,626
- Are we ready?
- Okay, I'll have the chicken.

874
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,630
A whole one.

875
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:17,052
And I'll have the same.

876
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:20,097
And one to go, please.

877
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:23,392
One to go. Thank you.

878
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,411
Hey, Miss J?

879
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:47,499
I was wondering maybe, like,
in the next couple of days, if I--

880
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:51,170
- ls everything all right?
- Everything's fine. Thank you.

881
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:53,380
All right.

882
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,883
Now don't be mad or nothing,
but I gotta be absent...

883
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:58,635
for a couple of days
without your coming to my house.

884
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,555
lt's important.

885
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,225
- You'll have to tell me why.
- I got some shit to do.

886
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,231
I gotta make some money
to pay back this guy.

887
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:18,363
This doesn't sound important
enough to cut school.

888
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:21,283
lt is. I gotta pay
for this jacket.

889
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,744
See, I got it off the street
from this guy for 200 dollars,

890
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,746
and he said he'd trust me
for it until Friday.

891
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:28,916
Why did you buy it on the street
instead of in a store?

892
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:32,002
Are you crazy? You know how much
this would cost in a store?

893
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:36,173
I needed a nice jacket and fast,
and I got it from this guy
'cause he cut me a deal...

894
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:40,802
'cause he stole it,
probably.

895
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:45,641
So, are you gonna go out and get
a job or are you gonna go out
and steal too to pay him back?

896
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,268
Miss J, I gotta pay him back.

897
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,604
He'll kill me.

898
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,732
I didn't have nothing to wear!

899
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,328
Fine. I'll lend it to you.

900
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:11,083
I can't take your money.
Teachers are poor. Everyone knows that.

901
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:15,170
Well, you don't really
have a choice, do you?

902
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,714
lf you don't pay the guy back,
he'll kill you.

903
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,635
lf you cut school, I'll tell
your father and he'll kill you.

904
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:26,390
- So I'm your only way out.
- Oh, man.

905
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:29,768
- But I do have one condition.
- Big?

906
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,937
- Huge.
- What do you want, interest?

907
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,357
- Mm-mmm. Bigger.
- Jesus Christ, what is it?

908
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,403
Well.

909
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,656
- Would you like dessert?
- No!

910
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:45,742
- Another glass of wine?
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

911
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,745
- Coffee, perhaps?
- Hey, man, we're talking!

912
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:55,085
So, what's the condition?

913
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:01,008
You have to pay me back
on the day you graduate.

914
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:05,804
But-- But what if
I don't graduate?

915
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:09,391
Well, then you'll never
pay me back the money.

916
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:13,061
But I know that
if you say you will,

917
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,898
you'll kill yourself
keeping your word.

918
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,880
Well, what do you say?

919
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:44,218
I don't get it. Why do you
care so much if I graduate?

920
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:46,595
Weird, isn't it?

921
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:54,394
All right, I'll pay you back.

922
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:01,068
- You have my word.
- Hey.

923
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,904
lt is a very nice jacket.

924
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:08,575
Thank you.

925
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,930
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

926
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,432
- How you doin'?
- Oh, good.

927
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:36,061
I think this is the first time I ever
brought food into a supermarket.

928
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:39,606
-Yeah, I can smell it from here.
-Yeah.
-Good. Thanks.

929
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:42,943
Well, Raul says if you don't like it,
he'll take it off your hands.

930
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,530
Oh, please.
Like hell he will.

931
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:49,533
Callie, could you help load
in aisle three, please?

932
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:54,580
Be right there. I'm telling you,
this place would fall to pieces
if it wasn't for me.

933
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:57,916
You know, Callie,

934
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,918
just between you and me,

935
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:05,299
with your scores, I think you should
consider going into Advanced English.

936
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:09,178
- Oh, but I'm gonna be at Clearview.
You didn't know?
- No.

937
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,848
You didn't see my record?
I tell you.

938
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,850
No, I-- I didn't know.

939
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,728
- Bye now.
- Yeah.

940
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:22,774
ln the middle of a semester?
Are-- Are you moving?

941
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:25,235
No. I'm pregnant.

942
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,906
And since I'm startin' to show,
they thought it was time, you know?

943
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:36,663
- Who thought it was time?
- The school. They don't let you
stay there if you're pregnant.

944
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,250
But they told me they have this
really good programme at Clearview
for, like, teenage mothers.

945
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:44,338
And they teach you stuff like parenting
and nutrition, all kinds of stuff.

946
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:47,007
So I thought it would
be good for me, you know?

947
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:49,426
- Yeah.
- Aisle three.

948
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:54,556
"Degrade first the arts
if you'd mankind degrade."

949
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:57,976
Hey, that's the spray can poem.

950
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:04,816
-Hey, hey, what's the code word?
-The code word is "great rides
and great prizes."

951
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:07,694
I'm keeping it undercover
But comin' soon, I surmises

952
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:13,075
Does anybody know where, um,
Durrell and Lionel are today?

953
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:18,872
- Durrell and Lionel.
- No.
- They around.

954
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,210
Yeah, so what's the prize we're
gonna get for learning this poem?

955
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:26,964
Learning is the prize.

956
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:28,966
Yeah.

957
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:32,177
Knowing how to read something
and understand it is the prize.

958
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:35,556
Okay? Knowing how to think
is the prize.

959
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:39,059
- I know how to think right now.
- Okay. Well, yeah, well,
you know how to run too.

960
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,520
But not the way you
could run if you trained.

961
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:44,523
You know, the mind
is like a muscle.

962
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:48,610
Okay? And if you want it to be really
powerful, you got to work it out. Okay?

963
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:53,448
Each new fact
gives you another choice.

964
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:57,327
Each new idea builds
another muscle, okay?

965
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,497
And it's those muscles that are
gonna make you really strong.

966
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:04,668
Those are your weapons,
and in this unsafe world...

967
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,045
I want to arm you.

968
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:10,924
- And that's what these poems
are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

969
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,594
Hey, try it. You're just
sittin' here anyway.

970
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,597
Look. Okay.
lf at the end of the term,

971
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:19,808
you're not faster, stronger
and smarter,

972
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:22,936
you will have lost nothing.

973
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:26,273
But if you are,

974
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,361
you'll be that much tougher
to knock down.

975
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:37,075
So what's "Hire idiots to paint
with cold light and hot shade"?

976
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,078
They're being sarcastic, Raul.

977
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:42,623
I mean, 'cause you know that light
is supposed to be warm, right?

978
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:44,875
- And shade is supposed to be what?
- Cold?

979
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:48,879
Exactly. But if you go
and hire an idiot to do the job,
he's gonna do it backwards.

980
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,256
- Hello.
- There you go.
- Hmm.

981
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,469
Don't make a big fuss
about this, Louanne.

982
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:58,847
You have to help me. You have
no idea how bright this girl is.

983
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,934
Yes, I do. And there's nothing
I can do about it.

984
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:05,562
Oh! That just makes me crazy!

985
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:09,149
What right do these miserable,
self-righteous sons of bitches
from the Board of Education...

986
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:12,361
have to make a moral judgment
on Callie Roberts?

987
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:14,571
- Do you know--
- Louanne, there are parents
in the next room.

988
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,907
Look, I don't c--
I'm gonna fight this ruling.

989
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:20,786
I'm gonna write an open letter
to every newspaper condemning
the entire School Board.

990
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,205
- Oh, you can't do that.
- Why not?

991
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,209
Well, first of all, the Board
has nothing to do with it.

992
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:33,549
We prefer that these girls go to
the mother-to-be programme at Clearview.

993
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:39,638
Oh, wait a minute.

994
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:43,600
You mean this isn't a rule?
You mean this is your preference?

995
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:47,020
Well, yes.

996
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:51,316
You mean Callie Roberts is free
to go to any school she wants?

997
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:55,946
- lncluding this one?
- Unless she's absent
for more than 30 days.

998
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,657
And then she has to wait
until the baby's born
before she can come back here.

999
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:04,538
But, Louanne, once these girls
have babies, very few of them
come back to school anyway.

1000
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:07,124
I see.

1001
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:11,378
So you make them think
they have to leave.

1002
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:14,756
You just push 'em out a little earlier,
make it a little harder,

1003
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:17,050
make it a little more hopeless.

1004
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:19,428
I do what I have to do...

1005
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:22,556
because it is dangerous to have
a pregnant girl in a classroom.

1006
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:27,394
lt's not a warning, Louanne. I-lt's
prestige, it's stardom, it's attention.

1007
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,771
You know, not all these girls
become pregnant by accident.

1008
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:33,066
- Pregnancy is contagious.
- Yep, yep

1009
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:35,068
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

1010
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:37,613
As you may have heard

1011
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,574
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

1012
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,243
- And drink a 'Bird
- Drink a Thunderbird

1013
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,579
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

1014
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:48,582
- To play this loud
- Play it loud

1015
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:52,669
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

1016
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:54,755
Who is it?

1017
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:58,175
lt's Louanne Johnson,
Callie's second period teacher.

1018
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,765
Hi.

1019
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,101
Um, Callie's getting ready
to go to work.

1020
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:09,978
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

1021
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,648
Curiosity killed the cat

1022
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:14,608
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

1023
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,861
- What you doing?
- Watching TV.

1024
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:22,824
- What's your name?
- Tyeisha.

1025
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,203
- Oh, that's a pretty name.
- She just love her TV.

1026
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:29,915
Why ain't you in bed?
Come here, baby.

1027
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,460
Callie? Honey?
Your teacher's here.

1028
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:41,301
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,805
I'm sorry to just bust in
on you like this, but I have
the most wonderful news...

1030
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,766
and I wanted to come
tell you personally.

1031
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:51,019
You do not have to go
to Clearview.

1032
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:56,400
There is nothing in the rules that says
you can't stay exactly where you are.

1033
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,443
But, uh, she already
enrolled in Clearview.

1034
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,697
Uh, well, that's all right. She-- that--
But she doesn't have to go there.

1035
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,409
Yeah, but Kimboley wants me
to take the mother-to-be programme
at Clearview, you know.

1036
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,912
He thought it would be a good
idea if I learned how to take
care of the baby and stuff.

1037
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:14,084
I don't understand.

1038
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:17,838
Do you not want to stay
at Parkmont?

1039
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:21,341
Well, yeah, but I gotta learn how
to take care of us, you know.

1040
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,927
I mean, we're getting our own
place and everything, so--

1041
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:30,684
Callie, just don't throw away
all you can become.

1042
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,772
Kimboley was so right.
He was so right.

1043
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,692
He told me that you'd probably
try to talk me out of this.

1044
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,736
You want to know
what else he said?

1045
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,488
He said that you probably
don't even like men...

1046
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:46,325
and that you're probably not married
and you don't want anybody else to be.

1047
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:49,536
That's why you're always
in everybody else's life.

1048
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:56,960
Look, I'm not saying
that I agree with him, okay?

1049
01:12:57,127 --> 01:13:00,005
Well, Kimboley's wrong.

1050
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,549
I was married...

1051
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:04,551
and I was pregnant.

1052
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,765
So what happened?

1053
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,353
We got divorced...

1054
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:17,564
and I had an abortion.

1055
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,237
He beat me.

1056
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:29,368
Well, sometimes
you start out wrong...

1057
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:32,579
and just keep going.

1058
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:49,179
Hey, don't touch me.
Oh, get outta here!

1059
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:53,976
I'll see you.

1060
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:56,687
You took something that
fuckin' belonged to me, ése.

1061
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:59,815
Man, she came to me
with open arms.

1062
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:02,359
Besides, you gotta have
one of these.

1063
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,321
You're dead.

1064
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:21,712
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1065
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:25,048
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

1066
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:27,718
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

1067
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:31,013
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

1068
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,807
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

1069
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,393
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

1070
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,272
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

1071
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:43,483
On my knees in the night
sayin' prayers in the street light

1072
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,989
Been spendin' most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1073
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:51,158
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey!
- Been spendin' most their lives

1074
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:54,745
- Haven't seen you guys in a week.
- Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1075
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:57,497
Thought maybe you got lost
on your way to class.

1076
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:59,708
I wanted to help you
find your way back.

1077
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,544
Get on inside.

1078
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:05,506
Clean up that pigsty of a room.

1079
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:13,680
Hi. I'm Louanne Johnson.
I'm the boys' teacher.

1080
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,682
I know who you are.

1081
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:19,394
You're that white-bread bitch
messin' with my babies' minds.

1082
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,396
I beg your pardon?

1083
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:24,650
My boys don't go to your school
no more, and that's gonna be it.

1084
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:28,904
- You took 'em out of school?
- You're damn right I did.

1085
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:32,866
I saw what they were bringing
home-- poetry and shit.

1086
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,788
A waste of time. They got
more important things to worry about.

1087
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:44,253
Don't you think that finishing high
school will be valuable to their future?

1088
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,380
That's not in their future.

1089
01:15:46,505 --> 01:15:50,384
I ain't raising no doctors and lawyers
here. They got bills to pay.

1090
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,678
Why don't you just
get on outta here.

1091
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:56,807
Go find yourself some other
poor boys to save.

1092
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:13,240
Mama! I could stand
some lemonade.

1093
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:23,375
"lt is easier
to forgive an enemy...

1094
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,128
than to forgive a friend.

1095
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:30,215
The man who permits you
to injure him...

1096
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,093
deserves your vengeance.

1097
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,638
He also will receive it."

1098
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:39,558
Wow, who wrote that?
Some Mafia guy?

1099
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:41,560
You know, let's go on
with this poem tomorrow.

1100
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,979
Why don't you-- Take out your work
sheets and do the vocabulary drill.

1101
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:47,482
- Say what?
- Oh, man!
- Man, I don't wanna do no vocabulary.

1102
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:49,818
I don't wanna do
no damn vocabulary.

1103
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:52,154
Then don't.

1104
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,741
What do you mean?
You mean I have a choice?

1105
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:59,661
You're not gonna let me get away with
not learnin' my vocabulary, right?

1106
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:06,543
That's right. You have to do
your vocabulary.

1107
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:09,379
Words are thoughts
and we can't think without 'em.

1108
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:12,925
So-- Please?

1109
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:16,720
And so let's just do it, man. She's
gonna be down our back in a minute.

1110
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:20,224
- Whatever. She's grouchy.
- Grouch.

1111
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:23,060
- Thanks, Louanne.
- Grouch, grouch.

1112
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:26,396
Thank you, Louanne.
Such a nice lady, Louanne.

1113
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:31,985
What do I do?
What the fuck you want from me?

1114
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,905
Who, my teacher? You think
I'm gonna fuckin' talk to a teacher?

1115
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,533
Like they're gonna
really help me, huh? Huh?

1116
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,786
Teachers aren't gonna
fuckin' help me, okay?

1117
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:44,831
Miss Johnson! Miss Johnson,
we gotta talk to you.

1118
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:47,960
- There's nothing to talk about, Angela!
- What, are you Superman?

1119
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:51,129
ls your ass bulletproof?
ls that what you think? Tell her!

1120
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:53,924
- Tell her what you're gonna do.
- What is it?

1121
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,969
- He's strapped.
- Shut the fuck up!
She don't need to know my business.

1122
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:59,972
ls your business dying? No!

1123
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:03,016
There's this crackhead named Shorty.
He just came out of jail.

1124
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,602
He says that I'm his girl and
that Emilio took me from him.

1125
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:08,188
And now he wants to kill Emilio.

1126
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,402
Emilio, if this boy is threatening you,
we can go to the police.

1127
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:15,821
Look, this is nothing you
can do anything about.

1128
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:18,699
This guy is looking for me to kill me,
and the only way for me to stop him...

1129
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:21,326
is for me to kill him first.

1130
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,787
That's just the way it is,
all right?

1131
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:27,291
Wait, Emilio, wait, wait, wait, wait,
no! Can we-- Can we talk about this?

1132
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,127
- Come to my house.
- Yeah, right.

1133
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,421
Oh, what?
You're too proud to hide?

1134
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:35,757
lt's better to wander
the streets all night?

1135
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:38,886
- Come on.
- Please?

1136
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:40,888
Please, just go.

1137
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:47,561
Go. Go.

1138
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:51,982
- Can we drop you?
- Just go.

1139
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:10,751
ls this boy your age?

1140
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:17,174
- Yeah.
- Does he go to Parkmont?

1141
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:20,177
I won't tell you who it is.

1142
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,179
No, don't.

1143
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:27,351
But if you tell Mr Grandey
about him--

1144
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:32,856
not about his threatening you,
but about his being on crack--

1145
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:37,486
he'll be turned over to the juvenile
court for-- for drug abuse in school.

1146
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,988
H-He won't serve hard time,

1147
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:44,368
but by the time he gets out and
he's detoxed, he-- he will have
gotten over trying to kill you.

1148
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,460
No, I can't rat on him.

1149
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:56,588
Right. Kill him.
That's better.

1150
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,717
Man,

1151
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:02,719
you don't understand.

1152
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:10,894
You asked me once how I was
gonna save you from your life.

1153
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:13,647
This is how. This moment.

1154
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,068
Right now.

1155
01:20:18,235 --> 01:20:20,612
This will make the difference
in your life forever.

1156
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,978
Emilio?

1157
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,070
Emilio?

1158
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,795
- Oh, Mr Grandey.
- ls there a problem, Miss Johnson?

1159
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:20,964
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Yes, I'm late.

1160
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:25,844
Um, I just wanted to ask.
Did Emilio Ramirez come
to your office this morning?

1161
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,555
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

1162
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,683
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I sent him away.

1163
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:33,894
You-- What do you mean?

1164
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:39,858
- I mean I sent him away.
- Why?

1165
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:42,569
Because he didn't knock,
Miss Johnson.

1166
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:46,782
- Here we are.
- Because he didn't knock?

1167
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:51,203
Yes, Miss Johnson. I'm trying to teach
these children how to live in the world.

1168
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,581
And in the world, you just don't
burst into someone's office.

1169
01:21:57,459 --> 01:22:00,295
Because he didn't knock?

1170
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,634
Damn it!

1171
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,210
Uh, Louanne.

1172
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,673
Mr Grandey is with the police.

1173
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,009
- Yes?
- Um.

1174
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:50,721
They just found Emilio Ramirez
three blocks from the school.

1175
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,557
He was shot this morning.

1176
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,728
ls he dead?

1177
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:04,359
- He's dead.
- I'm very sorry.

1178
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,363
Um...

1179
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,574
are you going to tell them now?

1180
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:15,495
Do you think that's wise?

1181
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,584
Yeah.

1182
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:24,296
Well, uh, perhaps if you talk to them
a little bit about death...

1183
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:27,591
and-- and-- and what it means.

1184
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:31,261
What would you like me to say?

1185
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:34,264
That if you don't want to die,
remember to knock?

1186
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:38,352
- That's not fair.
- What is?

1187
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:57,996
Bad news.

1188
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:02,543
Emilio was shot this morning.

1189
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,922
ls he dead?

1190
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:10,968
- Yes, baby, he's dead.
- Oh, no.

1191
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:03,478
Yo! Listen up. Miss Johnson
got something to say!

1192
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:07,065
- Shh.
- Thank you.

1193
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:10,569
I just want to say...

1194
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:13,822
l, uh-- I won't, um--

1195
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,244
I will not be here next year.

1196
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:21,246
I'm not coming back.

1197
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:25,167
How come?
ls it something we did?

1198
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:28,045
No. No, no, no. No. Um--

1199
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:33,300
I-l never intended to stay.

1200
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:36,136
Um, this was an unexpected job.

1201
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:40,224
So if you knew you wasn't
gonna stay, how come you made me
promise what I promised?

1202
01:25:41,808 --> 01:25:43,644
I--

1203
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:48,732
At that time,
I thought I would stay.

1204
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:50,943
So how come you're leaving?

1205
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:54,863
I just...

1206
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,742
have my reasons,
certain reasons.

1207
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:02,996
ls it because it's too sad for you,
what happened to Emilio?

1208
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:19,221
Maybe.

1209
01:26:19,388 --> 01:26:21,974
And Durrell and Lionel
and Callie. And I just--

1210
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,976
I just think that--

1211
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:32,150
So if you love us so much and you're
so interested in our graduating,

1212
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:35,320
- how come you choose to leave?
- Yeah.

1213
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:40,284
You sad about Durrell and Callie
and Emilio and Lionel, but we're here.

1214
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:44,037
What about us, huh?
None of us make you feel happy?

1215
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:48,792
We been working hard and we stayed
in school, man. What about us?

1216
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:51,128
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1217
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,563
Why are you packing up today
when tomorrow is your last day?

1218
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,649
Oh, just gettin' a head start.

1219
01:27:14,193 --> 01:27:16,069
Oh, I see.

1220
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:24,661
What you did, when you
gave me the 200 dollars?

1221
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:32,669
That was the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

1222
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:35,255
I don't know anybody else
who would give 200 dollars...

1223
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:38,008
to a Mexican kid
on his word of honour.

1224
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:46,433
S-So you gotta let me
pay you back.

1225
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:53,273
Even if I don't graduate,
all right?

1226
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:56,109
Why wouldn't you graduate?

1227
01:27:57,819 --> 01:28:00,781
Ain't no other teacher
gonna give me no "A."

1228
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:03,617
Yes, they will, if you work for them
the way you worked for me.

1229
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:06,286
No, but it was different with you.
You gave me an "A" to start with.

1230
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:10,832
- I didn't have to earn it.
I just had to keep it.
- Are you kidding?

1231
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:15,504
Keeping an "A" is harder than getting an
"A." Almost anyone can get an "A" once.

1232
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:18,757
But keeping it,
that's an accomplishment.

1233
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:21,802
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

1234
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,596
Do you realize the work
you did this term?

1235
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:28,308
Do you realize that
the poetry that we read...

1236
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,435
is given to people in college?

1237
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:32,771
- ln college.
- These same poems?

1238
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:36,233
- Yes.
- But they weren't even so hard.

1239
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:38,277
So, you see?

1240
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:42,823
Keep working.

1241
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:45,325
You'll graduate.

1242
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,914
I might even see you
in college.

1243
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:52,916
What do you think?

1244
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:13,228
I feel so bad about leaving
I can hardly breathe.

1245
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:17,482
I know, but-- Oh, what the hell.
You're right.

1246
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:22,196
You gotta be crazy to stay here
and teach these programme classes.

1247
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,948
There's no money.
lt's killer work.

1248
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:29,745
Why do you stay?

1249
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:32,372
Why do I smoke?
I'm crazy.

1250
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:34,458
You need any more help?

1251
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:36,877
No. Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1252
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,879
Yeah. Bye.

1253
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:43,800
This is the life

1254
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:47,846
Everyone has to be somewhere

1255
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:52,976
Oh

1256
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:58,982
I am here

1257
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:05,864
This is the life

1258
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:08,700
This is the life

1259
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:14,289
'Cause this is my life

1260
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:19,837
This is my life

1261
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,257
Hi.

1262
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:30,222
Well. Welcome back.

1263
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:34,184
This is the 29th day,
the last day I have to come back.

1264
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:37,479
So, am I still okay
for next term?

1265
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,566
Yeah.

1266
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:44,862
Did, uh,

1267
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:48,949
did you come back because
it was your last day or did somebody...

1268
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:52,369
ask you to come today
to talk me into staying?

1269
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:55,289
Well, it was both, really.

1270
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:59,877
See, 'cause I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do...

1271
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:02,921
until I heard that you
were leaving and--

1272
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:05,632
'Cause up until then,
I don't know, I thought...

1273
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:09,178
that you'd always be here
for me, you know.

1274
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:11,471
You know, whenever I came back.

1275
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:15,559
But then Raul tells me
that you're leaving...

1276
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:17,561
just like that.

1277
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:23,525
And I realized that this
was my last chance.

1278
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:27,696
And I decided--

1279
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:32,075
We decided that...

1280
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:34,494
we're not gonna just
let you leave like that.

1281
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,917
Yeah, we realized
like the poem said:

1282
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:42,836
You can't give in.

1283
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:45,172
"You can't go gentle.

1284
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:49,426
- You got to rage against
the dying of the light."
- Yeah.

1285
01:31:49,593 --> 01:31:51,803
Yeah, you gotta go for yours.
You know that, right?

1286
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:55,015
- Yeah.
- You gotta kick it in and get it up.

1287
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:58,435
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no. Wait, wait. I'm not giving in.

1288
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,147
Um, this is my choice.

1289
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:05,567
I have no reason to "rage
against the dying of the light."

1290
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:08,695
'Cause you're not the one who's raging.
We're the ones who are raging.

1291
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,114
See, 'cause we see you
as being our light.

1292
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:17,204
- What?
- You're our Tambourine Man.

1293
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:22,209
- Oh, I'm your drug dealer?
- You got the stuff, Miss J?

1294
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:26,380
You're our teacher. You got
what we need. lt's the same thing.

1295
01:32:26,505 --> 01:32:30,342
Come on, Miss J. All the poems
you taught us say you can't give in.

1296
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,761
You can't give up.

1297
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,764
- Well, we ain't giving you up.
- No way.

1298
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,310
Now, listen, baby, we gonna have to
tie you down to the chair and gag you...

1299
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:45,440
'cause you know
we want you to stay.

1300
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:50,279
What you need to stay, girl?
You want a candy bar?

1301
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:54,908
Okay, on the left and on the right,
a "Louanne, Louanne." Uh, here we go.

1302
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,412
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

1303
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:01,999
- Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.
- Come on!

1304
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:06,712
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

1305
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:16,180
- You have to go first.
- I don't want to go first.
- Come on. You have to.

1306
01:33:16,346 --> 01:33:18,182
Ready? You go like this. Go.

1307
01:33:20,684 --> 01:33:22,895
- lt go like this.
- This how you do it.

1308
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,982
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.

1309
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:30,235
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne.

1310
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:39,620
Let me see.

1311
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:42,706
- Excuse me.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1312
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:48,295
- You want to sign my book?
- Yeah, I'll sign your book.

1313
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:15,656
How'd they get you
to come back?

1314
01:34:15,822 --> 01:34:19,409
They gave me candy
and called me "the light."

1315
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,411
That'll do it.

1316
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:52,901
I won't do you wrong

1317
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:55,362
I'll do you right

1318
01:34:55,529 --> 01:35:00,409
You can roll with me
for the rest of the night

1319
01:35:00,576 --> 01:35:04,872
No need to fuss
'cause I don't wanna joke

1320
01:35:04,997 --> 01:35:09,001
Baby, sit right here
and let the chronic smoke

1321
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:12,045
So hang around, love

1322
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:15,007
And give it up

1323
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:19,469
'Cause all the real "G"s
know what I'm thinkin' of

1324
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:25,184
'Cause you wanna be down, down
so give it up

1325
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:29,313
There's a party over here
So, baby, show your love

1326
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:33,650
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

1327
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:36,904
- You know that, you know that
- I got the gin and juice

1328
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,698
Yeah

1329
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:44,077
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

1330
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,082
- I got the, I got the gin and juice
- Yeah

1331
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:53,086
- I got the answer
- 'Cause I got the gin and juice

1332
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:05,182
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1333
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:08,602
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

1334
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:11,271
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

1335
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:14,650
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

1336
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:17,486
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

1337
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:21,198
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

1338
01:36:21,323 --> 01:36:23,408
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

1339
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:27,120
On my knees in the night
Sayin' prayers in the street light

1340
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:33,085
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1341
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:38,966
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1342
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:45,305
We keep spending most our lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1343
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,902
You spent so many nights
in heat

1344
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:01,655
- And out of control
- Like that

1345
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:04,283
Waiting impatiently to see

1346
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,952
- What's under my clothes
- Like that

1347
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:12,207
I just wanna take time
to get right into the point

1348
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,251
Now you got your choice, girl

1349
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:17,379
- To come and rock this funky joint
- Like that

1350
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:23,093
Don't you take too long, baby

1351
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:28,223
I'll be waitin' here
for you, baby, baby

1352
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:33,353
Here's a gift
to you from me

1353
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,025
Just you wait and see
lt's the curiosity

01:37:38,192 --> 01:37:43,864

1355
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:47,034
- Do you wanna feel my body
- Like that

1356
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:49,036
Girl, all night long, yeah

1357
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:51,955
lt's the curiosity

1358
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,712

1360
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:04,134
For you, for me
