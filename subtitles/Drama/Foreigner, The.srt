1
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,335
- You like it?
- All right.

2
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:01,795
I need to go. My dad's here.

3
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,338
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

4
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,306
This is the dress. Do you like it?

5
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,518
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

6
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:20,480
Come on, Dad, let's go.

7
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:31,241
When do I meet him?

8
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:33,827
His name's Chappy.

9
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,971
On the football team and very...

10
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,955
- Chubby?
- Chappy.

11
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,547
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

12
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,125
Not before?

13
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,336
Dad, you really need to go faster.

14
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:47,299
Will he drive you to the dance?

15
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:49,176
He's rented a limo.

16
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,469
So he won't drive you?

17
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:55,515
Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.

18
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,649
It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.

19
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,484
I want you to like it.

20
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:32,361
- I'm getting out.
- No, no, no. Wait until I park.

21
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,803
Everyone's already inside.

22
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,724
Fan, careful crossing the street!

23
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,301
You stupid...

24
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,206
Metro desk, Ian Wood.

25
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,916
Listen carefully.

26
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,668
An action wing of the Authentic IRA

27
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:31,713
has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

28
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,341
The code word is "Phoenix."

29
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,218
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

30
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:41,181
The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions

31
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:44,684
persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.

32
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,611
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

33
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:57,548
A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

34
00:05:57,572 --> 00:05:58,782
Who's the Authentic IRA?

35
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,116
No idea. Never heard of them.

36
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:05,121
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

37
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:09,000
Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.

38
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,754
A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.

39
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,839
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

40
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:16,841
Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.

41
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,053
Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

42
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,402
What are you waiting for? Get over there.

43
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,362
...have asked
a number of police officials

44
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,325
for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...

45
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,376
This is a major incident
that they're treating

46
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,587
as a possible terrorist attack.

47
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,881
The bomb went off at exactly...

48
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,049
...4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

49
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,218
One theory on the cause of the blast

50
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,096
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

51
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,099
How many? How many I get?

52
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:51,519
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

53
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:54,898
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

54
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,692
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

55
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,611
Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.

56
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:04,157
Any problems?

57
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:09,037
- No.
- We should be moving.

58
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,497
That's normal procedure.

59
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,250
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

60
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:19,005
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

61
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,778
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

62
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,368
Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.

63
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:52,038
Too bad. What's the time?

64
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,958
Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.

65
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,669
Um, I'll miss my flight.

66
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:03,925
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

67
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,302
Room service for a week.

68
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,555
Sound good?

69
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,682
And your work, Deputy Minister?

70
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:14,060
An acute case of food poisoning.

71
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,107
You need to work on your excuses, darling.

72
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,549
Jesus Christ.

73
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:47,218
There's been an IRA bombing in London.

74
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,929
Scores dead and injured.

75
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,106
- Yes?
- Jesus, Liam.

76
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,568
Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?

77
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:04,902
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

78
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,322
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

79
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:09,115
Meetings.

80
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:11,200
- Meetings?
- Aye.

81
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,037
And last night?

82
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,748
You didn't come home. I was worried.

83
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:22,211
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

84
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,923
But the guest room wasn't slept in.

85
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,550
Who said I slept?

86
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:28,801
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

87
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:30,928
You didn't come home, plain and simple.

88
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,513
And what if I didn't!

89
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,017
Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?

90
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,353
So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.

91
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,566
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

92
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,029
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

93
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,990
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.

94
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:53,910
Oh, Jesus.

95
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:29,213
Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.

96
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:32,341
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

97
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,261
Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.

98
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:36,554
We're depending on you.

99
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:40,016
Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.

100
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,726
I'm meeting the Council now.

101
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,645
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

102
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,772
But, Kate, this is crucial.

103
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,400
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

104
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:53,738
But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.

105
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,114
I could use something now.

106
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,867
And you know what I'm referring to.

107
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,495
The Royal Pardons.

108
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,124
I remember your list, the 40 "On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?

109
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,376
My cousin's on that list.

110
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:10,588
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

111
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:14,300
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

112
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:17,678
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

113
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:21,849
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

114
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,143
We keep it quiet.

115
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,562
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

116
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,232
to press certain men
for something in return.

117
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,776
As Irish Deputy Minister,

118
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:33,754
you have served the British
government honorably,

119
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,404
which hasn't always been easy.

120
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,698
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

121
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,034
These are longstanding issues.

122
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,054
That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.

123
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:43,621
I need something, Kate.

124
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:47,041
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

125
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,252
I'm trying to hold this together.

126
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:52,964
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

127
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:54,882
I'll consider it.

128
00:13:57,176 --> 00:14:00,513
But I want something first,
something real.

129
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:02,890
Understood.

130
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,334
Hello?

131
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:39,552
We're closed. We open at 12:00.

132
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:42,471
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

133
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:44,807
Quan.

134
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:46,434
Upstairs.

135
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:52,815
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

136
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,651
Can you positively identify them as hers?

137
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:58,696
Who did this?

138
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:02,325
As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

139
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,369
Why my daughter?

140
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,457
Is there someone we can call

141
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,375
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

142
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,341
I have no more family.

143
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,891
These bombers, will you catch them?

144
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:27,974
Yes.

145
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,978
Will they get punished?

146
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,813
Yes, they certainly will.

147
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,566
We'll let ourselves out.

148
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,169
Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.

149
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,337
Been a long time, Liam.

150
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,131
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

151
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,883
All right, Hugh?

152
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,010
Now that we're all here,

153
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,847
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

154
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,685
Are they even part of the IRA?

155
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,273
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

156
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:21,237
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

157
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,655
Well, I won't have it.

158
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:26,617
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

159
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,161
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

160
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,455
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

161
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:32,623
Are we in agreement?

162
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:35,501
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

163
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,794
Hotheads.

164
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,256
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

165
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,675
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

166
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,050
Aye.

167
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,554
Long ago, when it was the only way.

168
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:47,930
And what did it give us?

169
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:50,641
More graves than I care to remember.

170
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:54,228
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

171
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:58,149
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

172
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:00,401
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

173
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:02,528
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

174
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:06,282
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

175
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:09,160
They also used our code word.

176
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,079
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

177
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:14,540
Maybe someone in this room.

178
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:20,796
They're trying to divide us,

179
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,425
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

180
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:25,801
Well, I won't have it!

181
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,305
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

182
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:30,681
everything verified,

183
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:33,309
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

184
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:36,395
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

185
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,856
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

186
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:41,442
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

187
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:45,029
And then we deal with this internally.

188
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,656
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

189
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:49,366
What do we get in return?

190
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:50,910
Peace.

191
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,163
Is that so bad, Brennan?

192
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:57,458
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

193
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,837
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

194
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,673
I need your full support and respect.

195
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,635
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

196
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:10,763
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

197
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,848
And no fuckin' exceptions!

198
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,404
Show me.

199
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:31,617
We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

200
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,245
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

201
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,330
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

202
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:40,334
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

203
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,462
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

204
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,257
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

205
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,510
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

206
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,220
What about phone calls?

207
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,472
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

208
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,891
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

209
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,434
trying to ID any call terminating

210
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:58,745
at the time of the incident.

211
00:18:58,769 --> 00:18:59,895
Sorry. Excuse me.

212
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:01,312
Yup.

213
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:04,024
For you.

214
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,569
- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.

215
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,863
- The Chinese man.
- What?

216
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,740
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

217
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,826
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

218
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,620
I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

219
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,168
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

220
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,629
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

221
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:27,273
to find those who killed your daughter.

222
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:34,471
But they're a difficult people to catch.

223
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,765
And it may take some time.

224
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,226
I need you to understand that.

225
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,896
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

226
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,607
Again, it's our top priority.

227
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:53,490
Twenty thousand pound.

228
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,787
All I have for the names of the bombers.

229
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,501
- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...

230
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:08,088
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

231
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:12,635
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

232
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:16,764
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

233
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:19,141
This is our work, not yours.

234
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,518
You need to be patient.

235
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,194
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

236
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:35,074
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

237
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:37,952
You were born in Guangxi, China.

238
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,873
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

239
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:45,334
I work in Saigon after the war.

240
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,919
We escaped to Singapore.

241
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,630
Then we immigrate here.

242
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,884
You had two daughters
before Fan.

243
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:56,887
Both killed during the escape.

244
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,889
And your wife?

245
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,432
Where is she now?

246
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,479
She died, giving birth to Fan.

247
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:10,609
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

248
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,073
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

249
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:21,328
It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.

250
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,374
Do you understand?

251
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,672
Yes. I understand.

252
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:37,886
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

253
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:51,275
After three weeks
of investigations,

254
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:54,153
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

255
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:56,405
The public is looking for reassurance.

256
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,200
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

257
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,203
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

258
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:05,873
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

259
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,750
with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.

260
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:10,627
Deputy Minister Hennessy,

261
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,671
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

262
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:14,590
Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

263
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,258
and a member of the IRA,

264
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:18,886
you took part in similar events years ago.

265
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:23,265
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then

266
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,434
and what's happened in London recently?

267
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:29,313
Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.

268
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:32,524
We needed to break the cycle,

269
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:35,736
so we committed
to a political path which lead to...

270
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:39,990
So, if you say "hope,"

271
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:43,410
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

272
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,412
returning to the bombings?

273
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:50,042
I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.

274
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,378
They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises...

275
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,391
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem

276
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:07,976
rather than a political one.

277
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:12,022
People look for scapegoats, for a way out.

278
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,066
And for some, they are more than happy

279
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:17,361
to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.

280
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:28,539
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

281
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:31,166
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

282
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,627
Same as before. Fear and anger.

283
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,045
Anger directed at whom?

284
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,172
From the Prime Minister on down.

285
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:39,967
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

286
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:42,052
You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

287
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,346
Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?

288
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:46,515
You've a call waitin' on Line Two.

289
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,851
- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.

290
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:51,812
A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.

291
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:55,107
- What does he want?
- His daughter was killed in the bombing.

292
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,277
I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.

293
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,363
- He saw ya on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.

294
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,824
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

295
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,874
This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?

296
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:15,294
Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?

297
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:18,755
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

298
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,884
Because, you are the First Deputy Minister

299
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,679
and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.

300
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:30,392
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

301
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:33,478
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

302
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:35,272
Then please tell me someone

303
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:38,650
who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.

304
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:43,030
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

305
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,199
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.

306
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,284
You are very powerful man.

307
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,704
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

308
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:52,706
I do not work for terrorists.

309
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:57,502
IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.

310
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:00,380
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

311
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,091
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

312
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,885
because one end will bite.

313
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:09,598
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.

314
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,682
Good day.

315
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,977
You have a room?

316
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,147
These are important documents
that we must have today.

317
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:29,816
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,

318
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,652
apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange

319
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:35,280
and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

320
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:40,494
Yes, 329174-N for November.

321
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,997
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

322
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,207
Good day.

323
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,210
Yes? May I help you?

324
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,004
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

325
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:53,381
- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.

326
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,659
You're the one who's been phoning.

327
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,594
Yes. I phoned many times.

328
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:01,306
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.

329
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,143
- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.

330
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,395
Best do as the lady says.

331
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,315
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

332
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,316
He won't take no for an answer.

333
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,442
Just groceries.

334
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:17,322
Go now, before we make ya.

335
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:21,326
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

336
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,252
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

337
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:33,213
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

338
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:36,424
Well, take it off him.

339
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:39,886
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

340
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,304
Let him be.

341
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,699
As I explained before...

342
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,809
...I don't know who the bombers are.

343
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:48,728
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

344
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,356
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

345
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:56,027
People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.

346
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,530
If you do not know who they are,

347
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,324
I would like you to please find out.

348
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,875
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

349
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,086
When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.

350
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,380
I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.

351
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:18,925
Now I serve the politics of both sides,

352
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,428
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

353
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:28,184
Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

354
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:31,938
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?

355
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:37,319
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

356
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:41,072
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.

357
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:43,992
You will tell me who killed my child.

358
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:47,412
Again, I don't know.

359
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,584
You will change your mind.

360
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:59,090
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

361
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:16,710
I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.

362
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,180
You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.

363
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:30,974
Take her, take her.

364
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:33,643
- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.

365
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,020
Jesus.

366
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,701
Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?

367
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:51,953
No, thank you.

368
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,626
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

369
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:01,755
No one comes to mind.

370
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:06,760
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

371
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:09,095
Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.

372
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:12,140
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?

373
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:17,896
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

374
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:21,691
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

375
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:24,986
Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.

376
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,740
Hello?

377
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:32,535
It's him.

378
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,503
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

379
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:43,963
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

380
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,132
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

381
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,343
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

382
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:49,636
But you'll soon find out.

383
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,887
Give me the names.

384
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,515
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

385
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:54,598
We'll settle...

386
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:58,937
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

387
00:35:02,107 --> 00:35:04,859
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

388
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,402
He won't be hard to find.

389
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:10,031
Fuckin' Chinaman.

390
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,037
Uncle Liam? What's up?

391
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,293
I'll be there.

392
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:36,409
Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!

393
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,704
Don't move! She's wired to blow!

394
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:20,328
Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,

395
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:23,122
soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.

396
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:25,750
Gives an extra kick.

397
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,211
Not needed, but a nice touch.

398
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,838
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

399
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:32,507
So, he wanted us to see it.

400
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:35,236
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.

401
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,053
He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.

402
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:40,598
Micky.

403
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,978
We found him.
A B&B in Wellington Park.

404
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,438
- They found him.
- Grab him.

405
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:50,817
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

406
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:52,670
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

407
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,281
Hello.

408
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:58,574
I hear your office was bombed.

409
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:02,036
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

410
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,789
An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.

411
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,291
It's all being taken care of.

412
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:07,500
Why'd he do it?

413
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:11,170
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

414
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,131
He's not the only one of that mind.

415
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:16,926
- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.

416
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:20,555
But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

417
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,391
I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.

418
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:27,979
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

419
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,773
The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.

420
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:44,037
Top floor on the right.

421
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,582
Fuckin' get him!

422
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:21,235
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

423
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,696
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you

424
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,491
and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.

425
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:28,826
You are four men. Four.

426
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,870
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

427
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,705
and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.

428
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:33,831
What is goin' on?

429
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,045
Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.

430
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,464
Go on.

431
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:43,216
Get your things.

432
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,643
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

433
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,307
Go on through, he's expecting ya.

434
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:58,606
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

435
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:00,233
Well, look at ya.

436
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,252
- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?

437
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:04,276
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

438
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,821
So, how is New York treatin' ya?

439
00:42:05,905 --> 00:42:08,991
- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.

440
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,954
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

441
00:42:13,037 --> 00:42:15,498
He set off a bomb in my office,

442
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:18,167
put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

443
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:23,839
- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

444
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:28,636
I need your help with the London bombing.

445
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:32,014
Any idea who's behind it yet?

446
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:35,309
Not at all.

447
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:38,604
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...

448
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,374
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

449
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:41,941
Any fundraising now is impossible.

450
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:44,860
Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.

451
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:47,196
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

452
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:51,784
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

453
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,203
SO15?

454
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:56,539
He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,

455
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:59,750
and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.

456
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:00,835
Why me?

457
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:03,754
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

458
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,301
Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.

459
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:12,722
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

460
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:15,891
to go after one of our own, rogue or not,

461
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,060
there'll be the devil to pay.

462
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:21,814
So, can I count on you, Sean...

463
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:24,066
to be discreet?

464
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,861
Of course.

465
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:14,241
Right this way, sir.

466
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:15,326
Thank you very much.

467
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:27,755
You took your time.

468
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:31,717
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

469
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:39,975
I'll be back in a minute.

470
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:41,060
I'll be right here.

471
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:56,032
Jesus.

472
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:25,479
Mr. Morrison.

473
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:30,693
Commander Bromley.

474
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:35,197
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

475
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:38,200
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

476
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:40,995
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

477
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:42,913
You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit

478
00:45:42,997 --> 00:45:44,307
on the loose you know nothing about?

479
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:45,331
Yes, I am.

480
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:46,917
And the Semtex?

481
00:45:47,418 --> 00:45:48,728
They're raiding our dumps.

482
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,872
Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?

483
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:52,840
And your code word?

484
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:55,885
They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.

485
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:57,511
So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

486
00:45:58,512 --> 00:45:59,805
We've a plan.

487
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,308
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

488
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,327
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

489
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:06,187
you'll tell us which word they use.

490
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,457
Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.

491
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:10,065
Who else is involved in this plan?

492
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:11,609
Liam Hennessy.

493
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,153
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

494
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,996
Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

495
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,866
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

496
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:21,202
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

497
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:25,080
I've one condition.

498
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,752
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

499
00:46:30,085 --> 00:46:32,588
Then we take them down. Not you.

500
00:46:33,714 --> 00:46:35,299
This is non-negotiable.

501
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,759
We found some plastic bags in his room.

502
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,954
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

503
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:08,332
mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

504
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:10,167
How much damage can he do?

505
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:13,671
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

506
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:14,755
Jesus.

507
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:17,800
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

508
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:20,427
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

509
00:47:21,303 --> 00:47:22,596
You'll be safe here.

510
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,142
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

511
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:35,479
Benny!

512
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:49,845
Jesus Christ!

513
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,557
Move it! Move it!

514
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:09,782
Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

515
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:12,201
Get more men from Belfast.

516
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:15,746
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

517
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:30,219
It's another warning, Liam?

518
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:33,138
Aye. Nothing I can't handle.

519
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:35,641
First Belfast, now here.

520
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,601
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

521
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:39,394
The problem's being dealt with.

522
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:42,272
He is destroying our farmhouse,

523
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:45,317
intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

524
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:48,529
God, you can be so pompous sometimes.

525
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:51,156
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

526
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,616
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

527
00:51:52,699 --> 00:51:55,118
Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.

528
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:58,121
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,

529
00:51:58,205 --> 00:51:59,623
it's you he's after, not me.

530
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:01,643
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

531
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,294
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

532
00:52:04,378 --> 00:52:05,546
It's not worth the risk.

533
00:52:05,629 --> 00:52:08,069
Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.

534
00:52:10,008 --> 00:52:13,637
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

535
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,138
and other things, too.

536
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:17,641
But those days are gone.

537
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:52,509
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

538
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:56,638
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.

539
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:58,473
It looks good.

540
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,394
Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.

541
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:03,854
And if it's turned on?

542
00:53:04,688 --> 00:53:07,316
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

543
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:08,650
Any idea which plane yet?

544
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:12,321
No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

545
00:53:12,571 --> 00:53:15,949
One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.

546
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,955
Code word has changed...

547
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:24,291
As of tonight.

548
00:53:27,294 --> 00:53:29,379
My news editor's a complete twat.

549
00:53:29,463 --> 00:53:33,133
Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.

550
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:34,217
Makes perfect sense.

551
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,346
Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?

552
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:41,391
You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.

553
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:47,481
"Wife Attacks
Husband's Transgender Lover."

554
00:53:47,648 --> 00:53:49,399
Some serious news you're writing there.

555
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,945
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

556
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:54,748
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

557
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:58,325
- So, what do you do?
- Wealth management.

558
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:08,877
I'm Maggie.

559
00:54:09,086 --> 00:54:10,212
Ian.

560
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:17,052
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

561
00:54:17,177 --> 00:54:19,217
- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

562
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,392
Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.

563
00:54:23,475 --> 00:54:25,662
When they get here, they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

564
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:26,829
Is it enough to secure the farm?

565
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:30,273
Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.

566
00:54:31,692 --> 00:54:34,277
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

567
00:54:34,361 --> 00:54:36,005
- Right, yeah.
- That's completely unnecessary.

568
00:54:36,029 --> 00:54:38,615
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

569
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:40,117
I can manage this, all right?

570
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,702
I'll not be debating this!

571
00:54:42,494 --> 00:54:44,329
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

572
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:45,872
You're leaving...

573
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:05,754
Take him to the hospital.

574
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,395
- Get Mary to the airport. Go.
- Right.

575
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,404
Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.

576
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:20,699
He needed a line of sight.

577
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,660
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

578
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:27,539
- Go.
- Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

579
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:28,790
Go, go, go!

580
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,563
Come on. Go, go, go!

581
00:55:58,028 --> 00:56:01,198
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

582
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,583
Names!

583
00:57:21,027 --> 00:57:22,571
Jesus Christ!

584
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:25,448
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

585
00:57:26,658 --> 00:57:27,659
Why is it so hard?

586
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:30,620
He's ahead of us every step of the way.

587
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:32,663
We need more men.

588
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:34,833
We need 100 more men, at least.

589
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:37,752
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

590
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,550
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

591
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,051
and beat him at his own game.

592
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:47,804
My nephew?

593
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:50,515
Aye. If you can spare him.

594
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,004
Come on.

595
00:58:29,137 --> 00:58:30,847
How's Keri? Where is she?

596
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:31,932
Out.

597
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,060
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

598
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,938
Have you a restaurant in mind?

599
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:39,731
Haven't given it much thought.

600
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:45,070
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

601
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,656
A few personal matters.

602
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,784
I'm glad I made the list.

603
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:55,789
Mm. I think that works.

604
00:58:56,456 --> 00:58:57,749
What do you think?

605
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:24,734
You've gotta be kiddin'.

606
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,951
- Liam?
- Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.

607
00:59:33,451 --> 00:59:34,578
I'll pass it on.

608
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:37,205
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

609
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:40,709
Quan hit us again.

610
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:43,962
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

611
00:59:44,212 --> 00:59:45,839
Kavanagh and the boys went after him.

612
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:50,218
The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.

613
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:53,555
Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.

614
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:55,078
Which brings me to the point.

615
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:58,852
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

616
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,980
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

617
01:00:10,322 --> 01:00:14,492
Hey. How'd he sound?

618
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:17,329
Worried.

619
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,123
He's got a lot going on.

620
01:00:20,373 --> 01:00:22,573
Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.

621
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,502
And politically, so's he.

622
01:00:27,088 --> 01:00:28,548
Do you think he'll find them?

623
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,092
Yeah, if there's another blast.

624
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:35,347
The code word will lead us to
who's running them.

625
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:38,016
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

626
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:41,519
What the Council needs is new blood...

627
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:44,439
someone stronger, like you.

628
01:00:45,774 --> 01:00:47,776
He's afraid to use his power.

629
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:51,237
He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.

630
01:00:56,618 --> 01:00:59,371
I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.

631
01:01:00,497 --> 01:01:02,415
Liam found out who killed him.

632
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:07,712
A UVF death squad. Four men.

633
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:13,551
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

634
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:15,136
But he said no.

635
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:18,348
That the time for revenge is past.

636
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:22,936
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

637
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:26,231
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

638
01:01:26,314 --> 01:01:28,525
taking classes at the open university.

639
01:01:29,776 --> 01:01:33,947
It's not right. It's not.

640
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,066
Hugh McGrath's here.

641
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:24,117
I heard you're checking my dumps.

642
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,245
We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

643
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,914
Four came up short. Two were yours.

644
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:32,041
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

645
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,670
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

646
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:37,046
We were clear in that. Remember?

647
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:38,381
You were at the meeting.

648
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:40,943
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

649
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:44,554
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

650
01:04:47,515 --> 01:04:50,476
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

651
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:58,026
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

652
01:04:58,526 --> 01:05:00,028
Trust, or fear?

653
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:03,323
In your case, mostly fear.

654
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:05,742
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

655
01:05:07,744 --> 01:05:11,664
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

656
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:13,313
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

657
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:14,935
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

658
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:16,878
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

659
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:19,422
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

660
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:22,467
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

661
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,887
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

662
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:29,641
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

663
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:32,685
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

664
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:34,812
The bombing.

665
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:39,734
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

666
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:41,235
"Encouragement"?

667
01:05:41,444 --> 01:05:42,987
They kill civilians by the buckets.

668
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:47,283
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

669
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:48,743
The Brits are on the ropes.

670
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:52,872
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

671
01:05:52,956 --> 01:05:55,541
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

672
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:58,670
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

673
01:05:58,753 --> 01:06:02,340
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

674
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:03,716
And that's the way it has to be.

675
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,844
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

676
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:11,015
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

677
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:15,687
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

678
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,981
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

679
01:06:18,064 --> 01:06:19,941
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

680
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:24,904
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

681
01:06:26,155 --> 01:06:30,118
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

682
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:33,329
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

683
01:06:33,413 --> 01:06:35,623
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

684
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:37,959
Those days are long gone!

685
01:06:39,002 --> 01:06:41,504
That's not what I heard a few months ago.

686
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:47,427
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

687
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:52,765
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

688
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,767
You question my loyalty?

689
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:59,814
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

690
01:06:59,897 --> 01:07:03,276
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

691
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,403
not profiting off a divided one.

692
01:07:05,486 --> 01:07:08,606
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

693
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,136
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,

694
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,663
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

695
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:18,082
You're not the Liam I once knew.

696
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:19,667
You want the old me, huh?

697
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:22,587
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

698
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,838
Well then, hear this.

699
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:26,090
You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,

700
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:28,843
or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.

701
01:07:30,803 --> 01:07:33,848
Right. I'm going now.

702
01:07:34,057 --> 01:07:35,892
I'll be at my farm if you need me.

703
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,520
And take care of that Committee issue.

704
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:43,941
We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?

705
01:07:50,198 --> 01:07:51,449
Yeah.

706
01:07:55,578 --> 01:07:58,331
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

707
01:07:58,414 --> 01:08:00,333
No. No one, but Murphy.

708
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:02,877
Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.

709
01:08:04,003 --> 01:08:05,630
I wanna know how.

710
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:27,235
What a day, Charlie.

711
01:08:28,444 --> 01:08:30,822
What a day. Come on now, let's go.

712
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:37,787
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

713
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:39,830
Charlie.

714
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:12,697
You killed my dog?

715
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:15,241
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

716
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:17,410
Sit.

717
01:09:26,335 --> 01:09:27,420
I'm wearing a bomb.

718
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:32,675
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

719
01:09:32,758 --> 01:09:33,759
Now, give me the names.

720
01:09:33,843 --> 01:09:37,638
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

721
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:40,349
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

722
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:41,743
You're lying! Who killed my daughter?

723
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,437
I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

724
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:53,946
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

725
01:09:54,322 --> 01:09:57,700
Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?

726
01:09:58,743 --> 01:10:00,203
I know Semtex-H.

727
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,331
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

728
01:10:03,414 --> 01:10:04,707
Good for bombs and traps.

729
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,626
- In Vietnam?
- Yes.

730
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:10,129
Many American people died by Semtex-H.

731
01:10:10,213 --> 01:10:13,049
Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.

732
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,509
That's ironic.

733
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:20,681
I've read your history.
We both know about war.

734
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:24,018
We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.

735
01:10:25,561 --> 01:10:29,440
We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!

736
01:10:29,523 --> 01:10:31,609
To Almighty God, I don't know!

737
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:34,654
Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

738
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,323
When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

739
01:10:37,406 --> 01:10:40,993
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

740
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:43,913
I've changed that code word.

741
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:46,874
So, when they use it, I'll know.

742
01:10:53,923 --> 01:10:55,174
You have one day.

743
01:10:57,551 --> 01:10:59,231
What if they don't set off a bomb by then?

744
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,265
Twenty-four hours.

745
01:11:05,518 --> 01:11:09,397
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

746
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:13,963
We missed it the first time...

747
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:16,487
But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR,

748
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,532
and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.

749
01:11:19,865 --> 01:11:22,702
Now there, look, the back of his hand.

750
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:25,246
- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.

751
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:26,872
We're running comparatives now.

752
01:11:26,956 --> 01:11:29,709
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

753
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:37,258
Come on. Come on.

754
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:47,935
OK.

755
01:11:48,019 --> 01:11:49,145
There you go.

756
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:57,421
- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

757
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:00,257
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

758
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,676
- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

759
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:04,929
- Has Bromley phoned?
- No. Not yet.

760
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:07,619
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.

761
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,684
No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.

762
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:11,769
Good man.

763
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:30,955
Hennessy.

764
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:34,625
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

765
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,544
Maybe it wasn't them.

766
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:39,004
Press Association took the call.

767
01:13:39,088 --> 01:13:41,733
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation

768
01:13:41,757 --> 01:13:43,277
with the Brits and no more code words.

769
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,137
He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.

770
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,347
And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.

771
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:51,851
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

772
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:56,981
Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.

773
01:13:57,314 --> 01:13:59,358
Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.

774
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:02,445
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

775
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:05,906
I'll call the moment I have something.

776
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:07,741
It better be soon,

777
01:14:07,825 --> 01:14:10,586
or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

778
01:14:15,124 --> 01:14:16,542
A bus now.

779
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:19,295
For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.

780
01:14:19,378 --> 01:14:20,838
I'm sorry.

781
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:24,008
I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.

782
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,052
I've just come
from Downing Street.

783
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:29,013
The PM will consider the pardons,

784
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,474
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

785
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:33,893
And how in God's name do I do that?

786
01:14:33,976 --> 01:14:35,436
Find a way.

787
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:39,190
Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

788
01:14:39,482 --> 01:14:41,066
Belfast will erupt.

789
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,611
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

790
01:14:43,694 --> 01:14:46,530
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

791
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:48,508
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

792
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:50,284
I'll have my cell at all times.

793
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:12,473
How was London? Is Mary OK?

794
01:15:13,641 --> 01:15:15,893
You said to keep an eye on her,

795
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,604
and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.

796
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:26,278
I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?

797
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:28,155
She had no idea I was there.

798
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:31,450
And your nephew turns up.

799
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:34,912
He spent two hours in her room.

800
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:40,417
- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.

801
01:15:40,918 --> 01:15:41,919
And after he goes,

802
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,880
Mary comes down,

803
01:15:45,756 --> 01:15:47,967
and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.

804
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:11,740
It's done.

805
01:16:18,289 --> 01:16:21,875
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

806
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,211
Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?

807
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:25,504
The internal clock.

808
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:27,339
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

809
01:16:27,423 --> 01:16:29,883
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

810
01:16:29,967 --> 01:16:33,554
All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.

811
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:35,681
Perfect. What about our mule?

812
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:37,891
Sara just confirmed he's going.

813
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:41,228
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

814
01:16:41,312 --> 01:16:43,272
We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,

815
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:45,065
age 29, from Belfast.

816
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:49,111
O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.

817
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:50,738
Did two months in Hydebank.

818
01:16:51,363 --> 01:16:54,533
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

819
01:16:54,617 --> 01:16:55,909
We got a hit.

820
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:01,540
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

821
01:17:01,957 --> 01:17:04,793
It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

822
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:10,108
And the other two with him?

823
01:17:10,132 --> 01:17:11,972
I was about to get to them,
Minister.

824
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:14,678
That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.

825
01:17:21,727 --> 01:17:22,727
Yes.

826
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:24,938
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

827
01:17:27,024 --> 01:17:28,317
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

828
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:30,778
Are you sure now?

829
01:17:30,944 --> 01:17:31,945
Quite.

830
01:17:32,988 --> 01:17:36,408
We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

831
01:17:36,492 --> 01:17:40,245
Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.

832
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,915
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

833
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,918
I don't know O'Reilly.

834
01:17:47,002 --> 01:17:48,587
I haven't seen McGrath.

835
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,381
Let me help you with McGrath.

836
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,052
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

837
01:17:55,135 --> 01:17:57,429
I'm watching him coming up your drive.

838
01:17:58,347 --> 01:17:59,765
So, let's cut the shit.

839
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:03,519
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

840
01:18:03,602 --> 01:18:07,189
They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.

841
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:10,275
I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him

842
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:11,902
will sink your career...

843
01:18:12,152 --> 01:18:13,404
This time for good.

844
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:16,407
Or?

845
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,742
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

846
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:20,661
Names and locations of everyone.

847
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:23,455
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

848
01:18:23,539 --> 01:18:26,667
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

849
01:18:28,794 --> 01:18:29,794
Jim.

850
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:39,304
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

851
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:49,690
Give me your phone.

852
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:51,501
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

853
01:18:53,318 --> 01:18:56,113
Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.

854
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:00,075
- A London bus, for Christ sake!
- Now hold on.

855
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,452
Not even fuckin' warnings!

856
01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:03,579
Sixteen dead.

857
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:06,373
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

858
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:07,916
to get your war back on.

859
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,669
The plan had no balls.

860
01:19:10,753 --> 01:19:12,838
This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.

861
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:14,882
You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.

862
01:19:14,965 --> 01:19:16,675
By killing women and children?

863
01:19:17,426 --> 01:19:19,511
You can't restrain yourself.

864
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,346
You never could. Well, it's over.

865
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:25,350
Their names, aliases, and location.

866
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:28,937
You know I can't do that.

867
01:19:29,104 --> 01:19:30,856
That's me being nice.

868
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:33,484
Now write. And it better match
what I already know.

869
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:37,237
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

870
01:19:37,946 --> 01:19:39,448
You used me.

871
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:43,202
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

872
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:45,329
You're a disgrace to the cause.

873
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:49,374
Four men and a woman.

874
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:55,297
Maggie Dunn?

875
01:19:55,506 --> 01:19:58,467
Aye. You call her that.

876
01:19:59,343 --> 01:20:01,595
Sara Mackay's her real name.

877
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:05,849
She works for you?

878
01:20:06,725 --> 01:20:08,268
Bloody right.

879
01:20:08,352 --> 01:20:09,686
Checks and balances.

880
01:20:13,315 --> 01:20:18,487
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

881
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,407
which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,

882
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:26,453
she will lead them straight back to you.

883
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:29,248
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

884
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:32,960
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

885
01:20:33,919 --> 01:20:35,838
We both know that can't happen.

886
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:41,260
You gave me up to the Brits?

887
01:20:41,593 --> 01:20:45,013
You tout bastard!

888
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:46,682
You gave yourself up.

889
01:20:47,474 --> 01:20:51,186
They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

890
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,313
who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.

891
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:56,316
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

892
01:21:00,696 --> 01:21:02,489
You broke every rule, Hughie.

893
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:08,370
And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.

894
01:21:13,584 --> 01:21:14,626
A final thing.

895
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:18,004
My wife?

896
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,841
What about her?

897
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:31,643
She hates you because of her brother.

898
01:21:32,519 --> 01:21:34,146
And so she reached out to me.

899
01:21:34,354 --> 01:21:38,025
So, yes, I helped her...

900
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:40,027
And she helped me.

901
01:21:58,503 --> 01:22:00,589
- Yes.
- Bromley.

902
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:03,008
I got your names.

903
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:14,978
Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.

904
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,273
Did you cum?

905
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:21,652
No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.

906
01:23:06,863 --> 01:23:09,992
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

907
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,910
You're gonna have to get used to it.

908
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:17,499
Practice, practice, practice.

909
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:28,927
I'm close.

910
01:23:29,094 --> 01:23:33,181
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

911
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:38,020
I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.

912
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:41,356
The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

913
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,483
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

914
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:48,613
Either way, Sean, you end this, now.

915
01:23:49,072 --> 01:23:51,241
- You hear me?
- Understood.

916
01:25:25,377 --> 01:25:27,129
You know why you're still alive?

917
01:25:27,379 --> 01:25:30,298
You want the names?

918
01:25:31,341 --> 01:25:36,054
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

919
01:25:38,181 --> 01:25:40,183
Five names and their location in London.

920
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:43,603
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

921
01:25:45,063 --> 01:25:47,190
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

922
01:25:48,483 --> 01:25:50,235
You fought in the army.

923
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:53,780
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

924
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:56,241
Two tours, Special Forces.

925
01:25:59,744 --> 01:26:03,123
You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?

926
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:04,749
I fought for the regiment.

927
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:09,629
Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.

928
01:26:11,798 --> 01:26:12,966
Family?

929
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,634
A brother.

930
01:26:16,428 --> 01:26:17,846
The rest have passed away.

931
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,847
Come in.

932
01:27:04,976 --> 01:27:06,311
Take a seat, Sean.

933
01:27:10,273 --> 01:27:13,610
Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.

934
01:27:13,902 --> 01:27:17,239
Aye. Quan got the drop on me.

935
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:21,201
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

936
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,995
When the bombers called in about the bus,

937
01:27:25,163 --> 01:27:27,290
they didn't use a code word,

938
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,292
because someone tipped them off.

939
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:34,130
Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.

940
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:37,259
You and me.

941
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:40,595
Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.

942
01:27:41,096 --> 01:27:44,599
What if I told you I had Murphy stay

943
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:46,685
and watch Mary in London?

944
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:52,816
My own flesh and blood.

945
01:27:53,275 --> 01:27:54,192
Liam, I'm so sorry.

946
01:27:54,276 --> 01:27:56,528
I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.

947
01:27:58,405 --> 01:28:02,075
All I wanna know is, what was discussed

948
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,745
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

949
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:08,206
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

950
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,332
No. Never.

951
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:12,395
She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.

952
01:28:12,419 --> 01:28:14,897
When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,

953
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,232
but she never let on about McGrath.

954
01:28:16,256 --> 01:28:18,425
Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?

955
01:28:18,508 --> 01:28:20,844
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

956
01:28:20,927 --> 01:28:23,847
- She thought they wouldn't be of use.
- So, she steered the conversation?

957
01:28:24,139 --> 01:28:25,640
Well, yes, I guess she did.

958
01:28:25,724 --> 01:28:28,810
Ah. A good manipulator, she is.

959
01:28:28,893 --> 01:28:30,061
So, she told the bombers?

960
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:33,106
She told McGrath, McGrath told them.

961
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:34,691
Thick as thieves, they were.

962
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:38,194
She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.

963
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:41,323
She used you.

964
01:28:42,115 --> 01:28:43,408
- Liam, I...
- Shut up!

965
01:28:55,962 --> 01:28:57,839
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

966
01:28:59,299 --> 01:29:01,926
And after that,
I have one final task for you.

967
01:29:03,261 --> 01:29:04,679
And when that's done...

968
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:09,059
go back to New York, son.

969
01:29:37,962 --> 01:29:39,005
Thank you.

970
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:51,851
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

971
01:29:52,477 --> 01:29:54,979
Zero. Echo One's
toward the target house. Copy.

972
01:29:55,688 --> 01:29:58,650
Echo One has entered
the target house and unsighted to me.

973
01:29:59,317 --> 01:30:02,278
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

974
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:03,655
Thank Christ for that.

975
01:30:05,073 --> 01:30:08,243
Sierra call signs. Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

976
01:30:08,326 --> 01:30:09,911
Sierra Two, roger that.

977
01:30:11,538 --> 01:30:13,081
Sierra Three, roger that.

978
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:21,214
X-Ray One on balcony.

979
01:30:25,176 --> 01:30:26,856
Echo One approaching front door.

980
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:42,944
How'd it go?

981
01:30:43,945 --> 01:30:44,946
It's done.

982
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:55,139
I have visual. X-Ray One
and Echo One have left the room.

983
01:30:55,165 --> 01:30:56,624
All other X-Rays remain.

984
01:31:07,802 --> 01:31:08,970
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

985
01:31:09,053 --> 01:31:11,598
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

986
01:31:11,764 --> 01:31:12,764
Roger that.

987
01:31:34,913 --> 01:31:36,164
He's a slobbering oaf.

988
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:37,539
It had to be done.

989
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,793
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

990
01:31:41,419 --> 01:31:43,463
Look, I know what you
went through. All right?

991
01:31:43,546 --> 01:31:45,173
Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?

992
01:31:45,882 --> 01:31:48,194
Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

993
01:31:48,218 --> 01:31:49,469
How would that be?

994
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:51,429
Taking a shower.

995
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:54,890
Next.

996
01:32:14,202 --> 01:32:15,762
X-Ray One entering living room.

997
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:19,832
All X-Rays now complete in living room.

998
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,627
All call signs
move to your final rendezvous.

999
01:33:02,417 --> 01:33:04,669
X-Rays and Echo complete in living room.

1000
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:17,307
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

1001
01:33:18,016 --> 01:33:19,892
Fox One, you have control.

1002
01:33:19,976 --> 01:33:21,978
Roger that. I have control.

1003
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:23,604
Standby. Standby.

1004
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:29,235
Stop, stop, stop!

1005
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,403
Wait!

1006
01:33:37,493 --> 01:33:39,871
Sierra call signs, report what's going on.

1007
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:42,123
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

1008
01:33:42,206 --> 01:33:44,834
Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,

1009
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:47,962
and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.

1010
01:33:48,087 --> 01:33:51,090
Our gas works fine. There's no problem.

1011
01:33:51,924 --> 01:33:53,968
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

1012
01:33:54,052 --> 01:33:56,721
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

1013
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,853
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

1014
01:34:03,936 --> 01:34:06,564
By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.

1015
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:09,984
All right. Just a second.

1016
01:34:22,997 --> 01:34:25,309
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

1017
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:27,001
Thank you. I will be very fast.

1018
01:34:32,757 --> 01:34:33,841
This way.

1019
01:34:56,989 --> 01:34:58,366
Can I see the boiler, please?

1020
01:34:58,449 --> 01:35:00,576
Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?

1021
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:08,709
Open it up.

1022
01:35:20,054 --> 01:35:21,054
All right.

1023
01:35:41,868 --> 01:35:43,911
All call signs, standby, standby.

1024
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:27,765
All call signs, go!

1025
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:40,695
Get down! Get down!

1026
01:37:40,778 --> 01:37:43,447
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1027
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:46,867
Room clear!

1028
01:37:51,789 --> 01:37:52,789
X-Rays down.

1029
01:37:52,832 --> 01:37:54,417
What about Echo?

1030
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,043
She's alive, under control.

1031
01:37:57,503 --> 01:37:58,588
Who planned this?

1032
01:37:59,297 --> 01:38:00,381
Go fuck yourself.

1033
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:08,848
What's this, eh? Your next bomb?

1034
01:38:09,015 --> 01:38:10,141
Go fuck yourself.

1035
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:16,772
Talk, you rotten slag!

1036
01:38:25,281 --> 01:38:26,741
It's too late.

1037
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:30,953
Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.

1038
01:38:31,037 --> 01:38:35,249
What's that? A plane? Which plane?

1039
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:36,542
Which plane?

1040
01:38:37,168 --> 01:38:38,586
Open her shirt.

1041
01:38:46,344 --> 01:38:47,511
This is how it works.

1042
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:52,224
I ask questions. You answer.

1043
01:38:52,892 --> 01:38:57,897
That's right. Flight 136 to Rome.
Passenger name Ian Wood.

1044
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,980
Bomb's in his laptop.

1045
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:01,400
Set to go off at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

1046
01:39:01,484 --> 01:39:04,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

1047
01:39:04,195 --> 01:39:07,615
Flight 136 to Rome
has been further delayed.

1048
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:09,742
We apologize for the inconvenience.

1049
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:12,161
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

1050
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:15,164
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1051
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:17,541
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1052
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,336
Is there an Ian Wood here? Ian Wood?

1053
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:25,257
Ian Wood? Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

1054
01:39:26,676 --> 01:39:28,594
What's going on? What's going on?

1055
01:39:28,678 --> 01:39:30,930
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1056
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:33,140
That's me. I'm Ian Wood.

1057
01:39:33,224 --> 01:39:35,017
Ian Wood!

1058
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:36,143
I'm Ian Wood.

1059
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:39,121
- Is that your laptop?
- Yeah.

1060
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:43,109
Move! Move! Move!

1061
01:39:43,192 --> 01:39:45,986
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

1062
01:39:46,445 --> 01:39:48,322
Get down! Get down!

1063
01:39:48,823 --> 01:39:50,533
Get down! Get down!

1064
01:39:50,616 --> 01:39:52,159
Move! Move!

1065
01:39:52,243 --> 01:39:53,786
Get down! Get down! Move!

1066
01:39:53,869 --> 01:39:58,374
Get outta the way! Get out!
Move here! Get out!

1067
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:00,918
Move!

1068
01:40:21,814 --> 01:40:25,568
She said a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1069
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:28,946
Started shooting, killed everyone but her,
and then walked out the door.

1070
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,489
She said he was a Chinaman?

1071
01:40:30,573 --> 01:40:32,533
Affirmative. About 60 years old.

1072
01:40:32,616 --> 01:40:34,428
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

1073
01:40:34,452 --> 01:40:37,621
Good work. Fox Hunt is now terminated.

1074
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:39,415
No loose ends.

1075
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:40,958
Understood.

1076
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:55,139
It's Bromley. I need an AP
out to all city-district units

1077
01:40:55,222 --> 01:40:57,725
from Wapping High Street to the A1203.

1078
01:40:58,893 --> 01:41:03,856
Suspect's an Asian male, 61 years of age,
five feet, eight inches, 11 stone.

1079
01:41:04,523 --> 01:41:06,400
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1080
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:09,612
He's armed
and has U.S. Special Forces training.

1081
01:41:09,695 --> 01:41:11,447
Use extreme caution.

1082
01:41:40,351 --> 01:41:41,351
Yes.

1083
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:44,313
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

1084
01:41:44,396 --> 01:41:46,249
Because of your timely information,
we stopped it.

1085
01:41:46,273 --> 01:41:47,942
I wanted to thank you personally.

1086
01:41:49,527 --> 01:41:51,111
Thank God you're OK.

1087
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:54,657
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

1088
01:41:55,074 --> 01:41:57,409
whom you called "Maggie."

1089
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:03,332
She gave a reporter the bomb
that was to have been put on my flight.

1090
01:42:03,624 --> 01:42:05,793
She also carried out the bus carnage,

1091
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:10,548
and is directly connected to you,
and McGrath.

1092
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:13,843
We have call-pens going
to and from her off the cell tower

1093
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:15,511
by your farm and town homes.

1094
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:18,138
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

1095
01:42:18,222 --> 01:42:20,808
- consistent with your mutual activities.
- Katherine...

1096
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:24,103
I've spoken to the PM.
He's agreed to keep you in office for now.

1097
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:27,022
I'm issuing pardons
for five On-the-Runs, one is your cousin.

1098
01:42:27,106 --> 01:42:30,734
But, make no mistake,
Deputy First Minister, you are ours now.

1099
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:33,779
I say jump, you say where.

1100
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:36,407
You're on the next flight back to London.

1101
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,535
Tomorrow you'll brief
SO15 and myself on everything you know.

1102
01:42:40,744 --> 01:42:42,329
All of it.

1103
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:37,217
Good evening, sir.

1104
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:17,174
How did you find me?

1105
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:20,678
I gave you the names, like I said.

1106
01:44:24,807 --> 01:44:29,311
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

1107
01:44:30,813 --> 01:44:32,231
For whatever it's worth...

1108
01:44:33,857 --> 01:44:36,318
I never intended to hurt your daughter

1109
01:44:37,319 --> 01:44:38,946
or any of those people.

1110
01:44:41,907 --> 01:44:43,075
Send.

1111
01:44:45,285 --> 01:44:46,286
Do it!

1112
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:05,097
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

1113
01:45:05,848 --> 01:45:08,225
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1114
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:12,563
Good-bye, Mr. Hennessy.

1115
01:46:02,696 --> 01:46:03,739
Yes?

1116
01:46:03,822 --> 01:46:06,533
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1117
01:46:06,617 --> 01:46:07,618
Where?

1118
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:10,746
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned.

1119
01:46:10,829 --> 01:46:12,498
Do I send in a team?

1120
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:15,042
No.

1121
01:46:16,418 --> 01:46:18,420
I believe we owe this chap something.

1122
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:22,508
Keep back for now.
Observe and report only.

1123
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:23,592
Yes, sir.
