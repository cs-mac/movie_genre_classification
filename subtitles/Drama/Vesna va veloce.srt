00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,716
"...I bore you upon
a huge eagle's wings

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,071
"and brought you unto Myself..."

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,953
Torah - Exodus - chapter XIX - 4

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,839
<i>They had been forgotten</i>
<i>on their mountaintops</i>

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,388
<i>near Gondar.</i>

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,792
<i>Yet, since the dawn of time,</i>

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,431
<i>the Ethiopian Jews,</i>
<i>known as the "Falashas",</i>

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,150
<i>dreamed of returning</i>
<i>to their homeland, the Holy Land,</i>

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,072
<i>Jerusalem.</i>

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,390
<i>1984.</i>

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,031
<i>With Israeli and U.S. Aid,</i>

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,119
<i>a vast program was undertaken</i>
<i>from November to January 1985</i>

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,915
<i>to transport the Ethiopian Jews</i>
<i>to Israel.</i>

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,750
<i>The Falashas were returned</i>

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,190
<i>and finally recognized</i>
<i>as descendants of King Solomon</i>

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,835
<i>and the Queen of Sheba.</i>

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,917
<i>The Israeli secret service</i>

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,998
<i>carried out the operation</i>
<i>on the sly,</i>

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,237
<i>keeping it from the Mengitsu</i>

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>pro-Soviet regime who had</i>
<i>prohibited their emigration.</i>

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,393
<i>The Falashas walked from Ethiopia</i>
<i>to Sudan,</i>

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,673
<i>a Muslim country under Charia law.</i>

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,988
<i>There, they had to hide their</i>
<i>Jewish identity under pain of death</i>

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,795
<i>In Sudan, planes awaited</i>
<i>to take them to Israel.</i>

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,552
<i>On the road,</i>
<i>hundreds died of sickness,</i>

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,639
<i>famine, exhaustion.</i>
<i>Others were killed by bandits.</i>

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,516
<i>In the 1980s,</i>

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,276
<i>the Sudanese camps welcomed</i>

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,598
<i>thousands of Africans from 26</i>
<i>countries who were prey to famine:</i>

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,069
<i>Christians, Muslims,</i>

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,796
<i>and clandestine Jews.</i>

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,950
<i>The first secret airlift operation,</i>
<i>known as "Operation Moses",</i>

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>saved 8,000 Ethiopian Jews.</i>

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,868
<i>4,000</i>

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,753
<i>died on the road</i>
<i>between Ethiopia and Sudan,</i>

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,994
<i>murdered, tortured</i>

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,999
<i>or suffering from famine,</i>
<i>thirst and exhaustion.</i>

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,948
<i>Many children reached the Holy</i>
<i>Land alone or as orphans.</i>

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,392
Live and Become

40
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,511
Mommy, eat!

41
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,710
No, I'm not hungry.

42
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,674
Wake up.

43
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,759
Go!

44
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,193
Go!

45
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,673
Don't cry.

46
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,519
Go!

47
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,675
Go, live and become!

48
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,638
And don't come back.

49
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,275
Don't come back until then!

50
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,955
Go!

51
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,958
Hana, is this your son?
Didn't he die this morning?

52
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,069
This is my son!

53
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,031
I saved him this morning.
Tell him.

54
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,235
Okay.

55
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,473
A man doesn't cry.

56
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,153
When we get to the Holy Land,
we'll all be white,

57
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,235
won't we, Mommy?

58
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,675
It's a land flowing
with milk and honey...

59
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,275
Paradise on Earth, my sweet.

60
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,234
Mommy.

61
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,038
Excuse me, my son,

62
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,150
are there many albinos in Israel?

63
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,709
- You mean "whites"?
- Yes, whites.

64
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,790
In Israel, all Jews are white.

65
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,719
Aren't we in our country yet, my son?

66
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,672
Haven't we reached Jerusalem?

67
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,871
We have, father,

68
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,078
we are in our country.
All of the country is Jerusalem!

69
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,590
Israel is the country
of our ancestors: Jerusalem!

70
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,989
No! No!

71
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,712
What's wrong?

72
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,274
What's wrong?

73
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,910
Calm down! Calm down!

74
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,720
Israel has plenty of water!

75
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,588
There's enough water!
It's okay.

76
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,589
Listen to me! It's okay!

77
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,074
It's not my fault!

78
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,799
It's not my fault!

79
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,156
It's not my fault!

80
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,348
Like this.

81
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,749
Like this.

82
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,316
You see?

83
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,991
You see? You do it.

84
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,795
Let me.

85
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,238
Like this.

86
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,748
Enjoy your meal.

87
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,559
Fork.

88
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,919
Like this.

89
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,993
Silence!

90
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,158
Silence, please!

91
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,316
For the first time our black brothers
have been brought out of Africa,

92
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,271
not to be sold

93
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,032
or made slaves,

94
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,956
but to be saved,

95
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,518
liberated!

96
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,788
Welcome!

97
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,070
On behalf of my entire community,
I thank Israel

98
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,953
for having helped us
return to Jerusalem,

99
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,036
and for having saved us.

100
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,315
What's his name?

101
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,638
- Adisalem.
- That's not a Jewish name.

102
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,474
Yes it is.

103
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,315
Adis means "new",
and alem means "world".

104
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,314
Adisalem means "new world".

105
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,397
We'll call him Eddy.

106
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,993
Write it: Eddy.

107
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,558
Are you sure you're Jewish?

108
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,836
I'll ask you one last time.

109
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,835
I personally don't believe it.

110
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,157
Nobody knows you here.

111
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,111
What village are you from?

112
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,559
Have you forgotten?

113
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,309
What is your grandfather's name?
And your great grandfather?

114
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,398
Can't you remember?

115
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,834
Follow me.

116
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,353
Come on.

117
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,475
Help me.
I can't recognize them on my own.

118
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,632
We must be careful.

119
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,835
Don't forget,

120
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,190
your name is Solomon.

121
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,390
Your father was called Isaac,

122
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,071
your grandfather, Yakov,
your brother, Yakov,

123
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,998
and your sister, Aster.

124
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,073
They all died on the road to Sudan.

125
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,789
The name of our village is Weleka.

126
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,669
Repeat.

127
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,157
My name is Solomon,
my cow's name was Mandala.

128
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,039
No, just Solomon, not the cow!

129
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,156
Are you circumcised?

130
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,393
I believe you.

131
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,874
Is this your son?

132
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,079
What's his name?

133
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,389
Solomon!

134
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,591
Solomon... Schlomo.

135
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,676
"Schlomo", do you understand?

136
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,433
Your father and your grandfather?

137
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,756
We're from Weleka.

138
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,674
Everyone knows us here.

139
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,349
Qes Amhra, too.

140
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,109
My husband's name was Isaac,

141
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,914
my daughter, Aster,

142
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,554
my youngest son, Yakov.

143
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,513
They're all dead.

144
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,914
Solomon is all I have left.

145
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,079
Schlomo.

146
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,109
Would you like to go to school,
Schlomo?

147
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,634
Of course!

148
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,359
With her!

149
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,034
You'll stay together. Don't worry.

150
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,075
Through there. They come in and out.
There's a door!

151
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,396
There are a lot of them.

152
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,669
She's getting better.

153
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,077
She's in good hands now.

154
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,591
You can see her later.

155
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,437
Take off your coat.

156
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,794
Do you want to watch TV?

157
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,838
Nobody came out of the TV.

158
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,554
They haven't gone to bed yet.

159
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,630
Keep your secret.

160
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,358
Don't say a word to anybody...

161
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,833
Never.

162
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,709
Otherwise, they'll send you
back to Ethiopia.

163
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,473
You are my son,

164
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,436
a Jew from Weleka.

165
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,558
Learn our traditions.

166
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,950
That way you'll be safe.

167
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,316
Don't forget the names of your
parents and your grandparents.

168
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,359
Isaac,

169
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,309
Hana,

170
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,388
Yakov,

171
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,832
Sura.

172
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,355
And don't forget your mother

173
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,158
who is still over there.

174
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,350
Never!

175
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,313
One day, you'll see her again.

176
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,631
Because you'll live!

177
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,919
Don't die.

178
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,112
Don't cry.

179
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,199
Hello, children.

180
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,315
I'm the director of the school...

181
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,438
Hello, my name's Zwi.
What's your name?

182
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,793
Schlomo,
I'm the school psychiatrist...

183
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,119
Cow.

184
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,239
Girl.

185
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,675
Boy.

186
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,358
Bird.

187
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,238
Hat.

188
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,954
Fish.

189
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,679
Watch.

190
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,509
Banana.

191
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,433
Sit down.

192
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,993
Hello, everybody.

193
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,036
Do any children
have family still left

194
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,798
in Ethiopia or Sudan?

195
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,630
You're gonna eat this!

196
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,277
Eat, I say!

197
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,196
Stop! Have you lost your minds?

198
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,469
Let him go!

199
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,398
It'll be OK.

200
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,555
No!

201
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,911
It's not my fault!

202
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,749
Mommy,

203
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,396
I have to become like them.

204
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,590
I don't want to change.

205
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,315
How will you recognize me?

206
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,718
Please, let me come home...

207
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,435
Well?

208
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,709
Can't find him.

209
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,116
I've had it.
This kid's driving me nuts.

210
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,677
Not in the park or the rooms.

211
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,711
We've woken everyone.
I've called the police.

212
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,068
Come on.

213
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,034
Schlomo, stop!

214
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,313
Leave him alone.
He's just a child. Leave him!

215
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,756
12 kilometers on foot!

216
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,592
- He's only 9 years old.
- This child...

217
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,713
He learns Hebrew quickly
and is very interested in school.

218
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,516
I see his violence,
but we've got to give him some time.

219
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,671
I want a solution now.

220
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,077
He needs a stricter school
that will control him better.

221
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,392
Maybe Echel Avraham.

222
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,318
Is there any surviving
family member?

223
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,557
Nobody from his old village
wants him.

224
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,395
Do you have any ideas? Tell me!

225
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,358
Schlomo ran away, barefoot,

226
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,515
wrapped in a sheet.

227
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,676
Which way did he go? Which way?

228
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,836
Towards the south, Ethiopia.

229
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,918
Why?

230
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,873
Maybe he's trying
to return to his old life,

231
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,468
with his mother and family.

232
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,355
Time and another school
will never bring

233
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,479
Schlomo's mother and family back.

234
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,439
It's impossible.

235
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,675
I understand.

236
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,076
That's fine. Thanks.

237
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,234
Come in, please.

238
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,756
Schlomo, your adoptive parents,

239
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,991
Yael and Yoram Harrari.

240
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,549
112 horsepower, automatic,

241
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,878
it can go up to 200 km/h.

242
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,916
Volvo, the best car in the world.

243
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,476
Do you like cars, Schlomo?

244
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,195
You can call us "daddy"
and "mommy", if you want.

245
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,117
This is your brother and sister:

246
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,912
Tali and Dany.

247
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,839
Look, the stadium!

248
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,476
You can come and run here
if you want. I'll sign you up.

249
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,359
You like to run, don't you?

250
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,358
Gramps, they're here.
Come and see.

251
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,389
They're here. Daddy, daddy!

252
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,159
Hello, my cherubs.

253
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,999
Not a word about his
dead parents, okay?

254
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,913
This is Schlomo.

255
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,793
This is Tali,

256
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,598
Dany... and Gramps.

257
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,518
Yoram's father.

258
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,754
You're a polite boy.

259
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,350
We never looked somebody in the eye
where I grew up either.

260
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,959
He grew up in Egypt.

261
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,997
- Near Ethiopia.
- That's all you have?

262
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,197
What, I didn't say anything
about his dead parents!

263
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,793
Your room.

264
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,797
It was mine before.

265
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,917
You can put whatever you want
on the walls.

266
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,156
I forgot the presents!

267
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,472
Right... the presents.

268
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,357
This is from us, Yoram and myself.

269
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,313
My present.

270
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,833
If you want to write a diary,
I have one.

271
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,634
This is good luck where I come from.

272
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,074
A kippa, from us.

273
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,073
- Hello!
- Hello, Mother.

274
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,754
- Is he here?
- Yes.

275
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,518
Did he get here by bus?

276
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,399
No, we picked him up.

277
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,279
Where is he?

278
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,313
That's French.

279
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,158
Our native language...

280
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,632
Is this him?
He's so adorable!

281
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,310
You take plane... no afraid?

282
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,958
Mother, he speaks Hebrew.

283
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,639
Hebrew in Ethiopia?

284
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,393
Is he sick?
He's pale. I mean... pale-black.

285
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,994
- He's fine, mother!
- Are you sure? Have you checked?

286
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,795
Go see Dr. Cohen. He's wonderful.

287
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,751
He doesn't need to.
He's doing fine!

288
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,152
"Injara",
the traditional Ethiopian dish.

289
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,035
Listen, Schlomo...

290
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,037
I'd like to tell you that we know.

291
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,230
Everything.

292
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,517
We prefer to be clear...

293
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,193
I wanted to tell...

294
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,833
No, it's us...

295
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,871
We're your parents now.

296
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,958
Schlomo, we're left-wing people.

297
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,555
- I wanted to tell...
- We like to be frank,

298
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,594
honest, and respect others.

299
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,997
So I'll be frank, Schlomo.

300
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,074
We...

301
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,433
we're not religious.

302
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,234
We know that in Ethiopia, you were.

303
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,988
You have always defended the Torah

304
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,310
and survived because of your dreams
to return to Jerusalem.

305
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,708
We respect that,
even if we're not practicing.

306
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,831
If you'd like, tonight,

307
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,070
we'll pray with you.

308
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,631
We'll repeat after you.

309
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,159
Thank you.
That's nice,

310
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,436
but not tonight... Please.
It's just that... not tonight.

311
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,353
Let's sit down.

312
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,439
Don't you like it?
Did she mess up?

313
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,913
Stomach ache.

314
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,395
When I say that, it doesn't work!

315
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,357
They make me finish my plate.

316
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,590
Who do you like better,
Mickey or Donald?

317
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,109
They don't have Mickey
in his country, dummy.

318
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,668
What sport do you like, soccer?

319
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,272
Walking.

320
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,708
Good night.

321
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,711
If you need anything,
come and wake me up.

322
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,591
Mommy, come here! Mommy!

323
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,948
Shut up!

324
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,594
He's really big and muscly!

325
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,271
He's handsome as a prince!

326
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,798
Everyone.

327
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,236
We have a new student:

328
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,477
Schlomo Harrari.

329
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,632
Take a seat, please.

330
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,235
Let's carry on with the lesson,
please...

331
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,713
Did you have a good day, darling?

332
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,631
Hello, Mrs. Zilbermann.

333
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,435
How are you?

334
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,795
So, so...

335
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,874
I've brought you
some fish and oranges.

336
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,275
What?

337
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,317
Fish and oranges!

338
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,511
And the brownie?

339
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,358
I forgot!

340
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,033
Next week.

341
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,593
I'll take down the garbage.

342
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,551
Thanks a lot.

343
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,554
Bye-bye!

344
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,159
Take care of yourself!

345
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,311
Where did we receive the Torah?

346
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,951
- On Mount Sinai.
- Exactly!

347
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,719
And who brought us the Torah?

348
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,948
Moses.

349
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,993
Very good.

350
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,476
Who is the founder of our religion?

351
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,795
Jesus!

352
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,636
Because... Jesus...

353
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,560
converted... he... first Jew...

354
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,354
who became a Christian...
Christianity...

355
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,993
He suffered...

356
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,350
And that's why he walked on water,

357
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,712
turned the other cheek... got a slap.

358
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,157
And Jesus thought...
God's only child,

359
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,118
but... so nice
to have brothers and sisters.

360
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,758
And his mother... is his mother,

361
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,514
but Jesus mustn't say a word...

362
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,598
"Genesis".

363
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,949
"In the beginning
there was heaven and earth..."

364
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,235
One morning I'll wake up,
and I'll be all white.

365
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,196
And I'll speak Yiddish
like a real Jew.

366
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,158
Like Mrs. Zilbermann,

367
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,077
from the first floor,

368
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,715
who's losing her hair
and has a hard time getting around.

369
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,837
Her feet have swollen up
these past few weeks.

370
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,754
I buy her milk and bread.

371
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,274
And brownies. She loves them.

372
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,193
She's constantly saying:
"Oy, oy, oy, mein Gott!"

373
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,714
That's what it is to be Jewish!

374
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,675
Mother's Day

375
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,355
Is Yael OK?

376
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,993
Yes, don't worry.

377
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,754
You're not happy it's me?

378
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,591
Sorry, you're not happy?

379
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,159
I understand French.

380
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,958
Okay... okay.

381
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,398
Was school OK?

382
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,117
I have a surprise for you.

383
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,230
Do you understand "surprise"?

384
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,597
There are good and bad ones...

385
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,712
and big and little surprises.

386
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,679
I have a good one!

387
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,230
Yoram, it's broke!

388
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,476
- What did you touch?
- Me, no!

389
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,352
It's not a toy, damn it!

390
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,629
You say play.

391
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,320
I didn't say to fiddle with it.
How can I work now?

392
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,873
I don't know what he did.
He broke it!

393
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,955
Does it work?

394
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,439
Of course it works!

395
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,190
Your father's got a bug
sometimes.

396
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,232
There are too many pieces
to change inside.

397
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,670
Murad Khelfi,
our computer genius.

398
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,558
A pillar of our company.

399
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,468
Schlomo, I suppose.

400
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,156
He can't stop talking about you.

401
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,754
Listen, if they ever seriously
get on your nerves,

402
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,440
you can come and stay at my place.

403
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,068
OK?

404
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,037
When the Queen of Sheba,
your great, great, great-grandmother,

405
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,355
crossed Egypt for Ethiopia

406
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,710
after her meeting with King Solomon,

407
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,275
I could've shut the door
and never let her pass.

408
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,950
She was beautiful, you know.

409
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,117
I could've taken advantage.
But I didn't.

410
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,553
Do you know why?

411
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,790
I wanted to meet you.
I wanted you to exist.

412
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,709
- What do you say to Grandpa?
- Thank you.

413
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,234
You tell me how I became a Jew.

414
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,639
But I'm not telling you how
you got out of that dump Alexandria.

415
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,949
Dump?

416
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,749
Where did you get that?

417
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,433
Alexandria, a dump?

418
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,353
Heathen, ignoramus!

419
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,472
Black savage! Baboon!
Come here so I can slug you.

420
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,558
The largest library in the world
you call a dump!

421
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,879
For you.

422
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,672
I can't read Amharic.

423
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,319
You'll learn.

424
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,117
Can I talk to you please?

425
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,834
Schlomo, could you leave us alone?

426
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,395
Thanks.

427
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,154
This is a bit embarrassing, but...

428
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,794
Parents want to withdraw
their kids from school

429
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,990
if Schlomo isn't transferred.

430
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,510
They're afraid the level
will go down.

431
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,393
I know it's wrong,
Schlomo has very good marks.

432
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,919
And they're afraid
of diseases from Africa.

433
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,069
I know that...

434
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,593
Listen, you morons!

435
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,835
I've had enough!

436
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,430
My son is the most beautiful child
in the world. Understand?

437
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,558
He's as good,
if not better than your children!

438
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,920
He's healthy as can be.
Tell them!

439
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,628
His pimples? It's stress!

440
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,673
You're not the first or the only ones
to give him a hard time!

441
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,311
He's healthy! He's healthy!

442
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,635
Schlomo won't budge from this school.

443
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,198
You fucking idiots!

444
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,358
- Tigress, can you lick my pimples?
- Stupid!

445
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,354
Stop thinking about it.
You did the right thing.

446
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,910
Let him handle it on his own.

447
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,636
He knows we love him.

448
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,910
Let him go to school on his own.

449
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,399
- He's only 9.
- Dany's 8. He goes on his own.

450
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,592
Let him be,
otherwise they'll make fun of him.

451
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,111
Let them respect him, not you!

452
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,479
Dany, put out the glasses.

453
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,109
I haven't finished.

454
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,155
Are you OK, darling?

455
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,679
Can you handle this?
I've a meeting tomorrow.

456
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,835
What is it?

457
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,672
Hello, my love.

458
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,912
Tomorrow you have a medical exam
with the immigration service.

459
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,596
We leave for Jerusalem at 7:30.

460
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,628
We're getting up early.
So get to sleep.

461
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,429
Ready to go?

462
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,790
Eat something. We have to go.

463
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,559
In 15 minutes, understood?

464
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,279
Dany, get up!

465
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,359
Are you cold?

466
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,036
Tali, did you wake up Dany?

467
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,151
- He won't get up.
- Go on.

468
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,519
You threw out your bread?

469
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,910
You're impossible, Schlomo.
Make an effort!

470
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,237
An effort, damn it!

471
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,030
Don't be afraid,
they won't do anything.

472
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,998
Just an "ahh",
"open your mouth", that's all.

473
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,753
You're a man, right?

474
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,837
A man, right? A man!

475
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,634
Ritual bath
of the Jerusalem Rabbinate

476
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,389
Are you hot?

477
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,548
Are you OK?

478
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,317
Why did you take your bag?

479
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,829
Come in.

480
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,355
Tell me...
Schlomo, is that it?

481
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,156
Tell me about your name, your father,
your mother,

482
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,040
grandparents,
your place of birth,

483
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,912
your religious education...

484
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,954
My name is Schlomo,

485
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,314
my father's name was Isaac,
my mother Hana,

486
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,428
my grandfather Yakov, my brother too,

487
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,319
my sister, Aster.

488
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,878
My mother died in Ashkelon,
the others in Sudan.

489
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,429
You already have that information!

490
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,312
Isn't this a medical visit?

491
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,273
This way.

492
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,999
Alone!

493
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,228
Lie down.

494
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,558
Take off your coat.

495
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,953
Pull down his pants.

496
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,992
Forgive me.

497
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,191
Run! They want to convert us!

498
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,913
Shame on you!

499
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,029
Bastards!

500
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,673
Don't touch my son!

501
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,273
Come on!

502
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,391
Climb! Jump!

503
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,195
Run! Run!

504
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,995
You are my son. My son!

505
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,839
You're Jewish.
Nobody will touch you. Nobody!

506
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,477
You're my son!

507
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,988
No to conversion!

508
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,076
We're Jews like you!

<i>This is not about purifying blood,</i>

515
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,397
<i>it's about purifying doubt.</i>

516
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,748
<i>It's for their welfare.</i>

517

<i>They are children</i>

<i>The Queen of Sheba wasn't Jewish.</i>

519

522
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:33,836
<i>The letter allowed Israel</i>

523
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,957

00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,672
<i>we weren't real Jews,</i>

525
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,756
<i>not genuinely Jewish.</i>

<i>If we are not Jews,</i>

<i>of our sacrifices?</i>

528
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,590
<i>Why have we paid such a heavy</i>
<i>price in coming to Israel?</i>

529
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,312
<i>In Ethiopia, they accused us</i>

530
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,237
<i>of being Jews.</i>

531
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,109
<i>Here we're criticized</i>

532
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,155
<i>In Ethiopia</i>

533
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,078
<i>we were called "buda", witches,</i>

534

<i>and here we're treated</i>

00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,949
<i>niggers!</i>

536
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,790
<i>I want to remind the government</i>
<i>that numerous Jews</i>

537
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,673
<i>were left behind</i>
<i>in Ethiopia and Sudan.</i>

538
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,469
<i>Children are living alone</i>

539
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,878
<i>while their parents</i>

540

<i>"Qes Amhra</i> <i>- Rehovot"</i>

Our color is indelible!

546
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,316
We've all been circumcised!

547
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,871
Do you know where Qes Amhra is?

548
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,755
Do you know where Qes Amhra is?

549
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,112
Here's a piece of paper.

550
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,550
Write a wish on it.

551
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,473
Here's a pen.

552
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,313
Write your wish
and don't let anybody see.

553
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,357
Don't say a word to a soul
and it'll come true.

554
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,390
Why all these wishes?
Are people unhappy in Jerusalem?

555
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,593
I read what Schlomo wrote:
"I want to see you again, Mommy"!

556
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,032
Go to your room!

557
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,357
- I didn't do anything! Kushee!
- Shut up!

558
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,471
Can I tell you a story?

559
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,635
Once upon a time
there was a monkey.

560
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,149
Happy.

561
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,118
He jumped from tree to tree.

562
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,629
He had all his family and friends.

563
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,674
He knew the forest by heart.

564
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,110
One day, by accident,

565
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,912
he fell into a thorn bush.

566
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,279
His entire body
was covered with thorns.

567
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,717
They hurt him a lot.

568
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,236
He started to take them out,

569
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,195
but he soon realized
it was hopeless.

570
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,272
There were too many,

571
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,868
even under his nails.

572
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,989
Those hurt him the most.

573
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,837
Should he tear out his nails
to remove them?

574
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,673
Hello, could you possibly give me

575
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,112
the address of Qes Amhra
from Rehovot?

576
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,639
Excuse me.

577
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,195
The healer Melassa? Herzel Street?

578
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,114
Herzel Street: Straight ahead.

579
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,836
Reassure me,
can I help him remove his thorns?

580
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,591
Yes.

581
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,995
Come in.

582
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,879
Come in.

583
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,948
I saw you on TV.

584
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,471
You're the only one

585
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,115
to have spoken
of our family left behind.

586
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,391
I'd like to write to my mother,
but I don't write Amharic.

587
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,114
Can you help me?

588
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,393
You said your piece well.
What's your name?

589
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,710
- And your father?
- Isaac.

590
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,199
And your mother?

591
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,758
That's not a Jewish name.

592
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,590
She had to convert.

593
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,589
And not your father?
Where do you come from?

594
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,316
I don't remember.
I was too young.

595
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,192
Only my mother's left.

596
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,039
Could you help me
write her a letter?

597
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,269
I have to tell her
I'm alive and doing fine.

598
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,473
Sit down.

599
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,749
It'll cost you...

600
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,239
How much?

601
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,271
10 shekels a letter.

602
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,152
I'll bring you the money.

603
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,279
You're not going to negotiate?

604
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,915
Can I?

605
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,509
Not anymore, too late now.

606
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,548
"Mommy..."

607
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,233
"Dear Mommy, sunshine of my life...",

608
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,198
ingrate!

609
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,157
Yes, that's better.

610
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,517
"Dear Mommy sunshine of my life

611
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,949
"Israel's a beautiful country

612
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,758
"a nice family has adopted me

613
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,916
"I go to school and learn a lot..."

614
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,278
No periods or commas?
Just one sentence?

615
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,469
I don't know, you're the writer.

616
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,758
Very well.

617
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,519
What's next?

618
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,113
What's the address?

619
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,996
Camp Um Raquba,
near Gedaref, in Sudan.

620
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,318
And the return address?
Where should she reply?

621
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,474
Where do you live?

622
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,749
Here?

623
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,109
Can she reply to me here?

624
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,513
Very well.

625
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,673
I meant to call.

626
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,029
You meant to call?

627
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,717
Ask me a question to which
you know the answer's "yes".

628
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,195
Do I speak good French?

629
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,559
Did you have a good day?

630
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,516
Answer me, Yael.

631
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,512
Do you have a problem?

632
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,833
Are you kidding around?

633
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,551
What's with you?

634
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,190
A few years later - 1989

635
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,870
You've got to write another letter.

636
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,436
We talked yesterday.
She was less cold, much nicer.

637
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,879
Not now, tomorrow.

638
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,592
How about later?

639
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,675
Tomorrow!

640
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,753
Tell her "I love you
like Romeo loved Juliet,

641
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,950
- "that all my life..."
- Shut up!

642
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,031
If it's a dictation, you write it.

643
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,676
It's her birthday.

644
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,190
She invited us over, you too.

645
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,709
I'll read it:

646
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,875
"Dear Sarah,
ever since I left..."

647
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,638
Hold it, I never left.

648
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,398
Shut up, this works!

649
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,389
"Dear Sarah, ever since I left,

650
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,797
"I miss you.
You have no idea how much.

651
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,230
"I'd love you to be so proud of me.

652
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,189
"I'd like to wake up one morning

653
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,237
"and find you sitting next to me

654
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,551
"as if you had always been there,

655
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,558
"and our separation
were simply a long nightmare.

656
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,875
"Every evening,
I look up at the moon.

657
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,356
"God thinks I'm speaking to Him,

658

"I miss you. I love you,

662
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,598
"Itai."

663
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,030
Shit, you can write!

664
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,238
Where do you get all that?

665
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,231
Wait, what's wrong?

666
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,190
Are you crying? You love her, too?

667
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,191
- Fifteen shekels.
- I thought it was ten.

668
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,516
She loves you because of me.

669
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,835
Five shekels success bonus.

670
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,116
I hope you're not stealing
this money.

671
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,232
I work hard, Qes.

672
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,796
I wash the stairs of our building.

673
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,512
You seem sad.

674
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,754
It's a twinge of melancholy,
nostalgia.

675
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,719
What day is it?

676
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,108
Friday.

677
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,000
Friday, the day of Sabbath.

678
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,238
And it doesn't smell like Sabbath...

679
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,713
It doesn't smell like Sabbath?

680
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,157
Don't you remember?

681
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,874
You were probably too young.

682
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,234
Friday morning,
it already smelled like Sabbath...

683
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:36,959
the scent of Sabbath bread
that the women were baking.

684
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,310
The best bread of the week.

685
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,679
It's terrible:

686
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,758
In the land of the Torah,
nothing smells anymore.

687
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,472
It's been lost.

688
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,673
Alright, I'm listening.

689
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,709
"Mommy...

690
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,634
"Mommy, tell me why...

691
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,153
"I'm doing well...

692
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,758
"I'd like to...
I need to know why...

693
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,514
"I'm not allowed to come home..."

694
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,555
Here.

695
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,110
From now on, you write.

696
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,072
You need to.

697
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,239
Besides, my eyes are weary.

698
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,713
Go on, learn.

699
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,872
"Mommy, sunshine of my life...",

700
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,515
and then you write whatever you want.

701
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,753
You said: "Become..."
Become what?

702
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,752
"And don't come back until then."

703
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,916
Why don't you call Mom "Mommy"?

704
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,992
It's always Yael.

705
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,832
Yeah, you won again!
What a score!

706
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,679
Did you see the score? Champ!

707
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,949
Another round?

708
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,433
What should I wear?

709
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,357
Jeans, a T-shirt! Something cool!

710
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,232
It's a birthday, not a wedding.

711
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,716
I'll make him director
of the company.

712
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,640
With a new title:
"HardHarrari & Son".

713
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,797
What do you think?

714
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,115
He loves you, too. You know that.

715
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,108
No, I'm not a boy.

716
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,038
You are, but you're rotten
in computers and sports.

717
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,991
And you challenge him.
He hates that.

718
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,109
How does this look?

719
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,959
Cool.

720
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,913
If you ring a third time,
I'll break your finger.

721
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,553
- Understand?
- But...

722
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,033
Go home!

723
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,472
- How was it?
- Great.

724
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,709
Me?

725
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,233
I'm just running down to see Itai.

726
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,038
Don't be long.
Have you seen the time?

727
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,797
- I'm Sarah.
- Who gave you my address?

728
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,995
Itai.

729
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,872
- What do you want?
- To say sorry.

730
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,314
It's fine!

731
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,478
Daddy thinks you're not Jewish,

732
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,115
that you're Christian,
and you've never read the Torah,

733
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,598
that you were starving in Ethiopia
and you came here to eat,

734
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,472
and lied to Israel.

735
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,029
Great!
You came just to tell me that?

736
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,719
Listen to this.

737
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,392
Don't you ask a girl to dance?

738
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,399
Now, you haven't missed
the entire birthday.

739
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,873
Where's my present?

740
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,428
Close your mouth.
They say you're "black".

741
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,949
They're wrong, you're red.

742
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,671
Nothing works in this country!

743
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,835
Are you OK?

744
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,235
Can't you arrive slowly,
like the Messiah!

745
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,158
- Do you still lead the controversies?
- Yes.

746
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,272
Is Sarah's father
still on the jury?

747
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,113
If you win the controversy,

748
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,913
it means that you've read,
and know the Torah?

749
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,158
That you're Jewish?

750
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,548
Can I participate?

751
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,718
Everyone can.
But not before 6 weeks.

752
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,234
Yes, yes, yes!

753
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,275
I'll let you know
the subject to prepare.

754
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,594
Thanks, Rabbi.

755
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,431
Can I say something?

756
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,710
- I'm in a hurry.
- You're out of gas.

757
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,228
No, that's not good.

758
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,952
Interpret, Schlomo,

759
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,231
don't repeat like a parrot.

760
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,233
Interpret.

761
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,435
Put some Schlomo into it.

762
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,274
Let's start again.

763
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,594
Silence, please.

764
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,672
The subject today is:

765
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,430
"What color was Adam?"

766
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,632
In the image of God, white!

767
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,352
Silence!

768
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,958
We'll start with...

769
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,109
Michael Leibovich.
Please.

770
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,955
Adam was created in God's image.

771
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,874
And the beautiful color chosen
was white.

772
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,716
We were all white in the beginning.

773
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,875
After the flood, Noah and his sons
emerged from the Ark.

774
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,233
Noah cursed the descendants
of his son, Ham,

775
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,397
along with his grandson Canaan:

776
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,909
"Cursed be Canaan,

777
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,076
"the lowest of slaves will he be
to his brothers."

778
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,918
Genesis, 9, 25.

779
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,596
Kush, Ham's eldest son,

780
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,312
inherited another curse:

781
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,396
Some of Ham's descendants
would have black skin.

782
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,154
And so it was:

783
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,432
Kush became black and from him
were born the "Kusheems",

784
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,677
the black people of Africa.

785
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,796
The descendants of Ham
became slaves and black.

786
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,674
Are Adam and God

787
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,718
the same color,

788
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,552
white?

789
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,239
Michael said...

790
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,595
No...

791
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,878
In the beginning was the Word.

792
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,596
God created Earth and us,
giving life to the Word.

793
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,879
God believed in Man,

794
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,633
in each one,

795
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,877
entrusting him with the Word,
on condition that

796
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,755
each give a different, marvelous
and profound life to the Word.

797
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,518
In interpreting it.

798
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,395
As for Adam... his name comes
from "adama", "earth", in Hebrew.

799
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,149
God created Adam with the earth,
from clay and water.

800
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,995
He gave him spirit,
something marvelous like the Word.

801
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,954
That's how Adam was born.

802
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,039
Adam is the color of clay: Red.

803
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,951
Like the Sioux.
Red in Hebrew is "adom".

804
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:27,075
So you see,
Adam is neither white nor black,

805
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,509
he is red.

806
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,195
But does he feel alright,

807
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,676
alone and red in this new world?

808
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,515
That's when God thought of Eve...

809
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,275
But Adam didn't understand

810
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,870
what God wanted,
what He was expecting of him.

811
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,199
What was he supposed to do on Earth?
What was he supposed to become?

812
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,958
Why all these trials?

813
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,756
But he knows he can't go back,

814
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,678
he knows he has no choice,

815
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,198
that he's here because God wills it,

816
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,839
and he must become,

817
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,838
and God is disguised as the moon,

818
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,953
and watches over and protects him.

819
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,949
Hello, sir.

820
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,553
I'm Schlomo.

821
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,390
I don't want to see you
with him again.

822
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,511
This boy is the devil.

823
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,753
How dare you compare God
to the moon!

824
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,516
If I ever see you with my daughter,

825
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,153
you'll have problems.

826
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,878
Understand?

827
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,997
Good-bye.

828
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:04,995
Yes?

829
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,430
- Yes, young man?
- I'm guilty.

830
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,828
I'm not Jewish.

831
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,871
What? Guilty of what?

832
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,229
I'm not Jewish!

833
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,755
I've been lying from the start,
to everybody.

834
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,233
Hold on. Wait a minute.

835
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,748
Sit down!

836
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,230
Even you're starting to believe it!

837
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,512
You're as Jewish as we are!

838
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,435
More than us, do you understand?

839
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,552
More faithful to the Torah,
it's written everywhere.

840
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,552
Don't believe what they say!

841
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,030
It's shameful the way they treat you.

842
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,674
I don't know everything,
I read, I listen.

843
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,108
- I...
- Shut up!

844
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,196
Did I get flak
as a Rumanian immigrant?

845
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,119
Did they refuse my blood
for fear of Aids?

846
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,795
How many suicides in your community?

847
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,468

848
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,919
And it's our fault!

849
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,954
No other group of immigrants
has had that.

850
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,639
Hang in there, son,

851
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,395
I know it's hard.

852
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,110
Those idiots, they refuse to
understand what you experienced!

853
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,151
- But...
- It's OK.

854
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,158
What do you want to do later?

855
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,958
Are you in school?

856
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,271
Good, that's important.

857
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,477
After high school, if you're looking
for work, come see me.

858
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,079
I'll get you a job with the police.

859
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,229
We need people like you,
honest, courageous.

860
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,833
Mommy, I'm going to be late.

861
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,278
Mommy, I love you.

862
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,073
- What happened?
- Where were you? Look at the time!

863
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,470
I'm old enough to do what I want.

864
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,999
What you want? Under my roof?

865
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,553
Stop, he's upset.

866
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,512
Stop defending him!
The police...

867
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,039
I'll go if you want!

868
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,913
- Don't talk to me that way!
- Leave him! Stop, Yoram!

869
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,155
Why the police?

870
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,072
My son's no thief!

871
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,515
I'm not your son!

872
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,112
It's better you go.

873
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,153
A kibbutz is a good thing.
We used to go there on holiday.

874
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,594
You'll love it.

875
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,754
Grandpa lived there.
Yoram was born there.

876
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,153
Will you call?

877
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,114
Every other day?
More often if you can?

878
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,193
Come on, you'll be late.

879
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,398
Have you forgotten anything?

880
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,992
<i>Joseph Aaron Harrari</i>

881
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,998
<i>Founder of the kibbutz,</i>
<i>hero of Israel</i>

882
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,629
That's my grandpa!

883
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,354
He defended our land
and was wounded 5 times!

884
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,596
Can I call you Mandala?

885
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,316
My cow's name was Mandala.

886
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:46,029
She was a beautiful Ethiopian cow.
She fed my whole family.

887
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,949
I promised I'd never forget her.

888
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,273
Schlomo, telephone!

889
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,276
I bet you can't stop
thinking about me.

890
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,108
Hey? Are you there, Red Skin?

891
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,870
Maybe I'll leave Itai for you.

892
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,753
No, don't get your hopes up!

893
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,359
Have you met anyone?

894
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,550
- Anyone?
- Anyone...

895
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,990
like a girl, Red Skin!

896
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,680
Long hair, narrow waist, big boobs,

897
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,153
batting eyelashes

898
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,875
and saying silly things
to get guys' attention.

899
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,953
A bitch, you know!

900
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,316
Oh yeah, yes!

901
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,475
Really? What's her name?

902
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,552
- Mandala.
- What?

903
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,792
It's an Ethiopian name.

904
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,710
The jerk has a girlfriend!

905
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,152
Is anything wrong?

906
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,555
No.

907
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,477
They say you're working hard.

908
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,717
- Did the director say that?
- Yes.

909
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,393
He's very happy.

910
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,473
Maybe you're working too hard.

911
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,996
Or maybe not discreetly enough.

912
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,554
Did you come to say that?

913
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,953
The director called to tell you

914
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:23,240
I should be careful
and work less?

915
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,395
Is that it?

916
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,836
I came to see you.

917
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,078
I hear you've got a girlfriend?

918
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:32,355
Who told you?

919
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,831
Sarah. She calls sometimes
to get your news.

920
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,399
What did she say?

921
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,511
That her name was Mandala.

922
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,836
Mandala, this is Grandpa.

923
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,598
Nice to meet you.

924
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,676
It must cost a fortune
to take her to a restaurant.

925
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,436
Did you have a cow in Ethiopia?

926
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,513
Yes, I did.

927
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,593
That's good.

928
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,114
"An Arab was killed
and 10 others wounded

929
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,879
"during a riot
after terrorists attack a bus."

930
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,511
Should we give back land

931
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,071
we consider our own,

932
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,112
the land of our ancestors?

933
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:31,078
We were deprived of it
in our wanderings

934
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,830
and had no other to call our own.

935
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,470
And now we finally have it back
and we love it...

936
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,953
This tree provides shade.
We planted it 50 years ago.

937
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,198
But the tree over there,

938
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,831
it was there before we got here.

939
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,349
I think we should share the land,

940
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,550
like the sun and the shade,

941
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,438
so others can know love, too.

942
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,871
Even if we risk
being pushed to the sea and dying?

943
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,875
Love doesn't come without risks.

944
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,834
And it's difficult to decide
how others should love.

945
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,431
Thanks for coming.

946
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,958
Do you believe in God?

947
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,637
When my feet ache

948
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,917
or when there's war here
or elsewhere.

949
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,230
Like any left-wing guy, I guess.

950
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,397
I'm not all that nice with Him.

951
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,795
I only call when I need Him.

952
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,078
Never "How are You?"
A simple unselfish phone call.

953
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,434
Yes, hold on.

954
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,711
Schlomo, phone for you.

955
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,589
I don't believe it!
You're back and you don't even call?

956
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,593
- I just...
- You don't love me anymore?

957
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,188
Just kidding!
How was the kibbutz?

958
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,436
- Great, I loved it.
- I hate it.

959
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:08,519
It's so cheesy,
the land, the cows, the chickens,

960
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,433
"look at the exploits
of our parents."

961
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,712
Are Ethiopian men
allowed to marry whites?

962
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,553
What? Why?

963
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,631
Just curious, that's all.

964
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:22,230
Just to see if you could marry
a white woman one day.

965
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,719
Dunno. Want me to find out?

966
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,559
Forget it. It's alright.

967
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,238
How's Mandala doing?

968
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,951
We write, she lives far away.

969
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,476
You write letters, too?

970
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,188
Yes... not beautiful,
short, telegraphic.

971
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,114
I said to him:
"Can Ethiopians marry whites?"

972
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,959
Isn't that clear?
Does he need a drawing?

973
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,880
He said: "Want me to find out?"

974
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,396
Do I need to send him a fax?

975
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,598
He exasperates me...
That Mandala's such a bitch!

976
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,315
Yes, we can marry whites.

977
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,149
But...

978
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,835
But?

979
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,795
But the day she marries an Ethiopian,

980
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,950
the white woman becomes black.

981
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,359
Put my mask on.

982
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,753
You're younger.

983
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,515
You've got all your life
in front of you.

984
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,839
And you've got to find your mother.

985
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,159
You're not allowed to die before.

986
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,235
Hello.

987
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,510
You come home at this hour?

988
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,513
At least call after an alert
to say you're alive!

989
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,999
God damn it.

990
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,830
We've got to save money, Yael.

991
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,158
Cut down on expenses.

992
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,477
Let's go somewhere else.

993
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,075
To France or Canada...

994
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,956
You have two sons,
you know what that means.

995
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,230
I know, two future soldiers.

996
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,072
They'll go to war like you.

997
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,111
You think I want that?

998
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,676
- Then let's go.
- Who will stay?

999
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,350
The right-wing fools who want war?
Who'll vote for peace?

1000
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,997
They're your children.

1001
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,230
This is my country.

1002
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,400
Several years later - 1993

1003
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:30,998
- Yes to peace!
- No to the occupation!

1004
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,470
Things will be better now, darling.

1005
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,789
Let's try!

1006
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,232
I'm black.
You don't see it anymore.

1007
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,038
I don't give a shit!

1008
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,758
For me, you're...

1009
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,353
You're red.

1010
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,552
I've got to go.

1011
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,595
Forget it.

1012
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,556
<i>The river dried up months ago.</i>

1013
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,593
<i>The little water left</i>
<i>in the river bed is filthy.</i>

1014
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,237
<i>It's the source of the dysentery</i>
<i>sweeping the camp.</i>

1015
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,914
<i>This camp was built</i>
<i>just 8 weeks ago.</i>

1016
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,918
<i>Today it's home</i>
<i>for 90,000 refugees.</i>

1017
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,236
<i>The world is pouring in medicine</i>
<i>as fast as it can,</i>

1018
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,876
<i>but it has failed</i>
<i>to prevent that kind of disaster</i>

1019
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,276
<i>from these people left behind</i>
<i>in Ethiopia.</i>

1020
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,030
<i>They came in the hope</i>
<i>of recovery from the diseases</i>

1021
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,958
<i>due to months of starvation</i>
<i>and dehydration.</i>

1022
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,630
<i>The doctors are doing their best,</i>

1023
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,557
<i>yet illnesses, so easily</i>
<i>prevented, kill children every day.</i>

1024
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,753
<i>There is overcrowding,</i>

1025
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,430
<i>and many are too weak</i>
<i>to respond to treatment</i>

1026
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:53,632
<i>like vaccination</i>
<i>and intensive feeding.</i>

1027
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,918
<i>By common consent, many who</i>
<i>are dying could've been saved</i>

1028
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,237
<i>if aid teams had been</i>
<i>in position at the border</i>

1029
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,631
<i>and waiting</i>
<i>as they came across.</i>

1030
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,234
<i>The Sudanese protest</i>
<i>they must feed</i>

1031
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,193
<i>thousands of Ethiopians</i>
<i>as well as their own.</i>

1032
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,113
<i>The U.S.,</i>
<i>the one country able to respond,</i>

1033
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:18,595
<i>is ready to feed the Sudanese,</i>

1034
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,598
<i>but is reluctant to do the same</i>
<i>for the Ethiopians.</i>

1035
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,270
You want to go to Sudan?

1036
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,358
What camp?
She's no longer at Um Raquba.

1037
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,038
You know there's a war on?

1038
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,594
I've got to find her.

1039
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,438
I can't wait my entire life.

1040
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,472
You won't find her!
Do you want to commit suicide?

1041
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,750
- No, I...
- You don't understand!

1042
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,235
You haven't understood a thing
about our history.

1043
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,951
We're condemned to live!

1044
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,119
We came out of Ethiopia
like our ancestors from Egypt.

1045
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,749
Snatched from the clutches of death.

1046
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:59,075
We'll have 40 years
of suffering and questions.

1047
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,749
So what?

1048
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,473
My son was butchered

1049
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,830
before me like a dog

1050
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,038
by our own guides and their henchmen.

1051
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,314
He tried to save his wife

1052
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,519
from being raped.

1053
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:31,550
They killed her three days later.

1054
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,199
Amongst others.

1055
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,873
My wife

1056
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,838
died of a broken heart in the camp.

1057
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:48,635
Do you think I can ever forget
their eyes, now gone forever?

1058
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,631
Do you think I can ever forget
my son, my daughter-in law and wife?

1059
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,428
No.

1060
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,236
But I only have one option:

1061
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,719
To serve those who survived.

1062
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,950
You, for example.

1063
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,039
Look at this.

1064
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:12,073
This is all I could rescue:
The Torah.

1065
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,758
Go now.

1066
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,631
- What's your name?
- Schlomo.

1067
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,713
You're cute.

1068
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,679
You too.

1069
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,475
Do you dance?

1070
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,033
I don't know how.

1071
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,753
Come on.

1072
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,191
I've got to confess something:

1073
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,877
I'm not Jewish.

1074
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,996
But I feel Jewish.

1075
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,353
In a way, I am.

1076
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,039
I'm not Jewish,

1077
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,950
but I feel Jewish.

1078
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,799
That's OK, baby,

1079
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,991
I really like you.

1080
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:19,591
But if you want to go any further,
you've got to pay.

1081
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,554
Yes, of course...

1082
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,748
Lie down.

1083
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,869
Baby,

1084
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,519
I'll be back.

1085
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,159
You touch my sister?

1086
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,873
You touch her?

1087
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,513
I've got the cash.

1088
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,598
I don't give a shit about your story!

1089
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,757
Do you hear?
I don't give a fuck about your past!

1090
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:38,352
Or your troubles! "We were simply
extras in 'Operation Moses'..."

1091
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,715
I don't give a fuck! What about us?

1092
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,909
What about us?

1093
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:49,310
We're not even in the film.
Left behind there!

1094
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,754
Dead!

1095
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,554
A simple statistic! Do you hear?

1096
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:56,314
I know you hear me!

1097
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,237
Answer me!

1098
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,588
Answer me!

1099
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,630
He's my son!

1100
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,549
Please!

1101
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,240
Leave him alone, it's not his fault.

1102
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,948
He's my son.

1103
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,836
It'll be okay.

1104
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,797
I'm not Jewish.

1105
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:42,030
You've known all along, haven't you?

1106
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:01,520
We lived in a small village
in the north.

1107
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,909
Aleka and Kidane,
my father and mother.

1108
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,278
I had a sister, Tirunesh.

1109
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,790
Beautiful, a real princess.

1110
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,311
And a big brother, Menelik.

1111
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,271
He made me laugh so much.

1112
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,599
We had a little bit of land
and a cow:

1113
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,551
Mandala.

1114
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,349
The army sent my father to fight

1115
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:35,196
against the Eritrean rebels.

1116
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,471
He never came back: Dead.

1117
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,512
A year later,

1118
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,796
the drought killed Mandala.

1119
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,113
We left for the south,
heading for a camp.

1120
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:54,198
We set out on foot...
hundreds of kilometers.

1121
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,236
My sister was the first to die

1122
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,514
of disease and exhaustion.

1123
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:09,031
A mound of earth,

1124
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,353
a cross in the middle of the desert.

1125
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:16,799
I don't remember
where my little Tirunesh is buried.

1126
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,712
But one day...

1127
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,669
One day, I'll find her.

1128
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,753
What about your brother?
Where is he?

1129
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,880
My mother sent me
for water in the camp.

1130
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,838
We had been there for several months.

1131
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,191
Water was at the other end
of the camp.

1132
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,036
She gave me three coins.

1133
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,155
I took the can and went.
I paid up front.

1134
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,677
They took the money
and wouldn't fill the can.

1135
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,711
They said: "You didn't pay."

1136
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,593
The spring belonged to a gang.
I cried.

1137
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,030
I asked them
to give me back my money.

1138
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,393
People started to defend me
against the gang.

1139
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:18,835
A fight broke out.
All of a sudden! Violent!

1140
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,753
Everyone was on edge.

1141
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,311
Then I saw my brother...

1142
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,591
in the middle of the fight.

1143
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,356
I don't know how he got there
or when.

1144
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:36,195
He came to defend me. I tried
to get to him, but I couldn't.

1145
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:40,115
The Sudanese soldiers showed up
and began hitting everybody.

1146
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,833
The crowd dispersed.

1147
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,390
Everyone moved aside.

1148
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,630
My brother was on the ground.
Dead.

1149
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,276
Stabbed for a can of water...

1150
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,750
For 3 cents.

1151
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,674
It was my fault.

1152
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,996
It wasn't your fault.

1153
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,395
You were only 9 years old.

1154
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,356
Your mother didn't
send you away, Schlomo.

1155
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,758
She never wanted to punish you.

1156
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:34,271
You loved him, she knew that.

1157
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,356
Then, why? Why?

1158
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,948
Why did she forbid me to return?

1159
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,637
To save you. So that you would live.

1160
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,068
Cry, you're allowed.

1161
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:08,078
Come on, I have a doctor friend.

1162
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:12,151
He'll look after you.

1163
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,392
I know you, don't I?
Are you French?

1164
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,799
This is Franois Buchman,
French from Strasbourg.

1165
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,396
He worked for the Red Cross
and Doctors of the World.

1166
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:48,115
We met in Um Raquba
and became friends.

1167
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,277
He's been in Israel for 10 years.

1168
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,509
Come in.

1169
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,677
Don't move. It'll sting a bit.

1170
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,190
I was the one to bury

1171
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,072
Hana's real son
in the Um Raquba desert.

1172
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,917
His name was Solomon... Schlomo.

1173
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,195
He was only nine years old.

1174
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,354
You were born a second time that day.

1175
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,597
It took me a while to accept it.

1176
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,272
Forgive me.

1177
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:46,399
My God!

1178
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,070
Look at you.
They really did a number on you!

1179
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,031
There were 5 of them. Nazis!

1180
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:56,792
It was that Jewish nose of yours.

1181
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,279
Sarah, listen.

1182
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,437
I'm going abroad.

1183
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,318
I want to become a doctor.

1184
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,119
You're running away.

1185
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,158
You're running away!

1186
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,553
You don't want to see me
fall in love with someone else

1187
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,395
or be here when I marry.

1188
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,910
I won't wait for you.

1189
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:09,077
None of our family
ever ducked out of the army!

1190
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:11,395
What's wrong with you?
You're a coward!

1191
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,358
We all did the military
before college.

1192
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,308
You're an ingrate.
Israel saved your life!

1193
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:20,956
I could never shoot anybody.
Never!

1194
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,680
Why didn't anybody
say anything to me?

1195
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,791
- Stop!
- We knew you'd be furious.

1196
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,958
But I'll defend my country.
I'm not a coward.

1197
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:30,633
Really? Just how?

1198
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,996
Differently. With words.

1199
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,760
You'll go far. Very far!

1200
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,516
- Another minister.
- He won't die!

1201
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,952
He's seen enough death.

1202
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,752
The country will die.

1203
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,359
Yoram, defend your family.

1204
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,754
My family lives in a country,

1205
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,998
amongst other families
who've made a home here!

1206
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:57,638
If the foundations are shaky,
maybe it's our fault. We failed.

1207
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,594
He'll go to Paris.

1208
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,759
Forgive me for coming.

1209
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,032
I have a secret, Schlomo.

1210
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,235
I've got to get it off my chest.

1211
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,756
You know, the truth is...

1212
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,792
I didn't want you.

1213
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,717
I didn't want to adopt you.

1214
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,279
I was against it.

1215
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,992
Really against it.

1216
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:49,553
I was afraid,

1217
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,356
afraid for Dany and Tali,
for our family.

1218
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:58,278
Yoram was all for it. Completely!

1219
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,917
He was a real bulldozer.

1220
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:07,516
As though he knew you already.
Every day, he said:

1221
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,790
"Yael, all those Falasha orphans,

1222
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,520
"we can adopt them all,
or at least one."

1223
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,671
Every day, Schlomo.

1224
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,555
And I refused,
determined to defend my family.

1225
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,072
Yoram won
and I don't regret it for one second.

1226
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,998
Not one second.

1227
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,112
You're part of the family
because of him.

1228
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,716
Go on now.

1229
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:36,629
We've looked at the anatomy
of the bone marrow this morning

1230
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:39,194
and now we'll look at pathologies.

1231
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,030
Radicular pathologies,
the nerve endings...

1232
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:46,233
Notice the sciatic nerve...

1233
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,195
You're Jewish? A black guy?

1234
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,511
I've also been uprooted.
I'm from Marseilles. Know it?

1235
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,313
I had a real slap in the face
when I got to Paris.

1236
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,112
Where are your parents?

1237
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,119
The guy's tall, 1.86 meters,

1238
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:36,158
blonde with blue eyes.
He's studying law.

1239
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:38,829
Does it bother you
I'm telling you all this?

1240
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:41,676
Do you miss me?

1241
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:43,792
I miss you.

1242
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:47,233
I left him, a jerk
obsessed with money.

1243
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,677
I'm in love with my lieutenant.
Are you OK?

1244
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:53,039
I miss you, my love.

1245
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:55,674
You must have changed.

1246
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,235
You must have become a real man.

1247
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,552
<i>Yitzhak Rabin,</i>

1248
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:20,835
<i>the Israeli Prime Minister,</i>
<i>has been assassinated...</i>

1249
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,793
Why, my love?

1250
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,832
Why did they kill him?

1251
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,068
Congratulations. We were very pleased
to have you here.

1252
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,838
Here is your diploma.

1253
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,036
- Are you OK, Qes?
- Where are you?

1254
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:42,158
I'm at the airport. I'm coming home.

1255
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,875
I got my diploma. I'm a doctor.

1256
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,557
Don't come home, Schlomo.

1257
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:50,353
There's a big trial
against the Ethiopians

1258
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,392
who passed themselves off as Jews.

1259
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,596
It's all over the media.

1260
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:00,309
Everyone's accusing them
of being liars and traitors.

1261
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:03,200
They want to send them back.

1262
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,874
Non-Jewish Russians, too.

1263
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:11,193
Qes, where is my home?

1264
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,277
Stay in France!

1265
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:32,838
You won't die!

1266
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,869
Don't die!

1267
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:39,237
Don't die! Not you!

1268
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,433
Don't touch my child!

1269
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,393
You'll all end up in the sea,
in hell. Kike!

1270
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,032
Don't treat them, got that?
Our men first!

1271
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,912
Understand, kushee?

1272
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:12,349
I don't understand...

1273
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,119
You were lucky.

1274
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,356
Stop crying, he's alive.

1275
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,876
You were born under a lucky star.
You always survive.

1276
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,672
A star named Mandala.

1277
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,958
I want to have a child.

1278
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,198
What? Are you crazy? With who?

1279
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,078
I don't care. A family.

1280
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:44,879
I passed the exam in Technion.

1281
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,355
I'll be a computer engineer.

1282
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,309
I didn't tell Daddy.

1283
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,473
He thinks I'm studying philosophy.

1284
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:53,597
Can I have a word with him alone?

1285
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,159
Tell her you love her. She's crazy
about you. 10 years is long enough!

1286
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,476
Otherwise, I'll kill you!

1287
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,719
Schlomo wants to talk to you.

1288
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,311
To our beautiful Polish bride!

1289
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,638
May I?

1290
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,397
You're sad they didn't come?

1291
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:20,353
Your father renounced you,
tore his vest, proclaimed you dead.

1292
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,157
You look good for a corpse.
It gives old guys like me hope.

1293
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,350
Imagine when they resuscitate you...

1294
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,310
Here comes the sunshine!

1295
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,279
Sarah, with time, it will get better.

1296
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:36,392
When you have a child,
they'll come running back.

1297
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,670
Especially if it's a boy!

1298
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,958
Your mother will sew up the vest
and all will be forgotten.

1299
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,712
I love you!

1300
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,279
Down the hatch, guys.

1301
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,518
One more time. Let's go!

1302
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:58,153
Tell her tonight.

1303
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:04,908
I'll lose her, Qes.
Not tonight.

1304
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,511
I just barely found her again.

1305
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,597
I'll tell her soon. I'm too happy.

1306
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,113
Tell her!

1307
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:17,875
Sarah! Stop!

1308
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,353
No, you can't stop me.

1309
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,314
I've waited 10 years.
Look at my lingerie.

1310
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,879
Sarah, listen!

1311
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:26,999
Okay.

1312
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,353
I have to tell you a secret.

1313
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,317
Alright, then.

1314
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,237
Want to swap secrets?
I'll start.

1315
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:38,950
I didn't sleep
with half the guys I said...

1316
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:42,277
Not even a quarter of them.
I wanted to make you jealous.

1317
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,873
I slept with two.

1318
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,312
OK, just one. So?

1319
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,914
When you left,
I wanted to forget you...

1320
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,674
prove to myself I didn't love you.
It didn't work.

1321
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,713
What's your secret?

1322
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,910
Did you jump
every French girl's bones,

1323
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,519
including the Eiffel Tower?

1324
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,557
"Yes, Schlomo, yes!"

1325
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:07,432
You won't leave me...
no matter what I tell you?

1326
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,439
Are you joking?

1327
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,833
What is it?

1328
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,876
I'm listening!

1329
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,154
It's not that...

1330
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,999
It's just...

1331
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:47,838
I wanted to say...

1332
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,068
Itai's letters... I was the one...

1333
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,838
Those love letters,

1334
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:01,080
it was me...
when I was thirteen...

1335
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,515
Is that it?

1336
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,999
Are you sure?

1337
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,558
I knew that, you ass!

1338
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,915
I fell in love
with your letters first.

1339
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:21,439
Not you! Idiot!

1340
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,837
Dad and I are setting up a company.

1341
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:34,918
A start-up!
The bank and the army approved it.

1342
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:38,794
We set up a research contract
with them.

1343
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,592
Mazel Tov! And what about the baby?

1344
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:41,829
He's doing well.

1345
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:44,633
His idiotic father hasn't called
since I got pregnant.

1346
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:47,228
You didn't give him a choice.

1347
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,549
Hang up.

1348
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,758
Tali, I've got to hang up.

1349
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:56,075
- Well?
- I took the test.

1350
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:57,914
I'm pregnant!

1351
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:35,473
No, I don't believe it.

1352
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:41,957
You have 30 seconds
to tell me it's not true.

1353
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:56,919
I knew it.

1354
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:59,313
I felt it.

1355
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:04,759
It was too good to be true.

1356
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:12,872
I cut myself off from my family.

1357
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:15,039
For you.

1358
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,033
I left my father,
my mother, my brother.

1359
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,038
For you!

1360
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:27,998
They all renounced me. Everyone!

1361
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:32,469
For you. Think that was easy?

1362
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:38,236
Have we known each other
for 10 years?

1363
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:41,870

1364
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:44,918
You didn't trust me!

1365
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,117
I couldn't care less
if you were Jewish or not,

1366
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,113
white, red or black.

1367
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:54,350
I loved you.

1368
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,756
You, Schlomo, you!

1369
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,713
Asshole!

1370
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,075
Hello, Yael?

1371
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,673
Can I see you?

1372
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,668
Hello, Sarah.

1373
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:37,799
Can I come in?

1374
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:46,750
I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1375
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,069
I understand your anger, Sarah.

1376
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:55,029
Try to imagine Schlomo's trauma.

1377
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:01,958
A mother who loves
her son so desperately,

1378
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,829
she's willing to send him away,

1379
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:09,390
and never see him again,
ready to lose him...

1380
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,237
to save him.

1381
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:16,997
And a man who loves his wife
so much, you,

1382
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:20,874
that he dares not tell his secret
for fear of losing her.

1383
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,038
Isn't that love?

1384
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,309
Don't leave him, Sarah.

1385
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,111
Don't leave him.

1386
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:04,272
It's amazing
how many mothers love you.

1387
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:15,076
You've got to promise me something.

1388
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,391
Doctor, doctor...

1389
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,795
Red Skin, listen, he's talking.

1390
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,759
Say daddy.

1391
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,430
Daddy...

1392
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:59,313
I'll keep my promise.

1393
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:02,750
I'll call you. I miss you.

1394
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,039
Mommy...

1395
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:47,755
I love you.

1396
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:59,875
