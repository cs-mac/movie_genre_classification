1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,743
 Henry V, King of England, and Charles VI, King of France 
signs the treaty of Troyes.

2
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:39,414
The treaty states that the Kingdom of France will
belong to England upon the King's death.

3
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,376
 But the two kings die a few months apart

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,004
 Henry VI is the king of England and of France,
but he is only a few months old.

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,508
Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, 
has no intenteion to abandon his kingdom to a child,

6
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,802
nor even to his tutor, the Duke of Bedford.

7
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,265
A bloody war begins and the English,
along with the Burgundians, invade France.

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
Is anybody there?

9
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,763
Jeanne.

10
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,770
I'm always happy to see you, but to
keep coming twice, three times a day--

11
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,773
- I need to confess.
- You already confessed this morning.

12
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,775
I need to confess again.

13
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,779
What terrible sin
have you committed since then...

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,781
that can't wait till tomorrow
to be forgiven?

15
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,785
I saw a poor monk without shoes,
so I gave him some.

16
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,748
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

17
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,750
- They weren't my shoes.
- Whose were they?

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,711
- My father's.
- I'm sure he'll forgive you.

19
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,756
He already did.

20
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,758
But I want Jesus
to forgive me too.

21
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,761
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time...

22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,763
we'd spend our whole life
in church.

23
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,725
- Is that bad?
- Well, no, but--

24
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,772
- Are you happy at home?
- Oh, yes, very.

25
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,775
And your mother?
Everything's fine with her?

26
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,777
Yes, she's wonderful.

27
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,780
And your sister, Catherine,
she's still your best friend?

28
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,784
My sister's just--
She's wonderful.

29
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,746
And what about your other friends?
You don't like playing with them?

30
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,749
Oh, yes.
I play with them, lots.

31
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,753
Everything sounds wonderful.

32
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,756
Yes, it is.

33
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,758
Then why are you here so often?

34
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,763
I feel safe here.
It's where I can talk to him.

35
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,767
Him?

36
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,770
Well, I try to talk to him...

37
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,774
but mostly he's the one
who does the talking.

38
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,778
Who is this ''he''?

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,783
He never says his name.

40
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,745
What does he...

41
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,747
look like?

42
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,755
Beautiful.

43
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,760
And what does he say to you?

44
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,763
He says--

45
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,771
He says--
He says I must be good...

46
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,776
and help everyone
and take care of myself.

47
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,779
Do you think he's coming
from the sky?

48
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,783
Perhaps.

49
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,747
But wherever he's coming from,
I think you should listen to him...

50
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,751
'cause it sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,779
It's--
It's wonderful!

52
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:40,906
It's wonderful.

53
00:05:59,401 --> 00:05:59,902
Jeanne.

54
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,316
Mother!

55
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,281
Catherine!

56
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,171
Jeanne, are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

57
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm fine, really.

58
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,302
We've all been looking for you.
The English are everywhere.

59
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,304
- I was in the church.
- Really?

60
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,307
I was talking to the priest.
Do you know what he said to me?

61
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,725
Burn over there!

62
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,727
Tell me later.
Quick, hide in here.

63
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,732
- Where are you gonna be?
- I'll be right here.

64
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:49,733
I promise.

65
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,743
Well, that's what I call booty.

66
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,740
Comrade.

67
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,716
A woman with a sword.

68
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,470
Look at this.

69
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,473
Frenchmen are such cowards,
they've left all the fighting to women.

70
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,477
If that's God's will,
then so be it.

71
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,481
Fine with me.
I love women.

72
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,465
Hold still, bitch.

73
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,467
How can I do it
if you keep wriggling about?

74
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:31,478
Your turn now.

75
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,472
God, preserve and bless the soul
of this, our dearly departed.

76
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,475
Keep us safe from fear and sin.
Amen.

77
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,483
Come on.

78
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,484
Listen, Jeanne.

79
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,488
Your aunt and uncle are gonna take you
to their house for a couple of weeks...

80
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,491
just to give us time
to rebuild things here.

81
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,459
You understand?

82
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,489
Lord, we give thanks
for the food you've given us.

83
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,491
Teach us always
to love this land...

84
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,453
and to save it from those
who seek to destroy it.

85
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,455
- Amen.
- Amen.

86
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,480
So, good night, then.

87
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,492
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll be fine.

88
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,454
She'll grow up, find a good man,
make him some children. Don't worry.

89
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,456
She's been hurt, but she'll survive.

90
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,459
Tomorrow she'll be
as right as rain.

91
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,461
You'll see.

92
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,467
I want to see a priest.

93
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,452
- Why did she have to die?
- Only God can answer that.

94
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:01,456
I know Jesus says
to love your enemies, but I can't.

95
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,460
I just want the English
to burn in hell forever and ever!

96
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,464
I realize your anger, Jeanne.

97
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,466
But we must learn to forgive.
It's hard...

98
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:15,429
but revenge will never
bring about peace.

99
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,473
What will?
And what will bring her back?

100
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,477
And why did she have to die
in the first place instead of me?

101
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,479
Why didn't He take my life
instead of hers?

102
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,441
It was my fault!
I was late!

103
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:32,487
She gave me her hiding place!
Why did He save me?

104
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,490
Calm down, Jeanne.
Calm down.

105
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,455
I don't pretend
to know God's will...

106
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,458
but one thing I am sure:

107
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,462
The Lord always has a good reason.

108
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,466
Perhaps He chose you because
He needs you...

109
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,468
for some higher calling.

110
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,429
As long as you answer that call...

111
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,475
your sister will not
have died in vain.

112
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,436
I don't want to wait
for His call.

113
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,480
Be patient.

114
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,482
I want to be with Him always.

115
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,486
Soon you will be able to take part
in your Holy Mass.

116
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,489
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood...

117
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,491
you will be at one with Him.

118
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,411
I want to be at one with Him now.

119
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,920
So, what did he say?

120
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,214
He says we must bring her to church
whenever she wants.

121
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,218
Easy for him. He's not the one
who has to do the bringing.

122
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,220
Come on.
This is important.

123
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,223
We mustn't let her out of our sight.

124
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,227
Don't worry. I will watch her
like my own shadow.

125
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,237
I want to be at one with You now.

126
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,230
A message for the dauphin of France.

127
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,241
A message.

128
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,212
Captain, a message for the dauphin.

129
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,214
I'll take it.

130
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,223
The dauphin!
The dauphin!

131
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:04,241
Louis. Louis. Hey.
Shouldn't you be learning your lessons?

132
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,243
I don't want to learn.
I want to fight.

133
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,205
You will. But for now, you must
at least learn to wipe your nose.

134
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,211
A letter for His Majesty.

135
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,179
Another one from this girl
calling herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

136
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,223
I can read for myself,
you know?

137
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,185
She pretends she's been sent by God.
Charlatans.

138
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,228
It's a pity there isn't enough wood
to burn them all.

139
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,231
- She says she'll be here tomorrow.
- You mustn't see her, My Lord.

140
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,235
We know nothing about her. We don't
even know if she's from Lorraine.

141
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,237
What difference does it make
where she comes from?

142
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,240
If she comes from Burgundy,
it makes a difference.

143
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,242
It might be a trap.
Look, signed ''X.''

144
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,203
What sort of a name is ''X''?

145
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,206
Or must we assume that a messenger
of God can't even write her own name?

146
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,209
My Lord, Trémoille is correct.
She says she hears voices.

147
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,212
She may be a sorceress,
a witch.

148
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,215
Regnault, you see witches everywhere.

149
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,217
She's just a peasant.

150
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,221
A peasant who cares about her king.

151
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,225
All she wants is to see me crowned
and permission to fight for me.

152
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,229
Not exactly. She wants you
to give her an army at your expense.

153
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,232
Bearing in mind your mother stole every
last piece of gold in the treasury...

154
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,235
I fail to see how you can afford
such an adventure.

155
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,237
I can see her if I want to.

156
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,243
After all, with half of France
in the hands of the English...

157
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,203
what have I got to lose?

158
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:32,204
The other half.

159
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,207
You mustn't see her,
Your Majesty.

160
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,209
She may be an instrument
of the devil.

161
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,211
Well, I think you should.

162
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,219
Well, here's an amusing situation.

163
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,223
I would love to know why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing...

164
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:55,227
and my two most loyal
and trusted advisors...

165
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,229
think precisely the opposite.

166
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:01,233
Because I care about you.
Come here.

167
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:15,205
Your health and happiness has always
been my first concern, Charles...

168
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,207
ever since you were a little boy.

169
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,209
And I think I know you
better than your own mother.

170
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,211
You think so, eh?

171
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,214
Yes.

172
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,217
I know, for example,
the sickness that plagues your heart.

173
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,220
I know how painful it is
for you to have loved a father...

174
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,224
without ever knowing
if he was really yours.

175
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,228
Do I know you enough? Hmm?

176
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,233
What has that got to do
with this maiden?

177
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:47,237
Who better than a messenger from God
to give answers to your questions?

178
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,241
You think she was sent from God?

179
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,243
You're a fine judge
of character, Charles.

180
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,205
It'll take you less than five minutes
to expose her if she's a fake.

181
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,209
But if she's not...

182
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,213
then she will give you
your answers...

183
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,218
and place the crown on your head.

184
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,224
With respect to my lady, I think it's
going to take more than a peasant girl--

185
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,227
I'm not interested
in what you think, Trémoille...

186
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,228
or even what I think.

187
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:22,231
It's what simple people think
that matters, and the fact is that...

188
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:28,237
simple people up and down this country
are already talking about her.

189
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,239
Now, you know
what simple people are like--

190
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,242
always ready to believe
any old prophecy.

191
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,206
Like this one...

192
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,209
about a virgin from Lorraine...

193
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,212
saving France.

194
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,218
And now...

195
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,222
this girl comes along...

196
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,224
from Lorraine.

197
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,229
And suddenly, there's a spark
of hope in their simple minds.

198
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,239
You shouldn't disappoint them.

199
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:16,243
If they believe in her--

200
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,204
if she can put back
the fire in our army--

201
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,207
then I believe in her too.

202
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:39,224
Stop it!

203
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,229
Louis, be quiet for once.

204
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,209
- She's coming, Your Majesty.
- All right.

205
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,210
Calm yourself.

206
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,214
Your Majesty, I urge you
not to see this woman.

207
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,216
It all reeks of a Burgundian trap.

208
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:16,220
My astrologers assure me the timing
is propitious: Leo with Virgo rising.

209
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,224
Have you never noticed
on the astrological chart...

210
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,226
that the virgin
is next to the lion?

211
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,228
Supposing she's an assassin?

212
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,232
My-My-My dear Trémoille...

213
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,234
I'm not even king yet.

214
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,236
Who would want to assassinate me?

215
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,207
She's arrived, My Lord.
She's in the guards' room.

216
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,208
Fine, fine.

217
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,215
I suppose I shall have
to make a decision.

218
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,227
Why is life so complicated?

219
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,231
Sometimes I really wish
I could be someone else.

220
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,236
That's a good idea, sire.

221
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,575
What do you mean?

222
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,536
Let someone else
pretend to be you.

223
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,539
And see if she can find me?
That's a brilliant idea.

224
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,542
If she's really been sent by God,
she'll discover the trap.

225
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,712
And if she's an assassin,
she'll kill the wrong man. Brilliant.

226
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,434
- Mother?
- Not now.

227
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,615
I have come to see the dauphin.

228
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:17,794
Who are you?

229
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:21,673
I'm - I'm --

230
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:26,428
His most gracious majesty,
Charles de Valois...

231
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,180
dauphin of France.

232
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,494
I can see you are a good man.

233
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:51,495
But you're not the dauphin.

234
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,461
I'm sorry to insist,
but I must see the dauphin.

235
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:02,464
We have no time to lose.
Where is he?

236
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:08,470
He's here.
Find him yourself.

237
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,458
Now you'll see
who'll pass for a king.

238
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,451
There's no need to be afraid, sire.

239
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:57,496
I'm not the king.

240
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:02,459
I know you're not yet,
but you will be soon.

241
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,432
Out. Out.

242
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:21,478
How did you know who I am?

243
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,480
- Her voices, of course.
- ''That's him,'' they said.

244
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,483
''The one in the corner
with the big nose.''

245
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:34,491
Back off!.

246
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,415
Oh, my gentle dauphin.

247
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,467
I have a message...

248
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,470
from the King of Heaven...

249
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,472
for you.

250
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,476
You only.

251
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,487
Follow me.

252
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,490
Your Majesty, I really think --

253
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:20,495
My dear loyal Trémoille,
I know I can count on you...

254
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,456
to - to ensure our privacy.

255
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,459
I need to talk to her alone.

256
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,467
He needs to talk to her alone.

257
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,469
Fine.

258
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,488
I was about ten years old.

259
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,491
It was a beautiful spring day.

260
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,493
I was taking a shortcut home
through the forest...

261
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:04,456
when a strange wind...

262
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:06,416
began to blow.

263
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:18,470
It was such a strange sound,
almost like words...

264
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,430
calling me.

265
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,494
The second time...

266
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,455
was many years later.

267
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,459
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly...

268
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,461
the same...

269
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,424
violent wind.

270
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,472
Then...

271
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,476
a shape...

272
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,437
appeared...

273
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,482
in the middle of the sky.

274
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,485
The shape...

275
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:16,486
of...

276
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:19,489
of a man.

277
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:37,466
Everything was moving so fast.
So fast.

278
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:41,470
The wind, the clouds.

279
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,475
I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.

280
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:51,480
I was so frightened.

281
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,483
He was...

282
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:56,485
so...

283
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,445
so...

284
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,490
here.

285
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,460
And then I knew
that God had chosen me.

286
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:17,464
But I did not understand
what it was He wanted me to do.

287
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:21,426
What was my mission?
What could I do to help my country?

288
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,471
But how? I was nothing.
I was just a poor girl.

289
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,476
I did not know anything about--
about making war or riding.

290
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:33,438
So I decided to wait...

291
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,483
and not to speak of it
to anybody.

292
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,485
You did well.
You did well.

293
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,488
I didn't wait long.

294
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,452
I was going to Mass,
like I do every day...

295
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,455
and the same...

296
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:54,459
strange wind--

297
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,490
Everything was made clear.

298
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,494
God had given me a message.

299
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,457
A message to deliver.

300
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,463
What--

301
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,465
What was the message?

302
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:52,476
He said...

303
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,480
that I must save France
from her enemies...

304
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,441
and bring her back
into the hands of God.

305
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,486
And He told me that I...

306
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,488
Jeanne...

307
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,491
will lead you
to the altar at Reims...

308
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,454
where you will be crowned...

309
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:15,457
the king...

310
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:22,464
of France.

311
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,448
- Sire, are you --
- I'm fine.

312
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,496
This is, in fact, Jean d'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.

313
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:57,457
I put her in your care.

314
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,419
Find her suitable lodgings
here in the castle...

315
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:02,462
and guard her with your life.

316
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,466
Sire, I won't be needing any lodgings
if we're to be marching on Orléans.

317
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,468
Orléans has held out
for six months...

318
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,471
so I don't suppose a few days more
will make much difference.

319
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,431
Take some rest.

320
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,482
Put the bags here.

321
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,486
Please accept my apologies...

322
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,489
for me pretending
to be the -- you know.

323
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,491
Do you think
that I can have some water?

324
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:34,494
Water. Yes, of course.

325
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,413
Would you get some water?

326
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,457
- Anything else?
- I need to see a priest.

327
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,461
- Now?
- Yes. I didn't confess today.

328
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:48,425
All right.
Raymond, a priest.

329
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:49,426
Anything else?

330
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,470
I shall also be needing
a new war horse...

331
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,473
a sword, armor...

332
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,476
and an artist
to make a banner for me.

333
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,479
- Now?
- Better today than tomorrow.

334
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,439
This might take a little time...

335
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,485
but let me see what I can do.

336
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,489
Oh! I shall also be needing someone
who can read and write.

337
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,491
This I can do.

338
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,494
I was studying at the University
of Paris until the English invaded it.

339
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,455
- I thought you were an archer.
- Yes, I am.

340
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm an archer who can read and write.
Who do you want to write to?

341
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,420
The king of England.

342
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,467
I want to give him the chance
to leave in peace...

343
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,472
before I get to Orléans.

344
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:44,439
Dunois.

345
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,443
- What?
- A big one, straight at us.

346
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:52,447
What side?

347
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,199
Window side.

348
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:10,841
What?

349
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,845
I have wonderful news, finally.

350
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,848
He is sending her to us.
Thanks be to God. We're saved.

351
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:18,849
It's--
It's wonderful.

352
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,810
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.
Who has finally done what?

353
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:25,814
The dauphin. He's sending us
food and supplies and an army...

354
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:28,817
led by Jeanne,
the maiden from Lorraine.

355
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:30,819
Isn't it wonderful?

356
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,821
Yes, it's a miracle.

357
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:39,828
I can't believe
they are sending a woman.

358
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,832
I wonder what color dress
she'll be wearing.

359
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:45,834
Blue.

360
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,838
With a blue ribbon in her hair
to tie up Talbot.

361
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:56,845
Does anyone know if
she even knows how to ride a horse?

362
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:57,846
She knows.

363
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:12,819
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

364
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,822
Yes, we were.

365
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,825
- Where are the English?
- Everywhere. Where's the food?

366
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,827
It's coming.
I rode on ahead.

367
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:24,831
I have a message
for the captain of the English army.

368
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:25,832
- His name is Talbot.
- I know.

369
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,837
- Can you take me to him?
- He's on the other side of the river.

370
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,840
So, who gave the order for me
to be brought to this side of the river?

371
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,846
Hey, my friend. It's good
to see your ugly damn face again.

372
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,849
- La Hire, I'm warning you. Don't swear.
- Sorry, Jeanne.

373
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,812
Let me introduce the king's
half-brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

374
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,816
Lord Dunois, will you show me
to the other side of the river?

375
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,819
Wait. Wait!

376
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,825
Fine! Go now, if you want!
But not with me!

377
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,829
You may have a duty to God,
but I have a duty to my people.

378
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,832
And my people are starving.

379
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,835
Right now, I'm going to take
the food back to the city.

380
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,838
And if you can please calm down
and let me accompany you to Orléans...

381
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,840
it will be my honor
to welcome you.

382
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,818
Jesus Christ.

383
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,820
The goddamn English
will pay for this.

384
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,824
Yes, they will, and so will you
if you don't stop swearing.

385
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,846
Come on. I'm happy
to welcome you in my tavern.

386
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:45,848
Come on in.

387
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,811
La Hire, Gilles,
let me show you something.

388
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,823
Tourelles are around here.
The river crosses there.

389
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:10,831
Calm down.
You can't blame those people.

390
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,833
They've been hearing
about you for weeks.

391
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,836
There's nothing to hear!
And why is there nothing to hear?

392
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,838
Because I haven't done anything!
And why haven't I?

393
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,841
'Cause none of you
will listen to me!

394
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,848
Why don't you join us?

395
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:30,809
We're about to discuss
the campaign.

396
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:34,813
I'm sorry.

397
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,815
So from here,
Talbot has spread his forces...

398
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:38,817
between these forts up here.

399
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:41,820
But in the last few days it seems,
according to our scouts...

400
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,823
that some troops have been
deployed to this fort here.

401
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:45,824
What about this huge pile down here?

402
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:48,827
That's the Tourelles.
The English were planning...

403
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:51,830
to launch an attack from it,
but then we broke down the bridge--

404
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:54,833
- I did.
- Yeah.

405
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,835
Which should keep them quiet
for a while.

406
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,838
Now, my hunch is...

407
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,007
the attack will come
from St. Loup, here.

408
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,469
And what does Jeanne think?

409
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,473
I don't think.
I leave that to God.

410
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:12,434
I am nothing in all of this.
I'm just the messenger.

411
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:13,810
So...

412
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,812
what is the message?

413
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:20,067
We give the English...

414
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,069
a last chance
to go home in peace.

415
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,071
And if they refuse?

416
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,072
If they refuse...

417
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,077
we recross the river...

418
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,081
and attack here...

419
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,082
at the Tourelles.

420
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,087
That makes no sense at all.
The Tourelles is virtually impregnable.

421
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:44,091
If we are on the other side of the river
attacking the Tourelles...

422
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,094
what's to stop Talbot
attacking the city from the north?

423
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:51,098
- God.
- God. Why, of course.

424
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:55,060
We'd forgotten about Him.

425
00:48:57,563 --> 00:49:02,067
I feel a great sorrow for you
because you are laughing now...

426
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,070
but by tomorrow night,
some of you will be dead.

427
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:08,073
With respect, we can't just
attack the Tourelles like that.

428
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:11,076
- It's a very complicated matter.
- What's so complicated about it?

429
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:16,081
All you have to do is what you're told.
What could be simpler than that?

430
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,083
I am the drum...

431
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:20,085
on which God is beating out
His message.

432
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:23,088
He's beating it so hard,
it's bursting my ears!

433
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,091
You have to understand,
it's not easy for us.

434
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:29,094
I mean, for our pride
to suddenly be usurped by--

435
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:38,061
Well, with all due respect,
by a--

436
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,063
by a girl.

437
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,070
So that's it.

438
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:52,075
To you, I'm just a girl.

439
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:58,081
Put yourself in my shoes for a moment.
How would you feel if you were me?

440
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:01,084
Knowing what I know...

441
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:04,087
enormous gratitude.

442
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,093
One hell of a girl, huh?

443
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,060
I warned you.

444
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:26,068
I do love her when her fire
gets well and truly stoked.

445
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:28,070
Me too.

446
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,074
Hello, my friends!

447
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,077
What a journey.

448
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,079
But we made it.

449
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,082
Back together again.
Let's have some fun.

450
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:47,089
Fine.
I shall look like a man.

451
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,097
Stop it!

452
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,058
How dare you stop me
from doing God's will!

453
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,060
He didn't tell you
to cut all your hair off!.

454
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,062
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!

455
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,065
Whatever! But since He's not going
to come down and cut it Himself--

456
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,067
At least let someone
cut it properly!

457
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,072
Raymond, bring the scissors.

458
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:15,075
Louis, fetch the mirror.

459
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,081
Stop getting so angry about everything.
Calm down.

460
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:25,085
I am calm!
It's God that's angry.

461
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:28,088
I need to send a letter, now.

462
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:29,089
Fine.

463
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,092
''To you, Henry, king of England...

464
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:36,096
and to you, Duke of Bedford,
who call yourself regent of France...

465
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:40,058
obey the King of Heaven
and abandon your siege.

466
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,061
Give back the keys
to the other towns you've taken...

467
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:45,063
and go back home
to your island.

468
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:49,067
To you, Lord Talbot, I beg you
as humbly as I can beg you...

469
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,070
for the sake of the lives
of your soldiers...

470
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,072
do not bring about
your own destruction.

471
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:58,076
Surrender to me, Jeanne the maiden,
who wassen there by God. ''

472
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,081
Message!

473
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,084
''But if you do not
heed my warning...

474
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,086
then we shall raise
such a battle cry...

475
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,088
as there has not been heard in France
for a thousand years. ''

476
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:22,059
Sire, message.

477
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,062
''This is the third and last time
I will write to you.

478
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,064
If you are still here at noon,
I warn you...

479
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:30,067
you will hear from me
to your very great destruction.

480
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:33,070
Please give me your answer
speedily. ''

481
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:35,072
Go fuck yourself!

482
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:40,077
What did they say?

483
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:44,081
They said
they'll think about it.

484
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:47,084
Good.

485
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:50,087
To be honest,
I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.

486
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,093
I can't wait for tomorrow.

487
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,081
French blood is spilling.

488
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:33,088
Wake up! Hurry!

489
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,093
They've started the battle
without me.

490
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:47,060
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won.

491
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:52,065
Damn.

492
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:58,071
Sound the retreat!

493
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,075
My banner.
My banner!

494
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,083
Open the gate!

495
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,099
What happened?
Who gave the order to attack?

496
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:29,061
God knows.
It was a bad idea.

497
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:31,063
Were the men confessed?
Where are the priests?

498
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,066
We didn't take them.
We wanted to make a surprise attack.

499
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,068
Dunois, was it you
who gave the order to attack?

500
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,072
- Answer me!
- Can we discuss this later?

501
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,075
Sooner is better than later.

502
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:44,076
Wait!

503
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,081
You'll be killed!

504
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,094
Follow me!

505
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:04,096
Follow me
and I will give you victory!

506
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:13,063
Close it!

507
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,065
Close the drawbridge!

508
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,090
To the drawbridge!

509
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:46,096
- What is she doing?
- To the drawbridge!

510
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:48,098
- The drawbridge is closed.
- Not for long.

511
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:58,066
Let's go!

512
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,075
That's mine.

513
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:44,089
It's a great victory--
your victory--

514
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,091
but we must follow it through
and pursue the English...

515
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:49,094
back to Talbot's camp unless,
of course, you have another good idea.

516
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:53,098
First, we find
the biggest army we can.

517
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,058
- Then we return to Orléans.
- The bridge has been pulled down.

518
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,062
- The English are rebuilding it.
- And how do you know?

519
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:03,066
You have been with your counsel,
and I have been with mine.

520
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,079
Come on!
Hurry up!

521
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:41,063
Be careful with my baby.

522
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:15,097
- That's the Tourelles.
- Wonderful.

523
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:16,098
Captain!

524
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:25,065
Looks like the froggy whore's
coming to pay us a visit.

525
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,067
I'd better tell Glasdale.

526
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,074
Let's put the horses over there.

527
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,083
Fathers, please, bless them.

528
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,085
- Please, bless them all.
- We will.

529
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,061
Let's plan this attack a little more
carefully than this morning.

530
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:05,063
Good idea.

531
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:11,069
Sire.

532
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:16,074
We've got, uh, visitors.

533
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:37,095
Glasdale!

534
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:42,059
Do you hear me?

535
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,061
You, who call me a whore...

536
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:48,065
I feel pity for you,
for your soul...

537
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:50,067
and for the souls of your men!

538
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:54,071
Yield! Yield now
to the King of Heaven!

539
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:57,074
Or go back to your island!

540
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:01,078
And you, go back to your pigsty!

541
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,087
Man the walls.

542
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:33,068
This morning...

543
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:36,071
God gave us a great victory.

544
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:43,036
But it is nothing compared
to what He is ready to give us now.

545
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,082
I know you are all
tired and hungry...

546
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,085
but I swear to you...

547
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:55,090
that even if these English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips...

548
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,092
we would pull them down
before nightfall.

549
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,096
Now...

550
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:03,098
let all those who love me...

551
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,019
follow me!

552
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:16,069
Follow me!

553
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,081
You were saying?

554
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,089
Come on!

555
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:42,095
- I go right.
- I go left!

556
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,061
Come on!

557
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:57,069
Get that fucking pot of oil
up here now!

558
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:09,081
Get that fucking thing moving!

559
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:22,094
Come on!
Move that fucker faster!

560
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:26,098
You're beautiful.

561
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,058
Let's see if you're powerful.

562
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,076
- Do something!
- Like what?

563
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,078
I don't care!
Do something!

564
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:51,081
And fire!

565
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,091
Fire!

566
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,096
What the fuck?

567
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,057
Too high.
Reload!

568
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:27,075
- Get out of here!
- Where are the men?

569
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:29,703
You're gonna get killed!
Get out of here!

570
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:40,964
Come on, fight!

571
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:44,968
Go!
Come on, fight!

572
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:53,936
Bring the culverin!

573
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:00,943
Get out!

574
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:07,950
I'm going up the side!

575
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:19,920
- Jeanne!
- Leave me alone!

576
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:23,966
Hurry!
Come on! Come on!

577
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,935
Yes!

578
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:20,939
Hey, you just killed my woman!
Captain!

579
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,943
Go to hell.

580
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:30,949
Call the physician!
The physician!

581
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,910
Damn it!

582
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:35,913
Louis, find the physician.

583
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:38,957
We have to take out the arrow.

584
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,959
She'll bleed to death.

585
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,962
There must be something we can do
for her, for Christ's sakes.

586
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:47,966
- Yes. You can pray.
- Good idea.

587
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:53,972
I swear that I will
never swear again in my life...

588
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:55,933
if You save her life.

589
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,894
But I'm warning You,
if You let her die...

590
01:06:59,436 --> 01:06:59,895
then You're the biggest--

591
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,945
- Don't swear.
- He heard me.

592
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,908
Why--

593
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,952
Why aren't you fighting?

594
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:15,953
You've been badly wounded.

595
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:19,957
- It's nothing. It's --
- It's an arrow.

596
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:21,917
And it's in deep.

597
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:29,967
You must stay still
till the physician arrives.

598
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,971
Physicians are a waste of time.
We'll have more luck with this charm.

599
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,974
It saved my life at Agincourt.

600
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:38,934
I'd rather die than use magic.

601
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:41,937
You will die if that arrow
stays in you much longer.

602
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:09,965
Well, at least this
won't bother us anymore.

603
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,970
Now, let's go to the battle!

604
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:20,934
Please!

605
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:25,939
She's nuts.

606
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,942
You must stay calm.
You must rest.

607
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:30,944
I'll rest.

608
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:32,946
But you have to...

609
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:34,907
promise me...

610
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,952
that you'll --
that you'll go back to the battle.

611
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,955
I promise.

612
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,967
Hurry!

613
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:54,968
Quickly!
Do something!

614
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,941
She's sleeping.

615
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:10,943
What?

616
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,914
Come on back!
Why are you running away?

617
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:28,961
- Jeanne is alive.
- Good.

618
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:32,965
- We have to press on the attack.
- Sound the retreat.

619
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:34,967
- I promised Jeanne we'd fight on.
- I made no such promise.

620
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:38,929
- Sound the retreat for the night.
- No, that was her order.

621
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:41,932
I'm fed up
with taking her orders!

622
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:44,935
She swore she'd defeat
the English before nightfall!

623
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:48,897
Instead, she goes and plays the fool,
gets herself nearly killed!

624
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,900
Look!
Look at the mess we're in!

625
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:53,944
That's her mess, not mine!

626
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,947
We are worse off
than if she'd never come at all.

627
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,951
Now do as I say
and sound the retreat!

628
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:11,962
Where are you going?
Hey, come back!

629
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:13,922
Come back and fight!

630
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,904
- What are you making?
- A message for the English.

631
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:44,953
So, what are the men saying?

632
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:47,956
She's a gift from God.

633
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,959
Some even call her a saint.

634
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:54,963
- I'd gladly follow her through hell.
- Will you go that far if she asks you?

635
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,966
Of course I will,
and I've been there before.

636
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:04,932
There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

637
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:07,935
She's been sent to us by God.

638
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,939
Why does He allow her
to be wounded so badly?

639
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,943
Maybe the good question is,
is she really sent by God?

640
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:20,948
Who knows?

641
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,951
God knows.

642
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,971
Ooh.
A woman with a sword.

643
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:35,939
You've hurt my feelings.

644
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:34,957
Frenchies!

645
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:36,959
What happened to your precious angel?

646
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,964
Huh?
Frenchies! Frenchies!

647
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,967
I'll tell you what happened!

648
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:47,970
We sent the little bitch
back to hell...

649
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:52,891
so she can go fuck
with the devil!

650
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:58,939
What are you gonna do now,
Frenchies?

651
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:02,943
Why not come out and fight?
Come on!

652
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:06,947
Come on!
Bastards, wake up!

653
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:09,950
Or are you too busy praying...

654
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,912
to bring your little fucking witch
back from the dead?

655
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,916
Do you hear me?

656
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:21,962
I hear you!

657
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:27,968
I'm alive!

658
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:34,892
May God forgive your blasphemy...

659
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:39,938
for I never will.

660
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:45,944
I never will!

661
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:57,956
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

662
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,959
We must wake up the soldiers, now!

663
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,920
My fine soldiers, wake up!

664
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:07,925
To arms!
To arms!

665
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:11,970
Wake up! Wake up!
We must fight the battle!

666
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,936
My fine soldiers,
the battle has begun!

667
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:26,902
Wake up!
The time has come!

668
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,951
The battle has begun!

669
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:35,953
- To arms!
- Yes?

670
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:40,958
My soldiers, we need this tower up!
We need this tower up, now!

671
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:48,966
Pull!

672
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,932
- What's going on?
- We're taking back the Tourelles.

673
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,943
Get ready!

674
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:18,912
Go wake up Glasdale.

675
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,973
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to Glasdale.

676
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:40,934
- With that?
- Yes.

677
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,896
But you've got it back-to-front.

678
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:45,898
Listen, I know what I'm doing...

679
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,943
so either lend a hand
or get back to bed.

680
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:53,947
I'm going to send a message
to Glasdale too.

681
01:16:59,453 --> 01:16:59,953
My lord?

682
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:01,955
What?

683
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,960
The French witch,
she's back from the dead.

684
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:08,921
Hurry up, men!

685
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:13,967
Don't you think we should take
some time to think about this?

686
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,969
Sooner is better than later.

687
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,938
To arms!
To arms!

688
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:26,939
Good morning.

689
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:34,905
This one.

690
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,952
What the fuck is she playing at?

691
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:43,956
I don't know! The question is,
what is she doing now?

692
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:46,959
How can we plan anything
if she doesn't consult with us?

693
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,962
- Did we consult with her yesterday?
- Don't even start.

694
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,965
- You agreed to attack yesterday too.
- Yes, but that doesn't count.

695
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:54,967
- Why is that?
- Because I always agree to attack.

696
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:56,927
To arms!

697
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:06,937
Crazy bitch.

698
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:08,939
She doesn't even know
how to use it.

699
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:22,911
Oh, my God!

700
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:34,965
- Fuck! Close the doors!
- Close the doors!

701
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,937
- Open the door!
- Load the porcupine!

702
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:58,947
Pull!

703
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:16,965
And pull!

704
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:21,970
Come on!
Hurry up!

705
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:35,901
Come on!

706
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,961
Never wait for miracles.
Stay there.

707
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:00,926
French whore!
Come and get me!

708
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:05,973
What are you waiting for?

709
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:10,936
Yes? Oh, Jeanne!

710
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:14,940
Find your archers
and burn that door!

711
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,942
Right away!

712
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:22,906
Push!

713
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,959
Prepare the gate!
Come on!

714
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:35,961
Position!

715
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:39,965
Fire!

716
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:47,931
Water!

717
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:48,932
Fire!

718
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,941
Oh, my God!

719
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:05,949
Kill her.

720
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:11,955
Fuck. Reload!

721
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:12,956
More archers!

722
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,944
Perfect.

723
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,949
More archers!

724
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:47,950
Help me!

725
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,964
Get your men!
We'll load this up as a battering ram!

726
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:03,966
Already done.

727
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:38,959
- What?
- Nothing.

728
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,967
Help me with these men, please.

729
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:48,927
Yes.

730
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:51,972
As you command.

731
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:05,944
Wait.
What are you doing?

732
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:09,948
We're going to open that door.
Isn't that what you want?

733
01:23:13,452 --> 01:23:14,953
Get out of my fucking way!

734
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:21,960
Fill the cauldron!

735
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,965
Fucking French!
What the fuck do you know about me?

736
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:35,974
Reload.
Reload!

737
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:45,943
Fill the fucking cauldron!
What are you waiting for?

738
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:52,950
More men!
More men!

739
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:06,964
Ready!

740
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:33,949
Pour the oil!
Pour the oil!

741
01:25:28,462 --> 01:25:30,964
What are you doing, Jeanne?

742
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:34,968
I'm playing.

743
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:56,949
What are you doing
to me, Jeanne?

744
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:15,926
Do you hear me?

745
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:17,970
Are you all right?

746
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,973
Do you hear me?
Calm down.

747
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:22,933
It's over.

748
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:24,935
We won.

749
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:26,937
- We won?
- Yes.

750
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:36,947
Fucking bitch.

751
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:42,953
My friend! My soldier!
In my arms.

752
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:47,958
- We won?
- Won?

753
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:51,962
No. No, Jeanne.
So small a word will never do.

754
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:54,965
This is victory!

755
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:57,968
This is glory!

756
01:27:25,454 --> 01:27:26,955
What's the matter?

757
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,961
This is glory?

758
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:38,967
Doesn't matter.

759
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:47,935
This is not possible.

760
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:02,950
It is not possible.

761
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,954
You look disappointed.
Isn't this what you wanted?

762
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:10,958
No.
Not like this.

763
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:13,961
For weeks you've been asking for this.

764
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:16,964
Well, now you have it.

765
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:26,974
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

766
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:28,934
I'm just taking his teeth.

767
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:33,939
But you just can't kill a man
for his teeth.

768
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:35,941
Why not? He has good teeth.

769
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:39,945
Because--
Because you can't!

770
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:43,949
What about all this?

771
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:45,951
But that's different.

772
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:49,955
I mean, we were fighting for a cause.

773
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:53,959
Not me.
He's my prisoner...

774
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:54,960
I can take his teeth
if I want to.

775
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,964
No, you can't!
Stop it!

776
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:00,966
Here. Take this!

777
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:04,970
He's mine now.
Here, you.

778
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:06,972
Go.

779
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:11,935
Bravo. And what about
all the other prisoners?

780
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:14,938
- Do we let them go too?
- I don't know.

781
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:17,941
Maybe.

782
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:29,953
We must confess.
We must confess.

783
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,958
Please, we have to be confessed.
All of us.

784
01:29:40,464 --> 01:29:42,966
I know this is not normal custom...

785
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:44,968
but, uh--

786
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,934
Everything's gonna be fine.
He's gonna confess us.

787
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:57,940
Kneel. Kneel.

788
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:10,953
Alençon brings bad news.

789
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:14,957
Thousands of English are forming up
on the far side of the river.

790
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,960
I think we should count our men
and get ready.

791
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:19,962
Let's go.

792
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:00,961
I'll go.

793
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:06,967
Alone.

794
01:31:35,454 --> 01:31:37,956
I have a message for your King Henry!

795
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,960
It is a message from God!

796
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,962
Go home!

797
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:49,968
Go now, in peace!

798
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,972
If you do not go now,
you will be buried in this field!

799
01:31:57,434 --> 01:32:01,939
I've seen enough blood!

800
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:05,943
But if you want more...

801
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:08,946
I can't stop you!

802
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:13,951
I can only warn you
that it will be your blood...

803
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:16,954
not ours!

804
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,959
I'm waiting for your answer.

805
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:40,936
Never wait for miracles.
Stand by to attack.

806
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:55,951
Please.

807
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,960
My Lord...

808
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:06,962
please.

809
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:41,955
Now that's what I call
a goddamn bloody miracle.

810
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:43,957
She was on her white horse alone...

811
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,960
facing the whole English army,
and she drove them away...

812
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:49,963
and now Orléans is free.

813
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:01,934
We lost Orléans.

814
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:04,937
I want that girl.

815
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,944
I want that girl burned.

816
01:34:32,464 --> 01:34:34,967
May I see the seamstress?
It's too tight. I can't breathe.

817
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:38,971
That's meant to be a crown?
Don't you have something more regal?

818
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:40,973
The English took the real one.

819
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:43,934
It's been muddy so long I forgot
how good it looked cleaned up.

820
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:46,937
But did you remember to clean up
what's inside as well?

821
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:50,941
I ask for a grandiose coronation,
and this is what you give?

822
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:52,943
This whole thing is going to be
an utter fiasco!

823
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:56,947
You gave me 3 days to prepare.
Your father's coronation took 3 months.

824
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:58,949
He's right.
We should call for a delay.

825
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:00,951
No time.
We can't hold up the ceremony.

826
01:35:01,451 --> 01:35:02,953
No telling when the English
might come back.

827
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,956
Let them come. Let them see
who is the true king of France.

828
01:35:16,466 --> 01:35:19,970
Those damn English. We should be
doing this in Paris in Notre Dame.

829
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,972
It is much more prestigious
and twice as big.

830
01:35:22,472 --> 01:35:24,933
It is the sacred place that matters,
not the size. Correct, Bishop?

831
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:28,937
Yes, my lady.
True kings of France must be anointed...

832
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:31,940
in our great cathedral of Reims
with the holy oil of Clovis.

833
01:35:43,452 --> 01:35:45,954
Your Grace!
There can be no anointing.

834
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,958
- What are you talking about?
- The holy oil of Clovis is all gone.

835
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:51,960
Gone?
That's impossible.

836
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:55,964
It's a magic oil. A miraculous oil.
It can never be exhausted.

837
01:35:56,465 --> 01:35:57,966
- Look for yourself.
- Problem?

838
01:35:58,467 --> 01:35:59,968
I just don't understand.

839
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:02,971
The oil of Clovis. It was quite full
the last time I saw it.

840
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:06,934
- And when was that?
- At the coronation of King Charles VI.

841
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:09,937
Thirty years ago?
Does it surprise you it's gone?

842
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:12,940
But you don't understand.

843
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,944
It's no ordinary oil.
It's a miraculous oil.

844
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:20,948
It was brought
by a white dove from heaven...

845
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:22,950
to crown King Clovis
in this very cathedral.

846
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:27,955
- What are you doing?
- Performing a miracle.

847
01:37:48,452 --> 01:37:51,955
With this sacred oil, blessed by
the hand of God the Father Almighty...

848
01:37:52,456 --> 01:37:54,958
we do anoint thee, Charles Valois...

849
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:59,963
to be sovereign lord and king
of this great kingdom of France...

850
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:03,967
charging that we should defend
the faith of our Mother Holy Church...

851
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:06,970
as long as we shall live.

852
01:38:08,472 --> 01:38:09,973
Amen.

853
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:45,968
Long live the king!

854
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:07,948
- Jeanne, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

855
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,954
- Why are you staring at me?
- You have an arrow in your leg.

856
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:20,961
So there is.

857
01:39:23,463 --> 01:39:24,965
But that doesn't stop you
from climbing!

858
01:39:26,466 --> 01:39:29,970
Well, climb! Go! Go!

859
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:36,935
Take this arrow out of my leg.

860
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:43,942
Look out!

861
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:48,947
- Be careful!
- Jeanne, the men are exhausted.

862
01:39:49,448 --> 01:39:51,950
I know, but so is the enemy.
They're falling back. Paris is ours.

863
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:53,952
Jeanne, we are not enough.

864
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:56,955
So bring up the reinforcements.

865
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:58,957
Reinforcements? Where?

866
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:01,960
Right behind us.

867
01:40:02,461 --> 01:40:04,963
Dunois with another 10,000 men.

868
01:40:05,464 --> 01:40:07,966
- Jeanne, look behind you.
- Never look behind. Only ahead.

869
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:12,971
Do you know how to count?

870
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:18,936
Of course I do!
So, bring them up!

871
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:25,943
Jeanne, that is not
10,000 reinforcements!

872
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:27,903
That is 100...

873
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:30,948
very loyal
but very tired soldiers!

874
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,952
But where's Dunois?

875
01:40:35,452 --> 01:40:36,954
And where are the men
the king promised me?

876
01:40:37,454 --> 01:40:40,916
He never sent them!
Don't you understand?

877
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:42,960
He doesn't want this war anymore.

878
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,963
He has his crown now.
That's all he ever wanted.

879
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:50,968
But my voices, they promised me.

880
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:52,928
To hell with your voices!

881
01:40:56,473 --> 01:40:58,934
It's time to face facts!

882
01:41:01,436 --> 01:41:03,897
We have nothing to do here!

883
01:41:04,398 --> 01:41:05,941
None of us!

884
01:41:08,443 --> 01:41:09,945
Not even you.

885
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,953
You don't believe in me anymore?

886
01:41:18,453 --> 01:41:20,956
Jeanne, of course we still
believe in you.

887
01:41:21,456 --> 01:41:24,960
If it were up to me, I'd chase every
goddamn Englishman into the ocean.

888
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,963
But it's not up to us anymore.

889
01:41:28,422 --> 01:41:29,923
It's up to the king.

890
01:41:42,436 --> 01:41:43,937
You should go home, Jeanne.

891
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:01,955
We cannot possibly afford to pay
for the size of army she's demanding.

892
01:42:03,457 --> 01:42:03,957
Girl is crazy.

893
01:42:06,418 --> 01:42:07,961
Her victory at Orléans
was a miracle.

894
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:11,965
But we can't wait for a miracle
when we build a future for France.

895
01:42:14,468 --> 01:42:16,970
Paris was a disaster.

896
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:18,931
God wasn't with her then.

897
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:21,934
If God deserts her,
what do you think we should do?

898
01:42:34,446 --> 01:42:37,950
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours.
All I needed was a few hundred men.

899
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:42,913
- Why did you take the army you gave me?
- Gave you?

900
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:45,958
- I wouldn't quite put it that way.
- So how would you put it?

901
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:54,925
We are, of course,
enormously grateful...

902
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:56,969
for your past efforts...

903
01:42:57,469 --> 01:42:59,972
but now your task is done.

904
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:01,974
Now is the time for negotiation.

905
01:43:02,474 --> 01:43:04,935
Peace will only be got with the English
by the end of a lance.

906
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:08,939
Why are you so blood thirsty?
Do you enjoy it?

907
01:43:12,442 --> 01:43:13,944
Diplomacy is far more civilized...

908
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,947
far safer and far cheaper.

909
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:29,960
I've letters here from towns under
siege, where your people are starving...

910
01:43:30,419 --> 01:43:32,963
begging God on their knees
to help them.

911
01:43:33,463 --> 01:43:36,967
I'm here to answer their prayers.
And you want to stop me?

912
01:43:39,469 --> 01:43:41,972
France does not belong to you, Charles.

913
01:43:42,472 --> 01:43:44,933
She belongs to God.

914
01:43:56,445 --> 01:43:57,946
If only she would just go home.

915
01:44:18,467 --> 01:44:19,927
So what am I supposed to do now?

916
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,972
- What do your voices say?
- They haven't spoken to me in weeks.

917
01:44:24,473 --> 01:44:26,934
Not since the coronation.

918
01:44:27,434 --> 01:44:28,936
No signs, nothing.

919
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:31,897
Maybe their silence is a sign.

920
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,943
- Maybe it's a sign to go home.
- No.

921
01:44:36,443 --> 01:44:38,946
It's not time yet.
My mission isn't over yet.

922
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:44,910
- There's still more I have to do.
- But how do--

923
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:46,954
How do you know that these--

924
01:44:47,454 --> 01:44:49,957
these voices aren't just really you?

925
01:44:51,458 --> 01:44:55,921
Well, they are me.
That's how God speaks to me.

926
01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:00,968
Even you could hear them
if you listened hard enough.

927
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,972
You make it sound so simple.

928
01:45:06,473 --> 01:45:08,892
So even you don't believe in me anymore.

929
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:13,939
Jeanne, I believe in you
more than anyone.

930
01:45:14,439 --> 01:45:16,942
I just wish I could...

931
01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:18,944
help you.

932
01:45:20,404 --> 01:45:21,947
There is one thing you can do
if you want to help me.

933
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:23,949
Tell me.

934
01:45:24,449 --> 01:45:25,951
Tell the king to give back
the army that he gave me.

935
01:45:37,462 --> 01:45:38,964
We have to stop her, Your Majesty.

936
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:42,968
If she raises an army
and attacks the Burgundians...

937
01:45:43,468 --> 01:45:45,929
months of negotiations
will have been in vain.

938
01:45:47,472 --> 01:45:48,974
Jeanne has done so much for us.

939
01:45:49,433 --> 01:45:52,936
I can assure you, the maid has
no greater admirer than myself.

940
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:55,939
Whatever our personal feelings,
we cannot allow her to conduct...

941
01:45:56,398 --> 01:45:58,942
her own private war.

942
01:45:59,443 --> 01:46:02,946
For the sake of the kingdom, you must
stop her from going to Compiègne.

943
01:46:03,447 --> 01:46:04,948
I can't stop her.

944
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:10,954
Well, if you don't, I'm sure the
Burgundians would be happy to oblige.

945
01:46:11,455 --> 01:46:12,956
If they capture her at Compiègne--

946
01:46:13,457 --> 01:46:14,958
No one could blame us.

947
01:46:17,461 --> 01:46:21,924
But it could sound like
we betrayed her.

948
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:24,968
- No, never.
- Good heavens, no.

949
01:46:25,469 --> 01:46:26,970
Don't worry, Charles.

950
01:46:29,473 --> 01:46:33,894
If God is still with her,
she will be victorious.

951
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:35,938
But her army's so much smaller.

952
01:46:36,438 --> 01:46:38,941
Then her faith will have to be bigger.

953
01:46:53,455 --> 01:46:56,959
- What are you doing? Open this gate.
- I can't risk the safety of my town.

954
01:47:00,462 --> 01:47:00,963
Take my banner!

955
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:00,939
My Lord.

956
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:03,942
My Lord.

957
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:30,969
I can't believe it.

958
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:35,933
Your romantic vision of death
with all that grass growing everywhere.

959
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:37,935
I must admit,
you have a big imagination.

960
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:40,938
But maybe not big enough.

961
01:48:41,438 --> 01:48:44,942
Death is much more simple.

962
01:48:49,446 --> 01:48:51,949
After a few months,
it gets more interesting.

963
01:48:55,452 --> 01:48:58,956
Then after a year,
it finally becomes...

964
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:02,960
romantic.

965
01:49:08,465 --> 01:49:08,966
Who are you?

966
01:49:09,466 --> 01:49:11,969
You don't like my face?

967
01:49:12,427 --> 01:49:14,972
Maybe you'd prefer this one.

968
01:49:18,433 --> 01:49:19,935
Too young, maybe.

969
01:49:20,435 --> 01:49:22,938
How about this one?

970
01:49:24,398 --> 01:49:28,944
Better now? But incomplete.

971
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,911
Get thee behind me, Satan.

972
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:42,958
Who are you to even think you can know
the difference between good and evil?

973
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:45,961
Are you God?

974
01:49:50,424 --> 01:49:52,968
I'm just a messenger.

975
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:54,970
He needs me.

976
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:58,974
How can you imagine that God,
the creator of heaven and Earth...

977
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:00,934
the source of all life...

978
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:04,938
could possibly need you?

979
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:06,940
I don't know.

980
01:50:08,442 --> 01:50:09,943
You don't think He's big enough
to deliver His own messages?

981
01:50:11,445 --> 01:50:13,947
What do you want from me?

982
01:50:14,448 --> 01:50:15,949
Nothing.
I'm here to set you free.

983
01:50:19,453 --> 01:50:20,954
I said smile.
You have visitors.

984
01:50:21,455 --> 01:50:22,956
The Duke of Burgundy.

985
01:50:35,469 --> 01:50:37,971
So here's the famous Jeanne...

986
01:50:38,472 --> 01:50:40,974
savior of Orléans,
terror of the English.

987
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:44,937
My king will pay
any ransom you ask.

988
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:48,941
Your king?
Oh, yes, of course.

989
01:50:49,441 --> 01:50:50,943
What's he gonna pay me with?
Cows? Chickens?

990
01:50:52,444 --> 01:50:54,947
I prefer gold,
and the English have plenty.

991
01:50:56,448 --> 01:50:59,952
I wonder how much they'll pay to have
the witch of Orléans in their clutches.

992
01:51:00,452 --> 01:51:04,957
The English are so arrogant, they can't
accept being defeated by a peasant girl.

993
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:07,960
It has to have been the devil's work.

994
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:09,962
God defeated the English.

995
01:51:10,462 --> 01:51:12,965
And God allowed you to be caught?

996
01:51:14,466 --> 01:51:15,968
Personally, I don't believe in God.

997
01:51:16,468 --> 01:51:18,971
I don't believe in the devil either.

998
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:21,974
That's why I'm never disappointed.

999
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:24,935
Sell her.

1000
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:43,954
To pay Jeanne's ransom.

1001
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:46,957
The captains gave what they could,
as well as citizens of Orléans.

1002
01:51:47,457 --> 01:51:51,962
That's very generous of you.
How much?

1003
01:51:52,462 --> 01:51:54,965
- Ten thousand gold crowns.
- Ten thousand?

1004
01:51:55,465 --> 01:51:56,967
That's a lot.

1005
01:51:57,467 --> 01:52:00,971
Your Grace, I place you in charge
of this very delicate negotiation.

1006
01:52:16,445 --> 01:52:18,947
Get yourself ready.
You're leaving.

1007
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:22,951
Who are you?

1008
01:52:23,452 --> 01:52:26,955
Pierre Cauchon, bishop of Beauvais.

1009
01:52:27,456 --> 01:52:29,958
As you were captured in my diocese, the
duty to conduct the trial falls upon me.

1010
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:34,963
Trial?
What trial?

1011
01:52:35,464 --> 01:52:38,967
Your trial, Jeanne,
on a charge of heresy.

1012
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:43,972
But my king--

1013
01:52:46,433 --> 01:52:47,935
Didn't he pay my ransom?

1014
01:52:48,435 --> 01:52:50,938
It seems the English care
more about you than the French.

1015
01:52:51,438 --> 01:52:52,940
- The English?
- Yes.

1016
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,942
They paid your ransom.

1017
01:52:55,442 --> 01:52:58,946
Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to their great castle at Rouen.

1018
01:54:01,466 --> 01:54:04,970
Our serene and Christian king, Henry VI,
king of England and France...

1019
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:07,973
has placed this girl in our hands,
accused of heretical deeds...

1020
01:54:08,473 --> 01:54:09,933
to be tried in a matter of faith.

1021
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:12,936
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand...

1022
01:54:13,437 --> 01:54:16,940
and swear to tell the truth regarding
anything you may be asked.

1023
01:54:18,442 --> 01:54:21,945
I don't know what you will ask me. You
may ask things I won't want to answer.

1024
01:54:22,446 --> 01:54:24,948
You will swear to tell the truth
about everything you are asked.

1025
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,953
I will willingly tell the truth
about all Earthly things.

1026
01:54:30,454 --> 01:54:33,957
But as to my revelations,
I've told no one except my king...

1027
01:54:35,459 --> 01:54:37,961
Charles VII, the one and only
king of France.

1028
01:54:41,465 --> 01:54:42,966
You must take the oath.

1029
01:54:43,467 --> 01:54:46,970
Not even a king would refuse to take
an oath in a matter of faith.

1030
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:48,972
I will tell you all
that I'm allowed to tell you.

1031
01:54:51,433 --> 01:54:52,935
But as for the rest...

1032
01:54:53,435 --> 01:54:55,938
even if you threatened
to cut off my head, I won't tell you.

1033
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:05,948
Begin by telling us your name, assuming
you're allowed to tell us that much.

1034
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:08,951
My name is Jeanne.

1035
01:55:11,453 --> 01:55:13,956
My little cross was taken from me.
May I have it back?

1036
01:55:14,456 --> 01:55:17,960
Show us a little more
cooperation first.

1037
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,962
Where were you born?

1038
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:22,965
In a village called Domremy.

1039
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:24,967
How old are you?

1040
01:55:25,467 --> 01:55:26,969
Nineteen, or thereabouts.

1041
01:55:27,469 --> 01:55:28,971
Were you baptized?

1042
01:55:30,472 --> 01:55:32,933
- Yes.
- Recite our Lord's Prayer.

1043
01:55:35,435 --> 01:55:37,938
Not unless you hear my confession.

1044
01:55:42,442 --> 01:55:43,944
Listen to me very carefully.

1045
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:46,947
We are all men of faith...

1046
01:55:47,447 --> 01:55:50,951
and we shall earnestly strive for the
salvation of your body and your soul...

1047
01:55:51,451 --> 01:55:55,956
in the name of our Church who never
closes arms to those who return to her.

1048
01:55:56,456 --> 01:55:57,958
But we cannot help you...

1049
01:55:58,458 --> 01:56:00,961
unless you submit to our
learned judgment and authority.

1050
01:56:01,461 --> 01:56:03,964
Take heed of this
charitable admonition...

1051
01:56:04,464 --> 01:56:06,967
for if you persist
in refusing our help...

1052
01:56:07,467 --> 01:56:10,971
we shall have no choice but to
abandon you to the secular powers.

1053
01:56:11,471 --> 01:56:13,974
And I think you know well enough
the punishment that would await you.

1054
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:21,940
Now...

1055
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:24,943
will you please recite
our Lord's Prayer?

1056
01:56:27,446 --> 01:56:29,948
Not unless you hear my confession.

1057
01:56:33,452 --> 01:56:37,956
Be careful. You aren't helping yourself
by refusing to submit to our judgment.

1058
01:56:38,457 --> 01:56:39,958
You...

1059
01:56:40,459 --> 01:56:42,961
who claim to be my judges,
you be careful!

1060
01:56:44,463 --> 01:56:46,965
For you too one day will be judged.

1061
01:56:47,466 --> 01:56:47,966
Guards, take the prisoner away!

1062
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,972
- Silence!
- Sorceress!

1063
01:56:54,473 --> 01:56:56,934
Silence!
Clear the room!

1064
01:56:57,434 --> 01:56:59,937
Clear the room!

1065
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:05,943
In future, we should conduct inquiries
privately, away from public pressure.

1066
01:57:06,443 --> 01:57:08,946
Let the English burn her if they want.
Why does it have to involve us?

1067
01:57:10,447 --> 01:57:12,950
Because it's our duty to root out
heresy wherever we find it.

1068
01:57:15,452 --> 01:57:15,953
Father Vincente.

1069
01:57:18,455 --> 01:57:19,957
You're the most venerable among us.
What do you think?

1070
01:57:21,458 --> 01:57:22,960
I think this trial is a masquerade...

1071
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,963
and I won't be part of it anymore.

1072
01:57:26,463 --> 01:57:28,966
I'm willing to be her judge,
but not her executioner.

1073
01:57:29,466 --> 01:57:30,968
That's what I'm trying to ensure.

1074
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:39,935
The verdict comes at the end of
a trial, Cauchon. Not at the beginning.

1075
01:57:42,437 --> 01:57:43,939
I am going back to Rome...

1076
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:46,942
to give my report
to our Holy Father, the Pope.

1077
01:57:50,445 --> 01:57:53,949
This is ridiculous. Now I'm the one
who's on trial and being judged.

1078
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:55,951
- Arrest him.
- What are you doing?

1079
01:57:57,452 --> 01:57:59,955
This is an ecclesiastical court.
You've no right to do this.

1080
01:58:00,455 --> 01:58:01,957
This is English territory.

1081
01:58:02,457 --> 01:58:03,959
I have the right to do anything.

1082
01:58:04,459 --> 01:58:05,961
Is that clear?

1083
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:23,937
Our Father who art in heaven--

1084
01:58:24,438 --> 01:58:25,939
Thy kingdom come--

1085
01:58:31,445 --> 01:58:32,946
Forgive us--
Forgive them--

1086
01:58:33,447 --> 01:58:36,950
Forgive them, then forgive us.
Forgive them.

1087
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:37,951
Why were you yelling?

1088
01:58:43,457 --> 01:58:46,960
What are you doing here?
You can't stay here! Go away!

1089
01:58:47,461 --> 01:58:49,963
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?

1090
01:58:51,465 --> 01:58:51,965
Yes.

1091
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:54,968
- Who?
- My visions.

1092
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:56,970
Your visions.

1093
01:58:58,472 --> 01:58:59,973
They're going to visit you in here?

1094
01:59:00,474 --> 01:59:02,935
Yes. That's what I pray for.

1095
01:59:04,436 --> 01:59:06,939
I want to see that.
Do you mind if I stay on the side here?

1096
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:08,941
- I won't bother you.
- No!

1097
01:59:10,442 --> 01:59:11,944
No, you can't! You can't!

1098
01:59:12,444 --> 01:59:13,946
- Or else they won't come.
- Why won't they?

1099
01:59:14,446 --> 01:59:15,948
Because I have to be alone.

1100
01:59:16,448 --> 01:59:19,952
Oh. They won't come anyway.

1101
01:59:21,453 --> 01:59:23,956
- What do you mean, they won't come?
- Why would they?

1102
01:59:25,457 --> 01:59:27,960
Because I've always been faithful
to God...

1103
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:29,962
and I've followed everything
He's ever said...

1104
01:59:30,462 --> 01:59:31,964
and I've done everything
He's ever asked me to do.

1105
01:59:32,464 --> 01:59:33,966
God asked you to do something?

1106
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:39,972
Yes, lots of things.

1107
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:42,933
You mean, God said...

1108
01:59:43,433 --> 01:59:44,935
''I need you, Jeanne''?

1109
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:50,941
But He's sent me signs.

1110
01:59:53,443 --> 01:59:54,945
Signs? What signs?

1111
01:59:57,447 --> 01:59:58,949
The wind. The wind.

1112
02:00:04,454 --> 02:00:04,955
Wind.

1113
02:00:05,455 --> 02:00:07,958
And the clouds. Ringing.

1114
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:11,962
Ringing cloud.

1115
02:00:13,463 --> 02:00:14,965
The dance. The dance.

1116
02:00:29,438 --> 02:00:31,940
The sword. The sword lying in the field.

1117
02:00:33,442 --> 02:00:33,942
That was a sign.

1118
02:00:34,443 --> 02:00:37,946
No. That was a sword in a field.

1119
02:00:39,448 --> 02:00:41,950
No. No. That was a sign.

1120
02:00:42,451 --> 02:00:44,953
No, that was a sword in a field.

1121
02:00:45,454 --> 02:00:48,957
It can't just get there by itself.
It can't.

1122
02:00:49,458 --> 02:00:51,960
A sword just doesn't get there
by itself.

1123
02:00:52,461 --> 02:00:56,965
True. Every event has an infinite
number of causes, so why pick one?

1124
02:00:57,466 --> 02:00:58,967
There are many ways a sword
might find itself in a field.

1125
02:01:05,474 --> 02:01:07,935
Seems a perfectly valid explanation,
but how about this one?

1126
02:01:14,441 --> 02:01:15,943
Then again, there are other
possibilities.

1127
02:01:21,448 --> 02:01:21,949
Or even faster.

1128
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,956
And that's without counting
the inexplicable.

1129
02:01:31,458 --> 02:01:34,962
Yet from an infinite number of
possibilities, you had to pick this one.

1130
02:01:49,434 --> 02:01:52,938
You didn't see what was, Jeanne.

1131
02:01:53,438 --> 02:01:55,941
You saw what you wanted to see.

1132
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:15,961
This voice that you say
appears to you...

1133
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:20,966
is it an angel or a saint,
or does it come from God?

1134
02:02:21,466 --> 02:02:24,970
I won't tell you any more about that.

1135
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:27,973
I'm more afraid of displeasing Him
than not answering you.

1136
02:02:28,473 --> 02:02:32,936
You're afraid of displeasing God
by telling the truth?

1137
02:02:33,437 --> 02:02:35,939
Did God forbid you
to tell the truth?

1138
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,943
My revelations were for
the king of France, not for you.

1139
02:02:42,446 --> 02:02:44,948
When you saw your king
for the first time...

1140
02:02:45,449 --> 02:02:46,950
was there an angel over his head?

1141
02:02:47,451 --> 02:02:48,952
If there was one, I did not see it.

1142
02:02:49,453 --> 02:02:51,955
Why did your king believe in you
without any proof?

1143
02:02:53,457 --> 02:02:54,958
Go ask him yourself.

1144
02:03:08,472 --> 02:03:08,972
Dinner.

1145
02:03:26,448 --> 02:03:28,951
When you were taken prisoner,
did you have a horse?

1146
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:31,954
Yes. A half-steed. Black.

1147
02:03:33,455 --> 02:03:34,957
- Who gave you that horse?
- My king.

1148
02:03:35,457 --> 02:03:37,960
How many did he give you?

1149
02:03:40,462 --> 02:03:41,964
Five steeds...

1150
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:44,967
and a few hackneys.

1151
02:03:45,467 --> 02:03:47,970
As much as for a lord.
What an honor.

1152
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:50,973
Did your king give you other wealth
apart from those horses?

1153
02:03:53,433 --> 02:03:55,936
What about all those dresses
you were given?

1154
02:03:56,436 --> 02:03:57,938
Silk dresses, weren't they?

1155
02:03:59,439 --> 02:03:59,940
Yes.

1156
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:02,943
Yes, I was given a few.

1157
02:04:03,443 --> 02:04:06,947
But I never had time to wear them.

1158
02:04:07,447 --> 02:04:09,950
Still, pretty wealthy
for a peasant girl, wouldn't you say?

1159
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:16,957
You look pretty wealthy
for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?

1160
02:04:22,462 --> 02:04:23,964
You launched an attack on Paris,
didn't you?

1161
02:04:24,464 --> 02:04:25,966
I tried to.

1162
02:04:27,467 --> 02:04:28,969
And didn't you order the citizens
of Paris to surrender the city...

1163
02:04:29,469 --> 02:04:29,970
in the name of the King of Heaven?

1164
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,974
No. I said, ''Surrender in the name
of the king of France.''

1165
02:04:34,433 --> 02:04:36,935
That is not what is written
in the evidence.

1166
02:04:39,438 --> 02:04:39,938
Look yourself.

1167
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:42,941
I can't read.

1168
02:04:45,444 --> 02:04:47,946
Yes, I forgot.

1169
02:04:48,447 --> 02:04:51,950
God sent us an illiterate peasant
to carry out such an important mission.

1170
02:04:52,451 --> 02:04:53,952
Do you think that God
made the right decision?

1171
02:04:54,453 --> 02:04:57,956
To take an ignorant girl
to save the kingdom of France?

1172
02:04:58,832 --> 02:04:59,333
I leave that answer to God.

1173
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:06,340
Fuck!

1174
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:08,342
Calm down, my lord.
I beg you.

1175
02:05:08,842 --> 02:05:11,345
How can I when I'm made
the laughing stock of the whole court?

1176
02:05:11,845 --> 02:05:13,347
You've seen how it is.
This girl has a way with people...

1177
02:05:13,847 --> 02:05:16,308
but we're making progress every day.

1178
02:05:16,808 --> 02:05:20,312
As long as that bitch remains alive,
our armies refuse to fight. Understand?

1179
02:05:20,812 --> 02:05:21,313
They need proof
that God is on their side.

1180
02:05:22,814 --> 02:05:24,316
It's not for us to burn her.
That's your prerogative.

1181
02:05:24,816 --> 02:05:26,318
And it's your prerogative
to find her guilty!

1182
02:05:26,818 --> 02:05:30,322
But we can't do that
unless she admits to blasphemy.

1183
02:05:30,822 --> 02:05:31,323
What are you waiting for?

1184
02:05:31,823 --> 02:05:35,327
You've got a castle full of racks,
ropes and pulleys. Torture the bitch!

1185
02:05:35,827 --> 02:05:38,330
You'll never get anything
out of her that way.

1186
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:40,332
And besides...

1187
02:05:40,832 --> 02:05:46,338
you must realize that several
of my colleagues are, well, scared.

1188
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:48,340
Scared? Of a girl?

1189
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:51,343
Scared to make a mistake.

1190
02:05:51,844 --> 02:05:53,345
Suppose she's right.

1191
02:05:53,846 --> 02:05:56,348
Suppose she has been sent by God.

1192
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:05,315
- Who's side are you on, Cauchon?
- I'm on the side of Holy Mother Church.

1193
02:06:06,817 --> 02:06:08,318
Do you have a sword?

1194
02:06:10,821 --> 02:06:12,322
- Quite a few.
- Didn't you also carry a banner?

1195
02:06:13,824 --> 02:06:15,325
Yes.

1196
02:06:15,826 --> 02:06:18,328
Which do you prefer?
Your banner or your sword?

1197
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:20,330
I was 40 times more fond of my banner.

1198
02:06:20,831 --> 02:06:23,333
Why? Did it have some
particular value or power?

1199
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:28,338
It's just--

1200
02:06:28,839 --> 02:06:31,341
- A sword is a weapon.
- And?

1201
02:06:32,843 --> 02:06:37,347
And so, I prefer my banner.

1202
02:06:37,848 --> 02:06:38,348
Why?

1203
02:06:38,807 --> 02:06:41,310
To avoid killing anyone.

1204
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:44,313
Are you saying if you'd not
been carrying your banner...

1205
02:06:44,813 --> 02:06:46,315
you'd have killed more people?

1206
02:06:50,819 --> 02:06:52,321
Of course not.
I never killed anyone.

1207
02:06:52,821 --> 02:06:55,324
Then perhaps the temptation...

1208
02:06:55,824 --> 02:06:57,326
to kill would have been stronger--

1209
02:06:57,826 --> 02:06:59,328
too strong, perhaps.

1210
02:07:00,829 --> 02:07:02,331
I warned the English to go back home.

1211
02:07:02,831 --> 02:07:05,334
I begged them not to force us to fight.
They knew that I--

1212
02:07:05,834 --> 02:07:08,337
We have numerous witnesses
who can confirm...

1213
02:07:08,837 --> 02:07:10,339
you were not always
carrying your banner.

1214
02:07:14,843 --> 02:07:16,345
Yes, perhaps.

1215
02:07:16,845 --> 02:07:18,347
Sometimes you were carrying
just your sword.

1216
02:07:20,807 --> 02:07:21,308
Yes. I don't know.

1217
02:07:21,808 --> 02:07:24,311
Did you use the sword
you held in your hand?

1218
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:26,313
Yes, I used it--
I held it up--

1219
02:07:26,813 --> 02:07:29,316
You held up your sword
and flourished it about like this!

1220
02:07:29,816 --> 02:07:30,317
I don't remember.

1221
02:07:30,817 --> 02:07:33,320
So, you were on the battlefield
with your sword in your hand...

1222
02:07:34,821 --> 02:07:37,324
waving it above your head,
charging against the enemy...

1223
02:07:37,824 --> 02:07:39,326
screaming at the enemy,
fighting for your life...

1224
02:07:39,826 --> 02:07:41,328
and you expect us to believe...

1225
02:07:41,828 --> 02:07:45,332
that in the middle
of all this excitement...

1226
02:07:45,832 --> 02:07:49,336
you never killed anyone.

1227
02:07:49,837 --> 02:07:52,339
No. I never killed anyone.

1228
02:07:54,842 --> 02:07:56,343
I can't believe
you can lie like that.

1229
02:07:56,844 --> 02:08:00,347
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
Leave me alone. I can't remember.

1230
02:08:00,848 --> 02:08:03,308
-I didn't kill anyone. I can't remember.
-Let me help your memory.

1231
02:08:03,809 --> 02:08:06,311
I don't want to hear any more.
Leave me alone. I didn't kill that man.

1232
02:08:06,812 --> 02:08:08,313
Leave me alone!

1233
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:11,316
Stop. Stop. I can't remember.

1234
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:15,320
The battles were so confusing. I was
only defending myself as best I could.

1235
02:08:15,821 --> 02:08:19,324
There was so much dust, smoke and noise.
I was being attacked on all sides.

1236
02:08:19,825 --> 02:08:22,327
So maybe perhaps I fought back.

1237
02:08:22,828 --> 02:08:25,330
- But it was only to defend myself.
- So your memory's coming back.

1238
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:27,332
- Yes.
- Good.

1239
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:31,336
Now, you tell me why God let all those
battles happen in the first place.

1240
02:08:31,837 --> 02:08:33,338
He's so powerful. You said...

1241
02:08:33,839 --> 02:08:35,340
'' He's the creator of heaven and Earth,
the source of all life.''

1242
02:08:35,841 --> 02:08:39,344
He could easily have stopped
all that blood and misery.

1243
02:08:39,845 --> 02:08:40,345
Why didn't He--

1244
02:08:40,846 --> 02:08:43,348
Is He the one who spread
all that blood and misery?

1245
02:08:43,807 --> 02:08:45,309
- Is He?
- No. But He could have stopped it.

1246
02:08:45,809 --> 02:08:48,312
What, did he get pleasure--
pleasure--

1247
02:08:48,812 --> 02:08:52,316
pleasure from watching us killing
each other in His name?

1248
02:08:52,816 --> 02:08:54,318
In His name?

1249
02:08:54,818 --> 02:08:58,322
In His name. We fought and killed
in His name--

1250
02:08:58,822 --> 02:09:00,324
- the King of Heaven.
- Really?

1251
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:02,326
Let all those who love me
follow me!

1252
02:09:03,827 --> 02:09:05,329
'' Let all who love me
follow me!''

1253
02:09:05,829 --> 02:09:08,332
Where does God get mentioned?

1254
02:09:08,832 --> 02:09:10,334
Come on, Jeanne.

1255
02:09:10,834 --> 02:09:12,336
Be honest.

1256
02:09:12,836 --> 02:09:15,339
You fought for yourself.
In your name.

1257
02:09:15,839 --> 02:09:17,341
No!

1258
02:09:17,841 --> 02:09:20,344
I was defending myself
as best as I could.

1259
02:09:20,844 --> 02:09:22,346
Everyone has the right
to defend themselves, don't they?

1260
02:09:23,847 --> 02:09:25,349
Yes, they do!
Should I have let myself get killed?

1261
02:09:25,807 --> 02:09:27,309
- Is that it?
- No. You did fine.

1262
02:09:27,809 --> 02:09:29,311
I'd even say well done.

1263
02:09:29,811 --> 02:09:31,313
As a matter of fact...

1264
02:09:31,813 --> 02:09:34,316
most of the ones you killed
probably deserved it, don't you think?

1265
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:41,323
I never thought killing each other
would bring about any peace.

1266
02:09:41,823 --> 02:09:42,324
I agree.

1267
02:09:42,824 --> 02:09:44,326
Peace will only be got from
the English at the end of a lance.

1268
02:09:44,826 --> 02:09:47,329
I don't agree. Why do you keep
changing your mind all the time?

1269
02:09:49,831 --> 02:09:51,333
You. Why--

1270
02:09:51,834 --> 02:09:54,336
Why are you doing this to me?

1271
02:09:54,837 --> 02:09:56,338
Do you get pleasure from hurting me?

1272
02:09:56,839 --> 02:10:00,342
Pleasure.
That's a difficult word to define.

1273
02:10:02,845 --> 02:10:06,348
When does pain end and pleasure begin?
When did your pleasure begin?

1274
02:10:06,849 --> 02:10:10,310
With that sword in your hand?

1275
02:10:12,813 --> 02:10:15,315
I never took pleasure...

1276
02:10:15,816 --> 02:10:17,317
in hurting anyone.

1277
02:10:18,819 --> 02:10:20,320
Really?

1278
02:10:45,846 --> 02:10:49,308
Set me free. Set me free.

1279
02:10:49,808 --> 02:10:50,309
You will be, Jeanne.

1280
02:10:52,811 --> 02:10:54,313
You will be.

1281
02:11:15,834 --> 02:11:17,336
Jeanne, my very dear
friend in Christ...

1282
02:11:17,836 --> 02:11:19,338
we, your judges and assessors...

1283
02:11:19,838 --> 02:11:22,341
desirous of reaching
a true and lawful verdict...

1284
02:11:22,841 --> 02:11:25,344
submitted a transcript of your trial
to the University of Paris...

1285
02:11:25,844 --> 02:11:27,346
to attain their opinion.

1286
02:11:27,846 --> 02:11:29,348
After careful consideration...

1287
02:11:29,848 --> 02:11:31,308
the learned scholars
have concluded with us...

1288
02:11:31,808 --> 02:11:35,312
that you have committed
many grievous sins.

1289
02:11:35,812 --> 02:11:38,315
I ask you now
to listen most carefully...

1290
02:11:38,815 --> 02:11:41,318
to their opinion,
as detailed in these articles.

1291
02:11:44,821 --> 02:11:45,322
Article One.

1292
02:11:45,822 --> 02:11:49,326
You said that by God's command you have
continually worn men's clothes...

1293
02:11:49,826 --> 02:11:52,329
and that you have also worn
your hair short...

1294
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:55,332
with nothing to distinguish you from
the soldiers with whom you fought.

1295
02:11:59,837 --> 02:12:01,338
Don't abandon me. Please.

1296
02:12:03,841 --> 02:12:07,344
Where are You?

1297
02:12:07,845 --> 02:12:09,346
Where are You? Please.

1298
02:12:13,809 --> 02:12:16,311
Is this what You want?

1299
02:12:17,813 --> 02:12:20,315
You want me to...

1300
02:12:20,816 --> 02:12:23,318
to burn...

1301
02:12:23,819 --> 02:12:25,320
without...

1302
02:12:25,821 --> 02:12:27,322
being confessed?

1303
02:12:27,781 --> 02:12:30,325
Finally, Article 12.

1304
02:12:30,826 --> 02:12:33,328
You have said that you are not
willing to submit yourself...

1305
02:12:33,787 --> 02:12:36,331
to the judgment of the church militant,
but only to God.

1306
02:12:37,833 --> 02:12:38,333
As to this article,
the scholars say...

1307
02:12:39,835 --> 02:12:41,336
that you have no comprehension
of the authority of the Church.

1308
02:12:41,837 --> 02:12:44,298
That you have perniciously erred
in the faith of God...

1309
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:48,343
and you are a child of superstition,
a wanderer from the faith...

1310
02:12:48,844 --> 02:12:52,347
an invoker of demons, an idolater...

1311
02:12:52,806 --> 02:12:54,308
and a heretic.

1312
02:13:05,819 --> 02:13:08,280
We once again admonish,
beg and exalt you...

1313
02:13:08,822 --> 02:13:12,326
to cast out and recant
your erroneous beliefs...

1314
02:13:12,826 --> 02:13:15,329
by signing this recantation.

1315
02:13:16,788 --> 02:13:17,331
Please.

1316
02:13:19,833 --> 02:13:21,335
If the Church...

1317
02:13:21,835 --> 02:13:24,338
wants me to say...

1318
02:13:24,838 --> 02:13:27,341
that my visions are evil...

1319
02:13:27,841 --> 02:13:30,344
then I do not believe in this Church.

1320
02:13:35,807 --> 02:13:36,308
Perform your office.

1321
02:13:42,773 --> 02:13:44,316
Wait.

1322
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:51,323
Jeanne, I beg of you, sign.

1323
02:13:51,823 --> 02:13:54,326
In God's name, don't you understand?
I'm trying to save you.

1324
02:13:54,826 --> 02:13:57,287
I want to be confessed.

1325
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:00,332
Sign this and I will confess you
myself, if you want.

1326
02:14:01,834 --> 02:14:05,337
And may I--

1327
02:14:05,796 --> 02:14:08,340
May I go to Mass?

1328
02:14:08,841 --> 02:14:10,342
As often as you like.

1329
02:14:10,843 --> 02:14:13,345
Now, for the love of God, sign.

1330
02:14:18,809 --> 02:14:22,312
Sign, Jeanne,
and you'll be free of your chains.

1331
02:14:22,813 --> 02:14:24,314
Free of the fire, Jeanne.

1332
02:14:59,766 --> 02:15:01,310
Thank you.

1333
02:15:04,813 --> 02:15:07,316
Do you know what you just signed?

1334
02:15:08,817 --> 02:15:10,277
You just signed away His existence.

1335
02:15:12,821 --> 02:15:16,325
- I didn't mean to.
- For you, He's a lie.

1336
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:20,329
An illusion.

1337
02:15:20,787 --> 02:15:22,331
No, no.

1338
02:15:22,789 --> 02:15:24,333
He told me that I would be confessed.

1339
02:15:25,834 --> 02:15:28,337
In the end, it was you
who abandoned Him.

1340
02:15:35,802 --> 02:15:38,347
- May I have that back, please?
- You have nothing to regret.

1341
02:15:40,807 --> 02:15:43,310
Give it back to me!

1342
02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:46,271
- Give it back!
- Take her away!

1343
02:15:51,818 --> 02:15:53,320
Silence her!

1344
02:15:57,783 --> 02:16:00,327
There. She has recanted.

1345
02:16:00,827 --> 02:16:02,329
And we accept her repentance...

1346
02:16:02,829 --> 02:16:06,333
for the Church never closes her arms
to those who would return to the fold.

1347
02:16:07,793 --> 02:16:11,296
Now she's your martyr, not ours.

1348
02:16:38,824 --> 02:16:40,325
Please!

1349
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:48,292
Enough.

1350
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:57,342
Here.

1351
02:16:57,843 --> 02:17:00,304
If you want to get dressed,
try these for size.

1352
02:17:07,811 --> 02:17:09,313
My lord bishop.

1353
02:17:19,823 --> 02:17:21,325
Come to see for yourself.

1354
02:17:21,825 --> 02:17:23,285
Well, take a look.

1355
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:31,335
You see?
Dressed as a man again.

1356
02:17:31,835 --> 02:17:33,295
Her touching repentance
didn't last very long, did it?

1357
02:17:35,797 --> 02:17:40,344
The Bishop of Senlis was passing by
and was on hand to witness her relapse.

1358
02:17:42,846 --> 02:17:45,349
And by what miracle did these clothes
find their way in here?

1359
02:17:45,807 --> 02:17:47,267
Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon.

1360
02:17:47,809 --> 02:17:50,312
An evil spell.

1361
02:17:50,771 --> 02:17:53,315
This girl is a witch,
and tomorrow she will burn for it.

1362
02:17:55,817 --> 02:17:58,320
Have the stake prepared
in the market place.

1363
02:18:13,794 --> 02:18:17,339
Jeanne, I don't understand.
Why did you do it?

1364
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,341
- Why?
- And you.

1365
02:18:19,842 --> 02:18:21,343
Why did you lie?

1366
02:18:21,844 --> 02:18:23,345
You promised to have me confessed.

1367
02:18:23,804 --> 02:18:26,306
I know. It was the only way
to have you saved from the fire.

1368
02:18:26,807 --> 02:18:29,309
It's not my body I want to save.

1369
02:18:29,810 --> 02:18:31,311
It's my soul.

1370
02:18:32,813 --> 02:18:35,274
I ask only one thing.

1371
02:18:35,774 --> 02:18:39,319
Please, hear my confession.

1372
02:18:43,824 --> 02:18:46,285
I can't, Jeanne.
I can't hear your confession.

1373
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:52,291
I'm very sorry.

1374
02:19:13,770 --> 02:19:15,314
You want to confess?

1375
02:19:19,818 --> 02:19:21,320
I'm listening.

1376
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:24,281
I've committed sins, my Lord.

1377
02:19:27,826 --> 02:19:29,328
So many sins.

1378
02:19:32,831 --> 02:19:36,335
I saw so many signs.

1379
02:19:36,793 --> 02:19:38,337
Many signs.

1380
02:19:40,839 --> 02:19:42,341
The ones I wanted to see.

1381
02:19:48,847 --> 02:19:51,266
I fought...

1382
02:19:54,811 --> 02:19:56,313
out of revenge...

1383
02:19:59,816 --> 02:20:01,276
and despair.

1384
02:20:08,825 --> 02:20:11,328
I was all the things...

1385
02:20:11,787 --> 02:20:15,290
that people believe...

1386
02:20:15,791 --> 02:20:17,334
they're allowed to be...

1387
02:20:17,793 --> 02:20:20,337
when they're fighting for...

1388
02:20:24,842 --> 02:20:25,342
a cause.

1389
02:20:26,802 --> 02:20:28,303
For a cause.

1390
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:32,307
I was...

1391
02:20:34,810 --> 02:20:36,311
proud...

1392
02:20:37,771 --> 02:20:39,273
and...

1393
02:20:42,818 --> 02:20:43,318
stubborn.

1394
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:45,320
Selfish.

1395
02:20:46,822 --> 02:20:48,282
Selfish.

1396
02:20:48,824 --> 02:20:51,326
Yes. Cruel.

1397
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,331
Yes.

1398
02:20:56,832 --> 02:20:58,333
Cruel.

1399
02:21:00,794 --> 02:21:02,296
You think you are ready now?

1400
02:21:07,843 --> 02:21:08,343
Yes.

1401
02:21:10,846 --> 02:21:12,347
Good.
