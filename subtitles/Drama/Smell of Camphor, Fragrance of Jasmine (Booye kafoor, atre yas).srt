<i>[Episode 41]</i>

4
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,329
According to the ancestral regulation
of Bai Lan State

5
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,424
the attempted murder of
a royal family member

6
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,373
can sentence you to death by torture.

7
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:00,521
Prime Minister.

8
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,693
I went on the battlefield voluntarily.

9
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:03,990
Besides, I'm unharmed.

10
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,722
How is Prince Consort
to be blamed for it?

11
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,009
Prince Consort brought this war upon us.

12
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,475
If it weren't for him

13
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,610
how could Your Highness possibly
have had to take such a risk?

14
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:17,316
The safety of the royal family
is the utmost priority.

15
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,667
It's not a matter to be overlooked.

16
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:20,501
Your Highness.

17
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,440
Should Your Highness spare
Prince Consort from any punishment

18
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:28,393
how could you answer to your subjects
and people who protected you?

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,916
Your Highness.

20
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,463
Prince Consort's crimes
are not to be condoned.

21
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:37,492
Prime Minister's fervent pleas
are absolutely right.

22
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:38,805
I concur.

23
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,143
Prince Consort's crimes
are not to be condoned!

24
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:42,392
I concur!

25
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,368
- I concur!
- I concur!

26
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:48,318
- I concur!
- I concur!

27
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,739
- I concur!
- I concur!

28
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,788
It seems that all my dear subjects
are much begrudged.

29
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:55,394
Everyone's anger can't
seem to be appeased.

30
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,697
I can't be too lenient then.

31
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,844
However, since the state is safe
and I'm unharmed

32
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,768
I ask that Prime Minister propose
a much lighter sentence.

33
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:06,141
I accept the decree.

34
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,417
Prince Consort, He Xia!

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,636
As the husband of the princess
and General of Fast Cavalry

36
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,645
he has, for his personal interests

37
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,036
caused disturbance to the people
and put the princess's life at risk.

38
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,679
He's suspected of the attempted
murder of a royal family member.

39
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:28,483
Although the princess is unharmed,
his actions are not to be condoned.

40
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,056
Hence, Prince Consort will be given
a lighter sentence as a warning

41
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:34,377
to appease the anger of the officials
and ease the minds of the people.

42
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,524
Today, Prince Consort is specially
sentenced to 30 strokes of caning.

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,080
The punishment is to be
carried right away.

44
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:41,876
- Guards!
- Present!

45
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,641
- Carry out the caning now!
- Yes!

46
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:50,988
Your subject...

47
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:55,367
Accepts the punishment.

48
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,454
Reporting to Your Highness.

49
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:40,147
Your Highness!

50
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,076
- Your Highness.
- Lu Yi.

51
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,301
How is Prince Consort?

52
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,130
The caning is done.

53
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,012
Prince Consort...

54
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:48,183
He's quite badly injured.

55
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,500
Your Highness!

56
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,837
Where are you going?

57
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,419
I have to take a look at Prince Consort!

58
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:55,361
Do reconsider, Your Highness.

59
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,146
All the officials are watching
your each and every move.

60
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,559
Should Your Highness
react too aggressively

61
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:01,035
and provoke Prime Minister even further

62
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:04,091
Prince Consort would have
taken 30 strokes of caning for nothing.

63
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,306
You're right.

64
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,433
I wasn't thinking.

65
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:10,978
Prince Consort is already injured.

66
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,624
I was just worried that
he might not be able

67
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,256
to withstand such
tough physical punishment.

68
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:16,893
Lu Yi.

69
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,510
Deliver the best medicinal herbs
in the palace to Prince Consort.

70
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:21,827
Pass on my message to him.

71
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,440
Tell him to recuperate well.

72
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,560
Once the situation isn't as tense,
I'll go and visit him.

73
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:27,497
Yes!

74
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,112
Young Master...

75
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,421
Young Master.

76
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:49,692
Bear with it.

77
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,089
Some prime minister he is!

78
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,454
What does he think he is?

79
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,581
How dare he treat
Young Master so brutally?

80
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,354
Young Master.

81
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,465
When have you ever had to
suffer such a grievance?

82
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:17,137
If you really don't like the princess,
we can just leave.

83
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:18,699
Let's just leave this awful place.

84
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,201
Dong Zhuo.

85
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:31,594
I hit you so that you'll remember
never to say anything like that again.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,626
Young Master, I...

87
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:34,813
This is all my fault.

88
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:39,532
I forgot what I should do.

89
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:45,801
Those 30 strokes
are well deserved.

90
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,232
Your Highness, here's your wine.

91
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,010
Mo Ran.

92
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,097
You have been with me for years.

93
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,589
What do you think of me?

94
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,772
Your Highness is definitely a hero to me!

95
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,950
You're loyal and patriotic.
You care about your people.

96
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:35,638
Moreover, Your Highness
is a great husband.

97
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:37,467
You're so devoted to Princess Consort.

98
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,516
I'm really bad with words.

99
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know how to put it,
but all in all

100
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,467
you're someone who is worth
risking my life to follow.

101
00:07:57,137 --> 00:08:00,145
When I was young,
my mother and I only had each other.

102
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,888
<i>We were used to the fickleness
of human nature.</i>

103
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:05,578
<i>- People around us were hostile to us.</i>
- Stop it!

104
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,108
<i>- Everyone in the tribe wanted us dead.</i>
- Stop it!

105
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:11,224
<i>- I was often bullied.</i>
- Stop hitting him!

106
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,447
<i>Whenever I couldn't tolerate it,
I'd go against them head on.</i>

107
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,352
<i>In the end, I always end up being beaten.</i>

108
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:21,567
<i>Whenever my mother heard that
I was being bullied</i>

109
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,980
<i>she would rush over to shield me
with her own body.</i>

110
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,279
<i>When I heard the whip slash into her body</i>

111
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:33,021
<i>the only thought on my mind was
that someday, I'd have them killed.</i>

112
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,627
<i>There was only hatred in me then.</i>

113
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:41,139
It's so pretty!

114
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,874
<i>But then one day, I met her.</i>

115
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,096
<i>She smiled and reached out to me.</i>

116
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:52,658
<i>Her eyes were brighter than
the stars that shone in the sky.</i>

117
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,864
<i>I had never seen such clear eyes.</i>

118
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,324
<i>They were so clean, sincere, and warm.</i>

119
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:08,020
Ping Ting begged her father to help me.

120
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:13,098
For the first time in my life,
I felt kindness from a stranger.

121
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:19,572
However, her father later sacrificed
his life to save me and my mother.

122
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,085
That was when I first realized

123
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,334
there is another kind of person
in this world.

124
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,830
This kind of person
is compassionate and warm-hearted.

125
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,056
They're worthy of our respect.

126
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:33,715
They're worthy of our allegiance.

127
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,139
They're worthy of our protection.

128
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,603
I'd let go of my hatred for them.

129
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:47,071
Without her,
there would be no Chu Bei Jie.

130
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,049
Without her...

131
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,592
I could never be happy.

132
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,178
Your Highness.

133
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,228
We have to bring Princess Consort home!

134
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,319
Definitely.

135
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,792
I'll send more men to search
for Princess Consort now!

136
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:08,553
Don't bother.

137
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:12,051
I've given it some thought.

138
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,805
There's only one place she would go.

139
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,355
This is so comfortable!

140
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:36,422
Although this bed isn't as
luxurious as that in a huge manor

141
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,018
it is so much more comfortable.

142
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,200
We were so used to living in fear
that now we're at ease

143
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,704
I seem to find it strange.

144
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,104
If only we could be
so carefree every day.

145
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:58,051
Ping Ting, what are you doing?

146
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,876
My wife, how do I look in this outfit?

147
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:04,882
Very good.

148
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,845
My wife...

149
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,839
Sister Bai.

150
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:13,006
My wife!

151
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:16,806
- Don't run!
- Ping Ting!

152
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,273
We'll set out for Great Liang tomorrow.

153
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:30,605
From then on, we won't be concerned
about any worldly affairs.

154
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:33,667
It will be fine.

155
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,317
From then on, we'll be so carefree.

156
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:05,971
Ping Ting.

157
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,844
Ping Ting!

158
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,009
Ping Ting!

159
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,106
Ping Ting!

160
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,906
Ping Ting! Where have you been?

161
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,097
Ping Ting, I couldn't find you
early this morning

162
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,860
because you went out to
get all this done?

163
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,877
You really don't
take good care of yourself!

164
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:35,398
This is so heavy!

165
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,771
You even carried it back on your own.

166
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,018
Yes, it is quite heavy.

167
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,911
It seems that we'll just have
to eat a lot more from now on.

168
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,612
Subject Chu Mo Ran
returns with the army.

169
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:21,739
Greetings to Your Majesty!

170
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:25,035
Have you brought Prince
and Princess Consort of Zhenbei back?

171
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,279
Your Majesty, the prince has asked me
to bring you a letter.

172
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,570
<i>[To my king, Your Majesty]</i>

173
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,155
What does this mean?

174
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,730
Where are Prince
and Princess Consort of Zhenbei?

175
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:47,106
Bring it here!

176
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,024
How atrocious!

177
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,714
I am willing to take
the punishment for Prince of Zhenbei!

178
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,728
We're willing to take the punishment
for Prince of Zhenbei!

179
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,785
When did I say that
I'm going to punish him?

180
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,089
Chu Mo Ran, receive my command!

181
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,608
I receive the command!

182
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,395
I command you to bring your men with you

183
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:29,542
to search for Prince
and Princess Consort of Zhenbei.

184
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,499
Once you find him,
convey my decree immediately.

185
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,269
Prince of Zhenbei is to be
conferred as Regent Arch Prince

186
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,536
and Princess Consort as
a first rank-lady of honor.

187
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:41,353
Both of them are to return swiftly
for the sake of Great Jin.

188
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,412
If you can get this done,
I shall reward you handsomely.

189
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,367
I accept the command!

190
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:50,616
Young Master.

191
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,841
- Is he here?
- Yes, Young Master.

192
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:53,794
- Good.
- He's in your study.

193
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,261
Greetings to Prince Consort.

194
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,579
How is it?

195
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,569
Prince Consort, from what I learned

196
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,197
our informants in Jin State
sent news back to say that

197
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:08,945
they didn't notice Bai Ping Ting
on the routes from Bai Lan to Jin.

198
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:13,720
Moreover, Chu Bei Jie didn't return
to the imperial court with his army.

199
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,412
Neither of them are in Jin State?

200
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:26,603
No.

201
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,239
How is it with Gui Chang Qing?

202
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,735
Prime Minister had his men
seal off all routes around Yun-An City.

203
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:41,963
That cunning old man.

204
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,944
He still hasn't given up yet.

205
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,503
Should we send out more men
to search the nearby areas?

206
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,972
If Bai Ping Ting falls into
the hands of Prime Minister Gui

207
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:52,670
I'm afraid that she'd be dead by now.

208
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,353
Don't bother.
If Ping Ting wishes to leave

209
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,728
none of those morons who serve
Gui Chang Qing could hold her back.

210
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:04,172
Send out a letter to the border of
Bai Lan State and Liang State immediately

211
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:05,886
to speed up the search.

212
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,102
We must find Bai Ping Ting.

213
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,278
The border of Bai Lan and Liang?

214
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:10,281
Prince Consort means...

215
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,690
She won't go to Yan State and Jin State.

216
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:21,587
This is the only place she'd go.
<i>[Liang State]</i>

217
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:27,531
Perhaps Chu Bei Jie is also
on his way there now.

218
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,612
We must find them before
they leave Bai Lan State.

219
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:32,500
Yes!

220
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,942
Ping Ting, it's so dark out here.

221
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,887
We'd better light a torch.

222
00:16:58,423 --> 00:16:58,995
Someone's here.

223
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,576
<i>Don't drink too much.</i>

224
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,131
Someone's over there.

225
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,917
This is the only route that leads to
the border of Bai Lan and Liang.

226
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,726
What is better than planting
an ambush here at the pass?

227
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,409
Then we'd better leave now.

228
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,226
Leave?

229
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:18,925
Where else could we go?

230
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,226
This is the only route.

231
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,057
What should we do?

232
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:24,946
- Come with me.
- Yes.

233
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>Don't drink too much.</i>

234
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:34,662
Chief.

235
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:40,146
In my opinion, it's only a day's journey
from the capital to this pass.

236
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,293
Drink. Fill it up.

237
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,194
We've already been waiting
out here for three days.

238
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:48,385
We haven't even see a mosquito,
not to mention any women.

239
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:50,702
They have been tracking us.

240
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,802
I reckon that those two women
didn't take this route.

241
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,861
If so, wouldn't we have
waited here for nothing?

242
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:02,617
Enough nonsense!

243
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,275
Prime Minister already said that

244
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,482
he has had the surroundings
of Yun-An City ambushed.

245
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,402
<i>As long as those two bitches
dare to leave the city</i>

246
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,255
<i>they will be throwing themselves
right into the trap.</i>

247
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,425
This route that we're guarding
is the only way to the border of Liang.

248
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:25,233
<i>As long as those bitches come our way,
we must seize them immediately.</i>

249
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:29,952
<i>Otherwise, we'll have to keep
waiting out here in the cold forever.</i>

250
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:31,024
Here, here!

251
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,821
Quiet down.

252
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,670
Listen to me.

253
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:39,486
I've heard that Chu Bei Jie is
infatuated with that little bitch.

254
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:43,720
Even our Prince Consort
regards her as something precious.

255
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:49,643
- Drink!
- Drink!

256
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,176
- Here!
- Drink!

257
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,907
<i>What if those bitches see us here
when they walk by?</i>

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,418
<i>Put out the fire!</i>

259
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,865
<i>They have to take this route.</i>

260
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:57,825
<i>Exactly!</i>

261
00:18:59,128 --> 00:18:59,955
What is that sound?

262
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,291
There's some movement.

263
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:01,947
Let's take a look!

264
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:03,886
Brothers, grab your weapons!

265
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,344
<i>There's nothing!</i>

266
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,691
- Rabbit!
- There's a rabbit!

267
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:24,851
- A rabbit!
- Catch it!

268
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:26,553
- It's a rabbit.
- Quickly!

269
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:27,785
- Go!
- Catch it!

270
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,501
- It's over there!
- Over there!

271
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,414
It's the middle of the night.
Who said it's a rabbit?

272
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,870
- Get back here now.
- Sit down.

273
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,956
How could you let it get away?

274
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,536
Brothers, sit down.

275
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:38,679
- Here.
- Drink.

276
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:40,044
That rabbit ran so fast.

277
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,039
Let's keep drinking.

278
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,396
- Here, drink!
- Keep drinking.

279
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>Let's play a drinking game!</i>

280
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,125
<i>Here.</i>

281
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,555
We must get back at them.

282
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,119
Ping Ting, we can't even get past
a common fighter.

283
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,015
These men...

284
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,206
How are we to get back at them?

285
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:53,366
They are so rude.

286
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:54,470
How can we let them off?

287
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,346
Ping Ting, you have an idea?

288
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,103
Their campsite is where the campfire is.

289
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,344
The lookout post and the pass
must be near the campfire.

290
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,303
In order to prevent us from
getting through this mountain

291
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:10,059
they must have laid many traps
in this forest.

292
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,879
They will split into two teams to watch
this route during the day and night.

293
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,023
If we take this route,
we're sure to alert them.

294
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:19,848
This...

295
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,221
What should we do if we alerted them?

296
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:26,239
We'll just have to alert them
on purpose instead.

297
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:27,763
What?

298
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,207
Here, apply this to your hands.

299
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:39,355
Isn't this the cream I made
at the inn according to your formula?

300
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,517
What use is it?

301
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,034
The bamboo in this area will do.

302
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:55,134
Done!

303
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,013
We might have set up quite a few,
but they have to be triggered.

304
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,957
We can't aim at any targets
or hurt many of them.

305
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,246
This is our main weapon.

306
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:10,609
Ping Ting, you're going to poison them?

307
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,468
But where are we to use this?

308
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:28,460
Ping Ting, how do we trigger
these gadgets?

309
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:31,437
Hunting dogs.

310
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,416
Hunting dogs?

311
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,014
Drink!

312
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,688
<i>Here, here. Let's continue with the game!</i>

313
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:40,162
<i>Five ringleaders! Six, six, six!</i>

314
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,458
<i>Eight horses!</i>

315
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,624
You lose again!

316
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,340
Again! Again!

317
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,661
Five ringleaders, four lucky charms.

318
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,821
- Three...
- You lose, Chief!

319
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,284
Get back here!

320
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:54,878
Damn animal! Stupid dog!

321
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:56,621
<i>Fill it up.</i>

322
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:57,645
<i>Here, fill it up.</i>

323
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:02,701
A shoe?

324
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:03,941
This is bad!

325
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:04,939
Chief!

326
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:06,673
There's a problem, Chief!

327
00:23:07,257 --> 00:23:07,859
Chief!

328
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,589
Chief, look!

329
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:11,443
A shoe.

330
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,086
A woman's shoe!

331
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:14,642
- This really is...
- Lao Qi.

332
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:16,372
Well done!

333
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,588
Who knew that we'd catch them soon?

334
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:20,165
Where's that little bitch?

335
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:25,848
This... Lao Qi, did you set up
this thread lock?

336
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:30,183
This... I didn't set this up.

337
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,552
It's not me.

338
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,633
They aren't caught?

339
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:34,332
No.

340
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:35,522
Chief.

341
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,247
Perhaps those two bitches
tampered with it.

342
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,147
- Go after them!
- In there! Be careful!

343
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:42,651
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

344
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,398
Slowly.

345
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,252
Yellow!

346
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,484
Get back here, Yellow!

347
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,140
Sister Bai, you're remarkable!

348
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,703
They fell for our interlocked traps.

349
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,013
They will suffer soon.

350
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,029
Let's go!

351
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:44,786
Put me down!

352
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,323
Put me down!

353
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,586
Chief! Look! They are over there!

354
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:50,809
Those two bitches!

355
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,328
- Go after them!
- Go!

356
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:54,772
- Quickly! Go after them!
- Put me down first!

357
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:00,585
What on earth is this?

358
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:04,967
- I'm so itchy!
- I'm so itchy!

359
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,287
- I'm so itchy!
- I'm so itchy!

360
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:22,790
We finally made it out. We're safe now.

361
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,841
This has been one thrilling night.

362
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:26,622
My heart is almost
leaping out of my chest.

363
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:31,684
But it now seems that such
a fright is all worthwhile.

364
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,316
At least, we now know that
we can't get into Liang State

365
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,150
from the passes of Bai Lan State anymore.

366
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,875
What should we do then?

367
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:48,007
Between Bai Lan and Liang
lies the Pine Mountain Range.

368
00:25:48,904 --> 00:25:50,079
The route through the mountains
is very dangerous.

369
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,154
Although they can't station troops there

370
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,662
the mountain range serves as
a natural shield for Bai Lan State.

371
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:59,543
We have to get through those mountains
to enter Liang State

372
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,086
without being hunted by Bai Lan State.

373
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,318
Don't worry, you have me.

374
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:03,991
It will be all right.

375
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:05,023
Let's go.

376
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:16,693
Useless bums!

377
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,029
A group of men with sharp weapons

378
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:24,702
are outwitted by two
defenseless frail women?

379
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,145
Convey my orders!

380
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,165
Search for any traces
of Bai Ping Ting immediately!

381
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:36,729
Be it official routes or paths
through the mountains

382
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:37,802
all must be monitored!

383
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:38,581
Yes!

384
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:52,030
I don't believe that
you could just vanish into thin air.

385
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,382
Ping Ting, we've been walking
for hours now.

386
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,041
You are after all pregnant.

387
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,334
We should stop and take a rest.

388
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:13,136
Don't wear yourself out.

389
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:14,504
Here.

390
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,302
Ping Ting, have a snack.

391
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,124
I'm not hungry. You can have it.

392
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:32,975
This won't do.

393
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:34,517
You are with child.

394
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:36,746
I...

395
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,448
I don't like this snack.

396
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:43,478
How about this? We'll share it.

397
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:10,705
One, two, three, four, five...

398
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,433
Along the way, apart from spending
on food and accommodation

399
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:17,838
we spent the rest of the money
on materials to tackle those bandits.

400
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,650
We didn't even get ourselves any clothes.

401
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:23,537
We're almost there.

402
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,951
Once we get through Pine Mountain Range,
everything will get better.

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,783
You keep mentioning Pine Mountain Range,
but where is it?

404
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,129
We haven't even see it yet.

405
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,333
<i>Wherever you are, I will find you.</i>

406
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:26,404
<i>Ping Ting.</i>

407
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,506
<i>Where are you?</i>

408
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:05,373
Look.

409
00:30:06,111 --> 00:30:07,479
Ahead of us is Pine Mountain Range.

410
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,489
Once we get through it,
we'll be in Liang State.

411
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:16,159
Thank goodness.

412
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,993
We've finally reached
Pine Mountain Range.

413
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:19,794
Exactly.

414
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,278
I hope that we can
pull through this safely.

415
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:33,445
Great.

416
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,120
Great!

417
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,448
Chu Bei Jie deployed
the army without permission

418
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:42,230
and then left his post
after attaining victory.

419
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,131
This seemed to have sparked quite some
discontent among my dear subjects.

420
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,578
Every one of you are here to impeach him.

421
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,292
You're going to impeach
Prince of Zhenbei?

422
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:02,946
You as well?

423
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:05,279
Right! You as well?

424
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:07,853
All of you are here to impeach him.

425
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:10,888
I'd like to ask you instead.

426
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,477
The throne up here...

427
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:17,637
Which one of you would like to sit on it?

428
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:19,909
- I wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't dare!

429
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:21,967
We definitely wouldn't dare do so!

430
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,282
You wouldn't dare?

431
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:25,945
I think that all of you
make a better king than I do!

432
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:31,289
We're willing to assist Your Majesty
in governing your nation.

433
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,159
We would go to any length to assist you!

434
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,010
Get lost!

435
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:43,820
Look at these reports you wrote!

436
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,459
Do I still need you to tell me
what is right from wrong?

437
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,790
Impeachment? Sentencing?

438
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,246
The impact of the silkworm poisoning
still affects the people greatly!

439
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:00,918
A great number of my people
are still struggling!

440
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,475
Why didn't any of you mention it?

441
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:09,028
Chu Bei Jie doesn't care about the world.

442
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,405
Every one of you here
has sinned just as much!

443
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,552
Ask yourselves.

444
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:16,348
Do you care about the people?

445
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:26,141
Any officials involved in the silkworm
conspiracy are to be locked up!

446
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,779
Your Majesty!

447
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,392
- You mustn't.
- We're innocent, Your Majesty!

448
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,131
- Grand Marshal Xie!
- We're innocent!

449
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:32,920
Do you want to end up
in the dungeon as well?

450
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,703
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

451
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,068
I'm innocent!

452
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,056
- I'm innocent, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

453
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,530
- Your Majesty!
- I'm innocent!

454
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,670
A bunch of useless scum!

455
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:50,079
Get lost if you have nothing to report!

456
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:51,954
We will take our leave now.

457
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,848
Long live the king!

458
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:05,619
Your Majesty!

459
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:07,820
Your Majesty.

460
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:10,625
Be careful.

461
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:30,843
Who is it?

462
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:33,653
How dare you barge into
the gate of Nan-An County!

463
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,988
Do you think that my men are useless?

464
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:37,226
You're the garrison commander?

465
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:40,522
Exactly! I'm the guardian of the gates
here in Nan-An County!

466
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:44,310
If you want to barge in here,
you'd better ask my blade for permission!

467
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:45,902
Brothers, attack!

468
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:00,662
Kill him!

469
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:12,503
Attack!

470
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,704
Kill him!

471
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:38,790
Who are you?

472
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:40,925
Hero... Hero, do spare us!

473
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:42,607
Hero, do spare us...

474
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,447
Be nice.

475
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:53,689
Hero, do spare us! Let's talk nicely.

476
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:54,965
- Master!
- Let's talk nicely.

477
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:55,658
Close the door.

478
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:57,604
- Master.
- Don't come in!

479
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,782
Hero, do spare us! Let's talk nicely.

480
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,035
Be nice.

481
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,686
Hero, do spare my life.

482
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,906
We can talk nicely.

483
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,452
Have you seen this person?

484
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,347
No...

485
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:28,370
Tell the truth!

486
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:31,664
Yes... I have.

487
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,382
I have... No!

488
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:44,049
Hero, look.

489
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,104
Prince Consort sent this.

490
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,544
Every pass along Bai Lan State's border
received this command.

491
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:51,269
If we were to see this woman

492
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:52,901
we are to kill her
if we can't catch her alive.

493
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,175
Hero, spare my life!

494
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,938
Move it!

495
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:08,738
Step aside!

496
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:09,787
Yes.

497
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:11,564
Step aside!

498
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:14,815
- Master!
- Master!

499
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:27,354
Master, are you all right?

500
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,374
Master.

501
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,743
He... What did he say to you?

502
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,511
He said that if we should dare
to harm Bai Ping Ting

503
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,042
we will end up like this flagpole.

504
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,201
This is...

505
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:29,505
Prince Consort.

506
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:31,706
This man shows up mysteriously.
He's extremely violent.

507
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:33,242
He's picked quite a few of our passes.

508
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,131
Yet no one could defeat him.

509
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:41,678
Apart from Chu Bei Jie,
who else is capable of that?

510
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:45,834
The garrison commander of
Xiaoyang Pass is Luo Hao?

511
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,842
Yes.

512
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:49,552
Judging from the passes that
Chu Bei Jie has picked

513
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:50,838
he chose only the ones farther away.

514
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,458
He's moving farther away
from Xiaoyang Pass.

515
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:59,062
Bai Ping Ting won't go through
the heavily guarded Xiaoyang Pass.

516
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:01,476
Unless...

517
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:11,768
Open the door!

518
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:14,086
- Open the gates!
- Quickly!

519
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,479
- Open the gates!
- <i>Coming!</i>

520
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,583
- Sir?
- Why are you so slow?

521
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,657
It's so late at night.
What is this about?

522
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,011
We're going to war soon.

523
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:29,658
Every household has to
submit their taxes.

524
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,771
<i>If you don't wish to suffer,
you'd better pay up now!</i>

525
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:34,251
The local authorities of Bai Lan
are collecting taxes for war.

526
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,868
What a bunch of assholes.

527
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:37,406
<i>- Sir, you can't take it!
- Get lost!</i>

528
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:39,548
They might not be
from the local authorities.

529
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,019
- <i>Spare us!</i>
- Come with me.

530
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:42,511
<i>- Sir!
- Do you want to die?</i>

531
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,268
I dare you to run!

532
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:02,472
- Don't run!
- A-Han!

533
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:03,673
Don't let them get away!

534
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:05,401
I dare you to run! How dare you rob me?

535
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:07,127
Go on! I dare you to rob me!

536
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:08,823
- I dare you to rob me!
- Sir!

537
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:10,002
Stop hitting him.

538
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:15,504
Tell me the truth.

539
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:16,877
Who exactly are you?

540
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,901
We're tax officials of Bai Lan State.

541
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:24,122
You should be executed for
harming an imperial official!

542
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:26,776
Release me now and I might spare you!

543
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:29,654
Why would a tax official
wear the boots of a soldier?

544
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,506
Exactly!

545
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:33,365
Will you tell the truth or not?

546
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,611
If you don't, I'll take you
to the local authorities!

547
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:37,154
- Tell the truth!
- Say it!

548
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,160
Tell the truth! Say it!

549
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,452
- Will you say it?
- Yes, yes!

550
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:41,563
Please spare us, Miss!

551
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,417
We're not tax officials.

552
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:45,147
We're just garrison guards around here.

553
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:46,807
- Guards?
- Impostors!

554
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,135
- Inconsiderate scum!
- Pose as an official?

555
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,214
Spare us, Miss!
I have a family to raise and feed.

556
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:55,403
We really don't wish to die for nothing,
so we... escaped from the army!

557
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:58,329
Why would soldiers of Bai Lan State
die for no reason?

558
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,867
Miss, you might not know,

559
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:04,183
but a few days ago, a skilled warrior
broke a few of our passes in a row.

560
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,303
Wherever he went,
no one could fend him off!

561
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:09,309
We have all fled from death!

562
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,660
The tip of his sword was
only an inch away from me.

563
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,144
I nearly became blind!

564
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:14,147
Tell me.

565
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,578
What does this man look like?

566
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:19,461
That man is as tall as a metal tower.

567
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:23,615
Everywhere he goes,
sand swirls and winds howl.

568
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:27,667
He's almost inhuman!

569
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:29,798
You're just bluffing!

570
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,061
I'm telling the truth!

571
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:34,628
Where did he go?

572
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:37,528
I passed out from fright,
so I didn't know where he went.

573
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,823
Then we heard that Prince Consort went
to deploy forces from Xiaoyang Pass.

574
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:43,591
We only became soldiers to make a living.

575
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:44,973
Who would want to die?

576
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:47,388
Besides, we weren't the only ones
who ran away.

577
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:48,237
Xiaoyang Pass?

578
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,193
Where has this mysterious warrior been?

579
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:56,227
I heard that he's been to
Nan-An County, Longxi County

580
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:58,516
Guandi Way, and Angu Pass.

581
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:00,704
I really don't know about the rest.

582
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:12,673
He's running off!

583
00:42:13,276 --> 00:42:14,193
- Catch him!
- Stop!

584
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:15,292
- Zui Ju!
- Catch him! Don't run!

585
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,258
- Stop right there!
- Zui Ju!

586
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:18,376
Ping Ting!

587
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,309
- Miss!
- What's wrong?

588
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,247
- Ping Ting! Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

589
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:29,153
