1
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,100
No more dictatorship!

2
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,500
The people united
will never fall.

3
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,300
One giant leap for all mankind!
They’ve never been known
for their modesty.

4
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,100
He’s got the Hollywood thing down.
Stop the jealousy.
The man’s walking on the moon.

5
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,900
If he were a Soviet,
you’d be drooling over him.

6
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,200
I got drunk when they launched Sputnik,
then drunk again for Laika.

7
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,000
Laika?

8
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
The dog the Soviets’
sent into space.

9
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,900
Then I got drunk again for Gagarin
and for that guy ….

10
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
—Titoy.
—Titoy.

11
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,600
This is too much!

12
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,700
The U.S. cavalry
conquers the moon ….

13
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,900
and there’s not even natives
to kill.

14
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,100
I would like to ask Mr Ambassador,
Charles Elbrick …

15
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,800
and his distinguished wife …
to accept congratulations
from our Samba Club …

16
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,500
on this glorious night
for the United States of America.

17
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,400
The Ambassador can Samba very well.

18
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Let’s leave the moon
and come back to Earth.
The press is under total censorship.

19
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
Hundreds of political prisoners
are being tortured …
including some friends.

20
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,200
What are you going to do about it?

21
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,400
Me?

22
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,600
Yes, you.

23
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,300
We’re joining an armed movement.
Are you with us?

24
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
—You’re kidding!
—No. We’re serious.

25
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,600
How many bullets have you fired
in your life, César?

26
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,300
Have you ever even killed a bird?
I can learn.

27
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
You’re a seminary student.
Killing is a sin.

28
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,600
You’re going up against the military
with a weapon in your hand?

29
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
If you want to commit suicide,
just throw yourself out a window.

30
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,800
The pretty-boy actor is afraid,
Fernando.
Yes, I am an actor and I am afraid.

31
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,400
Vanity, you know, I like to show off.
You want to show off too, don’t you?

32
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,000
You’re legitimizing this dictatorship.
They’ve already legitimized
themselves.

33
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,000
What do you propose?
That we sit and do nothing?

34
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,000
You’re getting into
a pointless adventure.

35
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
For God’s sake, Fernando,
this is crazy.

36
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,800
The press is censored,
Congress is running scared.

37
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,100
A strong congress could defeat—

38
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Your thinking is bourgeois.
The time is ripe for revolution.

39
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,700
Your decision, is it definite?

40
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah, it’s definite.

41
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,900
You won’t have a home or a name.
Nothing.

42
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,300
I know.

43
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,700
Try not to get killed.

44
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,500
I’ll try.

45
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,800
See you.

46
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,600
No, we’re not going
to see each other.

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,100
Ready?

48
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
Yes.

49
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Put these glasses on.

50
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,700
Let’s go.

51
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,500
Can you get the key?
Yes. I’ll guide you.
This way.

52
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Wait a second.

53
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
Put your hand on my shoulder.

54
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,900
We’re gonna go down some stairs.
Smile.

55
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
—Another step.
—Is the car far?

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, it’s close.
Another step.

57
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,800
—Ray Charles must have a tough life.
—Yeah. Step.

58
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Let’s get in the car.

59
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
Watch your head.

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
You can take off your glasses.

61
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,900
Let’s sit here in a circle.

62
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,500
The first issue is security.

63
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Does anyone know anybody else?

64
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Everyone here has participated
in student marches and rallies.

65
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,600
I’m asking you, does anyone know
the name of anyone else in this room?

66
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Good. Because now you are about
to be re-baptised—born again.

67
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,000
Your name is Paulo.
Yours is Júlio.

68
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Yours is Renée.
And yours is Oswaldo.

69
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,100
—Oswaldo.
—Yeah. Oswaldo.

70
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
I’m Marcão.

71
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,200
I don’t like it either.

72
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,900
Lenin’s real name wasn’t Lenin
and Trotsky’s wasn’t Trotsky.

73
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
But that’s how they made history.

74
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,100
Comrades Paulo, Júlio, Renée
and Oswaldo, you now will stand ….

75
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,800
Not now. Let me finish.

76
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,400
You’re going to stand
and face the wall.

77
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,400
Our leader, Comrade Maria,
is going to talk to you.

78
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,100
Until you’ve been approved
to join the group …
you can’t see her face.

79
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,400
Understand?

80
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Face that wall.

81
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,500
—Stalin’s name wasn’t Stalin either.
—Shut up, Oswaldo.

82
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
I’m Comrade Maria …

83
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,100
one of the leaders of the 8th October
Revolutionary Movement:

84
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
the MR-8.

85
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Our purpose is to fight
the dictatorship in Brazil.

86
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,500
Many of our comrades
have already fallen. Some are dead …

87
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,100
others are in prison being tortured
by the military.

88
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,000
The fate of our dead
and tortured comrades …

89
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
could be our fate.

90
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,900
Let me make a comment.

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,600
What’s the name of the first one
in the corner?
Paulo.

92
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,100
This is a revolutionary organization.
We have rules of discipline.

93
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
These rules are to be obeyed.

94
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Understood, Comrade Paulo?
Understood.

95
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,100
Don’t put your thumb on the hammer.

96
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,800
Change your grip.

97
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Relax. Fire!

98
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
That’s looking better.
Reload.

99
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Go.

100
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,300
Excellent.
Have you had prior training?

101
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
Yes. A little.

102
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Good going.

103
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,300
Relax.

104
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,500
Fire!

105
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,300
You’ve improved since yesterday.

106
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,800
It’s easier than I thought.
It’s easy to shoot a target.
It takes courage to shoot a man.

107
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Lower your thumb.
Watch your grip.

108
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Aim.

109
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Pull the trigger.

110
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,000
No. Relax when you pull the trigger.

111
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,400
Are you afraid of the noise?

112
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,200
What a drag! All we need
is reveille or “fall in”.

113
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,700
Only soldiers can fight soldiers.

114
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, I think the little sergeant
is into you.

115
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,500
She either wants to fuck me
or fuck me over.

116
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,000
—She’s kind of pretty, Fernando.
—Paulo. My name is Paulo.

117
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
Comrade Maria, would you permit
a criticism?

118
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Of course. I think we should all
accept criticism.

119
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,500
You are good with weapons,
but eating your cooking …

120
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,300
is a true test
of revolutionary courage.

121
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,100
<i>Attention!</i>
This is not a robbery.
It’s a revolutionary expropriation …

122
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,100
of a bank that is a supporter …

123
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
of this bloody dictatorship.

124
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,100
Many of our comrades …

125
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,500
are being tortured in the prisons
of this military government.

126
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
You know nothing about it
because the press is censored.

127
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Tell your friends what is going on!

128
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,800
We are the 8th October Revolutionary
Movement: the MR-8.

129
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Hurry!

130
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,100
<i>A new safe house!
What a waste!</i>

131
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,600
Oswaldo went down
because he hesitated …

132
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,500
and didn’t shoot the guard.

133
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
What a disaster!

134
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,900
Lower your voice!
He’ll talk in less than 15 minutes.
You recruited idiots.

135
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
César’s not an idiot.

136
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,700
César?
Who is César?

137
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,700
I know his name.

138
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,500
What?

139
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,800
We’re friends.

140
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,400
Calm down!

141
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,900
Your normal life has ended.
You don’t have friends anymore,
nor a home nor a family.

142
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You have nothing! The military
probably already knows your name.

143
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,800
Going to Victor’s party tonight?

144
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,300
Probably. After the game.

145
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,400
—Are you going with Lilian?
—If she’s not too tired.
Is there another today?

146
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,100
No. Only this one.
Great. We’ll get out earlier.
He’s going to talk soon.

147
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,900
—Let him breathe.
—Not even 20 seconds.

148
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,700
He’s wounded.
I don’t want an accident.

149
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,600
He may faint, but he won’t die.

150
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,000
No fainting. He has to talk.

151
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Repeat the names.
Paulo.

152
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Maria.

153
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
Marcão.

154
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
Renée.

155
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,300
Júlio.

156
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,300
220 Portugal Avenue.

157
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,000
Apartment 204.

158
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,100
Describe them.

159
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,200
Maria …

160
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,400
thin …

161
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,900
brunette, twenty-something.

162
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,600
This isn’t going anywhere.
We’re going to go down one by one.

163
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,400
I disagree.

164
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,900
We’ve just pulled off the biggest
bank expropriation …

165
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,900
in Brazilian history.

166
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
We want money.

167
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,600
We can rent a safe house, buy guns,
do whatever we want.

168
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,000
You’re right.

169
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,800
I don’t think so.
We’ve got money.

170
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,300
The operation was a success,
in spite of César’s loss.

171
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,300
But there is no victory when you’re
playing to an empty stadium.

172
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,100
No one’s going to know what we did.

173
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,800
What we really need is an operation
to break-up censorship of the press.

174
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,700
What if we kidnap a general?

175
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,400
They’d let him die
and he’d become a hero.

176
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,700
Yesterday I saw the U.S.
Ambassador’s limousine go by.

177
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,500
What if we kidnap him?

178
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,600
—Easier said than done.
—Maybe not.

179
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,900
Nobody’s ever kidnapped
an ambassador.

180
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,300
They are not expecting that.
If we get the U.S. Ambassador …

181
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,100
the wall of silence would come down.

182
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Newspapers, radios, television—
everyone would hear our voice.

183
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:20,500
The military would be forced
to free our friends …
that are suffering in prison.

184
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,900
Can I help you, Miss?

185
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,300
My name is María das Dores.
I’ve just arrived from Varainha.

186
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,900
—From Minas Gerais.
—You’ve been there, sir?

187
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,300
Don’t call me “sir”.
No. I’ve never been there.

188
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,500
I came to work as a housekeeper.
Is this the right address?

189
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
This address is correct.
But we don’t need a maid right now.

190
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,600
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do?

191
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,200
Don’t panic. You probably
got the numbers mixed up.

192
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Thank you.

193
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,900
Wait.

194
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,600
I get off in half an hour.

195
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,400
I’ll help you find
Mrs Paulo Alancastro.

196
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,900
—God bless you.
—Amen. In half an hour then.

197
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,600
I’ll figure this thing out. We didn’t
find it today, tomorrow we will.

198
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,100
Maybe your boss
could give me a job?

199
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,500
He lives in such a big house.

200
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,600
That house belongs
to the U.S. Ambassador.

201
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,800
Ambassador!

202
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,900
Really?

203
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,100
You need to get references
to work there.

204
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
And besides that,
they investigate your whole life.

205
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Why?

206
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,900
Security purposes.
The Ambassador’s a very important man.

207
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,500
He’s one of those guys we see on television.
Lots of armed guards around.

208
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,300
No. He’s a simple guy.
He doesn’t like armed guards.

209
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,600
See this lighter?
He gave it to me.

210
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,600
He’s a good man.

211
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,800
Make yourself at home.

212
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,500
You can sleep on the sofa.
I will get you some sheets.
Do you have any beer?

213
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,800
I’ll get you one.

214
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
You dance very well.

215
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I speak English.
It’s required at the embassy.

216
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,500
I didn’t know you were so important.
I’m the head of security, honey.

217
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,400
I told them to take
the U.S. flag …

218
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,800
off the Ambassador’s car.

219
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,000
That little flag was like bait
to attract terrorists.

220
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Sometimes gringos are a little thick.

221
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,900
—What’s a terrorist?
—Forget it.

222
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,700
You are very pretty.

223
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,400
You probably say that
to every girl.

224
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
No. You are very special.
I’d do anything for you.

225
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah. Right.

226
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,100
Go ahead.Just ask me.

227
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
—Comrade Paulo?
—Yes.

228
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,900
I’m Toledo and this is Comrade Jonas.

229
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,100
It’s an honour to meet you,
Comrade Toledo. You too, Jonas.

230
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,100
Should we stand out in the street
so everyone can see us?

231
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,500
Come in, please. Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

232
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>It’s a great honour to introduce
Mr Toledo and Mr Jonas …</i>

233
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,800
from the National Liberation Group.

234
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,000
They bring their experience
from struggles in Sao Paulo …

235
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,600
to help us in our current operation.

236
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,700
Comrade Toledo is a veteran
of the Spanish Civil War.

237
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,400
He has an extensive background
in defending …

238
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,900
liberal causes in our country.

239
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Comrade Jonas has shown
outstanding courage …

240
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,800
in risky operations in Sao Paolo.

241
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Welcome to Rio de Janeiro, Comrades,
and may our mission be successful.

242
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,400
I’ll be brief.

243
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,500
I did not ask to command
this operation. It was offered to me.

244
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
So from now on,
I’ll give the orders …

245
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
and they are to be obeyed blindly—

246
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,100
without question.

247
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,700
We will be a united
and disciplined group.

248
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Our job is difficult and does not
permit any hesitation.

249
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,300
I will kill the first one
who disagrees or vacillates.

250
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,100
And if there’s a second one,
I’ll kill him too.

251
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,700
Understood?

252
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,500
Júlio and Marcão shoot very well.

253
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,700
We need two cars to cover us.

254
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
—Comrade Paulo.
—Maria?

255
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,000
—Comrade Maria.
—Yes. Comrade Maria?

256
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,000
It’s been decided that you won’t
participate in the operation.

257
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,400
It was my idea!

258
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,800
You’ll stay and wait.

259
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,700
What happened?

260
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,300
My idea.

261
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,400
Those are Jonas’s orders. He is
in command of this operation now.

262
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Is anybody going to question
the orders of Comrade Jonas?

263
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,400
They’re a bunch of middle class kids,
out for an adventure.

264
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,700
They’re not prepared
for an armed operation.

265
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,900
I know, but we need to recognize
that they had a great idea …

266
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
got the money to carry it out.

267
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,500
and wrote a great communiqué
to the newspapers.

268
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
We shouldn’t underestimate them.

269
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,400
We came to help them
and we are going to help.

270
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,600
<i>President Nixon authorized</i>

271
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,500
<i>the withdrawal of …</i>

272
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,400
<i>25,000 troops from Vietnam.</i>

273
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,100
<i>Today’s weather will be sunny
and clear …</i>

274
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
<i>with the temperature rising.</i>

275
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
He’s fifteen minutes late.

276
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,900
He’s the Ambassador. He doesn’t have
to leave at the same time every day.

277
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,100
I hope he uses the same route
every day!

278
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
Good morning, Ambassador.

279
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,200
<i>Military police. Good morning.</i>
Good morning.
There’s something strange …

280
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,800
happening at the corner
of Abrau and Marques street.
<i>One moment, please.</i>

281
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,000
This is Sergeant Eiras.
How can I help you?

282
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,700
There are three men and a woman
in a car on the corner …

283
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,100
of Abreu and Marques.

284
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,900
They look suspicious.

285
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,000
What do you mean by suspicious?

286
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,900
They’ve been there
for half an hour.

287
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,200
As if they’re waiting for someone
and they’re very nervous.
Can you see the license plate?

288
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Hold on, please.

289
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,000
Guanabara 1-28-34.

290
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,700
—Did she give the signal?
—She started then stopped.

291
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,800
That’s the Portuguese
Ambassador’s car.
That moron.

292
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,100
Take it easy. That limo looks
just like the U.S.’s.

293
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,000
The U.S. doesn’t have
a little flag.

294
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,800
Thank God you called!

295
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,500
They’re still there
and their behaviour is getting weird.

296
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,800
No need to worry …

297
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,900
the car is clean,
there’s no problem with it.

298
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,300
Maybe there’s no problem with the car,
but there’s a problem with those people.

299
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,200
<i>Take my advice, Madam. Stay away from
the window and give yourself a rest.</i>

300
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,500
Do you think I’m an idiot?

301
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I don’t need to rest.
I slept very well last night.

302
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Mr Ambassador,
Security hasn’t arrived yet.

303
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,200
There were problems
with their trains.

304
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,600
No problem.
Let’s go anyway.

305
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Open the door!
Open the fuckin’ door!

306
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,800
Put your head down!
Don’t look at me.

307
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
I knew it!

308
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,100
Don’t be so impatient, Paulo.

309
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,600
That’s the fifth time you’ve gone out.

310
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,300
The neighbours are gonna
get suspicious.
They’re half an hour late.

311
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
These things don’t go by the clock.
How can you be so calm?

312
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,100
One day, you’ll be calm too.
If I live that long—
maybe I’ll die young and nervous.

313
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,100
Maybe.

314
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,900
Don’t move,
or I’ll blow your head off!.

315
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,500
They’re here.

316
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,900
We did it! We kidnapped
the Ambassador of the United States!

317
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,600
<i>We interrupt this program
for a news bulletin.</i>

318
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,800
<i>Good evening.
Today, in Rio de Janeiro,
terrorists kidnapped …</i>

319
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,100
<i>the U.S. Ambassador,
Charles Burke Elbrick.</i>

320
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>Here is the communiqué
that was left in the embassy car.</i>

321
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:30,400
<i>“To the Brazilian people: revolutionary
group detained Mr Elbrick …</i>

322
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,700
<i>taking him to a place in the country,
where he will remain a prisoner.</i>

323
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,900
<i>The life or death of the Ambassador
is in the hands …</i>

324
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,700
<i>of the military dictatorship.</i>

325
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,900
<i>If they meet our demands,
the Ambassador will be freed.</i>

326
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,100
<i>If they don’t …</i>

327
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,700
<i>he will be executed.</i>

328
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,500
<i>The demands are as follows:</i>

329
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,100
<i>A) The release of 15 political
prisoners and their …</i>

330
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,400
<i>extradition to Mexico.</i>

331
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,800
<i>These are 15 revolutionaries
being tortured by the military police.</i>

332
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,900
<i>as well as humiliated
and imprisoned.</i>

333
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,800
<i>B) The publication and broadcast
of this communiqué …</i>

334
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,200
<i>in all major newspapers, radio
and television stations …</i>

335
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,600
<i>throughout the country.</i>

336
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,600
<i>The 15 prisoners must be freed …</i>

337
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,900
<i>whether or not
they have been convicted.</i>

338
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,200
<i>We realize that this is
an extraordinary request …</i>

339
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,500
<i>but we are confident …</i>

340
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,900
<i>that the Attorney General
will concede to our demands.</i>

341
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,700
<i>The dictatorship has 48 hours
to respond …</i>

342
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,100
<i>and accept our proposal.</i>

343
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
<i>This deadline will not
be extended …</i>

344
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>and we won’t hesitate
in carrying out …
our promises.</i>

345
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,000
<i>Whoever wants to keep on torturing
and killing our comrades …</i>

346
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>should be prepared.</i>

347
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
<i>From now on, it’s an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.</i>

348
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,300
<i>Signed: National Liberation Group …</i>

349
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,900
<i>and MR-8. “</i>

350
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,000
I have to go now.
We’ll talk later.

351
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,100
You’re on vacation.
Where do you have to go?

352
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,700
Not now.

353
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,100
If you leave without talking
to me, don’t come back.

354
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,700
Oh, God!

355
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,000
Brandao? I’m going to be late.

356
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,200
I can’t talk now.

357
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,000
All right.

358
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
What do you want to know?

359
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,800
Where are you going?
My vacation’s over.
You saw the news on television.

360
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,400
So what?
You serve on a submarine.

361
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,300
Now I work for the Secret Service.

362
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,700
Since when?
Why didn’t you tell me?

363
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,900
It’s a secret service.
I can’t tell anyone.

364
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,800
You’re not doing those things
they’re talking about on television.

365
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,900
That’s exactly what I’m doing.

366
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,900
Not torturing those kids.

367
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,900
That too.

368
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Why, Henrique?

369
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,100
It’s my job.

370
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,100
I was assigned to it
and I do it.

371
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,800
That’s all?

372
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Why do you think I do it?

373
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,400
Because I want this glory
on my resume?

374
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,100
Try to understand.

375
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,100
These terrorists …
act like a group of blind people.

376
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
Nobody knows anyone
in their group.

377
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,400
And the few that we do know …

378
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,000
all use phoney names.

379
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,900
Either you torture them right away …

380
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,900
and they confess where they last met,
or there is no progress …
in your investigation.

381
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,200
If you don’t torture them, they win.
And if you do, they still win.

382
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,800
They accuse you of being barbaric.
It’s total hypocrisy, but it works.

383
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,700
It really works.

384
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,300
Then, why the insomnia?

385
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Most of them are innocent kids
with big dreams.

386
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,500
God.

387
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,800
Kids being used by dangerous scum.

388
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,400
And if they get into power …

389
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
there won’t be torture,
but many executions.

390
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,500
You can’t shoot,
you can’t drive or follow orders …

391
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
but you write very well.

392
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,700
I’m very proud of you.

393
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,200
This is a list of things to buy.

394
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
What is this, Comrade?

395
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,200
A kiss, Maria.

396
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,900
You have a mission to carry out.

397
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,100
We forgot about dinner …
and you’ve been chosen
to go buy some pizzas.

398
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,000
—Now?
—Now.

399
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,100
Just water.

400
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,700
Fernando.

401
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,700
Artur!

402
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,000
What kind of costume is that?
It’s dress rehearsal
for Ibsen’s play.

403
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,300
—Are you that hungry?
—It’s for a party.

404
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,100
For an Ambassador?

405
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,700
If I were involved in that,
would I be buying pizzas?

406
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,100
“We realize that this is an
extraordinary request …
but we are confident—”

407
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,200
I recognize your style.

408
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,100
You overestimate me.

409
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,700
Do I?

410
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,600
How does it feel
being in the 19th century?

411
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,200
Closer to reality than being
in your horror show.

412
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,500
Kidnapping the Ambassador is like
shooting the soldier …
carrying the white flag.

413
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,200
Don’t be so dramatic.

414
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,700
You and the military seem distant
like two ends of a horseshoe, but …

415
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,200
actually you’re very close.

416
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,700
One day, everyone will know, a group
of kids picked up weapons …

417
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,400
to fight against the dictatorship.
That’s very important.

418
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,800
Not everyone’s hiding out in
<i>A Doll’s House</i>.

419
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,400
—Did you see it on television?
—What?

420
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,900
They kidnapped the U.S. Ambassador
right under the nose of the military.

421
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,100
I heard.

422
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
You heard!
What world are you living in, pal?

423
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,000
I’m not into politics.

424
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,800
Well, the guys that kidnapped
the Ambassador are very brave.

425
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,100
These guys and the astronauts
are my heroes.

426
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,800
What’s he doing here?
He’s not one of the leaders.

427
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,000
My English is lousy.
We need an interpreter.

428
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,800
The prisoner speaks Portuguese
very well.

429
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,000
Shut up!

430
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,400
You only speak
when you are questioned, understand?

431
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,600
Very good, Mr Elbrick.

432
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,200
I’ll speak slowly and don’t pretend
not to understand.

433
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,300
Who are the C.I.A. men in Brazil?

434
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,500
Do you think you’re talking
to a moron?

435
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Aren’t you aware that
U.S. military aides …

436
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,700
are teaching torture
to the Brazilian military?

437
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,600
We are wasting our time
with this liar.

438
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,400
Once he feels the same pain
that the U.S. military …
is causing in Latin America …

439
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,800
he will talk.

440
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,300
What did he say?

441
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,600
He asks if he’ll be tortured.

442
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,900
No. You will be executed
with a bullet in your head …

443
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
if the dictatorship
doesn’t meet our demands.

444
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Do you agree
with the dictatorship’s policy?

445
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,400
I cannot understand that kind
of behaviour.

446
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,400
Why threaten to torture
the Ambassador?

447
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,900
Does anyone intend
to carry out the threat?

448
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,900
Why threaten him?
So he will be frightened and talk.

449
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,200
He was not kidnapped to talk.
He was kidnapped to save
15 comrades in prison.

450
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,900
Let’s deal with the list now.

451
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,000
It is important that the names
chosen, represent …

452
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,600
all segments of the fight
against dictatorship.

453
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,400
This kidnapping has to be
the pinnacle in this fight.

454
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,300
Any suggestions?
Oswaldo.

455
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,700
Who’s Oswald?

456
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,500
Oswaldo was wounded in the bank robbery
that financed this operation.

457
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,200
But still, who is Oswaldo?

458
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,300
Oswaldo is a member of the MR-8 …
the group that thought of,
financed and—

459
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,500
Comrade Jonas is trying to—
I know what he’s trying to say.
Oswaldo has my vote.

460
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,400
And Marcão’s vote.
Does he have yours?

461
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,700
Yes.

462
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,800
Mine too.

463
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,300
Oswaldo’s in.

464
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,700
—How many, son?
—Eight.

465
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,100
—Eight?
—Yeah, eight.

466
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,400
Do you have enough money?

467
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,700
I could buy eighteen,
twenty, fifty!

468
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,800
But I only want eight.

469
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,700
The Globo, please.

470
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,100
A new group is using the name MR-8,
because we eliminated the old one.

471
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,600
A police report has just come in.

472
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,900
A young boy bought eight
roasted chickens …

473
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,400
and paid with a lot of cash.

474
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,400
The grocer thinks the boy
is involved with robbers.
Eight chickens?

475
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,300
Yeah. We asked the police
to report anything unusual.

476
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,500
Let’s investigate.

477
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,500
If the police had listened to
that complaint on Marques St … .
we wouldn’t be in this mess.

478
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Five kidnappers were seen,
one of them was really young.

479
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:00,700
Get the address of the grocer.
Any news about the demands?

480
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,200
Nothing yet.

481
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,900
There will be a rash of kidnappings
if we concede.

482
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,700
So, should we let the Ambassador die?

483
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,900
<i>Journal of Brazil. Good morning.</i>

484
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,400
—Editorial room, please.
—<i>One moment, please.</i>

485
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,300
A list with the names of the
15 prisoners to be exchanged …

486
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,700
for the U.S. Ambassador and a letter
from him to his wife …

487
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,800
are in the collection box inside
the church in downtown Rio. Repeat.

488
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,400
I voted for Oswaldo
because he was a friend.

489
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,200
You voted wrong.

490
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,200
He didn’t have the courage
to shoot the guard.

491
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,500
That’s what they told me.

492
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,600
—Yeah, he did hesitate—
—That’s what I’m saying.

493
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,700
More courageous Comrades
were left behind …

494
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,300
because of bourgeois sentimentality.

495
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,400
But he was already in.

496
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,300
That doesn’t matter.

497
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:57,600
You shouldn’t vote
to please other people.

498
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,300
You’re right. I made a mistake.

499
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,800
You’re brave, Júlio.

500
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,700
I’m proud of you.

501
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,100
Thank you.
Your opinion means a lot to me.

502
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,200
What if the military doesn’t agree
to our demands?
We’ll kill the gringo, of course.

503
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,400
Can I carry that out?

504
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,800
I know you’d do it without hesitation,
but I have someone else in mind.

505
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Who?

506
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,200
Comrade Paulo.

507
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:53,500
He’s a good talker.
But he has to prove something else.

508
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,800
It’s just between you and I.

509
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,500
Did you find a good apartment?

510
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,100
—Two.
—Where?

511
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,200
I don’t want to know the address.

512
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,200
The newspaper has the list
and the Ambassador’s letter.

513
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,600
—Everything’s okay?
—Yes.

514
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Toledo, what’s that?
Spanish rice.

515
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,400
You’re all so lazy and
I’m tired of eating junk food.

516
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,400
—I did one stupid thing.
—What?

517
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,800
The church is only two blocks away
from my old job.

518
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,100
No problem.

519
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,000
“Prison Diaries of Ho Chi Minh”

520
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,900
The only clue I can give you
is that …

521
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,500
my delivery man thinks that the kid
lives in a house on Petropolis Street.

522
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,300
Can we talk to him?
Not until tomorrow morning,
when he makes the deliveries.

523
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,800
Do you know where he lives?

524
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,100
I think I have his address.
Excuse me.

525
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,400
—Who was it?
—Nobody was at the door.

526
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,800
What’s the matter?

527
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,400
The two men from the phone company.

528
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,700
—They could be from the phone company.
—No way.

529
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,600
Look at their faces.

530
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,800
They’re both clean-shaven!

531
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,100
You’re right.

532
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,700
How did they find us so fast?

533
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,200
Those guys are pros.
Ours is an amateur group.

534
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,900
If that’s the place, they must have
taken the tunnel to get up here.

535
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,200
The garage probably connects
to the house.

536
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:49,800
Yes. The house is perfect.
Lots of rooms, a quiet street.

537
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:57,600
If this is the house,
where would the Ambassador be?
Second floor …  in the back?

538
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,300
Renée, answer it.

539
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,600
I would like to speak to Desiree,
please …

540
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:32,800
There is no one here by that name.
—Is this 225-8716?
—That’s right.

541
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,000
But she gave me this number.

542
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,800
Is this 105 Petropolis Street?

543
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:43,300
It’s the right address,
but there’s nobody by that name here.

544
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Leave it off the hook.

545
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,100
—What did you see?
—What’s going on?

546
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,900
Speak to us.

547
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,600
We have visitors. Tell Paulo to come
and you watch the gringo.

548
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,900
If you hear a gunshot, shoot the man.

549
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,000
No mercy.

550
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Maria, you and Renée stay here
for backup.

551
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,500
Marcão, you come outside with me.

552
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,000
—May I help you?
—Please, can I speak to Eduardo?

553
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,000
—There’s no Eduardo living here.
—No? Really?

554
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:01,500
But isn’t this 105 Petropolis Street?
Yes, but there’s no Eduardo.

555
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,900
We were invited for lunch.

556
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Could I use your phone?

557
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,600
I don’t have a phone.

558
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,100
Sorry to bother you …

559
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,200
—Good luck with your lunch.
—Thanks.

560
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,500
Follow them.

561
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,100
Now?

562
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Now. Find out where they go
and who they are.

563
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,200
—It’s them. I recognize that guy.
—Me, too.

564
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,800
We have pictures of him speaking
at student meetings.

565
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,900
They screwed up, buying take-out food.
If they only knew how to cook.

566
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,200
A bunch of lazy middle class—

567
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,700
The son of a bitch is following us.

568
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,800
Let him come.

569
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:04,200
We’re going to let them know
they’re surrounded.
It’s time to make them sweat.

570
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,100
—I don’t know. The Commander—
—Fuck the Commander.

571
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:12,200
If the Military Junta accepts the
demands, we’ll go to plan B.

572
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,300
Commander, we found the house.

573
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:45,000
We recognized the guy
who answered the door.

574
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,600
Do you know the name
of the owner of the house?

575
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,300
The stakeout is almost finished.

576
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,100
I think they’re suspicious.

577
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,800
They didn’t let us in and
they denied having a phone.

578
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,700
I’ll wait for your orders.

579
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,900
Open the door.

580
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,800
They already know we are here.

581
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,800
That’s not important.
They’re not going to invade the house …

582
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,400
because they don’t want
the Ambassador to die.

583
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,700
But they still haven’t
given us an answer.

584
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,800
What if they don’t agree
to our demands?
The deadline expires—

585
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,500
Tonight at 10 p.m.

586
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,500
I’m going to read to you
a segment of our document.

587
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,800
“This deadline will not be extended
and we will …

588
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,800
not hesitate in carrying out
our promise.”

589
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:52,900
We have to decide who’s going
to carry out the execution.
Comrade Jonas is the commander.

590
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,400
I’m not going to choose.

591
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,800
The Ambassador will be executed …
by whoever is with him
at ten o’clock tonight.

592
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,700
He’ll be killed by whoever is on duty.
In other words, by all of us.

593
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,300
That’s Paulo’s shift.

594
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,600
Congratulations.

595
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,600
If necessary, I know you will
carry out what you wrote.

596
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,400
Thank you.

597
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:45,100
Two bullets in the head at ten sharp.
I won’t stand for any delays.

598
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:51,200
The sentence will be carried out or
there will be two dead instead of one.
Understood?

599
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,600
He changed the shifts.
Why did he do that?

600
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:03,900
It’s not important. Either the military
accepts our demands by 10 p.m. or …

601
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,500
they’ll storm the house.
No one will get out alive.

602
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:15,800
Did you think we’d go this far?

603
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,300
ARMY HUNTING DOWN KIDNAPPERS

604
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,900
Yeah, sure …  no, I didn’t.

605
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,800
Maria, do you think they’re gonna
let the Ambassador die ?

606
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,800
No.

607
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,300
I’m not sure.

608
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,300
I’m afraid of dying.

609
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,600
I don’t want to die.

610
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,000
I would rather go to jail.

611
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,800
Sometimes I dream that I’m in jail
and I feel so relieved.

612
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,000
I know your name …

613
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,900
Fernando, isn’t it?

614
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,700
I heard you speak at a student rally.
You spoke so well!

615
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,400
I admired you.

616
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,500
Comrade, you’re completely
irresponsible.

617
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,700
My name is Andrea.

618
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,400
—Did you hear about Pecanha?
—Who?

619
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,500
—Sergeant Pecanha.
—No. What?

620
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,900
—He married Marta.
—Marta who?

621
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That skinny redhead.

622
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,600
The terrorist?

623
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:49,600
That’s the one. They got married
and are moving to the suburbs.

624
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,000
Pecanha really got into
torturing people.

625
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,700
He found a passion he never had
when he was a bureaucrat.

626
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:04,000
And Marta was always his favourite.

627
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,800
We opened up Pandora’s box.
We shouldn’t have done it.

628
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,600
Things got out of control.

629
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,900
Do you sleep okay?

630
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,800
I sleep fine.

631
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,700
I don’t.

632
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:30,700
I’ve been dreaming about things
hanging upside down.

633
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:51,800
He put on the glasses.
—Give me the hood.
—You’re gonna wear it?

634
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:56,400
I won’t kill a blind man. He has the
right to know that he’s going to die.

635
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,700
They accepted our demands.
They are releasing the prisoners.

636
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,000
We won.

637
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,900
<i>We interrupt this program
for a news bulletin.</i>

638
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,400
<i>The Reuters Agency just released
this wire photo …</i>

639
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,800
<i>of the arrival in Mexico City …</i>

640
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:19,100
<i>of the 15 prisoners freed in exchange
for the kidnapped U.S. Ambassador …</i>

641
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,500
<i>Charles Burke Elbrick.</i>

642
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,600
—We did it?
—We did it.

643
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,000
Be careful, son.

644
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,200
Be careful.

645
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,000
<i>It’s a great game!</i>

646
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,500
<i>Maracana Stadium is sold out!</i>

647
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,500
They’re following us.

648
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh, my God! Get the machine gun.

649
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Fifteen made it to Mexico,
but these seven aren’t going anywhere.

650
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,900
We’re being followed!

651
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,900
Oh, shit!

652
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,700
Marcão, there’s a police car behind us.

653
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,400
What are you trying to do …
kill the Ambassador?

654
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,200
The coast is clear.

655
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,300
Put that back in the bag.

656
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,400
I hear a helicopter.

657
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:02,800
If they think they can follow us
from up there, they’re crazy.

658
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,700
Go to the soccer stadium.
The game’s just ended.

659
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,900
Get lost, gringo.

660
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,300
—I have the Ambassador here.
—The Ambassador! Open the gate!

661
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,200
The Sergeant told me to call you,
if I found something unusual.

662
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,800
<i>Maria, one month without seeing you …</i>

663
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:41,000
<i>hidden, hunted and wanted.</i>

664
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,700
<i>I need to see you.</i>

665
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,100
<i>I don’t care about the rules
of being safe.</i>

666
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
<i>I need to see you.</i>

667
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,200
I heard that in Gil’s latest record …

668
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,200
he shouts the name “Marighella”
in the middle of a song.

669
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,400
So what?

670
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,800
It’s important.

671
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:27,800
The name of a revolutionary leader
in the middle of a pop song.
That’s important.

672
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,300
Do you think that’s true?

673
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,700
I heard that if you listen
to it backwards …

674
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,300
he says “Marighella” quite clearly.

675
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,700
No one listens to a record backwards.

676
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:56,300
It was a dream that failed.
We’re shouting into the wind.

677
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,800
Your name is not Maria. It’s Andrea.

678
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:28,400
You should’ve invited me
to lunch, Fernando.
Only my friends eat in my house.

679
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,900
The world has turned
upside down, Fernando.

680
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,200
<i>Fernando, the kidnapping of
the German Ambassador gives me hope.</i>

681
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:32,200
<i>I wonder if you are also on the list
of prisoners to be exchanged.</i>

682
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,100
<i>Maybe I will see you
when we’re sent to Algeria.</i>

683
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,900
<i>Jonas and Toledo are dead.</i>

684
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,200
<i>As for me, don’t be concerned
about what you’re going to see.</i>
