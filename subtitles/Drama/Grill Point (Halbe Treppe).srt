1
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,599
How's that for a picture?

2
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,478
-A nice shot.
-It's fabulous.

3
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,242
Just like a postcard.

4
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:36,440
-Is that the view from the hotel?
-We had that aerial up there.

5
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,685
And those smelly old mattresses.

6
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,924
Ellen was completely out of it
after three cocktails.

7
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,719
She was so smashed there!

8
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:57,441
-She was so pissed there!
-He's making me out to be a drunk.

9
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,645
I don't find that funny.

10
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,757
They had 3 2 cocktails!
3 2!

11
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,843
Could you please
take that awful slide off now?

12
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,887
It's embarrassing.

13
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,042
If I worked in television
I'd use it as the test card.

14
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,361
You're mean.

15
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,364
That's how he sharpens his beak.
Careful!

16
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,521
Stop it, you two.

17
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,725
-Carry on.
-Oh, all right.

18
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,881
Looks like someone shit in the sea.

19
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,839
That reminds me
of my childhood at the lake.

20
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,046
I'm swimming along
and see a floating turd.

21
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,765
When I came up
I had a pile of shit on my head.

22
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,647
-Sleep well.
-Bye.

23
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,642
-Close the window, it's cold.
-I'll drive.

24
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,039
-I'll drive.
-No, I'll drive.

25
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,121
-You've had too much.
-I can drive.

26
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,001
-Katrin!
-Yes?

27
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,888
-I'll call you to make a date.
-Fine.

28
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,802
I could pick you up or something.

29
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,608
Bye.

30
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,366
Wave goodbye.

31
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,280
Time for beddy-byes.

32
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,008
Yes.

33
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:40,602
-She can really get on your nerves.
-Yes, she's unbearable at times.

34
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,361
-She never stops talking!
-I know.

35
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:53,517
-I think she's unhappy with him.
-Oh, I don't know.

36
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:57,721
-That was horrible of you.
-What?

37
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,447
Showing the picture.

38
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,601
-What picture?
-That awful one of me.

39
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,521
I was embarrassed.

40
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,203
-I thought...
-Can't hear you.

41
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,882
I thought it was mean.

42
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,961
That was really rotten of you.

43
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,602
It wasn't exactly flattering.

44
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,079
And then you leave...
What's that in your hair?

45
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,366
Then you leave it
on the screen for ages.

46
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,645
You know how I hate that.

47
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,322
Stop it now.

48
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,287
It's embarrassing.

49
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,758
I mean, when we're alone...

50
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:35,639
When we're alone I don't mind
but not when we have guests over.

51
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:40,405
-There's no need for that.
-Some of mine were terrible too.

52
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:44,244
-Did you see those?
-What do you want me to say?

53
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,318
I've found another shot.

54
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:51,925
-Down the hatch!
-I mean a slide.

55
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,360
Look at all the ash.

56
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:00,558
I wish you'd use this properly.
You've got to tip the ash inside.

57
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,928
Oh shit!

58
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,762
Shit, shit, shit!

59
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,847
It's 5:4 9 on Radio 2 4,
playing hits of the last 2 4 years.

60
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,160
Broadcasting from the 2 4th floor
of the Oder Tower.

61
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:40,720
This is Magic Chris.
Coming up, your personal horoscope.

62
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,481
Good morning!

63
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,722
It's 6: 1 2. This is Chris.
Power from the Tower.

64
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,447
Good morning.

65
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,360
Mascha, Gregor!
Get a move on, it's late.

66
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:54,367
Hurry up.

67
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,562
Get a move on.
We're running late.

68
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,084
Bye, darling.
Bye, Gregor.

69
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,728
You be good now.

70
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,568
Hello.

71
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,198
No, this is Ellen speaking.

72
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,686
Ellen, really?

73
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,641
I wanted to remind Katrin to buy food
because my daughter is coming today.

74
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,768
So she must have left
her mobile there last night.

75
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,328
Morning.

76
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,526
So, everything ready?

77
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,482
Planning on tooting here all day?

78
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,566
Do you speak German?
Speak any German?

79
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,641
-Yes.
-You hanging around all day?

80
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:36,924
-Why not?
-Because I find it a bit irritating.

81
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,445
I take breaks.
I'll come for something to eat.

82
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,406
Well, that's good.

83
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:47,040
Maybe you could stand down there
near the lamppost.

84
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,722
-Fine, but only because it's you.
-I appreciate it.

85
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,642
I'll treat you to a beer later on.

86
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,562
I mean, I normally love music but...

87
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,882
Radio 2 4's Magic Hour
with your horoscope for today.

88
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,483
The stars favour change.

89
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,882
Put an abrupt end to all that boredom
and try to spice up a dull day.

90
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,007
As you know, life is too short.

91
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,808
And this is to all Taureans.

92
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:19,598
Receive unexpected visitors
with open arms.

93
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,522
Be sure to stock up your fridge.

94
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,528
Hi. Come in.

95
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,168
-Sure?
-Yes.

96
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,968
-Got the phone.
-I've got to go on.

97
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,801
-Sure.
-Hang on.

98
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,119
I'll only be ten seconds.

99
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,488
And that was Britney Spears.

100
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,403
Next up is the Happy Hour
with Knut from the Tower.

101
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,526
A kiss from Chris.

102
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,966
-Quite a session last night.
-Indeed.

103
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,120
-There you go.
-That's Katrin!

104
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,769
-I imagined this place to be bigger.
-It's only a computer and a mixer.

105
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,880
It's big enough.

106
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,880
Want to have a go?

107
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,720
Say something.

108
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:22,198
-Hello.
-Announce the time.

109
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,885
-It's 7:33.
-I think I'll leave that to you.

110
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,323
You have a fantastic view.

111
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,725
It's even better from here.
You can see Poland, the stadium.

112
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,961
-You okay, Knut?
-You look and sound tired.

113
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,883
Knut, this is my girlfriend.
No, I mean this is...

114
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,528
This is...

115
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,283
My friend's girlfriend.

116
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,441
-She's my wife's friend.
-Whatever.

117
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,158
Would you excuse me now?

118
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,565
-I have to go.
-So do I.

119
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:29,564
A nice evening, wasn't it?

120
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,925
This thing takes ages.

121
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:48,848
Four.

122
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,523
I serve sausages,
chips and schnitzel all day.

123
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,600
Soup is always popular.
Not surprising at 2 marks 50.

124
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,839
People like my soup.

125
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,279
Business is going well.

126
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,158
How long do you stay open?

127
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:22,047
Well, it depends.

128
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,122
I'm usually here till 1 0.
In the summer till 1 2.

129
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,961
Sometimes we stay open till 3.

130
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:35,123
I mean, if it's someone's birthday
I'll be stuck here till 3.

131
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,879
I don't mind though.

132
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,961
But it makes it difficult
to spend time with the family.

133
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:52,803
You shouldn't be filming this.
I'm not supposed to smoke in here.

134
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:56,882
If the health inspector turns up
I'm in trouble.

135
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,439
I'll have to pay a 20 mark fine.

136
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:01,486
-20 marks?
-Yes.

137
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,645
-Seriously?
-Yes, 20.

138
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,720
What happened, Uwe?

139
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,244
Oh shit, I don't believe it.
That's all I need.

140
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,600
-I'm sorry.
-We were supposed to meet.

141
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,439
-There's not much time.
-We're really busy.

142
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:24,045
-My break doesn't last forever.
-All right!

143
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,122
-Look at how full this place is.
-I'm so thirsty!

144
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,041
-Eberhard?
-Yes?

145
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,040
-Got half an hour?
-Yes.

146
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,281
Can you fill in?
We're buying a kitchen.

147
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:41,958
Hello.

148
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,644
-We want to look at some kitchens.
-Fine, go ahead.

149
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,243
Could you make a hamburger?

150
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,283
-It's almost ready.
-Okay.

151
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,124
My break is almost over.
We have to hurry.

152
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,041
I'd like to know
why we're looking at kitchens anyway.

153
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,485
Oh, come on.
You always put a damper on things.

154
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,447
-You've seen our place.
-And our kitchen.

155
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:10,282
There's no room for a proper kitchen.

156
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,839
There's space
even in the smallest place.

157
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,167
You always spoil it.

158
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:18,445
I've lost interest.

159
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,842
I see it as a living area.
A social area if you like.

160
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:43,968
In today's houses
kitchens tend to be bigger.

161
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,962
When I read this crap
I'm glad they didn't take me.

162
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,804
Can I take the car tomorrow?

163
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,448
No.

164
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,087
Did you drop something?

165
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:10,558
The glass from Aunt Trude.

166
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,128
Shit.

167
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,200
You married a klutz.

168
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,482
-Do you want some red wine?
-No.

169
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,561
That'll be Julia.

170
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,999
-So you decided...
-Hi.

171
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,485
Were you just going to bed?

172
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,241
Come in.

173
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,641
This is Jens.
This is my father.

174
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,763
Could you take your shoes off?

175
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,679
-Hello.
-That's Katrin.

176
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,528
Jens.

177
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:22,603
I've got something for you.
A letter from mum.

178
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,928
-Who's Jens?
-My boyfriend.

179
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:30,287
-I bought your cheese.
-You didn't say he was coming.

180
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,883
I said I was coming so I figured...

181
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,847
-Ask first.
-I didn't think you'd mind.

182
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:44,922
Are we running a cheap hotel?
Who will she bring along tomorrow?

183
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,399
-So you're Jens?
-Yes.

184
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:57,448
And what do you do?

185
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,680
That's my dessert.

186
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,038
The dessert stays here.

187
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,959
I said the dessert stays.

188
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,279
Make yourself a sandwich.

189
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,043
Well, have a nice evening, Jens.

190
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,724
-What is it?
-Stressing about the dessert.

191
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,728
Jens.

192
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,163
We'll be seeing more of Jens.

193
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,561
Sleep well.

194
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,041
You too.

195
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,802
If you see a speed trap, call us.

196
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:11,564
0 1 80 2 4 2 4 2 4.

197
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:15,608
This is Radio 2 4.
Nonstop power from the Tower.

198
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:19,478
Want to know what the stars
have in store for you?

199
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,164
Stay tuned
to find out what this day holds.

200
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:26,878
Coming up, the Astral Shower
from the Power Tower.

201
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,282
With Chris, of course. It's 8.:06.
This is Radio 2 4. Good morning.

202
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,439
Yuck, that is so gross.

203
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,363
What the hell is going on here?

204
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,367
We'll all go deaf soon at this rate.

205
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,603
Holy cow! Are you losing it?

206
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:23,202
-Uwe!
-Is this an open-air concert?

207
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,325
Uwe, please come here.

208
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,608
Uwe!

209
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,807
-Ellen, come here.
-Uwe, you come here.

210
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:33,403
Ellen, come here, please.

211
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:35,766
Please come here.

212
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:41,562
Uwe, the raw meat in the bathtub.

213
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,368
-What did I tell you?
-It's gross.

214
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:47,960
Notice anything? Anything different?

215
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,006
Where's the bird?

216
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:54,560
-Hans-Peter!
-Mascha, oh God, Mascha!

217
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,366
-Explain that to the kids.
-Hans-Peter!

218
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,366
Hans-Peter!

219
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,162
-Hans-Peter!
-Maybe outside.

220
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,961
He's not in here.

221
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:12,168
-Oh God, no!
-Leave it open. He might come back.

222
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:13,808
Uwe!

223
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,359
Be quiet. I think I hear...

224
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,566
Where do we start?

225
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,879
I heard something here.

226
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,801
-Hans-Peter!
-Well, he's not here.

227
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:33,201
-Do they fly very far?
-Why did you leave the door open?

228
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:38,079
-Maybe he's on one of the balconies.
-That was pretty stupid.

229
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:41,161
-I had to air the flat.
-So it's my fault.

230
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:45,484
-It's always my fault.
-It just gets so smoky.

231
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,324
-I know, we need an extractor hood!
-Exactly!

232
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,767
It's been a problem for weeks.
Now you blame me for airing.

233
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,763
Well, that's just great!
Why do I bother anyway?

234
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:00,248
Shit.

235
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,762
-I've got to go to work too.
-I'm sorry.

236
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,801
Let's have a look around the corner.

237
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:12,162
-I don't have time now!
-It'll take five minutes!

238
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,682
I've really got to go.
I have to take the meat back.

239
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,604
This is pointless.
Where do you want to look?

240
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,125
-Birdbrain.
-He should be easy to spot.

241
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:31,164
I mean, he's bright yellow.

242
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,638
-Ellen!
-Hans-Peter?

243
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:39,168
Shit!

244
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,521
Do you work here?

245
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:12,244
-Oh! Hi.
-I'd like to buy something.

246
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,401
-For yourself?
-For my better half.

247
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,161
For Katrin.

248
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,959
-Chris?
-Yes?

249
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:22,963
-Why did you get me this anyway?
-No special reason.

250
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:27,803
-I think I like it.
-Really?

251
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,719
The stuff cost enough!

252
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:32,800
Listen, darling...

253
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,279
Could you hang my T-shirt up

254
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:38,964
so it doesn't get a crease
across the chest?

255
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,608
Yes.

256
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:52,565
When I was a little girl

257
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,405
I thought I'd be a pilot.

258
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:00,245
I wanted to fly planes.
I wanted to see different countries.

259
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:08,961
You say, ''First finish your studies
and there'll be plenty of time later.''

260
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:15,001
Then you end up on a truck stop
because there isn't anything else.

261
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:20,121
And you kind of get stuck there.
It's all very strange.

262
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:23,562
But we're still young
so it's not too late.

263
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:26,641
Maybe Chris will get an offer in...

264
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,808
Vienna.

265
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,880
That's a great city.

266
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,563
Vienna is supposed to be nice.

267
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:40,604
Yes. Hi, this is Ellen.

268
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,402
Could I speak to Katrin, please?

269
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,324
Oh, that's too bad.

270
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:55,120
That's too bad.

271
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,208
Well...

272
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,162
Well, I still have some overtime.

273
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:08,605
So I can take time off.

274
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:12,128
We wanted to go to the pictures.

275
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:14,847
Katrin and I.

276
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,597
Oh well.
I can only manage today.

277
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:23,886
Really? I mean...

278
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,360
Have you got time?

279
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:31,721
Really?

280
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,688
Yes.

281
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,008
Okay.

282
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:43,728
Bye.

283
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,920
Oh dear.

284
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,360
Hear the bird?

285
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:23,246
Hans-Peter.

286
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,448
-What?
-Our budgie flew away.

287
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:35,040
Do you feel guilty?

288
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:42,800
No, not really.

289
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:46,606
Neither do I.

290
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,685
Not in the slightest.

291
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,479
Who would have thought?

292
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:57,928
Me.

293
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:01,367
I'm serious. Since yesterday.

294
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,448
Really?

295
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,959
You're joking, right?

296
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:14,366
Me too.

297
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,647
Yes!

298
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:22,563
Hello, Uwe!

299
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,402
Katrin!

300
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,524
We're doing fine!

301
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:43,928
Stop it!

302
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:45,727
Have you gone mad?

303
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,198
He's gone absolutely mad!

304
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,364
Now my dick's even smaller.
I want to go home!

305
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:20,448
The last time I was really happy?

306
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,406
That was when Ellen told me
that she was having a baby.

307
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:29,798
I think that was it.
That was really great.

308
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,364
We were both pleased.

309
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,565
It was on holiday.

310
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:38,642
We had time for each other.
Time is pretty important.

311
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:44,247
It has a big influence on happiness.
You should take time for each other.

312
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,799
But we have to make ends meet.

313
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:50,200
We all have to make a living somehow.

314
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,481
Because money is something
you need to live these days.

315
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,482
That was terrific.

316
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,960
Oh, here he comes.

317
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:16,446
-Evening.
-Hi.

318
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,999
So, what's the problem?

319
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,083
One of the lights is broken.

320
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,200
-And now?
-Well...

321
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,039
-You drive me home.
-We have to take the scooter.

322
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:32,645
-It won't fit.
-So it can go to the garage.

323
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,403
-Hi, Martin. Bye.
-Bye.

324
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:41,687
I can put the Vespa in the boot.
I've had much bigger things in there.

325
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:47,446
-Surely you can take me into work.
-I told you that I can't tomorrow.

326
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,561
I have appointments and need the car.

327
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:55,961
Your wife will have no way
to get to work tomorrow.

328
00:32:56,129 --> 00:33:00,168
-Want me to skip work?
-No one's saying that.

329
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:05,608
-I have a business trip tomorrow.
-Say I need a lift to my job.

330
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:09,403
Just lift it a little higher.

331
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,525
Just a bit higher.

332
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:13,361
-What?
-No.

333
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:17,442
-It won't work.
-Fine, we'll try it the other way.

334
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:21,600
Do you have to work in the sticks?

335
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:27,648
It's not funny.

336
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:30,119
Higher, higher. It'll fit.

337
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,007
Another tight fit.

338
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,288
Uwe?

339
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,121
I'm going to bed.

340
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll join you soon.

341
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:09,284
Sitting all the time
exacerbates female problem areas.

342
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:11,883
Bottom, thighs and waist.

343
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:14,768
Many women suffer from tension.

344
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:45,768
They taste best.

345
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:49,045
The cream's so fresh.

346
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:54,488
I'll change my image to a fat redhead.
Do you think red hair would suit me?

347
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,039
-Or darker.
-Like Milva.

348
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,526
Beautiful Milva.

349
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:05,562
I bet Chris wouldn't notice anything
if I dyed my hair.

350
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,606
-Sure he would.
-No.

351
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,487
Come off it.

352
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,082
Red hair?

353
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:18,240
He hasn't been very attentive
recently.

354
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:22,322
It's like that
when you've been together so long.

355
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:27,963
It's just the same with us.
Not like it was when we first met.

356
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,439
Perhaps we should...

357
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,047
We should what?

358
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,162
Start again from the beginning.

359
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,880
That's an idea.

360
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:06,285
You're back again.

361
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,765
Well, screech owl.
Brought a friend along?

362
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,438
Don't stand there all day.

363
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:34,403
The stars are having a ball today.

364
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:39,962
Taureans and Scorpios particularly
should now pay very close attention.

365
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:43,366
Your astral diagram
is on the ascendant.

366
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:56,847
-Two hundred zlotys.
-Okay.

367
00:37:57,169 --> 00:38:00,559
-Can I book for just a few hours?
-Yes.

368
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:02,481
Then it's half price.

369
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,244
Chris?

370
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:35,167
You're a sly fox.

371
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,804
Yes? Do you think so?

372
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,566
It was no coincidence.

373
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,367
What?

374
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,727
You know.

375
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,720
The horoscopes.

376
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:55,080
What horoscopes?

377
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,642
You've touched a thousand times.

378
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,607
Sparks will fly the 1 00 1st time.

379
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:12,568
Then we were together in the car.

380
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,720
Under the bridge.

381
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:18,162
You will have a great adventure.

382
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:21,126
Going over the border.

383
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:23,166
A new perspective.

384
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,687
That was today.

385
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:33,246
-What's your star sign?
-Scorpio.

386
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:37,888
Do you believe all that stuff?

387
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:40,481
Yes, I do.

388
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,078
Well, it's nice to have something
to hold on to.

389
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:51,920
The whole world,
and I'm not joking now.

390
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,523
The whole world has taken on

391
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:57,238
a magical glow in your eyes.

392
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:01,838
Your soul's current high
is set to continue.

393
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:07,161
The hearts of the world,
one especially, lie at your feet.

394
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,487
I'm back.

395
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:52,440
I got out early today.

396
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:55,442
There was some sort of accident.

397
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:01,564
We were sent home.
The truckstop was dead.

398
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:06,959
Do you feel like going out somewhere?

399
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:09,607
Chrissy?

400
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:14,082
Chrissy, did you remember to...

401
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:19,125
Sorry.

402
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:27,481
Are you crazy?

403
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:30,805
What's going on here?

404
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:34,046
Have you gone mad?

405
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,368
Katrin.

406
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:47,721
Christian.

407
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:49,408
My clothes.

408
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,604
My clothes!

409
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,240
My shoes. My shoes!

410
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,406
Katrin, I'm sorry.

411
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:31,125
I should have told you.

412
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:38,399
Keep your hands off me.

413
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:43,202
Don't stop me.
Let me out of here.

414
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:44,882
Let me go.

415
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:49,767
-Let me go!
-Where are you going?

416
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,567
Stay here.

417
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:53,563
What are you doing?

418
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:56,648
-Hi.
-What do you want?

419
00:43:57,289 --> 00:43:59,564
Just thought I'd drop in.

420
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:05,447
-How often have I said to call first?
-I thought you'd be pleased.

421
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,679
You've picked a bad time.

422
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:09,760
That's not my fault.

423
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,928
Oh, no.

424
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,125
Are you back already?

425
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,720
Stay where you are.

426
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,009
Don't come into the kitchen.

427
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,446
Close your eyes. Go on, close them.

428
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,207
Hi.

429
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:53,726
Keep your eyes shut.

430
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:56,126
Keep them shut.

431
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,121
Turn around.

432
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,567
Keep them shut.

433
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:04,528
Now.

434
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,966
Open your eyes.

435
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:18,040
It even has a light.

436
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:24,522
I had to move the cupboard.
It was a bit too wide.

437
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:28,398
But I thought
the cupboard could go over there.

438
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:33,246
What do you think?

439
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,607
Very nice.

440
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:40,606
I deserve a drop too.

441
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:45,246
It's okay, isn't it?

442
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:55,887
Well, it's great to see you so happy.

443
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:09,405
Is something wrong?

444
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,244
I've fallen for someone.

445
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:38,361
What do you mean, fallen for someone?

446
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:45,241
I'm sorry.

447
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:51,600
You can't be serious.

448
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,927
Who is it?

449
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:03,006
That's irrelevant.

450
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,645
It's extremely relevant to me.
Who is it?

451
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,325
I want to know who he is.

452
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:19,401
Are you completely off your rocker?

453
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:24,368
You come in here
and say you've fallen for someone.

454
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,047
Well.

455
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:32,040
It's obvious now.

456
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:34,643
Logical really. What an idiot.

457
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:37,403
Of course you had to work late!

458
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,281
Uwe.

459
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:06,201
Uwe.

460
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:15,166
I always used to think
relationships had to last a lifetime.

461
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:17,638
Now I feel differently.

462
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:20,084
Marriage is no marathon.

463
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:22,285
No endurance test.

464
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:26,362
And when you die
you've crossed the finish line.

465
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:33,368
Perhaps this constellation
doesn't work.

466
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,646
What then?

467
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,845
Perpetual variety?

468
00:48:44,169 --> 00:48:46,842
It doesn't have to be perpetual.

469
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,967
It's different if you have children.

470
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:53,802
If a whole family is involved.

471
00:48:56,689 --> 00:49:01,205
But I don't think
you have to endure to the bitter end.

472
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:05,918
You could change partners
every eight years.

473
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,520
That's no bad thing.

474
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:18,841
If your relationship is in a rut
you get bogged down.

475
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:21,523
You don't gain much from it.

476
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,523
I used to think differently.

477
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,767
Excuse me.

478
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:36,127
Düring.

479
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:41,007
Now?

480
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,167
At the office?

481
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:52,203
I'll be there in ten minutes.

482
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:00,686
I have to go.
Uwe wants a man-to-man talk.

483
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,721
I'm going out.

484
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:30,807
Uwe.

485
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:56,046
From the cafe.
To loosen our tongues.

486
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:01,005
I'm glad you've come.

487
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:13,401
Have a seat.

488
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,759
Do you want to buy a ring?

489
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:19,680
1 8-carat gold.

490
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:22,804
You can have it for a fiver.

491
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:27,358
After 1 3 years of wedlock.

492
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:31,124
Just like that.
''I've fallen for someone.''

493
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:34,845
Man, I'm 40 now.

494
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:37,569
I can't start again at my age.

495
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,086
I'm 37 myself.

496
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:44,802
Well.

497
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:49,759
-It can happen to anyone.
-She must be out of her mind. Crazy.

498
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:52,280
Don't be so hard on Ellen.

499
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:58,803
Well, you're a great moral support,
aren't you.

500
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:03,486
-Thanks a bunch.
-You expect me to boost your esteem?

501
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:05,481
I thought you'd hit me.

502
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:12,157
It's not all Ellen's fault.

503
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:16,927
-Of course not, but...
-Well then.

504
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:27,402
Katrin is furious with Ellen.

505
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:33,647
What's Katrin got to do with it?

506
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:35,561
She knows too.

507
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,805
She walked right in on us.

508
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:44,087
She caught us in the act.
I hadn't told her anything.

509
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:49,965
What a predicament.
Ridiculous really.

510
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:52,967
Damn it.

511
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:57,960
Today really tops everything.
What an awful day.

512
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:05,127
No.

513
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:14,248
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

514
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:45,365
Just give us a call.
Our number is 0 1 80 2 4 2 4 2 4.

515
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:50,045
It's 5.:00. Here's Radio 2 4.
Megahits from the last 2 4 years.

516
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:53,406
From the 2 4th floor
of the Oder Tower.

517
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:56,845
Nonstop power
from the Power Tower. Of course...

518
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:58,840
Shut your face!

519
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:25,967
Next stop.: Central Station.

520
00:55:45,649 --> 00:55:49,642
Geminis,
your day won't be a bowl of cherries.

521
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:54,237
You are at odds with yourself.
Feel misunderstood.

522
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:56,843
Pick fights with your best friends.

523
00:55:57,009 --> 00:56:00,001
Anger and frustration are in the air.

524
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:03,559
Your self-confidence
is at rock-bottom.

525
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:06,846
Your best option is to sleep in.

526
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:11,446
Stay well away from alcohol.
7: 1 6. 1 6 minutes past 7.

527
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:16,478
This is Radio 2 4 with the Magic Hour.
Good morning.

528
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:20,447
-Hi.
-Hello.

529
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:24,084
What are you doing here?

530
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:27,082
Mum's working late. She sent us.

531
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:30,366
She said she'd be home late
from work.

532
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:33,760
She told us
to come to you after school.

533
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:39,521
-That's right.
-I have my hands full. She's crazy.

534
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:42,438
I don't believe this.

535
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:47,362
I have to organize my catering.

536
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,727
Stupid cow.

537
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,760
Sorry. Give us a kiss.

538
00:56:56,529 --> 00:57:00,886
Sit there. I'll be over right away.
Do you want some lunch?

539
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:04,121
-Egg and chips.
-Curry sausage.

540
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,441
Shit!

541
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,799
Sunshine, leave the kids alone.

542
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:31,199
I'm not doing anything.

543
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:35,087
Just looking.

544
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,684
I'm not causing trouble.

545
00:57:41,649 --> 00:57:45,119
You've already caused enough trouble.

546
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:47,280
No, you have to...

547
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:52,243
-I was just...
-Stupid idiot!

548
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:55,242
I told you
to stay away from the kids.

549
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,967
Clumsy oaf!

550
00:57:57,129 --> 00:57:58,767
Get out of here!

551
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,647
Get lost!

552
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:03,361
Bastard.

553
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,328
No.

554
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:09,367
What a shame.

555
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,361
Pick that up.

556
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:14,608
Shake it off.

557
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:19,806
-It happens.
-It happens. Come on.

558
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,846
-Well.
-Look at it!

559
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:24,045
-Buy him a new book.
-Shit.

560
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,598
-Look at it.
-He can redo it.

561
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,841
Would you let your son
hand that in?

562
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:32,318
Do it again with him tonight.

563
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:34,321
I can't...

564
00:58:35,689 --> 00:58:38,442
-Who's making trouble?
-Bumble.

565
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:40,600
You could grab a towel.

566
00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:44,046
-Get me a towel!
-Bumble.

567
00:58:46,729 --> 00:58:48,447
Just stay cool.

568
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,606
-Strong and silent.
-Why should I be?

569
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:57,887
Everyone butting in.
I made a mistake. So what?

570
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:02,281
-Strong and silent.
-Why are you poking me?

571
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:06,601
You always make mistakes.
It's getting on my nerves.

572
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:37,161
Well.

573
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:44,601
This is all a bit strange, isn't it.

574
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:49,521
But still.

575
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:54,364
I felt it was high time
we talked about this.

576
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:58,008
Things can't stay as they are.

577
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,648
It's been going on a long time.

578
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,606
Quite a while now.

579
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:12,409
-Gregor.
-Go and tell him, please.

580
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:15,129
Please. We had an agreement.

581
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:23,403
Well, as I said.
We're all sensible adults here.

582
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:27,167
Enough is enough.

583
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:32,164
The situation we find ourselves in
at the moment can't continue.

584
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,320
We have two children.

585
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:36,400
We have a family.

586
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:39,208
We must sort this out somehow.

587
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,848
I don't know.

588
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,477
I'd like to hear your opinion.

589
01:00:43,649 --> 01:00:45,162
Yours, Chris.

590
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:48,002
And yours, of course, Ellen.

591
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,764
How do you want to proceed?

592
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,523
How do you plan to resolve this?

593
01:00:53,689 --> 01:00:56,522
It's been going on a good while.

594
01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:01,487
Uwe, I don't really know
what you're expecting to hear.

595
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:03,207
An answer.

596
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:06,964
I'm not promising anything.
I can't do that.

597
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:24,158
You're acting
as if we were on trial.

598
01:01:25,529 --> 01:01:30,478
But this isn't something
we planned secretly over a long time.

599
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:34,437
-It could as easily have been you.
-Hang on, Chris.

600
01:01:34,609 --> 01:01:38,318
I can understand if you slip up
and go too far.

601
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:41,049
Jump into bed together. Okay.

602
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:43,200
I can cope with that.

603
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:47,203
But if it happens regularly
as it does at the minute

604
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:49,360
I can't stand for it.

605
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:54,160
Certainly not from supposed friends.
What's the matter?

606
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:58,038
-Look, it's turned out really well.
-That's cute.

607
01:01:58,209 --> 01:02:01,679
-Mascha's a real artist.
-Lovely. Who is it?

608
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:04,522
-No one in particular.
-A lady.

609
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:09,604
But Mum and Dad have to discuss
something important right now.

610
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:13,478
We'll have time later.
Why don't you draw...

611
01:02:13,649 --> 01:02:15,287
-Katrin?
-Okay.

612
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:18,327
Thanks a lot.

613
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:30,121
-I won't stand for it.
-I feel like I'm in kindergarten.

614
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:34,038
Kindergarten?
Who started this game, anyway?

615
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,439
It certainly wasn't me.

616
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:43,400
-Sure you don't want any cake?
-No, thanks.

617
01:02:43,569 --> 01:02:46,766
-I'm not hungry.
-Here's the ashtray.

618
01:02:58,249 --> 01:03:00,319
Well, I think...

619
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:05,086
-Okay. Listen, Uwe.
-I say you stop seeing each other.

620
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,009
That would be my suggestion.

621
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:11,161
I can't promise that.

622
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:15,482
I'm not interested in talking.
It won't achieve anything.

623
01:03:15,649 --> 01:03:17,367
I can see that, pal.

624
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:19,042
I may as well go.

625
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:20,882
Go then.

626
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,600
Don't slam the door.

627
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:31,804
-I can do as I like in my own home.
-Yes, of course.

628
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:34,608
If I want to slam the door, I will.

629
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:41,967
-Does anyone want more coffee?
-No, thanks.

630
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:47,119
Only a man could react like that.
A totally male reaction.

631
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:51,724
Really,
you have to ask yourself this.

632
01:03:52,049 --> 01:03:57,521
What is a valid argument
and what role does dented pride play?

633
01:03:58,169 --> 01:04:00,399
-Yes.
-A 90% role, I'd say.

634
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:03,208
-Yes.
-Ever ask if I was happy?

635
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:06,167
-Give me compliments?
-Of course.

636
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:08,797
You criticized me
from dawn to dusk.

637
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:12,279
Now it's too late.
Something's happened.

638
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:17,403
All at once
you start playing the injured party.

639
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:24,162
I'm glad I don't have children.

640
01:04:43,529 --> 01:04:45,087
Bye.

641
01:04:58,289 --> 01:04:59,927
I think...

642
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,765
Well, I'm suddenly...

643
01:05:04,689 --> 01:05:06,919
I see him in a new light.

644
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:11,848
I...

645
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:18,000
Now I find him very attractive again.

646
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,046
It sounds crazy.

647
01:05:22,129 --> 01:05:24,689
But I can understand Ellen.

648
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:27,557
I can imagine what attracts her.

649
01:05:28,729 --> 01:05:31,721
And what she's discovered in him.

650
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:51,967
Bye, Gregor.

651
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:07,807
Bye, Mascha.

652
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,961
Bye, love.

653
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,280
-Hello.
-Bye.

654
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:10,964
Our paths were bound to cross
at some point.

655
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,721
I'm sorry.

656
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:20,360
Where are you going?

657
01:08:23,249 --> 01:08:24,967
Away somewhere.

658
01:08:31,769 --> 01:08:33,600
Please stay.

659
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:35,600
Just for a moment.

660
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:39,246
I want to know why.

661
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:43,443
I want to know what I've done.

662
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:46,123
You can tell me that at least.

663
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:52,081
-Just say what I've done wrong.
-I wish I could.

664
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:55,525
If it's my bad teeth,
I'll go to the dentist.

665
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:59,079
If you want a new kitchen,
I'll buy you one.

666
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:03,367
What the neighbours think
is more important, is it?

667
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:13,157
You've done nothing wrong.

668
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:18,999
I don't understand you.

669
01:09:20,049 --> 01:09:22,085
What's the problem?

670
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:25,208
What does he have that I don't?

671
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:28,318
Uwe, I...

672
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:31,766
-Don't touch me. Please.
-Please.

673
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:33,681
Please.

674
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,682
You made a vow to me. A pledge.

675
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:43,482
You solemnly declared,
''Till death us do part''.

676
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:46,004
Quiet. Don't get sentimental.

677
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:47,887
Let me go.

678
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:51,598
-Stop it. No.
-Please. Don't leave me.

679
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:57,122
-I won't let you go.
-You won't get me back like this.

680
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,844
This is simply ridiculous.

681
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,880
If you leave now,
don't bother coming back, stupid cow.

682
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:08,567
I understand what he says, I know.
But what can I do?

683
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:10,924
I can't change how I feel.

684
01:11:11,089 --> 01:11:12,886
I can't help it.

685
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:19,284
You can't do anything.
The feeling is there.

686
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:27,239
I can't resist it.

687
01:11:27,609 --> 01:11:29,486
I really did try.

688
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:31,805
At first I was so careful.

689
01:11:32,049 --> 01:11:36,998
I didn't know where it would lead.
It kept going further, and...

690
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:42,522
It's no longer just a flirt.

691
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:49,968
It's an opportunity for me.

692
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:53,767
Düring.

693
01:11:53,929 --> 01:11:55,521
Hello.

694
01:11:55,769 --> 01:12:00,889
Here's the information,
all the figures and a floor plan.

695
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,645
This is the kitchen.

696
01:12:05,769 --> 01:12:10,001
Big and spacious.
Plenty of room for a table and chairs.

697
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:14,368
-When did you want to move in?
-As soon as possible.

698
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:17,642
Let's look at the other apartment.

699
01:12:17,809 --> 01:12:20,323
It's not ideal in my opinion.

700
01:12:20,889 --> 01:12:23,528
-Living room.
-That's stipulated?

701
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:28,479
You could use the other room
as a living room if you so decide.

702
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:31,004
Lovely corner bathtub.

703
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,288
Great.

704
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:39,760
Hang on.
Is there a bath for grown-ups?

705
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:43,005
Stick your legs out.

706
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,964
This apartment's cosy.

707
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:49,360
-All neat and compact.
-It's a bit small.

708
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:51,281
Just three rooms.

709
01:12:51,609 --> 01:12:55,363
But the rent for this is lower
than for the other.

710
01:12:57,129 --> 01:13:00,007
You could make kitchen cabinets.

711
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:02,603
If you go to all that trouble

712
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:05,681
you have to stay here permanently.

713
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:09,401
We don't quite agree on this yet.

714
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:11,480
We'll think about it.

715
01:13:11,649 --> 01:13:14,925
Don't make a snap decision.
Sleep on it.

716
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:16,967
Why all the fuss?

717
01:13:17,129 --> 01:13:19,597
-What's up?
-You're too eager.

718
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:23,557
-It's fine. Don't spoil things.
-Too tiny for four.

719
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:26,243
Spare us your comments.

720
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:29,048
-We'll improvise.
-She wants a sale.

721
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:30,881
We must find something.

722
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:33,085
We'll come back later.

723
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,922
-Well.
-We'll think about it.

724
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:42,686
-You're exaggerating. It's fine.
-We'd burst at the seams.

725
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:54,919
What's all this about?

726
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:59,039
What are you playing at?

727
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:03,798
I'm speaking to you.

728
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:08,447
There's your stuff.
I don't want you in my room any more.

729
01:14:08,609 --> 01:14:12,522
-Where can I go?
-Get set up in the spare room.

730
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:15,157
Katrin, it's still our flat.

731
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:18,401
There's more.

732
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:20,202
Here's the perfume.

733
01:14:20,529 --> 01:14:23,407
I hope you had fun at my expense.

734
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:26,242
We didn't make fun of you at all.

735
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:29,164
Help me with this, please.

736
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:31,600
I won't give you a hand.

737
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:34,124
I'll move your stuff, then.

738
01:14:34,289 --> 01:14:38,999
-Stop this. We're still married.
-We're no longer married.

739
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:43,526
-We're still married.
-Stop flitting back and forth to her.

740
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:46,203
Our marriage isn't ruined yet.

741
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:48,929
-We haven't divorced.
-Isn't ruined?

742
01:14:49,089 --> 01:14:54,561
-Who destroyed everything we had?
-I just need a bit of time, damn it.

743
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:58,598
-All I need is a little time.
-Time. Is that so?

744
01:14:58,769 --> 01:15:01,283
-My fling with Ellen may blow over.
-I need time too.

745
01:15:01,449 --> 01:15:04,805
-But I can't promise.
-You can't promise?

746
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:08,723
You made me different promises
a few years ago.

747
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:13,679
What's the plan, anyway?

748
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:17,080
Are you going
to keep coming back home?

749
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:22,924
-Just leave and move in with her.
-I need time.

750
01:15:23,089 --> 01:15:26,843
-Go to her. Don't run back and forth.
-I can't leave.

751
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:29,807
-I need time. Don't you see?
-Wimp.

752
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:32,324
I need time. Yes, I'm a wimp.

753
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:38,045
You come home
and pretend nothing's wrong.

754
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:40,518
And then you go back to her.

755
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:48,441
I have to adapt to the situation too.

756
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:50,645
Calm down. It's okay.

757
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,721
Kiss me!

758
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:05,607
I have to pick up the goulash at 1 2.

759
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:09,445
It's high time he came.

760
01:17:09,609 --> 01:17:11,440
Here he is.

761
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:12,883
At last.

762
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:27,888
Sorry I'm late.

763
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:31,802
No doubt you've all heard the news.

764
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:34,563
There's been a serious accident

765
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:36,527
on the autobahn.

766
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:41,478
It's a miracle
that I'm standing before you.

767
01:17:42,169 --> 01:17:46,048
I really owe my life
to your local radio station.

768
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:49,724
To be precise,
the horoscope feature with Magic...

769
01:17:50,289 --> 01:17:52,007
Magic Piss.

770
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:56,321
In the horoscope for today
he strongly recommended

771
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:58,480
stopping to have a break.

772
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:01,801
I regard this as a sign from heaven.

773
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:07,522
I perceive it as confirmation
of the success of our common project.

774
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,158
The stars are smiling on it.

775
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:14,641
We believe in Frankfurt-Oder
as an industrial centre.

776
01:18:17,129 --> 01:18:19,802
Time for the official ceremony.

777
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:24,520
Mayor Hartwig. Mr. Kurzer.
Would you mind doing the honours?

778
01:18:25,249 --> 01:18:27,365
Cut the first turf here.

779
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:33,089
This wasn't planned, but...

780
01:18:35,569 --> 01:18:38,322
This job is riddled with idiots.

781
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:41,404
I propose we cut the turf.

782
01:18:41,809 --> 01:18:44,369
Let's cut the first sod now.

783
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:47,447
If you both... He's back again.

784
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:50,041
You moron.

785
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:53,485
Later.
And wipe that smile off your face.

786
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:33,079
We have to go, don't we?

787
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:38,761
Too bad.

788
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,325
Freezing cold today.

789
01:20:21,929 --> 01:20:23,567
Oh, not again.

790
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:29,363
Listen to the wind out there.

791
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:39,167
Hi, Uwe.

792
01:20:39,449 --> 01:20:42,725
What are you doing here,
Katrin, love?

793
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:47,408
I heard you talking on my way past,
so:::

794
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:51,168
What a nice surprise. How are things?

795
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:57,198
What brings you to these climes?
Lost your way?

796
01:20:57,369 --> 01:20:59,803
Laden with a rucksack, I see.

797
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,447
It's sealed.

798
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:05,999
I had to get out.
I couldn't just sit around.

799
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:10,967
Why should I wait
until his lordship deigns to come?

800
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:13,359
Let's have some music.

801
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,479
That's good. Leave it on.

802
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:23,881
I like that.

803
01:21:24,489 --> 01:21:26,445
For a change.

804
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:36,448
Did he say he wanted to come home?

805
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:40,758
No, we weren't that clear.

806
01:21:41,249 --> 01:21:43,444
Last night I was hopeful.

807
01:21:44,369 --> 01:21:48,248
I thought things were looking up.
But probably...

808
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:52,607
I'm sick of them making a fool of me.
I've had enough.

809
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:56,762
But I have to say,
it was quite an absurd situation.

810
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:00,160
I open the bathroom door
and what do I see?

811
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:02,884
The two of them in the bath!

812
01:22:04,849 --> 01:22:08,000
And I say sorry and go back out again.

813
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,528
Honest.

814
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:36,168
I've been listening to that music
for two weeks.

815
01:22:38,609 --> 01:22:41,885
-Uwe, come on.
-Watch this. Can you do that?

816
01:22:44,009 --> 01:22:46,000
You could join the circus.

817
01:22:50,449 --> 01:22:53,919
Ms. Schröder would be impressed.
I can do it.

818
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,927
So can I.

819
01:23:07,089 --> 01:23:08,681
Katrin.

820
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:19,807
Katrin, I'm sorry.

821
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:21,925
I have to talk to you.

822
01:23:25,249 --> 01:23:28,002
I've made a mess of everything.

823
01:23:28,529 --> 01:23:30,008
And then...

824
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:31,648
If I could...

825
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:35,841
Who's that?

826
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:39,204
-Chris?
-What's going on?

827
01:23:42,369 --> 01:23:46,282
Katrin said we could stay here
and do what we like.

828
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:50,278
Turn the light off, please.

829
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:52,600
Katrin said that?

830
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:54,927
Yes.

831
01:23:55,089 --> 01:23:56,761
Where is she?

832
01:23:56,929 --> 01:24:00,205
I don't know.
Please turn the light off.

833
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:04,283
That doesn't mean you can...

834
01:24:08,049 --> 01:24:09,846
Very funny.

835
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:13,927
Now they've invaded our bedroom.

836
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:23,448
A black hole of a day for you too.

837
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:26,727
A nasty lunar eclipse
mars the night.

838
01:24:26,889 --> 01:24:30,086
Venus is in reverse.
No cuddles today.

839
01:24:32,889 --> 01:24:36,643
The day is pitch black.
Everything is futile.

840
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:39,767
The Sun and Pluto are at loggerheads.

841
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:44,640
All in all a day to forget.
Expect no improvement.

842
01:24:44,809 --> 01:24:48,279
Later your energy cycle
will slump to nothing.

843
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:51,641
Someone's birthday?

844
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:53,925
-It's for you.
-For me?

845
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,920
From some car dealer.

846
01:24:56,089 --> 01:24:58,478
It might lift your spirits.

847
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:01,881
Dear Mr. Düring.

848
01:25:03,129 --> 01:25:05,324
Thanks for your horoscope.

849
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:07,320
It saved my life.

850
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:10,167
Codswallop.

851
01:25:11,569 --> 01:25:12,718
Bye.

852
01:25:13,569 --> 01:25:17,005
-Hello. Hi Mascha. Hi Gregor.
-Hello.

853
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,885
-Hi.
-Come to the table. I'm in a hurry.

854
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:23,324
-Okay.
-What's all this here?

855
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:26,128
You could clear the table.

856
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:29,326
-Must I do everything?
-We've just got in.

857
01:25:29,489 --> 01:25:31,207
Get a move on.

858
01:25:32,249 --> 01:25:33,523
Mascha?

859
01:25:34,049 --> 01:25:37,280
-Dinner's going cold.
-What is it?

860
01:25:37,449 --> 01:25:40,725
Lovely curry sausage. Tasty chips.

861
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:43,483
-Oh, no.
-Dad, not sausage.

862
01:25:43,649 --> 01:25:47,164
-What's up?
-They're coming out of our ears.

863
01:25:47,329 --> 01:25:49,718
I can't do with fussy eaters.

864
01:25:49,889 --> 01:25:52,961
With me you'll eat what you're given.

865
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:56,839
-I'm due at the dentist.
-Stone cold.

866
01:25:57,169 --> 01:26:00,605
-I don't need this hassle.
-Is there any soup?

867
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:04,125
Yes. I can't do everything at once.

868
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:06,883
I'm just warming it up now.

869
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:09,359
Well, so much for that.

870
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:11,567
Order a pizza.

871
01:26:11,729 --> 01:26:14,289
-Where's the number?
-In the kitchen.

872
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,721
-Where in the kitchen?
-I don't know. Use your eyes.

873
01:26:21,249 --> 01:26:22,887
Shit.

874
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:27,687
Hey, Dad?

875
01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:38,685
Dad, are you okay?

876
01:26:40,089 --> 01:26:42,603
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

877
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,366
Just checking.

878
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:48,447
Dad's listening down the toilet.

879
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,928
So what do you think? This is it!

880
01:27:00,009 --> 01:27:04,605
-Is the entire ceiling sloping?
-Yes. It's an attic apartment.

881
01:27:05,129 --> 01:27:08,201
In a bad mood?
Like today's horoscope.

882
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:12,324
You won't get a bed up here.

883
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:16,528
Listen. This isn't funny any more.
What's wrong with you?

884
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:19,806
-I hate this ceiling.
-This is the seventh.

885
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:24,520
-You don't want to move in with me.
-I don't want to crawl everywhere.

886
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:26,042
Let's go back down.

887
01:27:26,849 --> 01:27:29,886
-We're going downstairs.
-No problem.

888
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,166
It's not my cup of tea.

889
01:27:36,929 --> 01:27:39,045
What's wrong with you?

890
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:41,921
Nothing.

891
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:52,323
You're looking at me strangely.

892
01:28:03,089 --> 01:28:05,159
I have a funny feeling.

893
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,481
I'm sorry.

894
01:28:18,769 --> 01:28:20,441
Sorry for what?

895
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:51,927
Bye.

896
01:28:52,169 --> 01:28:53,727
Bye.

897
01:28:57,889 --> 01:28:59,447
Chris?

898
01:29:18,049 --> 01:29:21,644
One sign of bad breath is
when your spouse says,

899
01:29:21,809 --> 01:29:23,800
''You smell funny today''.

900
01:29:27,089 --> 01:29:29,808
Let's take a look in your mouth.

901
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:31,960
Open your mouth, please.

902
01:29:33,729 --> 01:29:35,720
Oh dear!

903
01:30:02,489 --> 01:30:04,366
Let's suck up this saliva.

904
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:11,088
There he is!

905
01:30:11,249 --> 01:30:14,844
Look at this.
There's a bit of root attached.

906
01:30:19,089 --> 01:30:20,078
Uwe.

907
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:23,488
Uwe.

908
01:30:25,089 --> 01:30:27,239
What are you doing here?

909
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:29,365
This won't take long.

910
01:30:30,209 --> 01:30:34,646
I came to tell you Ellen and I
have stopped seeing each other.

911
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:38,768
So?

912
01:30:41,929 --> 01:30:43,965
Best of luck, okay?

913
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,401
Hey, Chris.

914
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,048
Chris.

915
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:07,400
This one's similar.

916
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:14,999
You need to have some kind of idea
of what it is you want.

917
01:31:16,249 --> 01:31:19,844
-I mean, fresh or...
-Yes, I see. Thank you.

918
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:24,559
Let's line these up.
Which one goes where?

919
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,720
This goes here. May I?

920
01:31:28,689 --> 01:31:32,648
-Something spicier, perhaps?
-No, thank you.

921
01:31:32,809 --> 01:31:35,801
The open ones are nice.
The open notes.

922
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:40,480
I like this one.

923
01:31:42,969 --> 01:31:45,085
I need a little break.

924
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:57,968
This one has lovely packaging.

925
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:12,647
Let me know
if you'd like to try another.

926
01:32:16,849 --> 01:32:20,524
Yes, this is nice.
I'm starting to think...

927
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,325
-Thank you.
-Susanne, can you cover me?

928
01:32:31,089 --> 01:32:35,207
-Evening. I'm looking for Katrin.
-She's not here.

929
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:37,246
-She's gone?
-Yes.

930
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:22,638
Shit.

931
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:30,321
What's going on now?

932
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:35,322
Why do these damned things
always happen to me?

933
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,519
I don't believe this.

934
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:02,121
Here you are.
It's delicious.

935
01:35:16,249 --> 01:35:20,288
The electricity company
can't explain the blackout.

936
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:24,044
The Frankfurt power cut
was spookily predicted

937
01:35:24,209 --> 01:35:26,962
by Radio 2 4 presenter
Magic Chris

938
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:31,600
during his look at the stars
on yesterday morning's show.

939
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:36,399
Listeners were thrilled
by the accuracy of his prediction.

940
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:40,528
What catastrophes lie in wait today,
Magic Chris?

941
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:43,087
Well.

942
01:35:44,169 --> 01:35:46,205
Nothing exciting today.

943
01:35:47,649 --> 01:35:50,209
A special horoscope for Taureans.

944
01:35:52,449 --> 01:35:54,758
Taureans born on 8 May.

945
01:35:56,809 --> 01:35:58,800
So, here it is.

946
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:04,678
Wherever you are right now,

947
01:36:05,689 --> 01:36:09,762
you should know
that someone loves you very much.

948
01:36:10,769 --> 01:36:12,521
Someone

949
01:36:12,929 --> 01:36:16,319
who would like to come back to you.

950
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:19,447
He has severed all other ties.

951
01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:24,165
He knows that he
really messed things up.

952
01:36:24,729 --> 01:36:28,517
And he will do anything
to correct this mistake.

953
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:32,159
It was probably
the worst he ever made.

954
01:36:33,969 --> 01:36:36,529
Take courage and have a heart.

955
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:39,997
Give him a second chance.

956
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:43,520
You won't regret it.

957
01:36:45,249 --> 01:36:49,083
That was a special horoscope
due to recent events.

958
01:36:49,249 --> 01:36:53,037
This is Radio 2 4
with the hits of the last 2 4 years.

959
01:36:53,209 --> 01:36:55,803
It's 8:50, that's ten to nine.

960
01:36:56,689 --> 01:36:58,839
Good morning from Chris.

961
01:38:01,129 --> 01:38:02,608
Well?

962
01:38:14,009 --> 01:38:15,806
Do you like it?

963
01:38:30,289 --> 01:38:32,359
New kitchen, new joy.

964
01:38:37,129 --> 01:38:40,201
My Ellen.
I'm so happy you're here.

965
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:53,848
You...

966
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,363
You don't understand, do you?

967
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:07,725
You just don't get it.

968
01:39:16,649 --> 01:39:18,367
I'm leaving.

969
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,006
I'm moving out.

970
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:50,687
Ellen.

971
01:39:52,049 --> 01:39:53,687
Ellen.

972
01:40:27,049 --> 01:40:28,767
Hans-Peter!

973
01:40:32,849 --> 01:40:34,407
Easy does it.

974
01:40:43,809 --> 01:40:45,800
How did you get here?

975
01:40:52,769 --> 01:40:57,001
-Has no one called for me?
-No, no phone calls at all.

976
01:40:57,929 --> 01:41:00,045
Okay, one last try.

977
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:03,247
-Knut?
-Yeah?

978
01:41:03,409 --> 01:41:07,004
-I can't introduce you.
-Everyone knows me anyway.

979
01:41:07,169 --> 01:41:08,648
Sorry.

980
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:11,678
That was Britney Spears.

981
01:41:11,849 --> 01:41:15,205
Here is a special horoscope
for Gemini.

982
01:41:15,729 --> 01:41:18,721
Today somebody will give you a call.

983
01:41:19,649 --> 01:41:23,085
Someone you've waited for
a long time.

984
01:41:23,569 --> 01:41:26,083
That person will call... now.

985
01:41:55,169 --> 01:41:57,637
This big room
will be the living room.

986
01:41:57,809 --> 01:42:00,118
If we move in here.

987
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:03,289
So, this is the biggest room.

988
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:08,364
The stars favour a change of scene.
If you want to move, do it now.

989
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:13,683
Be brave and make your own decisions.
Don't do what people tell you.

990
01:42:13,849 --> 01:42:17,603
Pinching pennies
won't make them work harder.

991
01:42:17,769 --> 01:42:21,284
Travel to foreign lands.
Live your dreams.

992
01:42:22,009 --> 01:42:26,400
A good day for matters of the hearf.
Don't cling to the past.

993
01:42:26,569 --> 01:42:30,767
Open your eyes, look around.
You may find true love too.

994
01:42:30,929 --> 01:42:32,408
Sometimes...

995
01:42:39,569 --> 01:42:41,446
Want to come inside?

996
01:42:43,289 --> 01:42:46,406
Don't you want to come in?
It's raining.

997
01:42:46,809 --> 01:42:48,447
Come inside.

998
01:42:57,329 --> 01:43:01,083
You coming too?
Come in and listen to the music.
