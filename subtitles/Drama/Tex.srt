00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,416
              Hey, boy.

     All right, come on.

00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:56,683
         Come on, Rowdy.

5
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,326
             Whoa. Think that's
             a bear in there?

6
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,730
 It's only a rabbit.

7
00:01:11,732 --> 00:01:14,265
 You ain't never even
 seen a bear.

8
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:17,501
 Whoa.
 You got some imagination
 on you for a horse.

9
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,169
     Come on.

         "Greatest strength."

12
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,699
        It's offensive, sure.

   Bridle itches you, huh, boy?

16
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,888
                   Hungry, huh?

17
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,390
 Look, I don't got any carrots.

18
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,359
       I said, I don't got any.

19
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,330
 You got that carrot detector
 working full blast, don't you?

20
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:41,500
                       Here.

21
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:45,470
 Way you're jumping these days,
 nobody'd ever believe
 you were a cow horse.

22
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,206
           We'll ride some more
           when I get back
           from school, OK?

23
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:02,886
              Hey, Mace?
 Yeah, here.

24
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:12,461
       Hey, Mace, what happened
       to your 50 points
       before breakfast, man?

25
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:14,596
 I got to do this
 instead today.

26
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,532
 You'd better get changed
 for school
 if you're gonna make it.

27
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,300
               Do what instead?

28
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,937
 It's a questionnaire for...

29
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,406
 I ain't gonna shout.
 You come in here.

30
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,941
         I'm changing.
         You told me to change.

31
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,710
 Well, when you're done
 changing, genius.

32
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,613
 That's changed?

33
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:39,415
    Can't you tell school pants
    from riding pants?

34
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,483
 You'd better get
 yourself washed, Tex.

35
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:43,851
           Yeah, yeah.

36
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,495
 What do you want to go
 to Indiana for, anyway?

37
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,563
     Well, number one, they got
     the best basketball team

38
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,266
           in their conference,
           if not the Midwest.

39
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,636
          Number two,
          it's not in Oklahoma.

40
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,572
 And number three, I got a shot
 at a full scholarship.

41
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:11,540
            Are you defrosting?
 Just broke.

42
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,376
    It's cold in here, too.

43
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:18,746
       It's turned off.
       I haven't paid
       the gas bill in a while.

44
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:22,282
       What happened to
       all that money
       we made last summer?

45
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,884
 Oh, I blew it all
 on a fun-filled week
 in Acapulco.

46
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,753
     What the hell do you think
     happened to it?

47
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,689
    Food for us, food for Rowdy
    and Toyota, electric bill.
   OK, OK.

48
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,725
   I mean, how far do you think
   a couple of hundred bucks
   is gonna stretch?

49
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,360
 Well, Pop's coming back soon,

50
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:40,296
 now that rodeo season's
 almost over.

51
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,064
              Oh, that's been
              another big help,

52
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,932
       Pop sending home
       all that fabulous money.

53
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,968
 He did, Mace.
               Four months ago.

54
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,438
 That's not so long ago.
 He's only been gone for five.

55
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,843
  You'd better get goin'
  if you're gonna make the bus.

56
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,711
 Uh-uh. I'm gonna ride
 with Johnny. Don't worry.

57
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,313
 Pop's coming back.
 See you in school.

58
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:03,783
    <i> (motorcycle approaching)</i>

59
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:05,517
         Yo, Tex.

    Go! Let's move it!

62
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:14,892
 You're supposed to meet me
 out on the road.

63
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:18,629
 I'd like to have
 breakfast too,
 you know. Let's go.

64
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,998
              Yo, Tex, you left
              your books, man.
 Hey, there's your sister.

65
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,502
  Oh, Johnny, Cole said to tell
  you to be home by four

66
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,036
 to help him flush
 his radiator.

67
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,872
   Oh, damn. I was gonna go out
   to the gravel pits today.

68
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,673
 I'll flush out
 your radiator, baby.

69
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,142
     Hey, Tex.

70
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:14,879
 Ugh, I think his horse
 needs a bath again.

71
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,415
  Oh, no, see, that's just me.
  I'm a quarter horse by birth.

72
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,716
 Yeah? I know which part, too.

73
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,751
                See ya.

74
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,386
      That sister of yours
      is pretty and everything.

75
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:28,921
     She must be a pain to have
     around the house, though.

76
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:30,722
 Yeah, well, we was all
 thinking of pitchin' in

77
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:33,791
 and buying her a dog
 to be mean to.

78
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,926
    Tomorrow we'll be talking
    about "Paterson,"

79
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:39,462
     the epic poem Williams
     wrote about his hometown
     in New Jersey,

80
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:42,665
  which, who knows,
  may inspire one of you
  to write an epic about Bixby.

81
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,967
      Now, before you all
      race away for lunch,

82
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,503
      let me remind you
      that your book reports
      are due on Friday.

83
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,571
     And, Tex McCormick,
     I don't want to see you

84
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,873
    turning in another report
    on Smokey the Cowhorse.

85
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,009
 You've done it twice already.
            Yeah, but I read it
            both times.

86
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,144
     Well, read another book
     by the same author.

87
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,713
          You mean that guy
          wrote another book?

88
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:01,980
         In the library.

89
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,881
              Oh, wow.

90
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,566
 See you later.
               See you later.

91
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,872
           Way to go, man!

92
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:41,547
      Hey, Mace.

93
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:45,083
 Ah, the heat's back on.

94
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,218
 Yeah, I went down
 and took care of it.

95
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,588
      Good. Sure wasn't
      looking forward to
      burning up the furniture.

96
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:54,991
                    Food.

97
00:08:57,227 --> 00:09:01,629
   You left school early today,
   huh? You feel all right?

98
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:03,664
 Yeah.
 I just cut the afternoon.

99
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,466
             Mr. Supergrand cut
             a day's school?

100
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:09,068
       I guess that makes it OK
       for me to cut, huh?

101
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,636
 I guess it don't.

102
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,907
        So, did you go fishing?

103
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,975
 No, I didn't go fishing.

104
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:25,013
      I'm gonna go out the back
      and get Rowdy and Toyota
      workin' on some oats.

105
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,981
   If they don't get fed pretty
   soon, I'm tellin' ya,

106
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,650
       they're gonna be tearin'
       down the fence.
       They ain't there.

107
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,685
    Well, if they're out
    in the pasture,
    I'd better get 'em in here.

108
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,853
       I sold 'em.

109
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,922
              No, you didn't.

110
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:39,190
 Yeah, I did, and I got
 a good price for 'em, too.

111
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,865
     I'm gonna give you
     another chance, Mason.

112
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:25,768
         Where are them horses?
 I told you already.
 I sold 'em.

113
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,771
 I don't know why you think
 I'd start lying to you
 this late in life.

114
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:31,306
 Don't you ever close doors?
 No wonder I can't pay
 the gas bill.

115
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:35,076
         Who'd you sell 'em to?
 I ain't gonna tell you.

116
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,146
 Those people bought a horse.
 They didn't pay to have
 some kid come bothering them.

117
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:41,914
            Mace, Rowdy's mine.

118
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,082
    You just can't sell
    something that isn't yours.

119
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:49,187
   You can't live
   on no money, either.

120
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,889
   They got a good home.
   I made sure of that.

121
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,557
   Now, they're gone,
   so shut up about it.

122
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,292
       Mason, you'd just better
       get those horses back.

123
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,327
 I ain't getting them back!

124
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,195
 We couldn't have kept feeding
 them much longer anyway.

125
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,597
 Either they would've starved
 to death or we would.

126
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:04,032
 Just shut up about it.
     You get those horses back.

127
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,101
 I ain't getting them back.

128
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:10,837
 Texas, you better quit it!

129

  but you never could fight
  worth a damn.

131
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,900
                   Come on.

132
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,802
 I'm gonna get my horse back.
      You ain't gonna find him!
      I told ya!

133
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,403
 If Pop was here, he wouldn't
 have let you sell them!

134
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:52,173
    If Pop was here, I wouldn't
    have had to sell them!
    That's the point!

 and Bob's room.

268
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,423
                 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah.

269
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,858
                Boy or girl?
 It's a boy.

270
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,626
                     Ah.

271
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,638
      I'm sitting there, right?
      And this nurse comes in.

272
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,342
  She goes, "Hey, are you gonna
  be like her coach in there?"

273
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,710
      And I says, "Her coach?"

274
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,745
 I says, "What is this now?
 A sport or something?"

275
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:10,048
 "We compete against
 the other moms, see who
 can have their kid first?"

276
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,450
 I said, "No way, baby. I'm
 sitting in that waiting room,

277
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:14,084
 and I'm gonna read
 some old <i> Time</i> magazine

278

 You get caught in a storm
 on the way?

 You're just lucky she didn't
 have it loaded with ink
 this time.

282

 No, what he's lucky is that I

       Mom and Pop had?

400
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:42,954
         Right before she died?

401
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,956
         She ended up walking
         out there in the snow.

402
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:53,028
        I could hear 'em
        shouting at each other.

403
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,329
  Tex, you couldn't
  remember that.

404
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,096
  You weren't even
  three years old.

405
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:01,032
         I remember it anyway,
         or I sort of remember.

406
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,202
         I'm tellin' ya,
         everybody was so tall.

407
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:09,071
       I wanted to go out there
       and stop it,

408
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:12,140
        but I couldn't reach up
        to the door knob.

409
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:14,341
       And after that,
       I don't remember it all.

410
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,312
 Well, there's not much
 to remember.

411
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:23,582
 She stayed out there a couple
 of hours and came back in.

412
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:25,584
 A few days later, the doctor
 said she had pneumonia

413
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,952
 and put her in the hospital.

414
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:32,322
   A few more days
   and that was it.

415
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,694
      I'm gonna get some sleep.

416
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,699
 You think you can you get
 undressed by yourself?

417
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:47,367
         Yeah, I'm fine.

418
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,246
        <i> (car door slams)</i>

419
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,250
          Oh, my head!

420
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,493
 Mace, Bob and Johnny
 both came home drunk
 last night.

421
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,193
    Oh, no.

422
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,462
 I'd like to know why.

423
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,530
      Well, they were drinking,
      I imagine.

424
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:01,332
    I know Bob,

425
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:04,601
 and I'm not sending him
 to college to be an idiot.

426
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:06,769
 Now, we've got that straight.

427
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:09,772
 Now, Bob wouldn't get drunk,
 and if he did,
 he wouldn't drive.

428
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,441
 And he sure as hell
 wouldn't let Johnny drink.

429
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:16,444
   Well, except for them coming
   home drunk last night like
   you said, that sounds fine.

430
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:18,546
 Somebody got 'em drunk.
                     Wasn't me.

431
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:20,580
    I happen to be in training,

432
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:23,182
         which means I'm in bed
         every night by 10:00.

433
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:25,217
      I wouldn't touch a beer
      if I was dying of thirst.

434
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,187
       Why don't you ask Robert
       what happened?
             I did.

435
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:30,721
      He said it was his fault.

436
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:33,123
       Says he took them over
       to some party somewhere.

437
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,425
 Well, maybe he's
 telling the truth.

438
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:37,727
 He does that sometimes.
 Keeps you guessing.

439
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:40,429
       Now, don't you get smart
       with me, Mason.

440
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,064
       I'd like to talk to Tex,
       if you don't mind.

441
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:45,499
 Yeah, well, I do mind.

442
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,535
 I mind a lot,
 as a matter of fact.

443
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:51,404
 Don't you have enough kids
 of your own to hassle?

444
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:54,740
        How old are you, Mason?
 18. I'll be 19 this summer.

445
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:57,809
    I haven't seen your Pop
    around here much this year.

446
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:01,078
 His work requires him
 to travel.

447
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,579
 What is this call?
 The census?

448
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,582
 Two boys living out here alone
 without the sign of an adult.

449
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:09,184
  Now, that's really something.

450
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:12,720
 I bet the state welfare people
 would like to know about this.

451
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:16,290
   And if anybody was to call
   at County Juvenile Bureau...

452
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:18,191
 If everybody was to mind
 their own business,

453
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:19,592
 we'd be doing just fine.

454
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:21,594
          I would appreciate it
          if the two of you

455
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:24,496
 didn't associate with my kids
 from now on.

456
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,664
   Well, you tell that to them.

457
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:35,705
   I don't believe that stuff.
   Not associate with his kids!

458
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:37,073
   Probably afraid
   we're gonna corrupt 'em all.

459
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:45,646
         from dirty magazines
         to 3.2-beer in my face
         my whole life!

                <i> (Tex whimpers)</i>

461
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:50,582
             Tex?

462
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,188
 You lose something?

463
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,756
   It's sort of nice down here.

464
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,326
     It's kinda cool and quiet.

465
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,861
 Oh, well, maybe you'd like
 to come have breakfast
 under the kitchen table,

466
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:09,330
 so you'll be on time
 to get under the school bus.

467
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,799
          You'd like that,
          wouldn't you?

468
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:24,709
        Anyway, I can't make it
        to school today.

469
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:28,111
  I woke up sick. I think I got
  a 24-hour virus or something.

470
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:31,346
 You got an 80-proof hangover,
 that's what you got.

471
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:33,314
       I can't make it
       through a day of school.

472
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,749
   Everything's spinning around
   in here.

473
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:37,851
 Well, then maybe you'll
 sit still for once.

474
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:41,588
 Tex, I don't want you
 missing any more school.

475
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,690
 You hear what Cole said about
 that Juvenile Authority
 and all that?

476
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:46,158
 You think that ain't for real?

477
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:50,561
 You're a minor without
 a guardian, remember?

478
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:52,362
             I thought you were
             my guardian.

479
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,563
 As far as the damned court
 is concerned,

480
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:56,731
 I'm as underage as you are.

481
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,634
             How about if we go
             to Indiana, then?

482
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:03,637
 Nobody said nothing
 about "we" going to Indiana.

483
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,574
 I don't even know
 if I'm going.

484
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:12,411
 Coach sent them that film
 and I haven't heard
 a damn thing.

485
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,546
        They're gonna want you,
        though. I know that.

486
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:17,549
           You're probably
           the best high school
           basketball player...

487
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,784
    Tex, I'm trying
    to explain to you.

488
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:23,888
    We are not both
    going to Indiana.
              Why can't I come?

489
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,725
 Because what am I
 supposed to do with you
 when I'm going to college?

490
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:29,793
 Where are you gonna live?
 In my locker?

491
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:34,730
 So you're gonna go
 and I'm gonna stay here?
 That's the deal, huh?

492
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,365
         Nobody's going nowhere
         if you bring a couple
         dozen social workers

493
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,667
             down on our necks.

494
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:42,736
     Grow some brains, will ya?

495
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,471
     You want to stay off
     some youth farm somewhere?

496
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:47,207
         Start thinking ahead
         five minutes at a time
         now and then.

497
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:48,541
 That's all you
 care about, huh?

498
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:52,577
 Is going off and being
 a big basketball star.

499
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,646
    Well, it beats staying here
    and being a screwup.

500
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,549
           OK, guys, that's it.

501
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,751
     OK, I like it.

502
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:12,886
    Oh, you added some color
    to it, I see. Good.

503
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:16,756
        Just be careful
        when you're gluing it.

504
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:22,327
     Nice. Nice texture.
     Oh, yeah, I like it a lot.

505
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,562
  Smooth that out a little bit.

506
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:26,897
             How's this coming?
 <i> (girl)</i> Fine.

507
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:29,799
 That's good. Very good design.
 I like that.

508
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:48,450
    <i> (teacher)</i> Good. I really
     like how it's taking shape.

509
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,018
              That's just fine.

510
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:07,935
          Grade it, quick!

511
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:10,805
         It's going fast.
         You'd better grade it.

512
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,682
 Tex, setting fire to school
 property is not a little joke.

513
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,884
 I don't care what
 that property happens to be.

514
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:26,620
 Now, what if something on
 that desk had caught on fire,

515
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:28,622
 or somebody's clothes?

516
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:29,990
                  Yes, ma'am.

517
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,559
 Were you angry
 with Mrs. Germanie

518
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,694
 because you thought you
 couldn't do a good sculpture?

519
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,163
       No, I don't think
       there was any psychology
       involved in here

520
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:39,964
  if that's what you're asking.

521
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:42,599
      I just think my sculpture
      looked better on fire.

522
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:44,567
         Tex...
             No, ma'am, really.

523
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,036
  If you'd have seen it,
  you'd probably agree with me.

524
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:55,976
 How are you and your brother
 getting along?
           We're doing great.

525
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:58,945
   Mason, you know, he's always
   after me about eating right

526
00:40:58,947 --> 00:41:01,480
   and studying and everything.

527
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:03,915
      Have you heard
      from your dad?

528
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:08,085
        Oh, Pop, yeah. Yeah,
        well, when he goes away
        on one of his trips

529
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:10,020
         - which he doesn't
         go for long -

530
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:11,955
         but, you know,
         when he does go away,

531
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:13,957
     he always makes sure
     he sticks a little note in

532

882

 Well, you're not the boy

883

 See, uh... it was an accident.

885
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:03,996
            He wasn't supposed
            to sell him,
            but he didn't know.

886
01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:06,131
  Well, we knew
  we were buying him.

887
01:06:07,299 --> 01:06:09,933

 fair and square.

888

                   I know.

 So he's my horse now.

890
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:26,446

 to ride him western?
                     Yeah.

891
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:29,415
 I ride him jumping.
 He really seems to like it.

892
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,717
       I used to jump him.

893
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,987
    We used to go out
    in the fields, though.
    We used to jump big logs.

894
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:39,456
         I showed him at a show
         a couple of weeks ago.

895
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,692
     Yeah? How'd he do?
 He took a third.

896
01:06:44,695 --> 01:06:46,729
           I had a pony before,
           but he died.

897
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,600
 He's really been a good horse,

898
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:53,602
    once we got a little weight
    off him

899
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:55,370
  and we got his coat in shape.

900
01:06:55,372 --> 01:06:57,538
   He's real smart for his age.

901
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,511
 Never did much show-riding
 with him.

902
01:07:04,513 --> 01:07:07,480
         I didn't think
         I'd want another horse
         until I got him.

 the same thing we did.

01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,018
 for a couple of weeks.

936
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,954
      It doesn't matter anyway.
      Indiana never sent
      that application.

937
01:11:34,956 --> 01:11:37,623
 Yep. Deadline's next week.

938
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:41,627
 I'm sorry, Mace.
 You deserved it if anyone did.

939
01:11:41,629 --> 01:11:43,795
       Yeah, well,
       I guess a full ride was
       a pretty steep order

940
01:11:43,797 --> 01:11:46,764
      for a Bixby farm boy.

941
01:11:46,766 --> 01:11:50,267
       Oh, hey, Tex,
       you wanna trade clothes
       and shoot a few baskets?

942
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:52,302
    Sure, Mace.
      Take it easy now.

943
01:11:52,304 --> 01:11:55,505
   You're not gonna be good
   to anybody with a messed-up
   right arm.

944
01:11:55,507 --> 01:11:57,707
              Is this your boy?
    Don't know yet.

945
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:00,476
 Depend on how much
 he's gonna cost me.

946
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:03,846
  I didn't know a quarter horse
  like you'd come up
  with such a lanky racer.

947
01:12:03,848 --> 01:12:05,881
 His mama was a thoroughbred.

948
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:08,650
    That's it. Just keep it in.

949

   We got time for a Coke
   or something.

954
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:33,769
    They sell Cokes round here?

 Well, you had a Coke at
 the game, and I ain't thirsty.

 if you aren't thirsty?

01:13:28,587 --> 01:13:30,987
          I don't know.
          It feels kinda weird.

959
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:33,589
         Yeah.

960
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:39,960

961
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:43,896
            I think I love you.

962
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:46,831
    I think me too.

963
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,920
             What's the matter?
 I'm not ready for that,
 and I mean it.

964
01:14:10,922 --> 01:14:12,855
        What did you let me get
        started for, then?

965
01:14:12,857 --> 01:14:15,924
 How was I supposed to know
 you were gonna be in such
 an all-fire hurry?

966
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:17,659
 I was curious.
           Curious?

967
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:20,827
      I'm burning up over here,
      and you're curious.

968
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:25,030
 Tex, right now I think
 you're the only boy

969
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:28,099
 I'll ever feel this way about.
 But how am I supposed to know?

970
01:14:29,601 --> 01:14:32,536
 I mean, this last year
 has been so crazy.

971
01:14:32,538 --> 01:14:34,704
 One minute I hate everybody
 and if they don't like me,

972
01:14:34,706 --> 01:14:35,871
 they can just go jump.

973
01:14:35,873 --> 01:14:39,140
 And then the next minute,
 I love everybody

974
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:42,676
 and I'm scared that maybe
 they don't love me back.

975
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,077
 Well, I don't know.
 Maybe Cole's right.

976
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,812
 Maybe I am too young to get
 messed around and stuff,

977
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,414
 but I tell you,
 I'm confused enough these days

978
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:49,915
 without throwing sex
 in the deal.

979
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,617
      I wasn't thinking of this
      as just sex.

980
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:09,833
   How about when we get older?

981
01:15:09,835 --> 01:15:11,935
     Maybe we could get married
     or something.

982
01:15:13,137 --> 01:15:15,438
 I can see me marrying you.

983
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,973
                     You could?
 Yeah.

984
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,675
 It would last about a year.

      It's like
      that fortune teller said.

988

          this is worth it?

990
01:15:57,905 --> 01:15:59,739
 They're not gonna find out
 who did it.

991
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:02,208
 Even if they do,
 what are they gonna do?

992
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:04,510
 Send us down the principal's
 office for a lecture?

 but believe me,
 there is life after finals.

 So let's get everything
 off our desks

 Hello, Mr. Collins.

      Mrs. Johnson.

1011
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,036
    I might've known
    you'd be behind this.

1012

    Ever since the first day
    you came around,

1013

    I knew you'd be trouble
    for Johnny.

1014
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:27,175
    And I've been getting awful
    sick of you getting Johnny

      in all these messes.

1016

        just as sick of Johnny
        getting Tex into 'em.

1017
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:34,047
 I'd say it's 50-50.
            Well, hello, Mason.

1018
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:36,182
    I don't recall inviting you
    to this meeting.

1019
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:37,950
  Don't you have a class
  you're supposed to be in now?

1020
01:17:37,952 --> 01:17:39,786
 I didn't know
 if my dad was coming.

1021
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,254
                She called him.
                He'll be here.

1022
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:44,189
             Tell me the truth.
             Was this your idea
             or Johnny's?

1023
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:48,726
 Yeah, and the time they
 threw that shopping cart

1024
01:17:48,728 --> 01:17:50,894
    off that roof
    into that swimming pool,

1025
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:52,896
 that was Johnny's idea,
 as I recall.

1026
01:17:54,298 --> 01:17:56,065
     I told you this friendship

1027
01:17:56,067 --> 01:17:58,901
           was just gonna keep
           lousing you up.

1028
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:02,203
  Now, I want you to promise me
  that you'll end it right now.

1029
01:18:03,004 --> 01:18:05,038
      No.
                  What?

1030
01:18:05,372 --> 01:18:06,972
    No, sir.

1031

      Mr. Collins,
      just so you'll know,

1032
01:18:09,443 --> 01:18:13,011
    I'm gonna suspend
    both of these boys
    for the next three days.

     their quarter finals
     next week,

1034
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:18,282
 but I'm gonna take 10 points
 off each of the tests,

1035
01:18:18,284 --> 01:18:20,250
   and I'm gonna recommend
   that the high school

1036
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:22,385
 put them in separate classes
 next year.

1037
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:25,988
 Well, I would think that's
 the least you'd wanna do.

1038
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,789
 When I get this one home,
 I'm planning on

1039
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:31,992
 taking a lot more away
 from him than just
 10 points on a test.

1040
01:18:31,994 --> 01:18:33,793
  You come with me.

 I been keeping myself at home,
 taking care of my family.

1044
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,009
 You ought to try
 that sometime,

1045
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:55,811
 if the demand
 for rodeo clowns slows up.

      on some typewriter keys.

 Start the day off
 with a bang, huh?

1054
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:20,929
 Yeah, that sounds like
 one of them crazy things

1055

      cause this much trouble.

1061
01:19:40,347 --> 01:19:43,915
 because there are gonna be
 no more free chances for you.

 expelled you today?

1063
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,186
 Yeah, that's right.
 And I've considered it before,

1064
01:19:49,188 --> 01:19:52,489
 but I haven't done it
 because I like you.

1065
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:54,891
 But I also like having
 a halfway decent school here,

1066
01:19:54,893 --> 01:19:58,326
 and if you make me choose,
 I'm gonna choose the school,
 now, aren't I?

01:19:58,328 --> 01:19:59,460
                    Yeah.

01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,969
 Mr. Kencaide, over at
 the Kencaide Quarter
 Horse Ranch,

1070
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:12,537
  he called up here
  a couple days ago,

1071
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:15,172
 asking about hiring some kids
 for summers and after school.

1072
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:17,474
 Does that interest you?

1073
01:20:17,476 --> 01:20:20,443
 Now, he made it very clear
 he's not looking
 for any bronco busters,

1074
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:24,013
 just somebody to look
 after the horses.

1075
01:20:24,015 --> 01:20:25,948
   And for some
   godforsaken reason,

1076
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,984
   I thought you might
   behave responsibly
   in a job like that.

1077
01:20:28,986 --> 01:20:31,385
 What do you think?
          Yeah, it might be
          all right.

1078
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:36,055
 Just don't make me sorry
 I recommended you.

1079
01:20:36,057 --> 01:20:38,857
       Well, I take horses
       real serious.

1080
01:20:40,093 --> 01:20:43,961
 I hope there's something
 you take seriously.

1081
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:46,496
      Because it may be
      the only thing
      that'll save you.

1082
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,301
 OK, you heard my punishment.

1083
01:20:52,303 --> 01:20:56,071
 You can go on home now.
 Take your family with you.

1084
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,177
    <i> (Pop)</i> Now, Mason, you know
     better than that.

1085
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:05,512
 I was never one to stay around
 town and go to PTA meetings.

1086
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:07,480
 <i> (Mace)</i> OK, so you
  can't take Tex serious,

1087
01:21:07,482 --> 01:21:09,949
 You don't care
 what happens to him.
              <i> (Pop)</i> Yes, I do.

1088
01:21:09,951 --> 01:21:11,383
       <i> (Mace)</i> Well, how do you
        think I feel

1089
01:21:11,385 --> 01:21:13,985
  when I see you be nice to him
  like he's some damn puppy?

1090
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:18,589
     What's gonna happen
     when I go away? Make it
     easier on me, at least!

1091
01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:21,324
     He's my brother,
     even if he's not your son.

1092
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:25,927
 Who told you that?

1093
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:28,996
         Nobody had to tell me.

1094
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:32,031
        I know when you went
        to prison and I know
        when Tex's birthday is.

1095
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:35,934
        Is that true, Pop?
 Tex, listen...

1096
01:21:35,936 --> 01:21:37,835
         <i> (Mason)</i> Tex, I didn't
          mean it like that.

1097
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,438
 I'm gonna split.
 I'll see you guys later.

1098
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:48,077
 Jesus, Mace.

1099
01:21:55,284 --> 01:21:57,485
       Hey, Tex! Tex! Hey, kid!

1100
01:21:58,553 --> 01:21:59,886
                           Hey!

1101
01:22:03,857 --> 01:22:06,091
   Man, where are you going to?

1102
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:07,559
 Wherever you're going, Lem.

1103
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:09,494
         Well, that's OK by me
         'cause I'm bored, man.

1104
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:11,429
          Let's get outta here.

1105
01:22:30,915 --> 01:22:34,050
 Can't you make this thing
 go any faster?

1106
01:22:34,052 --> 01:22:36,619
                          Yeah.
       Let's do it.

1107
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:45,026
 Now, back there, I was looking
 for Dwayne Kirkpatrick,

1108
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:49,029
     trying to buy some of that
     third-generation homegrown
     he's got.

1109
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:51,965
          You seen him?
 No.

1110
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,668
  I get a hundred bucks a lid
  for that stuff in Tulsa, man.

1111
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:00,005
  Hey, I gotta make a stop here
  on the way home.
 Make it.

1112
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:03,174
  Well, actually, you know,
  I'd kinda like it
  if you went in there with me.

1113
01:23:03,176 --> 01:23:05,142
         A couple of deliveries
         got switched around,

1114
01:23:05,144 --> 01:23:07,310
         and I gotta go explain
         to these guys.

1115
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:09,278
          And, you know,
          I think it'd be smart

1116
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,647
        if I didn't go in there
        by myself.

1117
01:23:11,649 --> 01:23:14,116
      I don't care.

1118
01:23:14,118 --> 01:23:17,519
     Be nice if you looked
     a little meaner, you know?
     <i> (chuckles)</i>

1119
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:19,487
         But I think it's gonna
         work out OK.

1120
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:22,556
         If there's any hassle,
         we'll just split.

1121
01:23:22,558 --> 01:23:24,991
 You must have burned
 these guys pretty bad?

1122
01:23:24,993 --> 01:23:28,127
   Burned 'em? Who do you think
   you're talking to, man?

1123
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:31,396
          A nice guy like me?
          It's just a mix-up,

1124
01:23:31,398 --> 01:23:34,031
 you know, like when a computer
 sends you a bill

1125
01:23:34,033 --> 01:23:36,233
       by mistake or something.
       I'll work it out.

1126
01:23:36,235 --> 01:23:38,368
 If there is any hassle,
 they'll be sorry,

1127
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,603
 'cause I really feel like
 making somebody sorry.

1128
01:23:43,006 --> 01:23:45,107
     Kid, I like your attitude.

1129
01:24:10,099 --> 01:24:11,999
            Hey, man.

1130
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:15,535
 I was starting to wonder
 about you. Who's your friend?

1131
01:24:15,537 --> 01:24:18,203
   He's a connection from out
   in Dixie, man. He's cool.

1132
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,608
  Tex, this is Kelly.
  Kelly, Tex.

1133
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:25,342
                     Tex.

1134
01:24:27,712 --> 01:24:30,080
        Would you excuse us?

1135
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:33,283
     Why don't you just
     make yourself at home?

1136
01:24:33,285 --> 01:24:35,585
 Hey, man, I'm really sorry
 about this mix-up.

1137
01:24:35,587 --> 01:24:38,087
             Mix-up? Hey, man,
             don't come in here

1138
01:24:38,089 --> 01:24:42,224
      talking about any mix-up.
      You owe us.

1139
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:44,125
         Hey, man, I thought
         we were pretty square.

1140
01:24:44,127 --> 01:24:45,659
 I don't know
 how you got that.

1141
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:48,528
 I mean, I don't think
 you're quite aware

1142
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,296
 how things are done
 around here.

1143
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:53,999
 Now, you're not hanging out
 in some schoolyard
 out in cowtown.

1144
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:57,167
 Now, those kids
 out there, man,

1145
01:24:57,169 --> 01:24:59,002
 you give them something
 gives them a headache

1146
01:24:59,004 --> 01:25:00,436
 and they think
 they're getting high.

1147
01:25:00,438 --> 01:25:03,405
 But this is Tulsa,
 and we got ways
 of doing things.

1148
01:25:03,407 --> 01:25:05,273
                I know that.
     I mean...

1149
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:08,109
 Man, you come into town
 and ten minutes later,

1150
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:09,710
 you're everybody's
 best friend.

1151
01:25:09,712 --> 01:25:13,013
 And then ten minutes
 after that,
 you're pulling a burn.

1152
01:25:13,015 --> 01:25:14,581
 I don't like it.

1153
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:17,116
      You know, Kelly, I admire
      this sense of high drama

1154
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,017
              that you have
              in your life now,
              but you're crazy.

1155
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:21,285
 I mean, man, I didn't expect
 you to come through that door

1156
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:23,520
 without a couple of ounces
 of clean crystal, right,

1157
01:25:23,522 --> 01:25:26,256
 and not some garbage
 about a mix-up.

1158
01:25:26,258 --> 01:25:27,790
        An honest mistake, man.
        Now, look...

1159
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:30,259
 You look, man. You come around
 here with some samples

1160
01:25:30,261 --> 01:25:32,160
 and then you come back
 with the delivery,

1161
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:34,061
 and that delivery is crap.

1162
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:37,030
 Now, that is no mix-up, man.
 That's a burn!

1163
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:38,564
 What do you think
 we are, man? Stupid?

1164
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:42,334
 We have been waiting
 a week, man.
         Keep it down, man.

1165
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:44,135
    What's going on, man?

1166
01:25:44,137 --> 01:25:47,372
 Listen,
 I'm getting outta here.
 This guy's nuts.

1167
01:25:47,374 --> 01:25:49,674
              What do you think
              you're doing?

1168
01:25:49,676 --> 01:25:51,475
          I told you already.
          I'm leaving.

1169
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:53,343
 Then he's gonna narc.
 He's gonna narc.

1170
01:25:53,345 --> 01:25:54,844
       Oh, he's not gonna narc,
       Kelly. Come on, man.

1171
01:25:54,846 --> 01:26:00,382
<i> (Lem)</i> Kelly, Kelly, it's cool.
 Really. Come on, man.

1172
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,417
 All right, now,
 hold it right there.

1173
01:26:05,854 --> 01:26:07,654
             Jesus Christ, man.

1174
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,626
            <i> (gunshot)</i>

1175
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:23,801
 <i> (Kelly's friend)</i> Oh, hey,
  look, man. It's cool, OK?

1176
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,770
 Everything's cool.
 I mean, we'll be cool,

1177
01:26:26,772 --> 01:26:29,839
    and you be cool.
    Just leave, OK?

1178
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:33,775
    I'm gonna kill him.

1179
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:35,843
      Tex, come on, man,
      you don't wanna kill him.

1180
01:26:35,845 --> 01:26:37,644
          Let's just split.
          Let's get outta here.

1181
01:26:37,646 --> 01:26:40,412
  Not till I settle up
  with him.
      You have settled up, Tex.

1182
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,414
           Texas, come on, man,
           let's go.

1183
01:26:59,296 --> 01:27:00,896
       OK, we're leaving.

1184
01:27:09,372 --> 01:27:12,707
             You wanna stop us,
             you're both dead.

1185
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:18,411
 It's OK. It's cool.
 Everything's OK. It's cool.

1186
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:24,350
 That's a nice bunch of friends
 you hang out with.

1187
01:27:24,352 --> 01:27:26,685
    Ah, jeez, Tex, man. What if
    he hadn't have missed you?

1188
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:28,353
 But he didn't.

1189
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:35,826
          Oh, my God, man.

1190
01:27:55,245 --> 01:27:57,879
             <i> (Lem)</i> Great, man.
              This is fantastic.

1191
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,714
            What am I gonna do?

1192
01:28:01,383 --> 01:28:03,684
 What do you got
 to be mad about, Lem?

1193
01:28:03,686 --> 01:28:06,820
          Man, I got to get you
          to a hospital.

1194
01:28:06,822 --> 01:28:08,288
    They're gonna ask all kinds
    of questions,

1195
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,722
   they're gonna call the cops.

1196
01:28:15,528 --> 01:28:17,428
        What if they wanna look
        in the car, man?

1197
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,630
      I got stuff in the trunk.

1198
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:22,666
 Come on, man,
 get the hell outta here.

1199
01:28:22,668 --> 01:28:24,834
 Hey, man, what are
 you doing, Tex?

1200
01:28:24,836 --> 01:28:27,269
 Tex, what are you doing, man?

1201
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:30,838
                Get outta here!

1202
01:28:39,513 --> 01:28:41,313
        <i> (drops in coins)</i>

1203
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:08,439
 <i> Hello?</i>

1204
01:29:09,507 --> 01:29:13,810
     Hi, Jamie. It's Tex. Um...

1205
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:14,977
 <i> Yeah?</i>

1206
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:22,416
              I can't remember
              my phone number.

1207
01:29:22,418 --> 01:29:24,785
         Do you... I don't know
         my own number.

1208
01:29:29,523 --> 01:29:32,758
         Do you...
         Do you know my number?
 <i> Tex...</i>

1209
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,559
 <i> Tex, are you drunk</i>
 <i> or something?</i>

1210
01:29:36,762 --> 01:29:39,863
  No, I just got shot.
  Listen, I gotta talk to Mace.

1211
01:29:41,098 --> 01:29:43,499
 <i> Did you say you got shot?</i>

1212
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:46,802
       Yeah, one of Lem's
       doper friends, you know?

1213
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:50,338
 <i> (Cole) Tex, is this some kind</i>
 <i> of a joke or something?</i>

1214
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:54,040
   Uh, no, sir.
   Listen, can I talk to Jamie?

1215
01:29:55,008 --> 01:29:56,975
    <i> (Cole) Tex, where are you?</i>

1216
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,515
     Um... I'm over
     at the shopping center

1217
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:07,583
    across the street from...

1218
01:30:09,586 --> 01:30:12,687
 It's the hotel that looks like
 the castle, you know?

1219
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,923
<i> (Cole) Tex, hang up the phone.</i>

1220
01:30:58,465 --> 01:30:59,565
                   Tex!

1221
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,801
     Come on, man. Come on.

1222
01:31:02,803 --> 01:31:05,436
     Come on, let's get you
     to a doctor, man.

1223
01:31:06,471 --> 01:31:07,704
     Come on.

1224
01:31:26,657 --> 01:31:28,691
     Is Tex McCormick here?

1225
01:31:41,938 --> 01:31:45,173
 How much blood has he had?
                      1500cc's.

1226
01:31:45,175 --> 01:31:48,042
        We're taking the x-rays
        to surgery, Doctor.

1227
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:50,577
                 Surgery ready?
 <i> (man)</i> Yeah, they just called.

1228
01:31:52,646 --> 01:31:53,979
           Hey, Mace.

1229
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,117
     I don't hate you, man.

1230
01:32:03,187 --> 01:32:04,954
        I don't hate you.

1231
01:32:07,123 --> 01:32:08,456
               I...

1232
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:41,788
 We got some signs
 of life here, Mace.

1233
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,791
 Hey, I want a Coke.
               He's OK.

1234
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,058
           Hey.
           Don't move your arm.

1235
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,527
              You're gonna pull
              that thing loose.

1236
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:50,529
 What is this?
         That's to help you
         grow some more blood.

1237
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:52,531
       You lost a lot of it.
       Just lay it down
       and be still now.

1238
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,199
      Relax. That's a boy.

1239
01:32:57,169 --> 01:33:00,571
             Hey, look, Tex.
             I'm gonna hold off

1240
01:33:00,573 --> 01:33:02,539
          on that college stuff
          for a while.

1241
01:33:03,741 --> 01:33:05,641
          A year or two, maybe.

1242
01:33:06,876 --> 01:33:09,510
             Pop's got a lot of
             traveling to do,

1243
01:33:09,512 --> 01:33:10,911
        and I can't exactly see
        leaving you

1244
01:33:10,913 --> 01:33:13,947
             while you're still
             in high school.

1245
01:33:13,949 --> 01:33:16,549
     So anyway, you'll be stuck
     with me for a little while
     longer.

1246
01:33:16,551 --> 01:33:20,051
 Mace, how about giving me
 and Tex a little time here,
 will you?

1247
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,620
             Yeah, I'll get you
             that Coke.

1248
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:29,090
     I wanna tell you
     about your mama, Texas.

1249
01:33:29,092 --> 01:33:30,925
 Aw, look, you don't
 have to, Pop.

1250
01:33:30,927 --> 01:33:36,163
    I figure the truth will be
    a lot better than
    what you might be thinking.

1251
01:33:36,165 --> 01:33:41,901
  Now, about this bootlegging
  business I got mixed up with.

1252
01:33:41,903 --> 01:33:44,870
        Now, Clare never wanted
        to have anything
        to do with that.

1253
01:33:44,872 --> 01:33:46,171
            She'd just say,
            "Sooner or later,

1254
01:33:46,173 --> 01:33:48,773
      sure as hell,
      you're gonna get caught."

1255
01:33:48,775 --> 01:33:51,041
            She was right.

1256
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:54,310
  They busted me
  when Mace was just about two.

1257
01:33:54,312 --> 01:33:57,913
 So when you were in prison
 she was out screwing around?

1258
01:33:57,915 --> 01:34:00,982
     Don't talk about your mama
     that way, boy.

1259
01:34:00,984 --> 01:34:03,284
     She was 19, she was alone.

1260
01:34:04,919 --> 01:34:07,787
      I was sitting in prison
      with my back to the wall.

1261
01:34:07,789 --> 01:34:10,790
           That was real smart,
           wasn't it?

1262
01:34:10,792 --> 01:34:14,159
      Anyway, she told me
      she was gonna have a kid.

1263
01:34:15,961 --> 01:34:19,063
      And when I got out,
      I wanted her back anyway.

1264
01:34:19,065 --> 01:34:21,165
       She never cared anything
       about that guy.

1265
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:23,834
           She was just trying
           to get even with me.

1266
01:34:23,836 --> 01:34:26,303
    She was sorry for it later.

1267
01:34:26,305 --> 01:34:28,338
       Sorry for it, huh?

1268
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,707
   I don't mean for having you.

1269
01:34:31,909 --> 01:34:34,643
        She always loved you
        just like she did Mace.

1270
01:34:36,245 --> 01:34:38,646
 When you paid more attention
 to Mace than me,

1271
01:34:38,648 --> 01:34:40,114
     was that why?

1272
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,682
               I reckon.

1273
01:34:45,218 --> 01:34:46,918
       Well, you look plumb
       tuckered out there, Tex.

1274
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,621
        You get some rest, boy.
        Get some sleep.

1275
01:34:50,623 --> 01:34:52,990
     Now, Mason's gonna come by
     and see you tomorrow.

1276
01:34:53,925 --> 01:34:55,292
    He ain't going nowhere now,

1277
01:34:55,294 --> 01:34:58,361
    so he'll have a lot of time
    to come and see you.

1278
01:34:59,629 --> 01:35:01,129
          Behave yourself, boy.

1279
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:09,636
  <i> (woman over PA) Dr. Gilbert,</i>
  <i> Dr. Stanley Gilbert,</i>

1280
01:35:09,638 --> 01:35:11,371
     <i> please call Emergency.</i>

1281
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:39,230
          This where they keep
          the bodies?

1282
01:35:43,402 --> 01:35:44,468
                 Hey, Tex.

1283
01:37:18,162 --> 01:37:20,930
                  Hey, Mace.
         Yeah.

1284
01:37:20,932 --> 01:37:24,400
               Congratulations.
   Thanks. For what?

1285
01:37:24,402 --> 01:37:27,068
              Indiana wants ya.
              Full scholarship.

1286
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:30,104
 What are you talking about?

1287
01:37:30,106 --> 01:37:33,507
   You don't look very pleased.
   They only gave you
   the red carpet.

1288
01:37:33,509 --> 01:37:35,909
 But I never even applied.

1289
01:37:35,911 --> 01:37:37,443
 They didn't even send me
 an application.

1290
01:37:37,445 --> 01:37:40,011
       Well, you got in.
       I presume you are going?

1291
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,448
  Well, yeah.
               Congratulations.
               You deserved it.

1292
01:37:47,384 --> 01:37:49,485
      Oh, by the way, that guy
      I talked to in admissions

1293
01:37:49,487 --> 01:37:52,554
     says you've got good taste
     in reading.
 Huh?

1294
01:37:52,556 --> 01:37:55,957
    He said Smokey the Cowhorse
    is his favorite book, too.

1295
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:30,056
   Hey, there, long, tall Mace.

1296
01:38:30,058 --> 01:38:32,892
            What brings you out
            to the old spread?

1297
01:38:32,894 --> 01:38:36,562
 Thought the country air
 might clear my head.

1298
01:38:36,564 --> 01:38:40,966
 I keep doing things
 and then plumb forgetting
 about 'em.

1299
01:38:40,968 --> 01:38:43,268
 Seems I wrote myself
 an application a while back

1300
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:46,204
 to go to some fancy
 university-type college

1301
01:38:46,206 --> 01:38:48,906
 back east in Indiana.
             What did they say?

1302
01:38:51,576 --> 01:38:53,309
 It seems I'm in!

1303
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:57,612
                  Great.

1304
01:38:57,614 --> 01:38:59,180
 The only thing
 I can't figure out is

1305
01:38:59,182 --> 01:39:01,982
 how I ever got through
 the essay part.

1306
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:05,552
 Well, like you said,
 Jamie Collins, she ain't dumb.

1307
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:08,254
 You guys gonna take
 the classes for me, too?

1308
01:39:10,057 --> 01:39:13,658
    I guess I could've
    screwed you up pretty good.

1309
01:39:15,293 --> 01:39:19,229
 Yeah, well, you had reason
 to be mad at me.

1310
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:22,565
          I don't know. I think
          I was mostly scared.

1311
01:39:22,567 --> 01:39:25,200
            I mean, running off
            and everything.

1312
01:39:25,202 --> 01:39:29,137
 I thought I'd stay around here
 and go to JC a while.

1313
01:39:29,139 --> 01:39:31,706
 Then it wouldn't matter
 if Pop evaporated again.

1314
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:34,308
   He's not a bad person, Mace.

1315
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:36,443
 Yeah, well, he ain't
 much of a father.

1316
01:39:36,445 --> 01:39:39,579
 Well, you ain't, either,
 and you've been trying longer.

1317
01:39:42,417 --> 01:39:46,385
    If you stay, you'll hate me
    in a couple of years.

1318
01:39:51,023 --> 01:39:53,124
              Listen, I gotta
              get back to work.

1319
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,492
                     Take care.

1320
01:39:58,195 --> 01:39:59,328
  Hey!

1321
01:40:01,031 --> 01:40:06,667
 Nah. You'd better practice.
 It's rough where you're going.

1322
01:40:06,669 --> 01:40:09,102
 Yeah, well, it's pretty rough
 where you're staying.

1323
01:40:11,004 --> 01:40:12,504
             But I'll make it.
