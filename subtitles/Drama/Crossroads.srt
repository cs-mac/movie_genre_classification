1
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:20,056
-Hand me the flashlight.
- Here it is.

2
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:25,815
- Kit, I've got the shovel.
- You do?

3
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:28,934
Lucy, get the box.

4
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:31,454
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

5
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:33,294
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

6
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:39,532
- My dad thinks I'm at your house.
- My mom thinks I'm at yours.

7
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,292
Let's d i g deep.

8
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:47,090
So no one will find it.

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,929
- Di g it deeper!.
- We don't wanna get caught.

10
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,408
I want some dirt.

11
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:02,686
When we were ten growing up
in Georgia, Mimi, Kit and I...

12
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:06,685
knew exactly what we wanted
out oflife.

13
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,366
- Lucy, get the box.
- This is fun.

14
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:14,284
So we put our dreams in a box,
and we buried it.

15
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,683
We have to keep it dry.

16
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,720
We made a pact to dig it up
at midnight...

17
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,841
the day of our
high school graduation.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,160
Pack it down.

19
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,158
- Let's be best friends forever.
- We will.

20
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:43,277
Now, I don't even remember
what our wishes were--

21
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:45,277
except for one.

22
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:49,076
We wished that we'd be
best friends forever.

23
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,075
Well, that wish
didn 't come true.

24
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:14,510
I see you on the street
andyou walk on by

25
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,709
Baby

26
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,508
You make me wanna hang
my head down and cry

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,866
Ifyou gave me
halfthe chance, you'd see

28
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:34,946
My desire burning inside ofme

29
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:39,664
But you choose
to look the other way

30
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,903
I've had to work
much harder than this

31
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:50,102
For something I want
Don 't try to resist me

32
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:53,862
Open your heart to me, baby

33
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,860
I hold the lock
andyou hold the key--

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,059
- Lucille Wagner!.
- Pop?.

35
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,099
- Baby, we're gonna be late.
- I was just--

36
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,018
- Did you practice your speech?.
- I almost have it.

37
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,818
Lucy, how's it gonna look if the
valedictorian messes up her speech?.

38
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,538
Okay.

39
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,696
Don't wrinkle your robe.
Just ironed it forya.

40
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:19,415
Okay, big day!. Come on!
See ya on deck! Let's go!

41
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:22,375
Toads do look like frogs.

42
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,293
It's just one's, you know,
in the water and one's not.

43
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,933
It doesn't--
It could happen to anybody.

44
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,532
Hey, Mimi!
I know you want me.

45
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,211
Ho!

46
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,411
I'm gonna look
drop-dead gorgeous.

47
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,089
You should see my dress.

48
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,209
- Hello! Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me, Kit.

49
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,489
What, you're too perfect
to bump into anybody?.

50
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,608
- What?.
- Perfect.

51
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,207
Sweet, proper...

52
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,327
nerdy and virginal.

53
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,846
- I'm not--
- You're a virgin.

54
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,166
I told y'all.

55
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:04,405
Just get us in the picture, okay?.
Hold my purse.

56
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:08,004
No, don't push the button.
Wait till I get over there. Honey!

57
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:13,123
- Mama, what are you doing?.
- One second. Stand up straight.

58
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,242
- I am. I will.
- Tuckyour tummy in.

59
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,521
- Smile.
- Mom, I'm smiling!

60
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,601
Bigger, darling.

61
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,600
- Lucy, your speech was wonderful.
- Thankyou.

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,239
I hope you're gonna continue
studying music in college.

63
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,239
Actually, Lucy wants
to become a doctor.

64
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,158
Voice classes would make
nice electives.

65
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:35,198
No time. We're looking at a double
major in biology and chemistry...

66
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:39,476
if she wants to get into
the best med school, huh?.

67
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:42,316
Henry, I'll show you how
to start that truck for tonight.

68
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,356
All right.
See you later.

69
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,474
- Bye, Ms. J.
- Good luck, Henry.

70
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,954
I'm all he's got, you know?.

71
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,953
Congratulations, Lucy.

72
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:58,872
Thank you. Thanks.

73
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,550
Here it is.
Honey, what's wrong?.

74
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,469
I'm fine.

75
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:19,707
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.

76
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,867
Course you did.

77
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,866
Why didn't it feel
like anything?.

78
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:29,345
What do you mean, you didn't
feel anything?. It felt great!

79
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,664
Pop, I never went
to one football game.

80
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:35,863
You don't like football.

81
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:39,622
But you're supposed to go,
and it's supposed to be fun.

82
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:43,262
And like all the parties
at Hemmings Field and stuff...

83
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,021
I never went to any of'em.

84
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:50,900
I never stayed out late.
I never just hung out.

85
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,220
'Cause you had
a head on your shoulders.

86
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,338
You stayed home, and you studied.

87
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,138
There's just a lot of things
that I wanted to do that I didn't.

88
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:03,937
And I was up there getting
my diploma, and I was like...

89
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,936
"Is this it?'

90
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:09,935
Come on now. Didn't we both
work hard for this?.

91
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,175
You're right.

92
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:17,933
I guess it's just the pressure
of graduation. You're right.

93
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,011
Girls, hi!

94
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,170
Lucy.

95
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,648
Mimi, not now. Okay?.

96
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,486
- Are you comin' or not?.
- Coming where?.

97
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,447
It's graduation night!

98
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh, God, Hemmings Field.
I totally forgot.

99
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:54,845
So, are you comin' or not?.

100
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:00,524
I have plans.
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:03,323
Come on. You okay?.

102
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,961
Do you want something?.

103
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah. Are you coming
at midnight or what?.

104
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,160
Excuse me?.

105
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,518
Kit, we made a pact, remember?.

106
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:25,718
Oh, you're not serious!

107
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,077
Well, look, you can
really go without me.

108
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:33,836
I have better things to do
than dig up some old box.

109
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,555
Standing here
looking at all the world

110
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,871
The guitar guy is such a hottie.

111
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:55,471
That's Ben Kimble.

112
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,870
I heard he just got out of jail.
Killed a guy.

113
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,070
I don't believe you.

114
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,269
Yeah! Everybody's talking about it.

115
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,028
Oh, too bad!

116
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:08,788
Well, if anyone could have him,
it'd be you.

117
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:12,268
But I'm off the market, remember?.

118
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:15,186
Oh, please!
Dylan's at UCLA doing...

119
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,227
God knows what
with God knows who.

120
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,825
That's not true.

121
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,265
Right.

122
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:22,185
Whatever.

123
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:27,144
- Are you ready?.
- Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.

124
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,821
Okay, hold on.

125
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,702
Henry, are you ready?.

126
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,460
Henry, are you ready?.

127
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,419
I'm ready.

128
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,893
That's okay. Go on.

129
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:24,970
Why are you stopping?.

130
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,610
This isn't how I hoped it would be.

131
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,769
That's weird, 'cause this is
exactly how I hoped it would be...

132
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,248
or pretty accurate.

133
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:39,047
- Maybe ifwe get into bed.
- That's a good idea.

134
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:45,046
These are nice sheets.

135
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,204
- Can I hear the list again?.
- Oh, Luce, come on.

136
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:53,643
Please, please.
Just one more time.

137
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:59,083
Thanks.

138
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,122
All right.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,560
Reason number one.

140
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
We've been lab partners for three
years so we really trust each other.

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,559
- That's really important. Okay.
- Trust is very important.

142
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,239
Reason number two:. We are both 1 8
and have never done it.

143
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:18,678
Very important!

144
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,318
Reason number three:.

145
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,636
We both want to do it.

146
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,556
Reason number four--

147
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,435
Please, Lucy, come on. Please.

148
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:35,274
I'm, I'm begging you.
Please, let's just do it.

149
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,833
- Okay, yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?.

150
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,913
Okay, so let's--

151
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:47,151
- I'll go this way.
- Okay, I'm going this way.

152
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:49,070
Let's do this.

153
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,949
Please don't laugh.
You're killing this.

154
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,468
- Your first time should be special.
- Yeah, this is special!

155
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:03,347
Listen, do you want to spend
the rest ofyour life...

156
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,747
knowing that you did it for the
first time with your lab partner?.

157
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:08,626
Yes, yes, I do.
And I'll tell you why.

158
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:11,786
Because you know what it's like
for a guy to go to college a virgin?.

159
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:14,185
No, I'm telling you
they, they--

160
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:17,385
They're ostracized!
They treat them like lepers!

161
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:18,943
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:24,662
- What's up, Mimi?. How's the fetus?.
- Drop dead.

163
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:28,182
- Is it mine or what?.
- I can't believe we went out.

164
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:31,381
- I'm trying to do the right thing.
- Yeah?. What's the right thing?.

165
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,861
Ignoring me
for the past five months?.

166
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,300
Letting your friends call me a ho?.
Spreading rumors?.

167
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,979
I'm repeating what I heard,
that you let some guy...

168
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,978
do you in his car
over Christmas break.

169
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,497
Jerk.

170
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,816
It's ten paces
on the other side.

171
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,215
- What are you doing here?.
- Where's Lucy?.

172
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,933
She's not comin'.

173
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:05,613
- You have a flashlight?. Good.
- Gimme back my flashlight!

174
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:19,290
Let's just get this
over with, okay?.

175
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:37,005
God, I don't even remember
what we put in here.

176
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,925
Me either.

177
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,684
Here, hold this
for a second, Lucy.

178
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,161
My Bridal Barbie!

179
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,760
She was my wish.

180
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,399
- You're gettin' your wish.
- I know.

181
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,720
Lucy, I think this is yours.

182
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,038
- My locket.
- What did you wish for?.

183
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:12,757
I wanted to find my mom.

184
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:14,397
Did you ever find her?.

185
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:19,236
No, she lives in Arizona and my pop
doesn't think it's a good idea, so--

186
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:22,395
What did you wish for?.

187
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:27,914
- A key chain?.
- No, the world.

188
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:31,114
That I was gonna get out
of this crappy town...

189
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,352
go all the way to California...

190
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:37,751
put my feet
in the Pacific Ocean.

191
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:40,751
There's a wish that's not
coming true for a while.

192
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,670
- A lot you know, Kit.
- What's that supposed to mean?.

193
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,789
Slide Records recording contest?.

194
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:55,707
- So?.
- So I'm going on Sunday.

195
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:59,666
You're going to California
to audition for a record company?.

196
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:02,666
- Yeah.
- You're pregnant.

197
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,545
- So?. I'll wear something slimming.
- And what?.

198
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,785
You thinkyou're gonna become
this big, fat, pregnant star?.

199
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:11,504
- I have a pretty good voice.
- How are you gonna get there?.

200
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,383
- I found a ride with this guy.
- What?. No, that is crazy.

201
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,263
You can't go to Los Angeles
by yourselfwith some guy.

202
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:22,861
So?. Then come with me. I'll sing
lead, and you can sing backups.

203
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:25,780
- It's not something we should do.
- It's stupid is what it is.

204
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,500
Okay, fine.
You know what?.

205
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,019
You can just forget
all your past!

206
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,498
Oh, wow.

207
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:41,257
- Oh, my goodness. Look at us!
- Let me see.

208
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:44,096
- I was so chubby.
- Singing.

209
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:50,335
- I have to go meet my friends.
- Yeah, it's getting late.

210
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,454
Yeah.

211
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:58,413
Hey, you guys.

212
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:02,692
I'm leaving Sunday at 7:00 a.m.
ifyou all wanna come.

213
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,769
What do you mean you're not
coming home for the summer?.

214
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,528
Dylan, listen to me,
you have to come home.

215
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,328
Because! I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

216
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,247
Don't you miss me?.

217
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:25,087
- Excuse me.
- Dad, customer!

218
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,326
Dylan, we have to plan
the wedding.

219
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,046
All right.

220
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,285
I love you--
Dylan?.

221
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:44,322
- Hey, darlin'.
- Hey, Pop.

222
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,801
Dr.Johnson called today.
Good news.

223
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,921
Got me a job at the hospital?.

224
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,240
All those discounts I gave him
finally paid off.

225
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,520
- Cool.
- Yep.

226
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,399
Can I askyou a question?.

227
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,039
It's about Mother.

228
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:07,157
- Has she ever tried to see me?.
- No, she hasn't.

229
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:10,196
I was thinking,
maybe she's afraid to visit me.

230
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:12,756
Luce, you do not have
to feel any guilt...

231
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,475
about your mother leaving us.

232
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,234
This is not about us.

233
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:20,234
She was the one who walked out
on a three-year-old.

234
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,673
She's the one that should
feel guilty. All right?.

235
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,832
All right.

236
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,859
Nobody brings four suitcases
on a road trip.

237
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,057
Look, Dylan asked me
to go see him in LA...

238
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,657
and I can't get there
looking like a skank.

239
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:34,136
You better hope it all fits.

240
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,136
It will, okay?.

241
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:43,095
I'm not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.

242
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,534
- Fine.
- Fine.

243
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:49,533
- Fine. Shotgun.
- Yeah, right. I'm sitting up front.

244
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,933
You must be Lucy.

245
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:55,332
Yeah.

246
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,210
So you're taking us to L.A.?.

247
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,650
Yeah. I'll get your bag.

248
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,529
- You okay?. Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:11,648
- Move it, Ben! Let's go!
- I'll get the door foryou.

250
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,607
Hey, who's the guy?.

251
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:22,886
That's just Ben.
He's really cool.

252
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,444
Let's hit it.

253
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:00,957
Where's the bathroom?.

254
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:03,596
Second door.
There's no soap.

255
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,394
What's the deal with Lucy?.

256
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:19,872
- What, are you hot for her?.
- No.

257
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:25,111
I wouldn't even try, Ben.
Seriously, she's not like us.

258
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,112
She's way out ofyour league.

259
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,989
Want a chip?.

260
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,629
Get outta here.

261
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,107
What are you doin'?.

262
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:49,785
- What's with this music?.
- Well, I like it.

263
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,025
Can we listen to something else
for ten minutes?.

264
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,704
No.

265
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:56,624
Come on, Ben, please?.

266
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:58,263
Be a nice guy.

267
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:00,982
Okay, five minutes.
Just five minutes.

268
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,423
Thankyou.

269
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:08,342
I don't wanna be a fool

270
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,221
In this game fortwo

271
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,220
So I'm leavingyou behind

272
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,858
Bye, bye, bye
Don't make it tough

273
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,618
I've had enough

274
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:24,657
Bye, bye

275
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:27,176
Baby

276
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:32,855
- Ben!
- I can't listen to this.

277
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,054
- You said five minutes.
- Forget it.

278
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,734
Like this is any better.

279
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:54,571
- Why are we stopped?.
- I'm tired.

280
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:56,170
Let someone else drive.

281
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,850
No, nobody drives
the cruiser but me.

282
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,928
- Okay, whatever.
- Where are we gonna sleep?.

283
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:04,609
There's a field.
I got a tent and sleeping bags.

284
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,527
A field?.

285
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:12,046
No, I don't sleep in a field.

286
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,526
I saw a sign for a Hilton
back there.

287
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,085
How much money do we have?.

288
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:23,963
I can't believe
you only brought $40.

289
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:28,682
I have expenses. I had to have
my homecoming dress custom-made.

290
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:30,881
I was voted queen, you know.

291
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,481
Oh, my dream come true.

292
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:37,160
- Did anybody make a plan?.
- What do you mean?.

293
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
How far you'll drive each day?.
Which towns you'll stop in?.

294
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,878
How much gas money you'll need?.

295
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,758
Okay.

296
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,238
We have $486, right?.
Which means...

297
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:53,436
for food, gas--

298
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,595
Is it enough?.

299
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,235
It's gonna be tight.

300
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,274
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:08,353
It's a love room.

302
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:11,193
Oh, man!

303
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:12,792
Look at the walls!

304
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:15,511
- I'm not sleeping here!
- This is what we can afford.

305
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,990
Is this run by the hour?.
I'm not sleeping here.

306
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:20,310
- Where you gonna sleep?.
- I don't know.

307
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:23,830
This place is disgusting.
I'll take this bed.

308
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:35,666
So how come
you're going to L.A.?.

309
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:41,426
My uncle might have
a job for me there...

310
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:45,905
so I'm gonna check it out
and if I like it, I'll move there.

311
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:49,263
What about your band?.
Don't you have a band?.

312
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,623
No, I was just filling in the
other night. I don't have a band.

313
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:58,381
Mimi said that she didn't think
you'd come with us on the trip.

314
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,021
Neither did I.

315
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,580
You sorry you did?.

316
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,860
Not so far.

317
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,538
Well, good night.

318
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,458
Good night.

319
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:39,491
Hey! It's freakin' cold!

320
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,412
- We're in here.
- I'm in here.

321
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,930
I just need
to brush my teeth.

322
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:55,048
- What are you doing?.
- You're so touchy.

323
00:23:56,888 --> 00:24:00,127
Mimi, how do you know Ben?.

324
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:04,286
- Just from around.
- Gosh, don't you think he's cute?.

325
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:08,285
- He's all right.
- I can't believe he was in jail.

326
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:11,164
- What?.
- Yeah!

327
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,684
He like killed a guy.
What?. That's what I heard.

328
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:17,123
Excuse me?.
He killed somebody?.

329
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:22,162
No, he did not kill anybody--
I don't think.

330
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:25,841
Okay, he had a car, he was
coming to L.A. Don't be upset.

331
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm on a road trip with a killer and
you're telling me not to be upset?.

332
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,880
- He'll hearyou.
- Oh, my God.

333
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,439
What's up?.

334
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:47,596
Do you know him at all?.

335
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:51,155
He used to hang out with some
of the guys at the trailer park.

336
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:55,274
So he may have
killed someone, okay?.

337
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:59,673
So what?. He did his time.
He paid his debt to society.

338
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:02,192
Oh, my God.

339
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:10,231
Ready to go?.

340
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,150
Yeah.

341
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,950
Hey, you wanna ride up front
with me today?.

342
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,069
No, that's okay.
The backseat's fine. It's okay.

343
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,267
- I'll check us out, okay?.
- Yeah.

344
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,544
- I'll be back.
- I'll come with ya.

345
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,664
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

346
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:44,263
- Will you please get me some chips?.
- No, Mimi.

347
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:45,863
Open the door.

348
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,302
I'll get my own chips.

349
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:57,341
Y'all, wait for me!

350
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:07,138
So when he came home
last Christmas, he proposed.

351
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:10,297
He's comin' home as soon as
he's done with school next spring.

352
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:13,057
You're seriously
gonna marry that loser?.

353
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:15,016
You don't even know him.

354
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,215
- What's wrong?.
- Nothing. It just kicked, is all.

355
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:23,295
- Can I feel it?.
- Ifyou want.

356
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:25,573
It kicked again.

357
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:29,252
- What about Kurt?.
- What about Kurt?.

358
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:32,732
- He's the father, isn't he?.
- Yes, Kurt's the father.

359
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:36,371
But it wasn't working out,
so I dumped him.

360
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:39,171
You're gonna raise this baby
all by yourself?.

361
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,890
I'm gonna go wait in the car
with Ben, all right?.

362
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,008
That's so typical of her.

363
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,888
She's not thinkin' about her future.
How's she gonna get by with a baby?.

364
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,447
Well, she brought this
upon herself.

365
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,207
What?.

366
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:08,723
- Hello.
- Hi, Pop.

367
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,283
Sneaking away in
the middle of the night?.

368
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,642
I'm very upset with you.
Dr.Johnson went...

369
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,922
to a great deal of trouble
to get you that job.

370
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,481
- I'm sorry, okay?.
- Sorry?

371
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:22,880
You are coming back now! And
you will regard that as a command!

372
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,040
You're usually so levelheaded...

373
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,239
andyou pull a stunt like this,
I am so surprised atyou.

374
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,078
You worked so hard. Areyou
gonna start slacking offnow?

375
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:50,194
What are you writing there?.

376
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:51,913
Stuff.

377
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,952
Are you mad at me or something?.

378
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,472
Why would I be mad at you?.
I don't even know you.

379
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:08,430
- No!
- Oh, no, it sounds bad.

380
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,269
Look at all that smoke.

381
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,785
What's wrong with it, Ben?.

382
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:28,905
It's the head gasket, I think.

383
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:31,625
- Give me your shirt.
- Here.

384
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,584
Whoa! What are you doing?.

385
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,902
Nobody touches this except
for specialists and myself.

386
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:40,742
Because it's an antique
and I don't want people to--

387
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,901
- It's your radiator.
- No, it's the head gasket.

388
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:50,420
No, your radiator's cracked.
What year it this?. '73.

389
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,099
Oh, that's like 350,
plus labor.

390
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:57,858
Great! Great!

391
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,175
I'm hungry.

392
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:12,215
How long does it take
to get a tow truck?.

393
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:16,093
- Ben's only been gone two hours.
- I'm so hungry.

394
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:19,773
Won't you stop saying that?.
We heard you. You're hungry.

395
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,292
So what?.

396
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:30,010
We don't have $350.
Even if he gets a tow truck...

397
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,170
we don't have enough money
to get the car fixed.

398
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:37,009
I'm gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I?. Where am I?.

399
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:38,329
Louisiana.

400
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,768
Stuck in some
butt-hole town, Louisiana.

401
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,848
I am never gonna get to LA
to see Dylan.

402
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,006
He's gonna be so upset.

403
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,687
Whatever.

404
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:50,446
Excuse me?.

405
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,485
Could you be more self-centered?.

406
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:58,565
- You're just jealous.
- What?.

407
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:02,923
I'm not blind. I know how girls
like you looked at me in school.

408
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:05,482
You would've given anything
to trade places with me.

409
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,442
Girls like me?.

410
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,601
I can't help it if I'm popular,
so just lay off.

411
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,721
Girls like me?.

412
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,959
I didn't make the rules, Mimi.
It's not my fault...

413
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,120
everyone thinks
you're a trailer-trash skeeze.

414
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:23,718
- Stop it!
- Don't touch me like that!

415
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,197
- Guys, don't!
- You're pregnant!

416
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:28,397
You're a redneck!

417
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:32,556
Girls! Mimi! Stop!

418
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:38,595
Stop it! Stop!
I'm so sick of the two ofyou...

419
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:40,795
bitching and fighting
every damn second of the day!

420
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,674
For once,
would you just shut up?.

421
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:47,113
I don't know why the hell I asked
the two ofyou to come on this trip.

422
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,313
We don't belong together.

423
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,871
This was a mistake, okay?.

424
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,390
I'm sorry, partner,
that's the best I can do.

425
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,749
It's a cracked radiator.

426
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:08,068
He said he'd get it ready
by tomorrow.

427
00:31:08,147 --> 00:31:10,067
How will we get the money
to pay for it?.

428
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,306
I have an idea.

429
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,386
I'm gonna call my father
and have him come get me.

430
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,386
You're leaving?.

431
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,545
This trip's over.

432
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:23,264
Wait, I have an idea!

433
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,264
You know what?.
I'm sick ofyour ideas, Mimi.

434
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,223
I should've known you'd make
a mess of this trip.

435
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:33,302
Fine, run home to your daddy,
but don't try and blame this on me.

436
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:46,739
Lucy, I haven't asked you
for anything in a really long time.

437
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,818
But I'm gonna askyou to stay.

438
00:31:49,938 --> 00:31:53,817
Please hang up the damn phone
and just stay with us!

439
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:55,697
Come on, Lucy.

440
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,896
Hello?

441
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,814
I do.
I have a really good idea.

442
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:07,895
Yeah, it better be good.

443
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,890
Okay, I have something
to say.

444
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:31,528
I know we're not all getting along,
but tonight's important.

445
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,848
We really need the money.

446
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:38,167
So could we just be civil
and get through this?. Okay?.

447
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:39,806
Okay.

448
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:46,685
All right!
Y'all ready?.

449
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,644
Yeah.

450
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:53,603
- That's cute.
- Thankyou.

451
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:00,601
Wait.

452
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,881
It's all the tips
we can get, right?.

453
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,600
- Mm-hmm.
- So?.

454
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,561
Ifwe wanna put on a show,
we have to be sexy.

455
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,440
Now you're talkin'.

456
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:16,757
- Whatcha got?.
- Let me wear those feathers.

457
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:19,558
All right, next contestant's
a brand-new act.

458
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:22,676
And for all tourists that don't
know how the rules go in my club...

459
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:24,797
here it is, plain and simple.

460
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,835
You're the judge.
Ifyou hate 'em, tell 'em.

461
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:28,835
Ifyou like 'em, pay 'em.

462
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,194
We got baskets going around.
Put the money in there.

463
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,234
Be loud, be fair and be generous
ifyou like what you hear.

464
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,433
So, come on, give 'em
a warm welcome.

465
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,627
- They lookyoung.
- It's past their bedtime.

466
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:15,624
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

467
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:19,183
Get off the stage!

468
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,782
- Mimi, come on!
- I can't do it.

469
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:30,381
- You can do it.
- I thought so, but I can't.

470
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,340
- Please do it for me.
- You just gotta go do it.

471
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,620
- No, you do it.
- I don't know if I can.

472
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,298
You've got the best voice.
Come on, please for me.

473
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,979
- Okay, okay.
- Thankyou.

474
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,097
- You okay?.
- No.

475
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,892
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

476
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,852
I knew he must have been
about 17

477
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,091
The beat was going strong

478
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,609
Playing my favorite song

479
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:27,368
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me, yeah, me

480
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:32,607
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me singing

481
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:37,526
I love rock and roll so put
another dime in the jukebox, baby

482
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:43,445
I love rock and roll so come
and take some time and dance with me

483
00:35:47,363 --> 00:35:50,642
He smiled so I got up
and asked for his name

484
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:56,481
But that don 't matter
he said 'cause it's all the same

485
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:59,120
He said, can I take you home

486
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:03,720
Where we can be alone

487
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,558
And next we were movin ' on
and he was with me

488
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,559
Yeah, me

489
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:13,717
And next we were movin ' on and
he was with me, yeah, me, singing

490
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:31,154
I love rock and roll

491
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,353
'Cause it soothes my soul
Yeah

492
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:36,312
I love rock and roll

493
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,711
Yeah

494
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:53,427
And we were moving on
and singing that same old song

495
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:55,308
Yeah, me

496
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:20,861
Roll, roll, roll

497
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:45,856
Now.

498
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,574
It's so amazing.

499
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,091
Lucy, come here.

500
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:09,529
- How much is it?.
- Enough for the car and the trip.

501
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,970
Perfect.

502
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,849
You wanna come dance with us?.

503
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,647
No. We should get outta here before
somebody realizes you're underage.

504
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,127
Come on, just a
little bit longer, please?.

505
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:27,286
- All right, you go ahead.
- Thankyou.

506
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:35,603
- Hey, she with you?.
- What?.

507
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:38,603
Is she your girl?.

508
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,522
No.

509
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:43,603
Yeah. Watch this.

510
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,679
Move your hands, please.

511
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,157
We're gonna get a little freaky.
Hey, what's up, baby?. Come on.

512
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:05,636
- What's wrong?.
- Will you stop it?.

513
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:08,877
Excuse me. Hey, I don't think
she wants to dance.

514
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:11,876
I think she does.
You should mind your own business.

515
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:14,675
- Will you leave me alone?.
- Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

516
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:18,794
My nose!

517
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,073
Let's go.

518
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:31,431
Oh, damn!

519
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:32,910
Is this livin' or what?.

520
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:35,390
There's a mini-bar!

521
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:40,909
Y'all, you could swim
in this bathtub!

522
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:43,748
Look, I'm--

523
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:47,547
I'm not mad at you
for what happened there. Okay?.

524
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:49,387
There's bathrobes!

525
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:52,386
- Where are you going?.
-Just going out.

526
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:57,585
Are any ofyou guys tired,
'cause it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm wired!

527
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:02,184
- Who wants some of mama's punch?.
- Me, please.

528
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:05,063
- Madame.
- Madame.

529
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:26,698
Go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!

530
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:34,256
What are you doing?.

531
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:37,376
You go, girl!

532
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:46,334
I have seen one, y'all.

533
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:50,013
Yeah, but have you touched one?.

534
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:55,172
She has!
Give us the details!

535
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:58,651
It's always the quiet ones.

536
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:01,290
Say it loud. Say you
touched one and you're proud!

537
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,090
Lucy touched one!
She did!

538
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,567
Okay, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

539
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,687
- That's easy.
- What?.

540
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:22,686
Reaching my goal weight.

541
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:26,165
Third year at fat camp,
the summer before eighth grade.

542
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:29,524
Wait, that camp you went to
every summer was a fat camp?.

543
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,522
Yes, and I loved it.

544
00:41:35,522 --> 00:41:35,562
Yes, and I loved it.

545
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:37,722
For two months...

546
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:41,601
my mama wasn't around
to pick on me for being fat.

547
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:46,000
Being fat is just
unacceptable to her.

548
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,598
Okay. The worst thing
that ever happened to you.

549
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:54,119
That's even easier.
Reaching my goal weight.

550
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,877
- You said--
- It turns out...

551
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:59,358
that being prettier
than my mama...

552
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,876
is even more
unacceptable.

553
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,596
Oh,Jesus.

554
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:07,955
Yep.

555
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,993
One morning I woke up,
and she was gone.

556
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,954
Pop really wouldn't
say anything about it.

557
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,832
I thought she was coming back,
and Pop told me she wasn't.

558
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,431
They fought all the time.

559
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,751
You know, I think
that she just got fed up...

560
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:28,430
and took off
without even thinking.

561
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,309
And after a while, it was
just too late to come back.

562
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,509
I know she wants to see me.

563
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:41,187
She's just scared, that's all.

564
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:46,227
I'm gonna be so sick later.

565
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,425
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant
and you couldn't act stupid with us.

566
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:53,984
That's not why I don't drink.
I just don't see the point in it.

567
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:55,704
So you never partied?.

568
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:00,023
Once.

569
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:03,622
Over Christmas.

570
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:08,220
There was one of those parties
at Hemmings Field.

571
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:12,380
And this guy
was drinking this beer...

572
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,100
and I remember
it was in a blue bottle.

573
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,978
And I was real mad
at Kurt because...

574
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,577
he blew me off again
to hang out with his friends.

575
00:43:26,177 --> 00:43:28,696
So I had a few beers.

576
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:32,656
I had more than a few.

577
00:43:34,455 --> 00:43:38,334
This guy, you know, he seemed--
He seemed real nice...

578
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:41,374
'cause when I couldn't walk,
he offered to drive me home.

579
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:49,051
It's no big deal, Luce.
It happens to girls all the time.

580
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,531
Did you go to the police?.

581
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:53,691
No.

582
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,130
I'm from a trailer park.
I got drunk and got in his car.

583
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,129
So, Kurt's not the father?.

584
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:03,928
I saw this ad in a magazine.

585
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:09,526
So I called up this lawyer in
Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.

586
00:44:09,607 --> 00:44:11,846
Um, all these pictures
and letters...

587
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:14,885
of all these people
who want babies.

588
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,325
- I was supposed to pick one.
- The guy...

589
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,723
what was his name?.

590
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,722
I don't know.

591
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:31,562
Why did we stop being friends?.

592
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:34,361
I don't know.
People drift apart.

593
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:38,040
Promise me we won't
drift apart again.

594
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,479
Come here.

595
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,878
And where have you been
all night?.

596
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:54,997
Thankyou.

597
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:57,395
For what you did
last night, I mean.

598
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,555
Thanks.

599
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,794
Scoot over.

600
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:15,592
I'm never drinkin' again. Honest.

601
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,631
This burrito is so good.

602
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:19,831
Don't mention food.

603
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,630
- What are you doing?.
- Chilling.

604
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,426
- Wake him up.
- Y'all, he's been driving all day.

605
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:42,425
- We can't just stay here.
- We should just let him sleep.

606
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,785
- Uh-uh.
- We'll let him sleep.

607
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:48,184
Lucy, get his keys.

608
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:51,104
He told us we couldn't drive
his car. I can't do that.

609
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,662
Why not?. It's not like we're
gonna drive this over a cliff.

610
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:57,301
- It's stupid to stay here.
- I'll drive.

611
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:58,861
Get his keys.

612
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,741
- Yeah, get his keys.
- Why do I have to get his keys?.

613
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:06,260
Because Kit and I voted
and you lost.

614
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:07,699
Get the keys.

615
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:10,299
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.

616
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:21,817
- This is stealing.
- It's not stealing if he's in the car.

617
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:24,255
No, it's kidnapping.

618
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:33,094
Okay, stop.

619
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,812
Oh, I got it.

620
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,289
Go, go.

621
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,126
You failed driver's ed,
didn't you?.

622
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,246
Maybe.

623
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,846
- Move over.
- Oh, God.

624
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:12,005
Guys, smile for the camera.

625
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:27,841
Go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.

626
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,118
Let's go, girls

627
00:47:43,477 --> 00:47:46,996
I'm goin'out tonight
and I'm feeling all right

628
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,875
I'm gonna let
it all hang out

629
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:53,075
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

630
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,515
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

631
00:47:54,635 --> 00:47:58,273
Yeah, I'm gonna scream and shout

632
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:09,231
Get a little outta line

633
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:12,670
I ain 't gonna act
politically correct

634
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,869
I only wanna have a good time

635
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:20,829
The best thing about being a woman

636
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:24,948
Is the prerogative
to have a little fun and

637
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:29,386
Oh, oh, oh
Go totally crazy

638
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:33,425
- Hi! Did you have a good nap?.
- Yeah.

639
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:35,506
Stop, stop the car.

640
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,424
Don't be mad. You looked so sweet
when you were sleeping.

641
00:48:38,504 --> 00:48:41,784
- We just didn't wanna wake you.
- Stop the car.

642
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:44,263
- It's against the law to park here.
- It's my car.

643
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,863
- We're almost at an exit.
- Stop the damn car!

644
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:10,897
- Mimi, go talk to him.
- Uh-uh, you go talk to him.

645
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,696
- Nobody's gonna go talk to him.
- I know, he's mad.

646
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:17,216
And he has killed before.

647
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:20,575
Mimi, you said
he didn't kill anyone.

648
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:24,693
- I said I thought he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

649
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,732
- It's okay, I'll go.
- I'm sorry.

650
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:37,291
God!

651
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:40,050
Be careful, Lucy.

652
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:49,128
- We're sorry.
- I've been in a car full of chicks.

653
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:52,288
Do you have any idea what it's like
being surrounded by girls?.

654
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,726
Being a girl yourself,
I know, stupid question.

655
00:49:57,807 --> 00:50:01,325
But I'm a guy, okay?.
I'm a guy.Just a guy.

656
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:05,604
And I have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do...

657
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:08,004
your girl things for days.

658
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:10,763
I'm not complaining, 'cause,
let's face it, I'm outnumbered.

659
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,683
But that's my car.

660
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,602
It's my car, and it's just--

661
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:22,160
It's the one thing that hasn't
been taken over by chicks.

662
00:50:23,841 --> 00:50:27,319
- Okay?.
- Okay.

663
00:50:57,032 --> 00:51:00,152
- Ben?.
- Yeah?.

664
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:02,351
Were you really in jail?.

665
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,510
Yeah, I was.

666
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,749
- So you killed a guy?.
- What?.

667
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,908
Who said I killed a guy?.

668
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,028
Everybody back home.

669
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:20,667
Oh, man.
No, I didn't kill a guy.

670
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,226
What did you do then?.

671
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:28,625
I was in college, and I get
this call from my stepsister.

672
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:33,344
She wants me to come get her 'cause
my stepdad is beating her up.

673
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:35,463
My mom can't stop him, so...

674
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:39,022
I drive home in
the middle of the night...

675
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:42,461
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out...

676
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:44,381
and then I drive her back
to school in Ohio with me.

677
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,820
- And you went to jail for that?.
- That's the thing.

678
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,700
There's this law...

679
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,179
against driving a child that's
not a relative across state lines...

680
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:55,859
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges.

681
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:58,657
But, you know, it's okay.
I only got six months...

682
00:51:58,738 --> 00:52:00,898
and I had to stay in Ohio
for a year's probation.

683
00:52:00,977 --> 00:52:04,296
My sister got to go live
with her mom.

684
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:12,335
You all really thought
I killed a guy?.

685
00:52:13,454 --> 00:52:15,254
Yeah.

686
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:21,173
What were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac?.

687
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:40,888
- Why are we stopping?.
- You'll see.

688
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:55,085
- Mimi, you okay?.
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

689
00:52:59,364 --> 00:53:01,243
Look.

690
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,802
It's like you have to whisper.

691
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,321
Hello!

692
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:23,798
Man. We gotta make time. The next
hotel is still an hour away.

693
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:27,517
Ben, do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us?.

694
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:29,557
You serious?.

695
00:53:29,637 --> 00:53:32,156
You really want to camp here?.

696
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:33,516
Yeah.

697
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:37,555
It sounds like fun.

698
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:43,354
You gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this.

699
00:53:44,793 --> 00:53:46,992
Right. Now, the trick is...

700
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:50,392
you don't want to let him know
that you're gonna hit him.

701
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:53,912
Maybe like look away first.

702
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:58,070
And then, when he least expects it,
you throw your whole body into it.

703
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:04,469
What are you doing to her?.

704
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:06,388
I'm teaching her how to fight
because every girl...

705
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:09,228
should know how
to throw a decent punch.

706
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:10,668
That was decent.

707
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,626
I'm gonna go to bed.

708
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,427
I'm gonna go to the ladies room.
Where is it again?.

709
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:18,305
Third bush after the rock
over there.

710
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,666
- This one?.
- That one, yeah.

711
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:27,423
What are you always
writing in there?.

712
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:31,583
Poems, mostly.

713
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:34,102
Can I hear one?.

714
00:54:35,422 --> 00:54:39,021
Okay. One.
But you can't laugh.

715
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,659
"I used to think I had
the answers to everything...

716
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:49,098
but now I know that life
doesn't always go my way.

717
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:52,897
It feels like I'm caught in the
middle, and that's when I realize...

718
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:56,257
that I'm not a girl,
and not yet a woman.

719
00:54:56,337 --> 00:54:59,976
All I need is time,
just a moment that's mine.

720
00:55:00,055 --> 00:55:03,214
And while I'm in between,
I'm not a girl."

721
00:55:07,494 --> 00:55:08,814
I liked it.

722
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,454
Really?.

723
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,573
Yeah, really, I like it.

724
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:20,291
- What?.
- You got ash on your face.

725
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:22,331
- Where?.
- I'll get it.

726
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,250
There.

727
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:34,448
- What's wrong?.
- What happened?.

728
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:36,727
Something bit my ass.

729
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:39,686
- Let me see.
- It's a snake bite.

730
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:41,606
No, Mimi,
that's a mosquito bite.

731
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:45,445
Don't look!

732
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:48,805
- How could I not?. It's nothing.
- But it could've been a snake.

733
00:55:48,924 --> 00:55:51,524
All right! We are outta here
at the crack of dawn.

734
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:54,082
Nothing's biting my ass.

735
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:58,803
So we'll be in Tucson today?.

736
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:01,641
- Around 4:00, I think.
- Are you nervous?.

737
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:05,400
Should I call and tell her I'm
coming, or should I just show up?.

738
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,400
- I should just show up, right?.
- Surprise is always better.

739
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,519
She's gonna be
real happy to see you.

740
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,079
I hope so.

741
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:29,716
You'll call and tell me everything
about the audition, right?.

742
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:33,874
-You could still come with us.
-We don't leave town until tomorrow.

743
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:35,993
I'll be fine, okay?.

744
00:56:36,113 --> 00:56:39,113
You know where we're staying
ifyou need us.

745
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:42,312
Bye.

746
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,071
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

747
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:50,271
I guess this is it.

748
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,869
I guess, yeah.

749
00:56:54,989 --> 00:56:56,869
What?.

750
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,387
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

751
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:18,303
Can I help you?.

752
00:57:18,384 --> 00:57:21,264
It's me, Mama-- Lucy.

753
00:57:23,622 --> 00:57:25,142
Come in.

754
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:40,019
You have a really nice house.

755
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:42,297
Thankyou, Lucy.

756
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:57,774
Tucson seems like
a really nice city.

757
00:57:57,854 --> 00:57:59,614
It is.

758
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:01,254
Can I askyou
why you're here, Lucy?.

759
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:04,253
Can I askyou
why you're here, Lucy?.

760
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,613
I wanted to see you.

761
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:09,652
And why was that, Lucy?.

762
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:13,091
Well, you're my mother.

763
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,608
Why do you keep
saying my name like that?.

764
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,407
Hold on a moment.

765
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:41,924
Hello?.

766
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:44,443
Sweetie, tell Joey's mommy I said
you could swim for another hour...

767
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,323
ifyou put on more sunscreen.

768
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:48,243
I don't want you to burn.

769
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:51,322
Daddy will pickyou up at 5:00.
I love you.

770
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,319
- I have brothers?.
- Well, yes.

771
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,398
- How old are they?.
- Ten and seven.

772
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:12,078
Do they know about me?.

773
00:59:15,276 --> 00:59:19,196
Lucy, I think we need
to have a talk.

774
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:26,913
Whoa
Wait, seven, eight.

775
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,874
Five, six--

776
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,309
Come on in. Here.

777
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:48,229
- What happened?.
- What's wrong?.

778
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:51,028
- Get some towels, please?.
- I'm fine.

779
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,148
So, Luce, you got to see
your mom, right?.

780
00:59:54,268 --> 00:59:58,306
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And what happened?.

781
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,061
Just thought you might want
some dry clothes.

782
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:19,981
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

783
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,660
I'm fine.

784
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,580
I'm okay.

785
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,178
I know.

786
01:00:34,058 --> 01:00:35,858
Really, I'm okay.

787
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:50,095
What happened?.

788
01:00:56,014 --> 01:00:57,852
She said...

789
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:01,172
that she never wanted me.

790
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:10,930
She said that my father
made her have me...

791
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,329
and that I was
just a mistake.

792
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,363
I look like her, you know?.

793
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:41,243
I have her eyes and her hands.

794
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,483
It's her loss, Luce.

795
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:46,801
It's weird though, you know?.

796
01:01:48,481 --> 01:01:50,321
I don't have a mother.

797
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,080
Well, you have us.

798
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,840
Yeah.

799
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:13,236
Trying to call your dad?.

800
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:16,314
I can't.
I will in a minute.

801
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:18,035
You got that poem
you read me?.

802
01:02:19,034 --> 01:02:21,073
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?.

803
01:02:21,153 --> 01:02:23,153
Yeah, sure.

804
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:26,232
It's right here.

805
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:31,231
What are you doing?.

806
01:02:32,951 --> 01:02:35,629
Stop worrying so much.
Come on. I made you something.

807
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,989
Okay.

808
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:44,349
This is my surprise?.

809
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,467
Wouldn't it be sad if it was?.

810
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:49,028
Like if I just totally sucked
at cheering people up.

811
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:54,346
I wrote some music
foryour poem.

812
01:02:56,785 --> 01:02:58,705
Will you play it for me?.

813
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:00,625
Will you sing?.

814
01:03:05,903 --> 01:03:08,662
Just use this part
as the chorus.

815
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,139
- Yeah.
- Like that?.

816
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:46,094
Go my way
Like that?.

817
01:03:48,213 --> 01:03:52,093
It feels like I'm caught
in the middle

818
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:54,012
A little low there.

819
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:58,450
That's when I realize

820
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,850
I'm not a girl

821
01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:07,369
And not yet a woman

822
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:14,007
All I need is time

823
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:17,287
A moment that is mine

824
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:21,446
While I'm in between

825
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:25,285
I'm not a girl

826
01:04:35,362 --> 01:04:37,162
Thank you.

827
01:04:38,802 --> 01:04:40,641
It's no trouble at all.

828
01:05:22,231 --> 01:05:25,830
Hello, you have reached Pete
and Lucy. Please leave a message.

829
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:32,549
Hi, Pop. I'm just calling to say
that I'm fine, okay?.

830
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:37,508
And you were right about Mama.
You were right.

831
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:42,907
I love you, okay?.
I'm fine. Bye.

832
01:05:49,705 --> 01:05:53,344
I'm not the kind ofgirl
you take home

833
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:57,983
Ifit makesyou happy

834
01:05:58,063 --> 01:06:02,102
It can't be that bad

835
01:06:02,182 --> 01:06:07,220
Ifit makesyou happy

836
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:11,101
Then why the hell
are you so sad

837
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,258
Ifit makesyou happy

838
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:21,937
It can 't be that bad

839
01:06:22,017 --> 01:06:26,497
Ifit makesyou happy

840
01:06:26,617 --> 01:06:31,296
Then why the hell
are you so sad

841
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,366
It's too cold. It's freezing!

842
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,565
Don't even! Don't.

843
01:07:19,724 --> 01:07:22,844
- I can't believe we're here.
- I know.

844
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:28,163
Ben, you know, there are
a lot of colleges here in L.A.

845
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:33,522
Hey, what if I didn't go back?.

846
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:37,320
I could go to school here.
I mean...

847
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,639
why don't I do something
for me for once, you know?.

848
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:43,599
I wanna stay.

849
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:45,518
I'm gonna stay.

850
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:50,117
Good.

851
01:07:50,197 --> 01:07:53,317
Look how happy she is.

852
01:07:58,476 --> 01:08:03,114
Fill this out, turn it in over
there. The audition is in six days.

853
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:05,353
Wait. Where do we turn it in?.

854
01:08:05,473 --> 01:08:08,313
You turn it in over there.

855
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:10,472
Fill this out--

856
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:13,392
- What about music?.
- You know what?.

857
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:16,631
I'll get some flyers printed up.
I know a few guys in L.A.

858
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:19,311
I'll try to put a band together,
and I'll see you at the hotel.

859
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,709
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, where you going?.

860
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:36,786
Baby?. Hi, it's me!
Guess where I am.

861
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:38,746
L.A.!

862
01:08:40,745 --> 01:08:42,984
Okay. All right.
Then I'll come to you.

863
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:46,983
All right.
Then how 'bout tonight?.

864
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:52,543
Then how 'bout
tomorrow morning?.

865
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:58,061
Dylan, I'm in Los Angeles!

866
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,701
I came to see you!

867
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,540
Fine.

868
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,499
What am I gonna say?.
Fine.

869
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,378
Me too.

870
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:22,535
He's really busy with finals
and all. Yeah.

871
01:09:22,615 --> 01:09:24,255
We're fine.

872
01:09:27,015 --> 01:09:29,094
So who wants to go sightseeing?.

873
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:31,894
- I do!
- Okay! All right. Lucy?.

874
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:34,933
I'm kinda tired.

875
01:09:36,653 --> 01:09:40,132
Yeah, I'm pretty beat.

876
01:09:40,252 --> 01:09:42,650
Well, I need you.
We can't drive your car, remember?.

877
01:09:44,531 --> 01:09:46,210
Don't wreck it.

878
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,210
All right!

879
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:59,807
Wait, we're on Melrose--

880
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:02,926
I thought we were going
to see the Hollywood sign.

881
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:06,686
- We will.
- But I think it's back that way.

882
01:10:06,765 --> 01:10:09,924
I know. But we're gonna
make a stop first, okay?.

883
01:10:11,204 --> 01:10:13,363
Kit, you can
see Dylan tomorrow.

884
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,363
- Kit, come on. Let's go back.
- No.

885
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:21,602
- Kit, let's go back. Please!
- No! I want to see him now.

886
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:37,719
Are you sure?.

887
01:10:38,718 --> 01:10:40,557
Yeah.

888
01:11:21,148 --> 01:11:22,948
Kit, I really should wait
in the car.

889
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:27,666
- How do I look?.
- You look really great.

890
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,906
Don't you guys want
to be alone together?.

891
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:35,306
I want you with me.
Come on.

892
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:47,462
- Surprise!
- Honey.

893
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,182
Hi! Oh, baby.

894
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:52,581
Kit-Kat, I thought we were
gonna make plans tomorrow.

895
01:11:52,661 --> 01:11:56,260
Oh, I know. I just really wanted
to see you. This is my friend, Mimi.

896
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,380
You two know each other?.

897
01:12:01,499 --> 01:12:03,458
Yeah. From school.
Right, Mimi?.

898
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:06,577
- Right.
- Yeah.

899
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:12,096
Oh. Well, aren't you gonna
invite us in?.

900
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:15,776
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I've
got this friend here, and he's--

901
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:17,615
you know, he's really upset,
and we're supposed to, like...

902
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,615
you know,
hang out or whatever.

903
01:12:20,935 --> 01:12:23,093
Do you need money for the pizza?.

904
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:28,533
- Your friend sounds really upset.
- Wait, Kit, hold on.

905
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:33,371
- Oh, God.
- Who's she?.

906
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:37,610
We're supposed to be
getting married.

907
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:41,370
We're supposed to be
getting married.

908
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:44,169
I was-- I was gonna tell you,
I just, you know...

909
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:46,489
didn't want to do it
over the phone.

910
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:47,927
Dylan, you gave me a ring.

911
01:12:48,008 --> 01:12:50,848
You proposed and gave me a ring!

912
01:12:50,927 --> 01:12:52,567
Kit, I mean,
I'm sorry, you know?.

913
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,325
Oh, my God.

914
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:11,482
It was Dylan, wasn't it?.

915
01:13:13,043 --> 01:13:15,442
It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas.

916
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:19,360
- Wasn't it?. It was him, huh?.
- What are you talking about?.

917
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,480
That night when you came over,
you had that rip in your shirt.

918
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,199
- That was the night that he--
- Kit, what is your problem here?.

919
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:31,678
- Kit, I have to go.
- No, Mimi, come back here.

920
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:35,357
I want him to admit it.
Admit it!

921
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:38,557
You're getting all worked up
over nothing, Kitty-Kat.

922
01:13:40,155 --> 01:13:43,116
My name is not Kitty-Kat.
I am not your pet!

923
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,269
Hello?.

924
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:31,703
- Excuse me, where's the phone?.
- It's right over there.

925
01:14:39,302 --> 01:14:41,662
Yeah, can I make
a collect call, please?.

926
01:15:00,097 --> 01:15:02,617
They said I lost the baby.

927
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:05,336
"Lost it."

928
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:09,536
Like it was my keys
or something.

929
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:15,094
Isn't that the stupidest
damn thing you've ever heard?.

930
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:21,253
I'd decided to keep her.

931
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:26,772
I was standing on the beach...

932
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:31,571
and my toes were
in the Pacific Ocean...

933
01:15:33,849 --> 01:15:35,689
and she kicked.

934
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,168
It was like this sign.

935
01:15:41,608 --> 01:15:43,567
Don't touch me, Luce.
I'm already crying.

936
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:45,807
Okay.

937
01:15:47,926 --> 01:15:49,966
I would have made a good mom.

938
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:00,723
Just what were you thinking,
running away...

939
01:16:00,804 --> 01:16:03,522
with a pregnant girl!

940
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:05,442
Lucy, I'm waiting
for an answer.

941
01:16:05,522 --> 01:16:08,002
Do you know what it took
to come here?.

942
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:11,281
I had to take cash out of savings
for plane fare and hotel.

943
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:14,760
I worked hard to earn that money
for your college education.

944
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,160
I'm sorry.

945
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,318
So you made a mistake.
I understand.

946
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:30,837
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're forgiven.

947
01:16:30,956 --> 01:16:33,196
I'm gonna take you girls back
to where you belong...

948
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:35,915
and we'll forget about
this whole crazy thing, all right?.

949
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:37,835
Okay.

950
01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:39,794
Who's that boy you were with?.

951
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:43,073
How old is he anyway?. Is he the one
who put the crazy idea in your head?.

952
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:48,673
He just gave us a ride.

953
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,911
That's all.

954
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:59,231
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
We got a band.

955
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,669
- What are you doing?.
- Packing.

956
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:08,148
My father says I have
to move to his hotel, so--

957
01:17:08,228 --> 01:17:11,947
Until the audition?.
How are we gonna rehearse?.

958
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:14,226
I'm not going to the audition.

959
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:22,105
Look, I have to
go back with him, okay?.

960
01:17:25,304 --> 01:17:27,423
Ben, he's my father, okay?.

961
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:29,183
I just can't--

962
01:17:29,303 --> 01:17:33,941
And with everything happening
with Mimi, I just think I should go.

963
01:17:36,941 --> 01:17:39,261
- No, I get it.
- Don't be like that.

964
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:42,219
I get it. It's okay.

965
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,099
It's fine.

966
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:25,490
Did you see
how fast he went down?.

967
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:31,609
It's 'cause you threw your body
into that punch, like I taught you.

968
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:36,688
You did really good.

969
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:41,286
Hey, come here.

970
01:18:42,726 --> 01:18:44,365
Thankyou.

971
01:18:49,364 --> 01:18:52,764
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

972
01:18:52,884 --> 01:18:54,722
It's not your fault.

973
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,639
Got it?.

974
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:19,237
I can't believe
this trip is over.

975
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:22,357
I know. God, doesn't it feel like
we left home a million years ago?.

976
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:24,276
Yeah.

977
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:29,714
- Hey, y'all, thanks.
- For what?.

978
01:19:29,795 --> 01:19:33,954
For coming on this trip with me.
Thankyou.

979
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:38,633
Mimi and I were talking...

980
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:39,832
and we were thinking--

981
01:19:39,953 --> 01:19:42,472
That you need to stay
and go to the audition.

982
01:19:42,552 --> 01:19:44,951
Guys, I can't do that.

983
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:46,991
- I can't.
- You've got to.

984
01:19:47,111 --> 01:19:49,790
Kit and I voted, and you lost,
so you've got to go.

985
01:19:54,828 --> 01:19:58,068
All right, baby,
ready to head home?.

986
01:19:58,189 --> 01:20:01,468
- I'm coming.
- Ladies...

987
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,067
let's roll.

988
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:08,146
Come on, let's go.

989
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:14,145
We tried.

990
01:20:16,624 --> 01:20:17,823
Here you go, buddy.

991
01:20:17,904 --> 01:20:20,224
- Thankyou, sir.
- I'll take that, sweetie.

992
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:29,901
Good-bye, Lucy.

993
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,300
Good-bye.

994
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:08,172
It's gonna feel good
to get back home, won't it?.

995
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,772
Look, honey...

996
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:13,691
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

997
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:17,249
I wasn't angry at you.
I was angry at what you did.

998
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:19,289
- Okay?.
- Okay.

999
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:31,887
I don't want to be like her.

1000
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:35,486
We'll just get back home, and
everything'll be back to normal.

1001
01:21:35,606 --> 01:21:37,485
You just wait and see.

1002
01:21:38,724 --> 01:21:41,084
Don't make me do
what she did.

1003
01:21:42,324 --> 01:21:47,283
Don't make me run.
Just let me go, okay?.

1004
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,120
What are you--

1005
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,279
I used to think

1006
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,558
I had the answers
to everything

1007
01:22:11,957 --> 01:22:15,597
But now I know

1008
01:22:15,717 --> 01:22:18,796
That life doesn't always

1009
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:22,355
Go my way

1010
01:22:22,475 --> 01:22:23,875
Yeah

1011
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:29,192
Feels like I'm caught
in the middle

1012
01:22:30,233 --> 01:22:35,111
That's when I realize

1013
01:22:35,192 --> 01:22:38,431
I'm not a girl

1014
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:43,870
Not yet a woman

1015
01:22:47,349 --> 01:22:50,108
All I need is time

1016
01:22:50,188 --> 01:22:54,188
A moment that is mine

1017
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,947
While I'm in between

1018
01:22:58,027 --> 01:23:00,546
I'm not a girl

1019
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:06,544
There is no need
to protect me

1020
01:23:10,144 --> 01:23:13,183
It's time that I

1021
01:23:13,263 --> 01:23:16,582
L earned to face up to this

1022
01:23:16,702 --> 01:23:22,181
On my own

1023
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:28,339
I've seen so much more
than you know now

1024
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:33,179
So don 't tell me
to shut my eyes

1025
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:05,891
But ifyou look at me closely

1026
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:09,010
You will see it in my eyes

1027
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:14,609
This girl will always find

1028
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:19,847
Her way

1029
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:26,127
I'm not a girl
Don 't tell me what to believe

1030
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:32,165
I'm just trying to find
the woman in me, yeah

1031
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,238
My baby!

1032
01:25:17,474 --> 01:25:20,593
This time, we didn 't make
any wishes for the future.

1033
01:25:22,473 --> 01:25:25,072
We said good-bye to our past.

1034
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:28,592
Now, none of us has any idea
where life's gonna take us...

1035
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:30,871
'cause what we have is now.

1036
01:25:32,551 --> 01:25:34,310
And right now,
we have each other.

1037
01:26:02,664 --> 01:26:05,302
- Let's do this thing!
- Action!
