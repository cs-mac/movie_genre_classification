1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,177
You look beautiful tonight.

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,470
Just tonight?

3
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,680
I can't make continuously
complements?

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,482
Do you got her
telephone-number?

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,193
It's not in the phone book.
And I won’t give it to. . .

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,071
. . . you. I don't won’t to be
guilty if you run into a trap.

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,575
I need to know the truth.

8
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,370
This I can tell you.

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,665
She dates with the
highest Nazi magnates.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,877
She doesn't need any food
coupons. She got all privileges.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,382
She is part of the
cream of society.

12
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,888
And she obviously
enjoys is to the full.

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,100
I'm sorry Robert.

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,478
We all make mistakes.

15
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,399
That's true.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,785
This song serves as a iron link between
the soldiers on the front. . .

17
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,580
. . . and the loved ones at home.

18
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,280
In front of the casern,
in front of the big gate,

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,577
stands a lantern,
and it is still standing there,

20
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,373
So we will see each other again,

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,295
at the lantern will we stand,

22
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,090
Just like once Lili Marleen.

23
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,179
Just like once Lili Marleen.

24
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,861
Our two shadows looked like one,

25
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:37,866
That we loved each other was obvious.

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,663
And all people shall see,

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,584
when we stand at the lantern.

28
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,672
Just like once Lili Marleen.

29
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,176
Just like once Lili Marleen.

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,396
Already the post
horn blows curfew.

31
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:12,067
It can cost you three days.
Comrades I'm coming soon.

32
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,780
So we said good by,

33
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,493
How much I would
like to go with you.

34
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,664
Be with you, Lili Marleen.

35
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,294
Be with you, Lili Marleen.

36
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:41,263
Your steps she knows.
Your beautiful walk.

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,185
Every night she burns that
you wont forget her hand.

38
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,772
And should anything
bad happen to me,

39
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,485
Who will stand at the lantern?

40
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,781
My beloved Lili Marleen.

41
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,286
My beloved Lili Marleen.

42
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,296
I shall greet you.
Greetings?

43
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,589
From Robert.
Where is he?

44
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,382
Can I have an autograph?

45
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,268
Lili! Lili! Ah there she is.

46
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,897
Move away. We want
to take some pictures.

47
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,566
Please move back.

48
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,777
We have been looking
for you everywhere.

49
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,282
The group-leader invited us to the "Eagle"
He wants to celebrate your success.

50
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,075
I'm not feeling good.

51
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,786
Does that mean you already
turn me down again?

52
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,581
I'll get you an aspirin.

53
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,876
I feel miserable I got
a bad headache.

54
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,379
I'm sorry. My chauffeur
can bring you home.

55
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:24,176
It's not necessary. I think I walk
the fresh air will do me good.

56
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,596
It's not needed, good night.

57
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,685
I know her, she is so stubborn.

58
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,770
Follow her.

59
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,272
Yes, group-leader.

60
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,870
This is Blonsky.

61
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,585
Send a second man.

62
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:05,259
Are you crazy? I know you take
big risks, but this is madness.

63
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,679
You have to go at
once, immediately.

64
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,098
Why shall I leave?

65
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,560
Your life is in danger.

66
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,480
With your position you
surly can protect me.

67
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,776
Do you think so? How
do you get this idea?

68
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,487
That's very easy.

69
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,783
But you are in some ways a
figure-head of this regime.

70
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,786
What, for Christ’s sake.

71
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,290
I'm just singing a song.
Your song that's all.

72
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,961
But you have friends. Very
influential friends I was told.

73
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,298
Which are at the top
of the Nazi hierarchy.

74
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,468
Why do you say this.
Of what importance is this?

75
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,887
This you ask me?

76
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,472
Yes, Robert I do.

77
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,685
Maybe you should
ask this yourself.

78
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,982
They are just acquaintances.

79
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,358
No friends.

80
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,695
In my position this
happens automatically.

81
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,282
I can't always reject them
or I'll be suspected.

82
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:17,080
But you like it or not. You
enjoy the privileges you got.

83
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,879
In some ways, yes.

84
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:29,176
And it doesn't bother you all the
terrible things that happened?

85
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,680
Germany is at war.
There were was before.

86
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,184
I'm not talking about your war.

87
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,396
Unimaginable atrocities take place.

88
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,359
I don’t know anything
about it Robert.

89
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,487
I'm just singing a song.

90
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,492
Finally, I thought I stay here all night alone.
It's not particularly comfortable her.

91
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,663
I'm Jew.

92
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,666
I knew that before.

93
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,171
But you have been
ordered to despise us.

94
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,883
I love you as you are.

95
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,689
Robert, I missed you.

96
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,484
Eternal.

97
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,284
What's going to
happen to us?

98
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,098
Let me see your
papers, Gestapo.

99
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,770
I must say first class work.

100
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,277
Excepted a small thing not
visible with the naked eye.

101
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,488
Who are you?

102
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,782
My name is
Robert Hoffmann.

103
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,787
I didn't ask under which
name you are traveling.

104
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,958
I asked who you real are.

105
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,671
All right. I'm
Robert Hoffmann.

106
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,467
OK let's assume you
are Robert Hoffmann.

107
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,178
What are you doing
here in Berlin?

108
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,096
I'm passing trough.

109
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,766
You spend one night in
the Pension Jakobite.

110
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,476
That's right.

111
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,772
Two nights, and one night
you had a visitor, a lady.

112
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,984
Yes, from time to time
I have a female visitor.

113
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,987
The lady I’m talking about
is pretty famous.

114
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,368
I don't know about which
lady you are talking.

115
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:04,581
Normally she doesn't go to bed
with Tom, Dick or Hoffmann.

116
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,877
She prefers the higher ranks,
does at the very top.

117
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,964
Why are you telling
me all this things?

118
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,885
Miriam, I still don't know more than an
hour ago but Aaron will be here soon.

119
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,470
Would you like to
drink something?

120
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,764
No thanks, not
at the moment.

121
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,687
This arrived from
Drewitz via Amsterdam.

122
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,774
Robert didn't have anything on
him when they caught him. . .

123
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:35,571
. . . but of course it's just a matter of
time before they find out his true identity.

124
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,989
Was he with her?

125
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,700
She was with him.

126
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:44,663
I thought he forgot, as it's
several years ago already.

127
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,859
Blonsky, here Blonsky.

128
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,487
Object has boarded a black
Mercedes, model 1936.

129
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:21,783
Robert was arrested yesterday
only a few hours after you meet.

130
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,078
Robert my god, Gestapo?
Yes.

131
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,083
You don't think that I. . .

132
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,379
. . . put yourself into my shoes. Your
friendship to Robert proves nothing.

133
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,177
So why do you meet me?

134
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,183
Hurry please, I
want to get out.

135
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,363
Maybe because. . . I would
like that Robert is right.

136
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,789
Why did you stop?

137
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,166
I'm waiting here for the Bose
of our resistance group.

138
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,676
He thinks this meeting is necessary.

139
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,891
Frau Drewitz, I'm glad
to meet you. . .

140
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,395
. . . only the fact that we meet is
an enormous risk. - For all of us.

141
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:37,276
But because Robert Mendelsson
trusts you, I trust you too.

142
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,363
Have you ever heard of
Treblinka, Auschwitz, Majdanek?

143
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:42,864
What?

144
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,492
We need evidence about
what's happening in Poland. . .

145
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,786
. . . in the concentration
camps and ghettos.

146
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,998
And you could
get this evidence.

147
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:51,899
How?

148
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,085
Yes, you do front theatre. . .
does art tourneys.

149
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:59,173
Yes, and personal journeys
to Poland are forbidden.

150
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,092
I don't know what I could
do there for you.

151
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:06,180
You could say you want to do
troop care on the east front.

152
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,974
Nobody would deny you,
on the contrary,

153
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,059
Can I help Robert with this?

154
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,395
I can't promise you this, lady.

155
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,480
But you would help our case a lot.

156
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,276
I would like to
know how you are.

157
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,864
You can stop we are here.

158
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,496
Please tell me how you are?

159
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,794
I'm sorry we still don't know.

160
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:23,882
We know only one thing our Robert
Hoffmann isn't Robert Hoffmann.

161
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:28,679
Robert Hoffmann is dead since
three years, car accident.

162
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,683
I only see one way to shade light.

163
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,685
Right, this woman affair?

164
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,063
But for this we need
permission from the top.

165
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,275
Of course I keep
you up to date.

166
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,196
Soldiers.

167
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,490
Friends.

168
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,161
This is a very happy day.

169
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,876
Today we celebrate the birthday of the
man which is in thoughts with us. . .

170
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,587
the man which will guide. . .

171
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,883
our people to the final victory.
Our beloved Fuehrer. . .

172
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,471
and chancellor, Adolf Hitler.
Three times "Sieg Heil"!

173
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,776
Tell here to come once more!

174
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,094
Where has she gone?

175
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,599
Do you know where Willie is?

176
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:40,978
I haven’t got a clue.

177
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,079
He asks if you are aware of the
danger if the film is found on you.

178
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,760
He says you seem a bit. . .

179
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,180
seem a bit nervous.

180
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,063
He says you look frightened.

181
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,484
But at the moment
you are our only hope.

182
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,696
We wish you all the luck.

183
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:20,285
Look for a save hiding place.
And if everything works out, greet. . .

184
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,996
Günter Weissenborn from us.

185
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,576
Stop! It's driving me mad!

186
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,579
Stop it!

187
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:35,272
Lili is involved in something,
she hides an item in her bag.

188
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,779
Your attention please.

189
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,783
We are happy to welcome
among us our Lili Marleen.

190
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,968
May I asked why you
only joint us now?

191
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,680
I didn't feel comfortable.

192
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,391
Headache again?

193
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,976
No, it's ok now.

194
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,979
We have been looking for you...

195
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,690
I'm dancing very often.

196
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,590
It's ladies' choice now.

197
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:10,886
Come on boy, ladies' choice!
Get out of my way!

198
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,682
Your room is over there,
group-leader.

199
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:20,395
I have to talk with your partner.
Do you understand!

200
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,483
Willie is not only my
partner she is my fiancé.

201
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,696
And if somebody touches
her breasts it's me.

202
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,074
You got nerves Taschner.

203
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,786
But unfortunately you prove
this on the wrong place.

204
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,585
You will get a chance to prove your
courage where it will be needed.

205
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,391
Why didn't you shut up?
Was that really necessary?

206
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,678
Thank you, next please.

207
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,266
What the devil
is this for?

208
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,684
It's a physical inspection.

209
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:44,188
I'm vaccinated against
smallpox and typhus.

210
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,772
Complain by the group-leader.

211
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,193
Please fall in line.

212
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,783
What?

213
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:57,659
May I enter.

214
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,374
Give me the film.

215
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,792
Trust me.

216
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,465
Physical inspection? And you just put up
with it like this? But you normally wouldn’t?

217
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,065
Nothing.

218
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,961
This is the photo from our
contact man in Zürich.

219
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,097
What's the name?

220
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,895
Mendelsson.

221
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:53,066
Oh. I see.

222
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,281
OK, leave it to me.

223
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:12,961
Mr. Group-leader

224
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:19,384
You will return to Berlin tomorrow.
They are expecting you.

225
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,680
Does that meet that
my tourney has finished?

226
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,975
We would have liked
to keep you longer.

227
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,895
But the more
important has priority.

228
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,067
What do you mean? With the
more important has priority?

229
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,864
The urged request to
send you back to Berlin.

230
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,991
Is for me as good. . .

231
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,661
as an . . .

232
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,580
order.

233
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:56,463
By the way your piano played
Mr. Taschner also returns to Berlin.

234
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,966
His services are required
at the east-front.

235
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,062
She vehemently denies to
have maintained a. . .

236
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,772
relationship the
Jew Mendelsson.

237
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:18,986
But admits to have spend the
night in question with a man.

238
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,196
But which name she
doesn't want to give.

239
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,575
As he is a high ranking
person in the government.

240
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:30,664
She think it isn't appropriate
to disclose his name.

241
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,459
Is this right?

242
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,674
Than sign here please.

243
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:54,396
Thank you very much.
Just a moment.

244
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,275
I think that will end the matter.

245
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,195
I'll be back immediately.

246
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,293
Do you permit?

247
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,889
You somehow look familiar.

248
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,976
You probably saw me
in the newspaper.

249
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,395
Properly.

250
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,981
Would you also
like a cigarette?

251
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,493
Ah, I remember.

252
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,788
You are Lili Marleen.

253
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,667
I'm singing Lili Marleen
to be precise.

254
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,295
Hum, excuse me please.

255
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,588
What do you think?

256
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,382
Ah, it doesn't look like
they know each other?

257
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,093
There you are in best company.

258
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,263
Even the Fuehrer was fooled by her.

259
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,977
Congratulations, on you a
big actress has been lost.

260
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,480
This was a great act!

261
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,484
Blonsky, bring Mr. Mendelsson
back to his cell.

262
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,300
Come Mendelssohn.

263
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,180
You can leave too, I
won't need you anymore.

264
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:45,859
By the way from today
Lilie Marleen is blacklisted.

265
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,779
You can be thankful
that you are so popular.

266
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:56,495
Kaufmann, connect me
to our man in Zürich.

267
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,669
Now I still have to go.

268
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,673
Do you know where you go?

269
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,468
For a start to the east.
Maybe a mine search commando.

270
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,887
That's where pianists are required
because of the sensitive fingers.

271
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:18,475
Promise me one, promise me that
you want play the hero.

272
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,479
Now you don't have
anybody to protect you.

273
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,689
You also Willie.

274
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:29,987
One or the other
way we will make it.

275
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,990
Of course, we will.

276
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,372
My cards, can you believe
it I forgot my cards.

277
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,460
I'll send them to you.

278
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:48,088
Oh, it doesn't matter.

279
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,470
Hey Bernt, Bernt!

280
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:02,060
My good what are you doing here?

281
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,479
I was wounded, now
I've to go out again.

282
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,064
It was nothing.

283
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,275
Good day Mr. Taschner!

284
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:15,491
You two should take
care of each other.

285
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:17,868
We'll.

286
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,288
I have to go now.

287
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:24,875
Also take care of yourself.

288
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,672
You too, Heinz.

289
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,385
You to Bernt.
Sure Willie.

290
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,264
But I have to go now.

291
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,982
Yes, that's here.

292
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,580
Stop it!

293
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,792
That song has been forbidden.

294
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,169
Don't sing that song.

295
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,965
That song has been forbidden.

296
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,093
Stop, that song has been forbidden.

297
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,086
I would love to blow
the whole bunch up

298
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:56,300
We resort to the outmost only if
it's necessary. Do you understand?

299
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,390
On my list I got 78 people.

300
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,392
I only see 4.

301
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:07,895
Where are the others?

302
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:10,397
We can't be so wasteful
with people.

303
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,066
I also don't see my son?

304
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,861
As soon as everything is over.

305
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,371
Here it's the film.

306
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:31,460
You can keep it. Don't underestimate
us. Don't think we are stupid.

307
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,297
From films you can make copies,
but not from humans.

308
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:39,676
I make you an counter-offer.
We'll meat here in regular intervals.

309
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:44,097
Your friends and you look
that this film stays secret.

310
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,476
Agreed, we meet in six months.

311
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,562
In three months
with 100 people.

312
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:54,191
Don't be so greedy more than half
a dozen is out of the question.

313
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,569
Every three months is ok. Agreed?

314
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,071
Agreed.

315
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:01,782
Where is my son?

316
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,868
The first group can come now.

317
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,376
This settles it.

318
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,465
Now the other.

319
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,885
Let me blow them up.
No!

320
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:37,985
Bend down!

321
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,280
Why did you do this?

322
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,990
I hate this sort of deals.

323
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:44,283
Did you meat Willie?

324
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,577
No she is watched
by the Gestapo.

325
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:52,082
She tried to commit suicide
properly they arrested her.

326
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:56,587
So, we must try to be first.

327
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,058
Please send this today to Zürich.

328
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,687
Yes we must force them
to officially denounce it.

329
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,778
That is your only
chance Drewitz.

330
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,575
We just received
this from Drewitz

331
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,499
What does that concern us.

332
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,875
Can I see?

333
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,378
Sure, Weissenborn is right.

334
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:44,384
This is the only possibility to do something for here.
If we want to do something for her.

335
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,974
By the way in two hours a red
cross plain flies to London.

336
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,688
But why should we suddenly
help such a woman?

337
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,566
I haven't told you
everything, Robert.

338
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:10,285
I knew that she smuggled
the film out of Poland.

339
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,288
But this is terrible father. . .

340
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,293
horrible, dreadful. If Robert would have
known he wouldn't have married me.

341
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:21,088
I don't think so, Miriam.

342
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,591
Yes, please forgive me Robert.

343
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:29,596
I'm truly sorry. But I thought
it would be the best.

344
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,267
For you and for all of us.

345
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,978
If you want to catch the
plane you must leave now.

346
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,482
Goodbye Miriam.

347
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:51,382
You can't enter now! They are
broadcasting. Let me pass!

348
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:53,787
Let me!

349
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:58,083
Here speaks Robert Mendelsson.
I address all German soldiers.

350
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,961
I just have received news that the
women which mad the song. . .

351
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:04,965
Lili Marleen famous was killed
in a concentration camp.

352
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,467
Switch on my micro.

353
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:11,471
Here is Radio Calais, Calais
calls all German solders.

354
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,473
Wherever you are,

355
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:17,978
You will still be able to
listen to "Lili Marleen".

356
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:23,775
If not anymore over Radio Belgrade then
via the free soldiers broadcast Calais.

357
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,892
Yes Reich’s-chancellor
I have heard it.

358
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,896
Yes, it came as
a big surprise.

359
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,899
Yes very unpleasant,
I fully agree.

360
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:10,697
Yes of course we
have to do something.

361
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,784
Yes I keep you up to date.

362
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,089
She is still very weak.

363
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:35,097
I toke the liberty, I would
like to send you greetings.

364
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:40,185
A personal greeting from Dr. Goebbels.
He asks about your condition.

365
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:46,775
We were all very touched.
You gave us quite a shock.

366
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,992
Please announce to the press
what we agreed on before.

367
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,594
We all wonder why you
asked us to come here.

368
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:18,765
We asked you to come
here to tell the world. . .

369
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,685
once and for all to prove. . .

370
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,771
that the Jewish smear
campaign are only lies.

371
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,193
So they haven't refrained form using
one of the most famous and loved. . .

372
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:33,363
German singer for one
of there lie campaigns.

373
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,993
Radio London and Calais have spread the heinous lie. . .

374
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:42,998
the singer of the famous song Lili Marleen
was murdered in a camp.

375
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:47,377
We give you the chance to show loyalty
to the great German Reich. . .

376
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,882
and the Fuehrer. That's
what we want of you.

377
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,385
And if I don't?

378
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:03,268
You don't want that we have to
agree with the news of the BBC.

379
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:06,980
The times where you could
threaten me are over. . .

380
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:10,692
were I couldn't fall asleep because
I was afraid to wake up.

381
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,570
But that's over I'm not afraid
anymore, can't you see?

382
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,574
This will be interesting for you.

383
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,164
About one week ago we deported your
friend Robert Mendelsson to Switzerland.

384
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,667
Robert is in Switzerland?

385
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,670
I knew this would make
you fell better.

386
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:33,882
I cannot believe it.

387
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:37,177
Connected the line.

388
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,889
Please see for yourself.

389
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:45,894
Here is Willie.

390
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,899
Robert, for you?

391
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,076
Robert, your voice.

392
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,079
You're alive.

393
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,797
I'm all right too.

394
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,593
Really.

395
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,559
What do you
want from me?

396
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:28,562
You have to sing tonight?

397
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:29,980
That's out of the question!

398
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,274
That we understand each other
this is a order from the top.

399
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:34,193
She must look better than ever.

400
00:45:46,497 --> 00:45:48,373
Make the light as wide a possible.

401
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,300
Excuse me Mr. Henkel, can
I ask you a few question.

402
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,385
Why is a doctor when?
When will the show begin?

403
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:05,474
At the usual time 3 minutes before 10. Gentleman
you better go now to the spectators room.

404
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:11,480
Me properly too?
Yes.

405
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:41,885
Here is the Reich’s Broadcast Berlin all
German Broadcast-station are joint.

406
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:47,975
To the 211 time again out of the
over crowded sport palace.

407
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,186
The request concert of
German armed forces.

408
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:57,359
And here she is. Impossible to
ignore for friend and foe.

409
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:01,989
As every evening at the
usual hour Lili Marleen.

410
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,595
In front of the casern,
in front of the big gate,

411
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:29,683
stands a lantern,
and it is still standing there,

412
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:34,479
So we will see each other again,

413
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:39,193
at the lantern will we stand,

414
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:42,863
Just like once Lili Marleen.

415
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,284
Just like once Lili Marleen.

416
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,999
Russians.

417
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,173
We announce the
unconditional surrender. . .

418
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:12,095
of all our armed forces on land,
on water and in the air.

419
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:15,182
so as all other forces. . .

420
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:21,271
which are under German command, in
front of the high command of red army. . .

421
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:26,985
and also to the command of the
expeditional forces of the Allais.

422
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:40,290
How much longer my god,
how much longer?

423
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,667
What?

424
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:45,379
What did you say?

425
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,676
How much longer do
we have to hide?

426
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:55,264
We must first wait before we can explain
everything to the military command.

427
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,766
And how knows if
they believe us.

428
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:02,896
And before in a eventual process
Weissenborn or others can testify. . .

429
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:07,568
a lot more water will flow down the
stream before they will believe us.

430
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,784
Do you know Willie that a
murder toke place here?

431
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:17,661
No, when did that happen?

432
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:23,083
I think 1928 or 29.

433
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,377
But before the
Nazi took power.

434
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:29,590
A pimp shall have
killed his girl here.

435
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:31,967
It's a very mysterious story.

436
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,595
Where did that happen?

437
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,389
In the front of the fallen tree.

438
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:42,769
This case was put into
a novel at that time.

439
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,482
Tell me more.

440
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:50,277
I don't know more.

441
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,696
I just heard about it.

442
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,172
Do you still love me?

443
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,674
In my ways.

444
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:16,678
What do you mean?

445
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,181
It's just as it is.

446
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:22,976
May I kiss you?

447
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:26,980
Once more only, please.

448
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,899
What happen?

449
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,864
I think you should go to him.

450
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:40,494
To Robert in Zürich.

451
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:01,390
Willie, back after a long time?

452
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,267
Nice you visit us tonight.

453
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:04,476
Is this Robert?

454
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:09,690
Yes Robert, I always knew he
would become famous one day.

455
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:14,361
Yes I remember
how he started.

456
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,861
It's great.
Just fantastic.

457
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:27,786
I think you have
to bow once more.

458
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:41,175
You don't have to tell me how you are.
I wished for a long time to meat you.

459
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:09,578
Where is Willie?

460
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:10,662
She left.

461
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:14,082
It was brilliant.

462
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,460
The audience want’s
to see you once more.

463
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:34,394
Hallo Willie, where are you going?
