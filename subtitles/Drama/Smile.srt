1
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:13,392
<i>...and don't pack too tight.</i>

2
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:17,403
<i>The side pockets of the suitcase
are very good for small objects:</i>

3
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,440
<i>Earrings, chewing gum, shoe polish...</i>

4
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>needle and thread, charm bracelets,
things like that.</i>

5
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:27,570
<i>The top pocket is very good for hair rollers.</i>

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,015
<i>Since they are plastic,
they do not pull the lid down.</i>

7
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:34,385
<i>Also, so your shampoo
and cosmetics don't spill...</i>

8
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:37,322
<i>put all your gooey things in a plastic bag.</i>

9
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,621
I call it my Icky Bag.

10
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,961
Today's wonderful miracle
permanent- press fabrics...

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,692
are a big help
for the young girl on the move.

12
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,166
But for that very special wool jacket...

13
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,534
there's still good old tissue paper
to help keep out nasty creases.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,670
You won't need tissue for all garments...

15
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:58,872
but you will need common sense
to keep the case from looking sloppy.

16
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:01,276
And one final tip, girls.

17
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:06,344
Pack your naughtiest nightie right on top,
in case you need it in a hurry.

18
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,383
Packing a suitcase?

19
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,482
What the hell kind of talent is that?
I can pack a suitcase.

20
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:14,551
It's the only thing she could do
without falling off the stage.

21
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,654
She is cute. I kind of liked the nightie joke.

22
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:22,527
That's just the kind of stuff they hate
at the finals. They're not looking for sex.

23
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:24,696
Everybody's looking for sex.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,105
Thank you.

25
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:33,136
And now the winner to represent
the Imperial County in the State Finals...

26
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,047
the winner from El Centro:
Connie Thompson.

27
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:50,494
Thank you.

28
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:55,290
<i>An all- American girl you see</i>

29
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:58,099
<i>She's all an American girl should be</i>

30
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,412
<i>She wears a crown with love and respect</i>

31
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,949
<i>She's a young American girl</i>

32
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:14,511
Smile.

33
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:30,283
Girls! Now, there are only
two things to remember.

34
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:34,018
Just be yourselves, and keep smiling!

35
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,421
Hello, girls.

36
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,521
My name is Mr. Wilson Shears...

37
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:48,625
and I am the President of this year's
Young American Miss Pageant.

38
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,502
I know you all must be kind of pooped,
but I do have a couple of announcements.

39
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,667
First, as regards your luggage.

40
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,279
Your luggage will be arriving in the lobby.

41
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:06,218
Some of your luggage will be arriving.

42
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,652
Seems there's been a mix- up at the airport.

43
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,952
Girls, keep smiling.

44
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,288
We'll have all of your luggage
delivered to your host parent's home.

45
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,828
Yes, we will.

46
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,156
Now, I have one further announcement...

47
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,330
from the Veterans War Memorial Auditorium
Maintenance Director and his staff.

48
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,697
That's me and you, Logan.

49
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:32,101
"It is requested that the girls do not dispose
of their sanitary napkins in the commodes.

50
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,206
"Since there are so many girls in the hall...

51
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,281
"and since a sanitary napkin
is thick and difficult..."

52
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,823
Well, just don't do it.

53
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,418
Now, I'd like to turn things over...

54
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,430
to someone I'm sure you all know,
Miss Brenda DiCarlo...

55
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:57,232
who is the supervisor of this year's pageant
and a former Young American Miss.

56
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:02,064
...his breathing rate is approximately
12 times a minute for adults.

57
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:05,640
Now, if you'll just follow me
and the Mother Hens...

58
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:09,978
Do you think the announcement
about the toilets will help, Mr. Nakas?

59
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,812
I'm so sorry I forgot to tell you
about Mr. French's phone call.

60
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:17,152
- That's all right, dear.
- This is all so new to me.

61
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:19,715
- Just being out of the house is new to me.
- Here.

62
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:22,318
Brenda, you're so organized and everything.

63
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:23,988
- How do you do it?
- I don't know.

64
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,659
I get tired but I just keep going.
Somebody has to do the job.

65
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:31,170
Girls, you're now in No Man's Land.

66
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:34,173
It's called that for obvious reasons.
Everyone come in.

67
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:36,402
You're gonna be spending
a lot of time in here...

68
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,377
so get familiar with it and find your coop.

69
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,605
Now, your coop is run by your Mother Hen.

70
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,345
You'll see three girls.
Janet, would you turn the board around?

71
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,286
On the board you're going to see
three color groups.

72
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,255
Simi Valley. I'm Maria Gonzales.

73
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,884
I forget your name,
but I see your name in the paper- -

74
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,018
Karen.

75
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:57,188
Well, we're roommates.
So I come up and say hello to you.

76
00:07:57,264 --> 00:08:00,495
- Nice to meet you.
- I have to go sing. I see you later.

77
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,627
And I want to see all the other girls
finding their Mother Hens.

78
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,400
Okay, blues. Whoever's a blue.

79
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,603
All right. You're blue? Yes, right.
Of course, I remember you.

80
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:15,111
All right, every blue here.
We're gonna learn the opening song...

81
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:19,050
which is here on the board.
And nobody's being judged here, okay?

82
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,384
<i>Ready to start out, singing our hearts out</i>

83
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:25,823
Robin Gibson, right?
Hi, I'm Doria. We're roommates.

84
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,384
<i>Built by youth you'll see today</i>

85
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,558
- I'm supposed to learn this song with them.
- Sure, I'll see you later, okay?

86
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,165
Good, that's not bad at all.

87
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:38,227
Let's start just from there again.
Let's take it from the top.

88
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:49,338
If you love the open road as much as I do,
Tone, my guy right here, that's the one.

89
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:53,352
If you're worried about credit, forget it.
We don't worry about it, why should you?

90
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,856
Hey, Brenda! How are you?
Be with you in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

91
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:58,221
Go in and park your carcass.

92
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,728
Tony, this beauty here
holds 50 gallons of gasoline.

93
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,587
Now what does Uncle Sam say to us?

94
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:07,600
He says, "Don't store gasoline."
We all agree with that, don't we?

95
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:11,297
But with all these crazy Arabs around,
who knows what they're gonna do next?

96
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,566
You have to admit
it's a safe feeling knowing...

97
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,302
you're sleeping on top of 50 gallons of gas.

98
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,839
Well, we'll have to think that over.

99
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:21,142
Thinking, that's what this game is all about.

100
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:24,309
You must think it over, Tony.
I'm gonna give you one of my cards.

101
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:28,218
That's my home phone number on there.
Call me 365 days a year.

102
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:32,253
All of Big Bob Freelander's customers
are also his friends.

103
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:36,124
How about that? A balloon for Mom.

104
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:40,633
You think it over, and I'd say
you got an early October here, right?

105
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,994
Okay, the three of you think it over.

106
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,662
<i>Leonard, line 2.</i>

107
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,974
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Brenda.
- That's fine.

108
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,705
- Are those the applications?
- Yes, indeed. Thirty- three this year.

109
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,907
Really? Six more than last year? Wow!

110
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,712
And we got San Diego.

111
00:09:57,784 --> 00:10:01,311
- You are doing a bang- up job, Brenda.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,655
- Any real lookers this year?
- Oh, you men.

113
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,724
What do you mean us men?

114
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:10,229
You women are checking each other out
a lot more than any man I ever saw.

115
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:13,789
You're always the first ones
to sneak a look at the centerfold of Playboy.

116
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,734
- That's not true.
- Are those the name tags?

117
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:21,003
- Do you like it?
- Do I like it.

118
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:25,468
Boy, gold this year, huh?

119
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:28,075
No, just yours is.

120
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,076
The rest are only silver.

121
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,813
Brenda, thank you. That's really nice.

122
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:38,648
Well, I've got a Jaycette meeting.
So, goodbye.

123
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,792
See you tomorrow when all the action starts.

124
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,330
And don't do anything I wouldn't do.

125
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:45,592
Don't worry.

126
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,760
Say, Brenda,
where's your hubby been hiding out?

127
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,962
Andy? Hiding?

128
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:53,732
Well, I missed him
the last couple of Jaycee luncheons.

129
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,068
He had a touch of the flu.

130
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,772
You'd better start taking
better care of him than that.

131
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,974
He was my friend first, you know.

132
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,210
Right.

133
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,916
You stole him from me.

134
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:14,524
Hello, muffin. How's my sweetheart?

135
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:17,090
No, darling, you can't go out.

136
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm sorry, I'm late.

137
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,737
- I see you got dinner.
- Yep. Now dinner's getting me.

138
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:32,240
Another evening of sarcasm and self- pity.

139
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:58,500
- Brenda, I'm sorry.
- l'm tired.

140
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:02,439
Yeah, we're all tired.

141
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,091
You guys do it to me every time.

142
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:26,291
Somebody's been fooling
with my thermostat again.

143
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,731
Little Bob?

144
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:30,695
Mom!

145
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:48,019
Hey, Roberta,
have you seen my applications?

146
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:51,822
No, honey. Do you have to
work on those tonight?

147
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,759
It's pageantry time. No rest for the weary.

148
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:08,668
I'll tell you what we are gonna do, though,
after this week of pageantry.

149
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:12,701
You and I are gonna sneak off
and have us a romantic little weekend.

150
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,715
- How about Little Bob?
- No, not this time. Little Bob's out.

151
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:19,246
Where are we going?

152
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,953
I thought we'd go to Disneyland.

153
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:29,291
<i>- Yeah,</i> I <i>got</i> my <i>dad's application book.
- Who's the sexiest?</i>

154
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:33,132
I can't tell.
The pictures are just faces, no bodies.

155
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,630
There's one from Simi Valley
who looks pretty good.

156
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,829
But she's sticking out
where the picture ends.

157
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,429
So she's either got great tits or she's fat.

158
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,634
<i>Does she look like she's been laid?</i>

159
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,509
How should I know, Chuck? They don't
write down whether or not they're virgins.

160
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,640
<i>Don't mess this up.
There's a lot of money in it for both of us.</i>

161
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,480
Quit worrying, Chuck.
I'll take care of my end.

162
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,747
Now, are you sure
Freddy's got the Polaroid?

163
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,449
- Little Bob!
- Talk to you later, Chuck.

164
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:04,963
Little Bob, have you seen the applications?

165
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:06,788
There they are.

166
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:10,860
Sorry, Dad, were you looking for these?
I was just reading some of them.

167
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,199
You were?

168
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:14,367
You know something, Dad?

169
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,899
I know I sort of put down the pageant
the last couple of years.

170
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:22,244
But after reading these applications,
I can see why you want to help these girls.

171
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:25,148
They seem very worthwhile.

172
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,514
Right on, son.

173
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,056
These are the finest bunch
of high school girls in the state.

174
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,459
You want to know something else?

175
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,925
One of the most exciting things
about growing up:

176
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:43,402
One day, you find yourself being interested
in all sorts of new things.

177
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,462
You are tops.

178
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,101
- Can I have these now?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,944
No rest for the weary this week.

180
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,517
- Dad?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,047
Are there many fat girls in the contest?

182
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,114
No. Not usually.

183
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,663
<i>We can see a bright tomorrow</i>

184
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:16,435
<i>Built by youth you see today</i>

185
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:20,072
<i>We have faith, we have hope</i>

186
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,007
<i>We can see a brighter day</i>

187
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,681
What are you doing?

188
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,417
I was just looking
at this man's shaving stuff.

189
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:37,081
Believe it or not, I've never been
in a bathroom a man uses before.

190
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,387
Well, I haven't, either. Hardly.

191
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,755
I didn't mean that.

192
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:45,992
I just meant that I never had a brother
or father or anything.

193
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,995
- I grew up with just my mom.
- Where's your father?

194
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,934
He died when I was two.

195
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:53,698
Wow, I'm sorry, Rob.

196
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,268
Don't worry about it.

197
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:58,641
I really think it makes other people
feel worse than it does me.

198
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:01,374
I don't even remember him. I was only two.

199
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,939
You know what?
It could help you in this contest.

200
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:08,181
Getting to be a top high- school senior
without a father to help you.

201
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,553
Jesus, was that an awful thing to say?

202
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,493
No, I don't think so.
I mean, do you really think...

203
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:19,521
that things like having no father,
and stuff like that helps up here?

204
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,328
Yeah, everything counts up here.

205
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:24,837
Your grades, your personality,
the judges' conference.

206
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:29,073
Jesus, I like it better
when they just judge your tits and ass.

207
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,739
- Have you been in one of those?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:35,474
- I won Miss Teenage Complexion.
- I don't think I've heard of that one.

209
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:39,541
It was sponsored by this
horny old dermatologist in Orange County.

210
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,019
He rented a room at the Disneyland Hotel...

211
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:45,353
got 16 girls in bathing suits
and he had his own beauty contest.

212
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:48,519
You're kidding me!
Well, didn't you get mad?

213
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:51,829
No. I won $200 and had a wart removed.

214
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,500
<i>I think the biggest help in my life
has been my mom.</i>

215
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,533
<i>Well, both my parents, really.</i>

216
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:04,975
<i>Perhaps the judges' conference
is the single most important test...</i>

217
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:08,139
<i>of what a Young American Miss
is really made of.</i>

218
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:12,717
<i>What I mean is the valuable
and the fulfillment is just helping others.</i>

219
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:16,553
<i>Sandra Kay, tell me what you think
about Women's Lib.</i>

220
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,856
<i>Well, I think it's kind of silly.</i>

221
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,595
<i>What! mean is, it's not so important...</i>

222
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,760
Where is he?
We're supposed to start rehearsals.

223
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,905
This is my first year as President.
The Jaycees are counting on me.

224
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:38,501
- What if he doesn't show up?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

225
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,806
I don't know why we had to
go and hire this guy.

226
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,906
I don't know why we couldn't have hired
the guy we had last year.

227
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,042
That homosexual from San Francisco.

228
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,611
Now listen, I worked long and hard
to get Tommy French for this show.

229
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,589
It was a great coup.

230
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,024
He's never staged a local pageant before.

231
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:57,552
- Doesn't look like he'll stage this one.
- Don't worry.

232
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,402
<i>Sandra Kay Mathic: Miss Louisiana!</i>

233
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,770
<i>These scholarships are made possible
by the optimistic support...</i>

234
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:10,776
<i>of the pageant's national sponsors:
Clairol and Denny's.</i>

235
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:18,375
<i>The big show in Baton Rouge is telecast
nationally, and for the past four years...</i>

236
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,648
has been conceived and directed
<i>by</i> Mr. <i>Tommy</i> French.

237
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:25,985
<i>Although Mr. French is famous
for his smooth professional choreography...</i>

238
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,586
<i>he impresses on each girl
that their youthful enthusiasm...</i>

239
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,687
<i>is the main ingredient of the big show.</i>

240
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,495
We should never have hired
a guy that expensive.

241
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,933
Expensive people are always late.

242
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:40,370
- Where the hell is he?
- Relax, I'm here.

243
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,475
<i>Mr. French is the Hollywood professional...</i>

244
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:46,478
<i>and choreographer of many
of your favorite television programs.</i>

245
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:49,777
<i>We know each of the girls has profited...</i>

246
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,648
I look older in person, don't I?

247
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,985
Have any of you had any dance experience?

248
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:00,949
- Does square dancing count?
- Not with me, dear.

249
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,857
Now, ladies, first pick up the pompom.

250
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:11,470
One, two.

251
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:13,265
Ready?

252
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,841
One, two.

253
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,508
Sensational.

254
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,210
Tambourines.

255
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,212
One, two.

256
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,486
And one, two.

257
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,581
A real showstopper.

258
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:31,823
Bamboo poles.

259
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,859
I don't have a bamboo pole.

260
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,290
One, two, three, four.

261
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:38,455
Ready?

262
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,732
And one, two, three...

263
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:47,064
Very nice. Work on it.

264
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,500
Well, first I do <i>Spring is Here,
and then</i> I do <i>Summer Sun...</i>

265
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:56,277
then I do the first half of Autumn Leaves,
and I finish with Winter Wonderland.

266
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,749
<i>I call it A Song for All Seasons.</i>

267
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:02,351
Cute. Now have you got
an arrangement for all this?

268
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:08,383
No, I just thought
you'd sort of follow along.

269
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:11,327
Hear that, boys?
We just sort of follow along.

270
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,562
Okay, ready, four and...

271
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:18,636
<i>Spring is here!</i>

272
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,235
<i>Why doesn't my heart go dancing?</i>

273
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:29,473
What's the matter?

274
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,946
I'm sorry. Well, I usually
do this to my own tape...

275
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,348
and live music sounds
a lot different from a tape.

276
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:42,861
That's right, dear.
We count on that to make a living.

277
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,737
That one from Fountain Valley
looks pretty good.

278
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,295
I got a fountain
she can water her valley with.

279
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,934
- Let me see.
- You shouldn't be allowed to use these...

280
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,978
- the way you screwed things up!
- I didn't.

281
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:02,446
It's not my fault my mom took
the Polaroid to her Art Photography class!

282
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:06,076
You should've known. This could be
our last shot at these girls, dickhead!

283
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:07,176
Dickhead?

284
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:10,381
Okay, no big damage done!
We can pull it off tomorrow.

285
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:13,789
You better not mess up tomorrow, Freddy.
We already got $22 in orders.

286
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,088
That much, Little Bob?

287
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:18,153
You know that new kid,
the fat one, never suits up for gym?

288
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:21,428
He bought $8 worth himself.

289
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,795
Wow! Look at that one from Bakersfield.

290
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:27,772
I got something she could bake in her field.

291
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,640
I hate it.

292
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:39,040
<i>AH right, that'll be another $1
for slandering a fellow officer.</i>

293
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,211
<i>You see, old Phil's just mad...</i>

294
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,655
<i>because his auto repair shop
isn't doing as well as my mortuary.</i>

295
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:48,285
<i>We sell more caskets than he does gaskets.</i>

296
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:54,165
<i>Anyway, I'd like to introduce
our very special guest...</i>

297
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:56,258
<i>from the Young American Miss Pageant...</i>

298
00:21:56,336 --> 00:22:00,329
<i>first of all, Mrs. Brenda DiCarlo,
who is the pageant supervisor.</i>

299
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,007
Thank you.

300
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:09,614
<i>Brenda, of course, is the wife
of our fellow Bear, Andy DiCarlo.</i>

301
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,607
<i>Stand up, Andy.</i>

302
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:16,549
<i>I think old Andy's gonna get fined twice.</i>

303
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:19,819
<i>Once for not showing up,
and once for having such a beautiful wife.</i>

304
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,018
Where is he?

305
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:23,961
<i>Let's give Brenda
and all the other pretty young girls...</i>

306
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,055
<i>a growling Bears' welcome!</i>

307
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,426
Are you having a good time up here?

308
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:33,738
- Pretty good.
- Very good.

309
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:34,864
Good.

310
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:37,802
I'm glad you appreciate it so much.

311
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:40,937
I do.
It's such an incredible experience for me.

312
00:22:41,014 --> 00:22:43,710
I mean, I've never done
anything like this in my life.

313
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:46,251
<i>Santa Rosa is so beautiful.</i>

314
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,147
<i>I mean, I thought the shopping mall
in Anaheim was great until I saw yours.</i>

315
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:55,456
<i>It's a credit to the vision
of your business community.</i>

316
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:02,665
<i>Thank you.</i>

317
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,862
<i>Next.</i>

318
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:11,202
<i>- Hi, I'm Robin Gibson.
- Speak up, dear.</i>

319
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:15,738
<i>Hi, I'm Robin Gibson.
Antelope Valley's Young American Miss.</i>

320
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:20,174
<i>Thank you for inviting me to lunch.</i>

321
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:25,215
<i>Next.</i>

322
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,321
<i>I'm Maria Gonzales.
Salinas' Young American Miss.</i>

323
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:35,727
<i>And since you gentlemen
have been nice enough to feed us...</i>

324
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:40,837
<i>I would like to feed you
with this homemade guacamole dip.</i>

325
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,305
<i>It's a typical dish of my native land, Mexico.</i>

326
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:46,638
<i>You like to try?</i>

327
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:48,810
<i>How about that?</i>

328
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:55,313
<i>suppose Santa Rosa...</i>

329
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:58,448
<i>means so much to me
as a Mexican- American...</i>

330
00:24:01,594 --> 00:24:04,154
<i>because Santa Rosa is Spanish...</i>

331
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:06,625
<i>for "Saint Rose."</i>

332
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:11,499
I knew when you stopped showing up
at the Bears and the Optimist...

333
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,402
that you must really be down in the dumps.

334
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:17,637
Yeah, I guess. Look, I want to go someplace
where you can get a drink.

335
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:21,669
- How about a Major Weenie?
- Oh, no!

336
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,237
A foot of fun.

337
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,886
<i>- Your order, please.
- Hiya, pup.</i>

338
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,655
Wanna fetch us two El Majors...

339
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:38,760
a couple orders of fries,
and two vanilla shakes.

340
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:43,058
No, make it make it one vanilla shake
and one black coffee.

341
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,031
<i>- Will that be all?</i>
- I think <i>so, Major.</i>

342
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:50,336
<i>Are you sure
you don't want a vanilla shake, Andy?</i>

343
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,611
<i>You'll be sorry.</i>

344
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:57,246
<i>You know, sometimes I think
it's this town that's getting to me.</i>

345
00:24:57,316 --> 00:25:00,012
<i>I mean, I've lived here all my life, right?</i>

346
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,987
<i>Maybe I should go someplace
completely new, a big city.</i>

347
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:06,855
<i>Andy, the grass is always greener
on the other side of the hill.</i>

348
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:09,918
<i>Andy, you're crazy
to think about moving to a big city.</i>

349
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:14,797
<i>I had my own mortuary in LA for eight years,
hell, the pace damn near killed me!</i>

350
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:22,006
You get caught
on the Hollywood freeway at 4:00 pm...

351
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,065
with a loaded hearse, and you're in trouble.

352
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:26,976
- The big one's for you.
- I always knew you were a big weenie.

353
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,776
Why are you here?
Haven't you just had lunch with the girls?

354
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,339
I'm getting lunch for my embalmers.

355
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:34,511
They don't like to go out. Takes them
too long to wash their hands.

356
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:37,556
Andy, you stop all this talk
about leaving town, do you hear me?

357
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,284
Come on, can we get out of here?

358
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,689
Andy!

359
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:43,025
<i>Who's gonna pay for all this stuff?</i>

360
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,724
That's another thing I hate about this town.

361
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:48,995
Everybody's always sticking his nose
in everybody else's business.

362
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,902
- I want a drink.
- All righty, we'll go to my office.

363
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,668
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to have one toddy for the body.

364
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:01,869
Actually, I feel just the opposite.

365
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:04,379
Attaboy.

366
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,711
I like to know my neighbors.
Especially in a small town like this.

367
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:14,052
Don't you, really?

368
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:17,219
I'm beginning to think
that's a crock of shit, too.

369
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,821
Come on, Andy.
You're just having a bad day.

370
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:24,632
I mean, look at all the razzing
we have at all those meetings.

371
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:28,364
The teasing, all of the fining, all that stuff.

372
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,935
- But that's all really just fun, isn't it?
- Doesn't seem like fun to me anymore.

373
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,445
I never know what to say to you
when you say something like that to me.

374
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:41,247
I know something that will be fun.
This Friday night, huh?

375
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:45,122
The cry of the Rooster.

376
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,490
Come on. You actually gonna sit there
and tell me this coming Friday night...

377
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:54,055
at the Exhausted Rooster Ceremony,
that you're not gonna have a good time?

378
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:58,092
Bullshit! That's the stuff I'm talking about!

379
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:01,906
That a guy turns 35,
and the Jaycees make a big deal...

380
00:27:01,974 --> 00:27:03,839
about tossing him out
because he's too old?

381
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,107
Listen to yourself. What did you just say?
"A guy turns 35."

382
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:12,176
That's really what's bugging you, isn't it?
That you're about to turn 35?

383
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:13,479
Maybe.

384
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,626
Or maybe I don't see what's fun
about kissing a dead chicken's ass.

385
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:24,185
That's 'cause you haven't tried it.

386
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:27,098
"Certainly, external beauty is important...

387
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,192
"but the National Committee
would like to remind all judges...

388
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:33,170
"of that which Bacon had in mind,
when he said:

389
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,300
'"That is the best part of beauty,
which a picture cannot express.'

390
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,036
"We're looking for an inner beauty.

391
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:44,242
"A depth of personality,
a plain zest for living.

392
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:49,381
"In short, select a girl that you would be
proud to have as your own daughter."

393
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,446
Any questions?

394
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:55,122
- How long do we have with each girl?
- Ten minutes.

395
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,096
Marie, could you tell us why you think...

396
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:01,725
you'd like to go into missionary work?
In your own words.

397
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:06,768
It's like if I can share my culture
with someone else...

398
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,069
that way I can learn about theirs...

399
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:13,043
and enrich my own life as well as,
hopefully, enriching theirs.

400
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,740
Plus, the idea of helping one another.

401
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:18,543
Do you get an enjoyment
out of helping others?

402
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:22,383
Yes, I have. We have
a handicapped Olympics every year...

403
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:27,183
and we help them get to their races
and their events on time.

404
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:30,027
And, their winning is just...

405
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:33,031
It's the most fantastic thing to experience.

406
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:36,899
Not only themselves, but yourself,
for just helping a little.

407
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:39,164
Well, I'd like to be a nurse.

408
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:46,440
I think that would be one of the best ways
that I could do things for other people.

409
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:53,382
You see, I want to be
a veterinarian, or a nun...

410
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,682
because I like helping others.

411
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:59,020
Yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun.
I like helping people.

412
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:01,992
Robin, I noticed that in your senior year...

413
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:04,791
you went to work part- time at J.C. Penney's.

414
00:29:04,864 --> 00:29:08,391
And yet you still managed
to keep your 4.0 grade average.

415
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:12,603
Did you find that difficult,
to work and still get good grades?

416
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,403
Of course.

417
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,742
I'll bet you found...

418
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,441
that the experience of working
was an education in itself.

419
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,117
Yes, it was.
I met a lot of different kinds of people.

420
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,784
- And did you- - 
- What would...

421
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:33,953
Go right ahead, Father. It's all yours.

422
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,494
What would you do if your best friend
was unwed and pregnant?

423
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:41,463
Excuse me?

424
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:47,265
Would you advise her
to have the baby or seek an abortion?

425
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,709
I thought a lot about that last year...

426
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:03,186
when California was thinking about voting...

427
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:06,053
on whether to legalize abortion or not.

428
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:11,094
I read a lot about that,
and my mom and I talked about it.

429
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,453
And?

430
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:15,024
What did you decide?

431
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,869
I decided I was glad
I wasn't old enough to vote.

432
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:25,710
That's a terrific answer, Father.

433
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:33,875
I see here that you've been a flutist
for nine years.

434
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:37,850
Boy, you must have been so small
when you started out...

435
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,915
that that was practically
the only instrument you could hold.

436
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:44,087
I love the flute.
I'm gonna play it in the pageant.

437
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:47,462
By the looks of all these
wonderful music awards that you've won...

438
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:50,661
we're certainly in for quite a treat, aren't we?

439
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:55,701
Why do you like to play the flute, dear?
In your own words.

440
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,101
Lots of reasons, I guess.

441
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,438
Well, it sounds so pretty.

442
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:10,652
And when I play it right, it fills me up inside.

443
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:16,891
I do guess I like being in the spotlight,
it's glamorous and exciting.

444
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,131
And you must be pleased as punch,
making all those other people happy.

445
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,531
Pardon me?

446
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:26,467
The other people who are listening
to you playing the flute.

447
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:30,440
Nothing lightens a person's spirit
or brightens their load like a little music.

448
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:32,602
- Isn't that right, Robin?
- Oh, yes.

449
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:36,375
I think my music is one of the best ways
I can help others.

450
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:48,856
Jerry, you told me Fort Worth was all set,
and now you want to lower the price.

451
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:53,897
I realize it's a summer show,
but why should they pay so much less?

452
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,357
Shit.

453
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,970
It's harder to stage dances in the summer.
It's more sweat.

454
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:08,207
Tell them there's absolutely no way
I'll take the job at that price.

455
00:32:08,914 --> 00:32:12,475
And if that doesn't work,
then fall on your knees and beg.

456
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:18,547
I'll be back Sunday, unless I decide
to stay here for the polling seminar.

457
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:25,352
Oh, well.

458
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:36,063
Mr. French, we have a show
to do in two days. You're 40 minutes late.

459
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,735
- Forgive me, Mr. Sheep.
- That's Shears.

460
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:45,443
I realize that you and I
have gotten off to a rather shaky start...

461
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:49,778
but things don't have to stay that way.
What do you say?

462
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,019
Let's keep it shaky.

463
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:54,752
Okay, girls.

464
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:59,159
Oh, hell. It's 6 feet too tall. I told you.

465
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:08,835
Oh, no.

466
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:11,933
Take it from the faith and hope stuff, right?

467
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:15,310
<i>Ready to start out, singing our hearts out</i>

468
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:18,514
<i>We'll see a bright tomorrow</i>

469
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:21,280
<i>Built by youth you see today</i>

470
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:24,516
<i>We have faith, we have hope</i>

471
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:28,384
<i>We can see a brighter day</i>

472
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,825
We're here singing
And we're here to dance

473
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:31,988
Move!

474
00:33:32,064 --> 00:33:34,862
<i>And everyone's here with an equal chance</i>

475
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:38,596
<i>To be crowned a Young American</i>

476
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:44,571
<i>Young American Miss</i>

477
00:34:05,097 --> 00:34:08,066
And one, kick, three and four!

478
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:10,160
Hold it!

479
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,798
- Another luncheon.
- Are these the guys that roar?

480
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:18,604
No, these are the ones
with tassels on their hats.

481
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:23,114
Folks, please, now this is No Man's Land,
and I'm telling you, you can't get- -

482
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:47,433
Where is he?

483
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:50,339
We should have never let
the little asshole Freddy in on this.

484
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,173
He better show!
We now have $36 worth of orders.

485
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,337
Jesus!

486
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:57,405
I got it all worked out.
$1.50 for back shot with butt.

487
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,280
$2.50 for frontal shots.

488
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:03,117
And $5 if I can get a shot
with two naked girls touching each other.

489
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,587
Where's Freddy?

490
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,429
- What took you so long?
- I got here, didn't I?

491
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:15,092
Complete with camera
and my own personal zoom lens.

492
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,964
You're weird, Freddy.

493
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,865
- Where's the film?
- Isn't it in there?

494
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:23,339
- No.
- But in the ads, the film is always in there.

495
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,603
You asshole! I'm gonna kick your butt!

496
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:27,304
Come on!

497
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,110
- You're dead!
- We got no time to argue.

498
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:32,207
You tore my shirt, you faggot!

499
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:35,014
So we missed the girls
putting on their clothes.

500
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:38,215
We'll get some film and catch them
when they come back from lunch...

501
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,814
taking off their clothes.

502
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:42,289
Yeah. Taking off their clothes.

503
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,926
Let's go.
Boy, I can't wait to see these pictures.

504
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:49,127
You want to see something
that will develop even faster than the film?

505
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,926
Pick up my bike.

506
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:52,964
Eat it!

507
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:03,638
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mr. Greener.

508
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:05,647
Have you got film for this camera?

509
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:09,084
We've been to two other stores,
and they're both out.

510
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:13,591
You're in luck. Guaranteed shipment
coming in first thing in the morning.

511
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,356
- Santa Rosa sucks.
- Wait a minute, boys.

512
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,757
If there's something special happening,
I'll lend you a camera with film.

513
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,359
- You will?
- Sure.

514
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:26,768
Would this be a Polaroid camera?

515
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,806
Sorry, those babies are never for loan.

516
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,366
So you'd have to send the film to a lab?

517
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:36,540
Sure. But, don't worry.
I'll check every print myself.

518
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:42,253
No, thanks, Mr. Greener, we'll be back
in the morning for the Polaroid film.

519
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,986
<i>Even Jake, the plumber
He's a man I adore</i>

520
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:55,595
Had the nerve to tell me
he's been married before!

521
00:36:56,301 --> 00:37:00,761
<i>Everyone knows that I'm just
Secondhand Rose</i>

522
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:05,934
<i>From Second Avenue!</i>

523
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:07,370
<i>Oy vey!</i>

524
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,143
Next.

525
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:22,658
Well, hello.

526
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,128
Are you here to sing or to make butter?

527
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,765
They told me to come in costume.

528
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:33,828
No, dear, that's tomorrow.

529
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:39,002
I don't like that music man.

530
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:42,145
He's mean to the Young American Misses.

531
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:46,775
It's a depressing thing to see one person
being mean to another person.

532
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:51,846
I need a drink.

533
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,265
For those who think young.

534
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:19,047
What is it, Mr. Nakas?

535
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:31,385
It's starting.

536
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:34,263
I told them it would start, and it started.

537
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,858
- What?
- The pipes are backed up.

538
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:41,233
I can hear them moaning and grumbling
and starting to choke.

539
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,937
I can't hear nothing.

540
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:46,970
I got an acute sense of hearing pipes.

541
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,372
There they go.

542
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:55,946
They're fed up with swallowing Kotex.

543
00:38:57,189 --> 00:38:58,588
Who wouldn't be?

544
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:02,324
I don't really think of it
as a competition that much...

545
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:06,421
because we all want to win, but we're
not really competing with each other.

546
00:39:06,498 --> 00:39:07,863
We're more friends.

547
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:11,960
I guess I'll just be happy that I was here.

548
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:14,870
I think it was a good opportunity for me...

549
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,373
and I've met a lot of people...

550
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:21,009
Next to my mom and dad,
I guess I'd have to say my accordion.

551
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,107
The Young American Miss from Salinas,
Maria Gonzales.

552
00:39:25,684 --> 00:39:27,652
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're next.

553
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:30,517
What is that, dear?

554
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:35,824
I thought the judges would be hungry
after helping us so long...

555
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,863
so I made them a specialty
of my native land.

556
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:41,895
It's guacamole dip.

557
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,427
Like you did for the Bears.

558
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:46,526
<i>Si.</i>

559
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:51,970
God, how can you stand
being her roommate?

560
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,370
It's all right.

561
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:57,404
She spends most of her time in the kitchen
making guacamole dip.

562
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:02,412
Abraham Lincoln and Pancho Villa
symbolize my own theory...

563
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:16,593
Hello, this is Ernestine, the operator,
calling for Miss Pearl Bailey.

564
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:21,031
Well, I'm sorry if she's tired,
but could you please put her on?

565
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:22,863
It's very important.

566
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,239
Their parents made them beautiful,
not them.

567
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,641
I got it.

568
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:34,380
Boys get money and scholarships
for making a lot of touchdowns, right?

569
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:37,755
Why shouldn't a girl get one
for being cute and charming?

570
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:42,783
Yeah, but maybe boys shouldn't be
getting money for making touchdowns.

571
00:40:47,332 --> 00:40:51,792
Hello, this is Ernestine, the operator.
Who am I speaking to?

572
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:57,666
This is Edith Bunker, the dingbat.

573
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:01,103
And one, two, three, four.

574
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:03,773
Coming along. Okay, now watch this.

575
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:06,317
And kick and bend.

576
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:14,422
No, if you kick and bend at the same time,
you're going to knock yourself out.

577
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:17,223
All right, once again. Here we go, and...

578
00:41:17,496 --> 00:41:20,795
<i>Spring is here!</i>

579
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:25,569
<i>Why doesn't the breeze delight me?</i>

580
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:29,432
<i>Stars appear!</i>

581
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:33,676
<i>Why doesn't the night invite me?</i>

582
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:36,973
<i>Maybe it's because nobody loves me</i>

583
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,709
I went to Juilliard for this?

584
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,477
We all went to Juilliard.

585
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:48,290
<i>Spring is here, I hear!</i>

586
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:56,428
<i>Summer in the sunshine</i>

587
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,368
<i>Days that never end</i>

588
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:06,102
<i>When the spotlight</i>

589
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:11,309
DiCarlo Trophies.

590
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,374
Golfer awards?

591
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:15,615
Worst golfer awards?

592
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:19,781
Hey, Andy. You got the trophies?

593
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:22,725
- Yeah, I'm working on them.
- Working on them?

594
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:25,262
What the hell, Andy,
the first show's tonight.

595
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,525
Your wife told me to come over
and pick them up.

596
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,590
You tell my wife to go...

597
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:35,168
It's a little drunken golfer
leaning on his putter.

598
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,841
Alan, tell my wife I'm working on them.

599
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:43,541
- Ramon will bring them over this afternoon.
- Okay, you're the boss.

600
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:48,152
No, she's the boss. She just doesn't know
how to make trophies.

601
00:42:48,887 --> 00:42:53,085
Now, at this point, I take my sparklers
and I light them with my Torch of Freedom.

602
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,386
But you don't have to worry- -

603
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,723
But let's not put
too much powder in these things.

604
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:00,026
If we're gonna have a fire,
save it for the last night.

605
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:02,566
I know how to handle my equipment.

606
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:06,195
Now, I want red and green gels
at both the spots at my entrance...

607
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:09,900
and I want the senior klieg at 50%
when I do my high tosses because- -

608
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:13,103
- Yeah, yeah.
- Por favor, you're on.

609
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:19,815
Helga, when you go out there, be sure to...

610
00:43:19,884 --> 00:43:22,478
Will you please shut the door?

611
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:24,312
<i>Amigos!</i>

612
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:29,019
I would like to tell you the tale
of two great nations.

613
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:32,325
One, my humble place of birth.

614
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:35,423
And one, my new homeland!

615
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:38,531
Applause, applause, applause.

616
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:43,936
To tell you this tale, I will need the help
of two old friends.

617
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:47,274
These are my friends.

618
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:48,471
Cue tape.

619
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:51,946
One is named Chico...

620
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:54,747
and the other's named Joe.

621
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:57,879
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you guessed it.

622
00:43:57,956 --> 00:44:00,447
This is a tale about, of course...

623
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:05,019
Mexico, and these United States!

624
00:44:05,096 --> 00:44:06,256
Gross.

625
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:11,128
In the beginning,
these two great neighboring giants...

626
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:13,568
hardly knew each other existed.

627
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:16,365
But soon, they discovered each other...

628
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:20,537
and their respect for each other
grew higher...

629
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,272
Last night she gave
our host parents a pinata.

630
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:29,878
- I'm gonna get her.
- Do you want me to help?

631
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:31,113
Yeah.

632
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,759
We'll do it as soon as we're sure we've lost.

633
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:37,493
...forever...

634
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:41,926
by these two wonderful,
marvelous countries.

635
00:44:56,848 --> 00:45:00,181
Excuse me, dear. I'm going to interrupt you
just for a moment.

636
00:45:00,251 --> 00:45:01,980
Girls, I'd like you to meet...

637
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:06,114
California's reigning Young American Miss,
Jo Ann Marshall.

638
00:45:07,892 --> 00:45:11,328
And these are some of the former winners
and has- beens.

639
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:16,226
Jo Ann and the girls are going to be
rehearsing with you today...

640
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:19,102
Girls, here's our emcee...

641
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,071
the real star of the show, Ted Farley.

642
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,443
Hi, girls. I'm sorry to hear about
the little problem you had with the toilets...

643
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:31,243
but as they say in France, "No wee- wee."

644
00:45:41,393 --> 00:45:44,226
- Keep the motor running.
- I got my motor running.

645
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:45,557
Jeez.

646
00:46:03,014 --> 00:46:06,575
- Where do you think you're going?
- l'm looking for my dad.

647
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:10,678
Your dad's not around here.
Unless he's a teenage girl.

648
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:13,656
- No, my dad is Robert Freelander.
- Big Bob?

649
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:16,085
Yeah, you must be Little Bob.

650
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:17,992
- Yeah, Little Bob.
- Yeah, right.

651
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:19,996
Say, what can I do for you back here?

652
00:46:20,064 --> 00:46:23,830
Well, I was supposed to meet my father
and I've looked all over.

653
00:46:23,902 --> 00:46:26,700
Now, you know Big Bob.
Everywhere at once.

654
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,603
Tell you what now, nobody's
supposed to be back here on this path...

655
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:33,041
since you're Little Bob,
I think it'll be all right.

656
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:34,135
Yeah, thanks.

657
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:37,204
Tell you what, why don't you look
down there by those telephones?

658
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:39,307
I think you'll find him there. Okay?

659
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:42,945
- All right, we'll see you later, little buddy.
- Goodbye.

660
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:14,374
Oh. my God!

661
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,469
Somebody's at the window!

662
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:33,824
I was looking for my dad.
Big Bob. Good old Big Bob.

663
00:48:34,432 --> 00:48:38,095
I tripped and fell in there.
I wasn't taking any pictures of the girls.

664
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,296
I swear on my mother's life!

665
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:13,094
Thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen...

666
00:50:13,164 --> 00:50:14,722
Sorry, it's the lights.

667
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:17,962
<i>Me ol' bam- boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam- boo</i>

668
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:19,697
<i>You can have me hat or me bumber- shoot</i>

669
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:25,505
<i>But you better never bother
with me ol' bam- boo</i>

670
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:47,725
She's fine!

671
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,599
Easy, easy. Hold her carefully.
Stand back, kids. Give her some air!

672
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,933
You're all right. She's fine.

673
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:56,803
- Now give her some air.
- She's fine. Everything is fine.

674
00:50:56,874 --> 00:50:58,205
She'll be all right.

675
00:50:58,276 --> 00:51:01,336
- Who is that?
- Maureen somebody.

676
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,714
What happened?

677
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:07,148
One of the girls fainted. She'll be all right.

678
00:51:07,218 --> 00:51:10,551
Did she trip? Trip over a nail or something
we could be sued for?

679
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:13,385
No, and I'll tell her how concerned you were.

680
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:17,155
- Jesus Christ, she scared me half to death.
- I almost fainted.

681
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:19,661
Well, it is one less competition.

682
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:24,334
God, I'm really sorry I said that.

683
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:27,397
- I have an awful confession to make.
- Yeah?

684
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:31,374
You know when Maureen fainted?
The same thing crossed my mind.

685
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:34,802
- It's getting weird.
- Judy!

686
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,990
Has anybody seen my butter churn?

687
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,021
Now listen. Just listen.

688
00:51:55,833 --> 00:52:00,327
In about two minutes, you'll go out there
and be professional dancers.

689
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:03,633
Your job is to make the audience happy.

690
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:07,071
I know that a lot of you are scared
and don't think you can do it.

691
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:11,172
But I've been watching you all
very carefully, and I know that you can.

692
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:14,446
Now I'd like you to think
about a 17- year- old kid...

693
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:18,319
who came to me when I was staging dances
for the Mike Curb Congregation.

694
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:20,653
She hadn't had a bit of experience...

695
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:24,252
but she wanted to try so bad
that we just had to let her.

696
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:26,964
That was four years ago...

697
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:30,523
and now that girl
is one of the Mike Curb lead dancers.

698
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:34,427
Now, that may not seem like much
to you ladies...

699
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:37,201
but that girl has a wooden foot.

700
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,909
Now go out there and dance
with your two good feet.

701
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,683
That was really a beautiful story.

702
00:52:49,754 --> 00:52:53,485
Listen, I have a syndicated radio show
heard in four states.

703
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:56,549
I'm always looking
for inspirational youth stories.

704
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:59,357
- Do you mind if I use that?
- Be my guest.

705
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,398
But it's total bullshit.

706
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:05,826
- Hello!
- Hello!

707
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,427
<i>Who says hello?</i>

708
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:09,629
Young America!

709
00:53:09,707 --> 00:53:13,040
- Are you all here?
- Yes, we're all here!

710
00:53:19,717 --> 00:53:22,811
<i>Ready to start out, singing our hearts out</i>

711
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,822
<i>We can see a bright tomorrow</i>

712
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,654
<i>Built by youth you see today</i>

713
00:53:28,726 --> 00:53:31,524
<i>We have faith, we have hope</i>

714
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:35,054
<i>We can see a brighter day</i>

715
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:38,226
We're here to sing
We're here to dance

716
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,862
<i>Everyone's here with an equal chance</i>

717
00:53:40,938 --> 00:53:44,271
<i>To be crowned a Young American</i>

718
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:50,378
<i>Young American Miss</i>

719
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:54,381
<i>- Pick your favorite and sing along
- Tap your feet and sing our song</i>

720
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:57,444
<i>We can see a bright tomorrow</i>

721
00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:00,080
<i>Built by youth you see today</i>

722
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:05,959
<i>We have faith, we have hope</i>

723
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:12,060
<i>We can see a brighter day</i>

724
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:17,605
Take it away!

725
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:34,952
<i>Hi, I'm Jo Ann Marshall,
California's Young American Miss.</i>

726
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:38,827
<i>And I'd like to welcome you
to tonight's first preliminary show...</i>

727
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:41,023
<i>and invite you back for tomorrow's show.</i>

728
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:43,828
<i>And the really big show, Saturday night.</i>

729
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:11,819
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

730
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:15,127
<i>Me ol' bam- boo
You better never bother with me o!' ham- boo</i>

731
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,962
<i>You can have me hat or me bumber- shoot</i>

732
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:19,594
<i>But you better never bother
with me ol' bam- boo</i>

733
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:30,413
You know something?
You did a hell of a job.

734
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:35,112
Took a bunch of nice high- school kids,
and turned them into Vegas showgirls.

735
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,093
<i>On each of these preliminary nights,
we feature and judge...</i>

736
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:45,099
<i>the creative talents of the girls
from one color group.</i>

737
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:49,433
<i>Tonight, settle back, relax, and enjoy
the creative talents of the peach group.</i>

738
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:51,564
<i>This could mean 30 points to them.</i>

739
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:56,611
<i>Doria has written and will deliver an essay
based on personal experience.</i>

740
00:55:57,045 --> 00:56:01,243
<i>Here she is, Anaheim 's
Young American Miss, Doria Houston.</i>

741
00:56:03,852 --> 00:56:05,581
<i>Beauty, yes.</i>

742
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,256
<i>Curly hair, floppy hat...</i>

743
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,519
<i>glittery dresses, they were in...</i>

744
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,391
<i>so I have them all.</i>

745
00:56:15,898 --> 00:56:20,494
<i>But one day, on my mad dash
to the cosmetics counter...</i>

746
00:56:21,236 --> 00:56:25,070
<i>I stumbled by chance into a library.</i>

747
00:56:30,646 --> 00:56:33,410
<i>"To thine own self be true."</i>

748
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:38,083
<i>At last! had found a beauty aid
that didn't come in a bottle:</i>

749
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:41,487
<i>Simplicity.</i>

750
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:47,388
<i>I learned that one single solid gold strand...</i>

751
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:52,395
<i>could be more beautiful
than all my costume jewelry.</i>

752
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:45,008
<i>Off came the silly shoes,
the hat, all that glittered.</i>

753
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:49,116
<i>Soon with shiny nonsense
my floor was littered.</i>

754
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:52,123
<i>If you wanna be a real cutie...</i>

755
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:55,022
<i>always strive for inner beauty.</i>

756
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:03,498
<i>'Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow.</i>

757
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:07,997
<i>”They work not, they toil not.</i>

758
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:14,579
<i>”Yet I say unto you
That even Solomon in all his glory...</i>

759
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,118
<i>"was not so beautiful as these."</i>

760
00:58:24,726 --> 00:58:26,057
<i>Thank you.</i>

761
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,998
<i>And now, a double treat.</i>

762
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:33,464
<i>Healdsburg's Young American Miss,
Bobbi Erickson...</i>

763
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:36,766
<i>will play the ever popular
and thrilling Ebb</i> Tide...

764
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,275
<i>and simultaneously she will
at the same time exhibit her paintings.</i>

765
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:44,041
<i>A feast for both eyes and ears.</i>

766
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:33,289
<i>Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?</i>

767
00:59:33,795 --> 00:59:38,789
<i>Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?</i>

768
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:43,633
<i>And did I hear you say
he was meeting you here today</i>

769
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:49,376
<i>To take you to his mansion in the sky</i>

770
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:11,223
<i>You were meant for me</i>

771
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:16,569
<i>I was meant for you</i>

772
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:22,667
<i>Nature patterned you
And when she was done</i>

773
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:28,582
<i>You were all the sweet things
Rolled up in one</i>

774
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:01,282
<i>'Rotting maggots of death...</i>

775
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,147
<i>'trawling out of the skull of war.</i>

776
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:07,049
<i>"Vomit...</i>

777
01:01:07,722 --> 01:01:11,488
<i>”and blood run freely over the battlefield.”</i>

778
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:23,929
<i>Even in the Young American Miss's concern
of her own personal appearance...</i>

779
01:01:24,005 --> 01:01:25,563
<i>and the way she conducts herself...</i>

780
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,474
<i>gives to others the feeling
that she cares for them. And she does.</i>

781
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:31,910
<i>We share with her
this concern for the individual...</i>

782
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,711
<i>as she participates now
in the Gown and Grace Division.</i>

783
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:16,017
- Where are you going?
- Oh, Mr. French.

784
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:18,582
Quit bawling, Robin.
You just had a lucky break.

785
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,959
Now they'll notice you.
So go out there, and use it.

786
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:29,029
<i>Hi. I'm Helga Kleinsmidth,
Vacaville's Young American Miss...</i>

787
01:02:29,237 --> 01:02:32,673
<i>and I think it's fun to have pillow fights
on Sunday morning...</i>

788
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:34,868
<i>before church with my folks.</i>

789
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,485
<i>Buenas hashes. I am Maria Gonzales...</i>

790
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:49,388
<i>and I think it is fun to live in a land
of equal opportunity for all its citizens...</i>

791
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:52,358
<i>regardless of race, creed, or color.</i>

792
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,903
<i>Hi, I'm Robin Gibson,
Antelope Valley's Young American Miss...</i>

793
01:03:05,106 --> 01:03:08,735
<i>and I think it's embarrassing
to have your umbrella break.</i>

794
01:03:11,279 --> 01:03:12,871
They learn fast.

795
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,448
<i>Our fourth judge is a former
Young American Miss from 1966...</i>

796
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:25,588
<i>Miss Gloria Randall.</i>

797
01:03:30,699 --> 01:03:34,328
<i>Didn't I tell you, folks,
the girls get prettier every year?</i>

798
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:39,906
<i>And again this year, holding the envelopes
with the names of tonight's winners...</i>

799
01:03:39,975 --> 01:03:44,435
<i>our Dean of judges and a winner
in his own right, Big Bob Freelander.</i>

800
01:03:44,512 --> 01:03:46,537
<i>Big Bob, hey!</i>

801
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:51,008
Welcome, folks!

802
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:55,352
I know you came to see a whale of a show,
and a whale of a show it is.

803
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:58,019
How does Santa Rosa feel about that?

804
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,658
<i>But you know, folks...</i>

805
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:09,363
<i>to these talented
and lovely high- school girls...</i>

806
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:12,133
<i>from all over this great state of ours...</i>

807
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:14,903
<i>this is a lot more than just another show.</i>

808
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,376
<i>Tonight, for them, is the big one.</i>

809
01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:20,880
<i>Of course, this is just a preliminary night.</i>

810
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:23,850
<i>Tickets are still on sale
for the next two nights- - </i>

811
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:26,978
<i>Right, three nights in all.
Four winners each night.</i>

812
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:28,283
Lots of winners.

813
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:36,883
Doria, you know the judges
were dumb, anyway.

814
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:39,823
You were much better
than that girl that won.

815
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,829
You don't have to
cheer me up anymore, Robin.

816
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,925
What the hell,
now that I know I'm not winning anything...

817
01:05:47,268 --> 01:05:48,667
I can smoke.

818
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,870
I thought we weren't supposed
to smoke around the girls.

819
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,808
That's what the committee said.

820
01:05:56,878 --> 01:05:58,505
If she can smoke, I can smoke.

821
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,515
They told us a lot of girls
didn't win the preliminaries...

822
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,848
they went on to win the contest.
I mean, talent's only part of it.

823
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:08,184
Forget it, Robin.
Talent was my ace in the hole.

824
01:06:08,456 --> 01:06:11,983
If they don't like me taking off my clothes,
they're gonna hate my grades.

825
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,790
You shouldn't be so sure
you're not gonna win.

826
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:16,455
I don't mind it.

827
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:20,392
I did at first,
now it's kind of a relief, you know.

828
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,130
Besides, now I can pass
all my little tricks on to you.

829
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:26,400
Tricks?

830
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,741
Yeah, I guess I should have before,
but we were in competition.

831
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:32,973
What kind of tricks?

832
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:36,807
Little things I know that you don't.

833
01:06:36,918 --> 01:06:38,249
Like what?

834
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:40,977
Like tonight, for instance.

835
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,156
You didn't jump up and down enough
when Miss Woodland won.

836
01:06:44,225 --> 01:06:47,558
And you didn't even cry
when you won yourself.

837
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,823
Is that bad?

838
01:06:48,897 --> 01:06:52,526
It sure is. Beauty contest judges
like their emotions big.

839
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,360
And you don't smile enough.

840
01:06:55,436 --> 01:06:58,030
My God, I've smiled so much
my gums are raw.

841
01:06:58,106 --> 01:07:00,802
Put some Vaseline on your teeth.
It helps your- -

842
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,673
- lt helps your lips glide over them.
- You're kidding me.

843
01:07:03,745 --> 01:07:05,713
No. All the girls do it.

844
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,749
And Maria Gonzales puts enough on
to grease a flagpole.

845
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,079
- No!
- Yes.

846
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:12,412
Get some pantyhose.

847
01:07:13,054 --> 01:07:16,251
Bare legs are kind of splotchy
under the spotlights.

848
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:20,226
- Doria, I'm not gonna do all that.
- You're crazy not to.

849
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,763
You have a real chance
of winning the money.

850
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,731
- Get off it.
- Robin, you do.

851
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,790
Look, you've already won
Vim and Vigor, right?

852
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:30,463
You have great grades and
you play the flute, which is a classic talent.

853
01:07:30,538 --> 01:07:33,268
If you'd just keep smiling, you can win.

854
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:38,069
And it wouldn't hurt to mention
once in a while that you have no father.

855
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,580
Was that a terrible thing to say?

856
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,584
No. It's just that they keep telling us
this thing isn't a competition.

857
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:49,685
It's a competition.

858
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:57,022
<i>I still don't understand
how you could do this to me.</i>

859
01:07:57,098 --> 01:07:59,623
Dad, I wasn't doing anything to you.

860
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:01,997
You hurt the pageant, hurt me.

861
01:08:02,337 --> 01:08:06,137
Seven years without a scandal,
and now my own son causes one.

862
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:09,968
- What am I supposed to say to people?
- Tell them I'm adopted.

863
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,638
Robert Freelander, Jr.,
you have a sassy mouth.

864
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,114
You should be a little humble
after what you did.

865
01:08:15,183 --> 01:08:16,844
Now wipe that off.

866
01:08:16,951 --> 01:08:19,078
I don't see why I have to see a psychiatrist.

867
01:08:19,153 --> 01:08:21,587
Do you want to go to jail?
That's the big alternative.

868
01:08:21,656 --> 01:08:23,385
Come on, we'll go to jail.

869
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:25,756
- Do you want to go to jail?
- No.

870
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,851
- And you're gonna go in here now?
- Yes.

871
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:32,559
Take your hands out of your pocket.
You're very lucky you're my son, you know.

872
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,967
If this doctor thinks I'm crazy,
wait till he meets Freddy.

873
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:43,943
<i>Dr. Kelly. Code Blue, five east.</i>

874
01:08:54,122 --> 01:08:55,487
Here it is.

875
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,959
- Mrs. Chambers- - 
- lt's my fault. I feel guilty.

876
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:06,295
Hi, Doctor.

877
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:10,428
Your appointment will be in a few moments.
Would you mind, please?

878
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:40,930
I must admit I'm really not too sold
on this psychiatry stuff myself.

879
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,567
Seems like an awful lot of self- pity in it
to me.

880
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,107
You may come in now.

881
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,010
- Please have a chair.
- Where's Mrs. Chambers?

882
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:57,381
She left.

883
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,217
Oh, two entrances.

884
01:10:03,191 --> 01:10:05,250
Make yourself comfortable.

885
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,294
Now, you're Robert Freelander.

886
01:10:11,366 --> 01:10:13,425
No, we're both Robert Freelander.

887
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:15,526
Big Bob. Little Bob.

888
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:19,806
How long have you
called your son Little Bob?

889
01:10:20,074 --> 01:10:23,805
Why, ever since he was little.

890
01:10:33,087 --> 01:10:37,751
Actually, I'd hoped to meet both parents
at the initial consultation.

891
01:10:37,892 --> 01:10:40,690
Mrs. Freelander is ill. She's got the flu.

892
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:43,791
She got it the minute I got in trouble.

893
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,560
Does your mother get sick often?

894
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:48,033
Doctor, we're not here to discuss my wife.

895
01:10:48,269 --> 01:10:51,636
Your wife is this boy's mother.
In order to discuss his problems- -

896
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:55,904
What are you guys always trying
to pin everything on a guy's mother for?

897
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,541
Mr. Freelander, are you angry with me?

898
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:05,342
No, I'm not angry at you.

899
01:11:10,124 --> 01:11:12,456
Of course I'm not angry at you.

900
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:15,685
I'm just trying to help Little...

901
01:11:17,331 --> 01:11:20,357
You and I are both here
trying to help my son.

902
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,379
We could begin the consultations
alone with the boy.

903
01:11:35,616 --> 01:11:38,676
And then you and your wife
could join us later.

904
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:48,320
No, I'd like to see Little Bob
through this thing myself.

905
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:50,324
It'd be okay, Dad.

906
01:11:56,804 --> 01:12:00,501
It is pageant week.
Unbelievable amounts of work down there.

907
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:02,440
No rest for the weary.

908
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:06,069
I understand.

909
01:12:06,347 --> 01:12:09,714
Well, you run on,
and we'll see you in a couple of sessions.

910
01:12:11,352 --> 01:12:13,013
That'd be just super.

911
01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:17,023
How about you, son? You gonna be able
to get to school on your own, are you then?

912
01:12:17,091 --> 01:12:19,889
- I do it every day.
- Right.

913
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:22,796
Independent little guy.

914
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,724
Nice to meet you.

915
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:31,029
Son, you pay attention to this man now.
He is a doctor.

916
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:44,681
Hi, Blanche. How about some coffee
and a glazed doughnut?

917
01:12:44,752 --> 01:12:47,585
And don't charge me for the hole, Blanche.

918
01:12:49,056 --> 01:12:52,150
They told me at the shop that you'd be here.

919
01:12:52,226 --> 01:12:55,161
- Having a second breakfast there?
- First.

920
01:12:55,897 --> 01:13:00,596
I just wanted to make sure you were coming
to the Exhausted Rooster Ceremony tonight.

921
01:13:01,135 --> 01:13:02,500
I don't think so, Bob.

922
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:05,061
Come on, Andy.
The guys are really counting on you.

923
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:07,437
Look, I told you I just don't feel...

924
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,341
Thank you, my dear. Quick as ever.

925
01:13:14,482 --> 01:13:17,974
Look, I told you I just don't feel like
kissing a dead chicken's ass.

926
01:13:18,052 --> 01:13:22,079
Come on, Andy. It's a snap. Like that.

927
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:25,087
Besides, I'm an Exalted Exhausted Rooster.

928
01:13:25,393 --> 01:13:27,987
I'll be standing right next to you
with my sheet on.

929
01:13:28,062 --> 01:13:29,586
There's nothing to it.

930
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:34,294
You're looking at a man who's seen
as many chickens' asses as another chicken.

931
01:13:36,237 --> 01:13:37,829
How about a bib?

932
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,774
Besides, I shouldn't have to remind
an old guzzler like you...

933
01:13:42,944 --> 01:13:46,038
of the amounts of old boozzola
that'll be there.

934
01:13:48,182 --> 01:13:50,912
I'm getting a reputation
for being a drunk, aren't I?

935
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:52,976
- No, you certainly are not.
- lt's true.

936
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,249
- No, it's not true.
- lt's true.

937
01:13:57,258 --> 01:14:01,160
First I was drinking a little,
then I was drinking a lot.

938
01:14:03,364 --> 01:14:07,425
Damn, it sure sneaks up on you.
I just sort of slid into it.

939
01:14:09,103 --> 01:14:12,038
That's one thing I'm awful good at. Sliding.

940
01:14:14,308 --> 01:14:18,472
I'm having problems with Brenda.
Sexual problems.

941
01:14:20,014 --> 01:14:23,450
No, thank you, dear. We're fine.
Just fine, thank you.

942
01:14:25,886 --> 01:14:28,013
You're not having any problems.

943
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,556
She's frigid.

944
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:33,723
That's why I started drinking.

945
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:36,486
She says it's my fault- -

946
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:43,895
She says my drinking turned her off.

947
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:47,334
I've been drinking so much,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

948
01:14:47,408 --> 01:14:50,673
Then it doesn't matter
one whole hell of a lot, does it?

949
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:55,148
You're gonna have to start pulling yourself
together and quit moping around, here.

950
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:58,617
Seriously, you got to get out there
and start having some fun.

951
01:14:58,686 --> 01:15:01,712
You can get headaches
sitting around here trying to figure out...

952
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,622
which came first: the chicken or the egg.

953
01:15:06,694 --> 01:15:08,594
Speaking of chickens...

954
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:13,823
I know a place where we can have,
this very night, some real...

955
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:16,158
fun.

956
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:22,372
All right, I'll go to the ceremony.

957
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,338
Swell.

958
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,504
You sure are one hell of a salesman.

959
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:29,614
I better be.

960
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:37,013
I heard about Little Bob.
I really am sorry about that.

961
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:41,417
Those things happen. We'll have Little Bob
straightened out in no time...

962
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,326
and right back on the right track.

963
01:15:43,397 --> 01:15:45,922
Doesn't anything ever get you down?

964
01:15:46,267 --> 01:15:49,065
Yeah, I get my apple cart upset sometimes.

965
01:15:49,303 --> 01:15:53,967
I just learned a long time ago
to accept a little less from life, that's all.

966
01:15:58,713 --> 01:16:02,080
Want to know who taught me
this great lesson in life?

967
01:16:02,817 --> 01:16:04,444
Elizabeth Taylor.

968
01:16:04,819 --> 01:16:05,945
What?

969
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:12,319
I never bothered to tell you the story
because I don't believe in negative stories...

970
01:16:13,094 --> 01:16:16,621
but one time I actually had a date
with old Liz herself.

971
01:16:16,964 --> 01:16:18,454
You're kidding.

972
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,660
Do you remember when I went off
to junior college in Los Angeles?

973
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:27,808
I had a class with a guy
that was Liz Taylor's cousin.

974
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,843
He fixed me up with her.

975
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,811
- What was she like?
- I never met her.

976
01:16:33,614 --> 01:16:37,414
- You just said- - 
- No, I just said that I had a date with her.

977
01:16:37,485 --> 01:16:39,749
I never said that she kept it.

978
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,725
You should've seen
all the preparations I made.

979
01:16:45,793 --> 01:16:49,058
I went out and got the best flowers
that I could find...

980
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,691
and a great table at the
world- famous Cocoanut Grove restaurant.

981
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:56,162
And then she never showed up.

982
01:16:56,937 --> 01:17:00,805
That was the weekend that she ran off
and married the hotel guy.

983
01:17:01,842 --> 01:17:03,207
I'm sorry.

984
01:17:03,277 --> 01:17:05,438
You don't have to be sorry.

985
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:09,313
Just that now I'm married to Roberta,
and I'm happy about it.

986
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:16,654
Even though she is
a little less than Elizabeth Taylor.

987
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,394
God, Elizabeth Taylor was beautiful.

988
01:17:27,134 --> 01:17:30,001
<i>...and that girl had a wooden foot.</i>

989
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:35,538
<i>And now, as we begin
the Creative Talent Division on this...</i>

990
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:39,568
<i>the Final Preliminary night
before the Final Big Show, tomorrow night...</i>

991
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:43,310
<i>when, at last,
our new California Young American Miss...</i>

992
01:17:43,384 --> 01:17:46,444
<i>will finally be chosen
right here on this stage...</i>

993
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,421
<i>in a burst of tears and laughter and glory.</i>

994
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,192
<i>But first...</i>

995
01:17:55,062 --> 01:17:59,226
<i>I'd just like to say a word
about how these girls have affected me...</i>

996
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,031
<i>personally.</i>

997
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:04,366
<i>Not Ted Farley, the smooth entertainer
that you see here before you...</i>

998
01:18:04,438 --> 01:18:06,338
<i>but Ted Farley, the man.</i>

999
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:09,171
- Maria, could you hook this, please?
- l'm on in a second.

1000
01:18:09,243 --> 01:18:11,871
- It's the top one.
- Here, let me do it for you.

1001
01:18:11,946 --> 01:18:15,382
<i>...not only to me, but to everybody
who has participated in the pageant.</i>

1002
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:17,883
<i>Even Ray Brandy
and all the guys in the band.</i>

1003
01:18:17,952 --> 01:18:21,115
<i>The lack of competitiveness
and the genuine desire of each girl...</i>

1004
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:23,247
I do this. It's fine, I started it. It's okay.

1005
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:27,158
<i>Just another example of what makes
America the place I'm proud to be a part of.</i>

1006
01:18:27,228 --> 01:18:30,686
<i>Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba
Said the monkey to the chimp</i>

1007
01:18:30,764 --> 01:18:34,256
<i>All night long, they'd chatter away
All day long they're happy and gay</i>

1008
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:37,600
<i>Swingin' and singin' in a honky- tonky way</i>

1009
01:18:51,218 --> 01:18:53,413
<i>And for that very special wool jacket...</i>

1010
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:57,617
<i>there's still good old tissue paper
to help keep out nasty creases.</i>

1011
01:18:58,959 --> 01:19:00,722
<i>And one final tip, girls.</i>

1012
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:28,285
And so these great nations
have gone speeding through history.

1013
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:32,856
Brown friends and white friends,
reaching out to the skies...

1014
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:35,225
in heavenly harmony!

1015
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:33,652
Hey, Big Bob! Good to see you.
How are you?

1016
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:35,416
Help me with my sheet, here.

1017
01:20:35,489 --> 01:20:37,980
Where's somebody go
to wet their whistle around here?

1018
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:40,458
- Al, son of a gun.
- Let's get a beer. Come on.

1019
01:20:40,527 --> 01:20:43,621
Hey, Pancho! How are you?

1020
01:20:48,402 --> 01:20:51,963
Look, isn't that the saddest looking bunch
of Exhausted Rooster Candidates?

1021
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:55,873
Haven't I told you every year
they get more exhausted looking?

1022
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:00,009
- Here, have a beer.
- How the hell are you, Big Bob?

1023
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:04,982
Peel that.

1024
01:21:09,256 --> 01:21:11,486
You missed out on a lot of fun.
Where've you been?

1025
01:21:11,558 --> 01:21:15,654
- Had a little trouble with the pageant.
- Good. I'll drink to that.

1026
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:18,823
That's not funny.
Some poor girl's act was ruined.

1027
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:21,925
Our first Mexican- American entry
claims her act was sabotaged.

1028
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,630
- I hardly believe that.
- I hope that's not true.

1029
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,639
Our club has spent
a lot of time and money...

1030
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:29,733
trying to help these young people
become responsible adults.

1031
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:32,340
I'll barbecue your ass!

1032
01:21:37,284 --> 01:21:39,946
Didn't I tell you it was gonna be fun?

1033
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:45,421
Didn't I tell you, as our friends south
of the border would say, "Dos pelotas!"

1034
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:50,380
I love it!

1035
01:23:57,457 --> 01:23:58,856
Come on.

1036
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,891
- What's wrong?
- Come on, Andy, be a man.

1037
01:24:39,399 --> 01:24:42,891
If Wilson can't get to the bottom of it,
I'll get into it myself tomorrow.

1038
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,303
I've got to hang up now.
Yeah, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye- bye.

1039
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:49,399
Andy, I just had the rug shampooed.

1040
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,072
Piss on the rug.

1041
01:24:58,285 --> 01:24:59,752
You're drunk.

1042
01:25:10,097 --> 01:25:11,758
What's the matter?

1043
01:25:12,633 --> 01:25:14,430
I think I'm going crazy.

1044
01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:20,806
Now, that's a stupid thing to say.

1045
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,902
I was in the park.

1046
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:25,508
Grown men horsing around in sheets.

1047
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:29,447
Big Bob grinning at me through his hood.
Either they're crazy or I'm crazy!

1048
01:25:29,516 --> 01:25:31,814
Did Big Bob tell you
what happened at the pageant- -

1049
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:35,321
- I don't give a damn about that pageant!
- Go ahead!

1050
01:25:36,356 --> 01:25:39,325
I'm used to having trouble with things I do.

1051
01:25:39,559 --> 01:25:41,789
But I'm going to go right on doing them!

1052
01:25:41,862 --> 01:25:46,424
You have to do something with your time
when you're married to the town drunk.

1053
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,776
You won't let me make up, will you?

1054
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:11,856
Brenda, that's what we're supposed to do,
comfort each other.

1055
01:26:11,925 --> 01:26:15,452
- I'm tired!
- Well, I'm tired of your being tired!

1056
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,462
You're crazy!

1057
01:26:19,933 --> 01:26:21,696
I already said that.

1058
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,535
Oh, poor thing.

1059
01:27:02,776 --> 01:27:04,266
Where are you?

1060
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:09,278
If you're doing anything
to mess up my clean rug...

1061
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,249
Don't worry, I'm standing on the paper.

1062
01:27:19,326 --> 01:27:22,625
- Andy, you can't!
- Quit telling me what to do!

1063
01:27:24,965 --> 01:27:27,126
That's terrific.

1064
01:27:27,601 --> 01:27:30,399
If you've got a problem,
don't try to solve it...

1065
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,530
just take the coward's way out. Coward!

1066
01:27:39,513 --> 01:27:41,208
You're right, Brenda.

1067
01:27:41,281 --> 01:27:45,809
This is the coward's way out.
I should attack my real problem.

1068
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:56,426
Hey, I'm property
of the United States Navy, man.

1069
01:27:56,496 --> 01:27:58,225
I don't belong here.

1070
01:27:58,298 --> 01:28:00,289
I want to see a psychiatrist.

1071
01:28:00,367 --> 01:28:02,232
- Let me out!
- What do we have here?

1072
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:07,006
Hey, let me out!

1073
01:28:23,557 --> 01:28:27,721
I guess you heard Brenda's okay.
Just a little nick in the shoulder.

1074
01:28:33,233 --> 01:28:35,201
Sounds of the big house.

1075
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,299
It's a little scary.

1076
01:28:38,638 --> 01:28:40,265
How are you?

1077
01:28:41,074 --> 01:28:44,908
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty damn good.

1078
01:28:46,313 --> 01:28:50,044
Guess you're relieved
Brenda's not pressing charges, though.

1079
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:52,913
I knew she wouldn't.

1080
01:28:52,986 --> 01:28:56,353
This way she can keep her precious pageant
out of the newspaper.

1081
01:28:56,423 --> 01:28:58,414
Andy, now wait a second.

1082
01:28:58,758 --> 01:29:00,885
I'm your best friend, right?

1083
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:04,388
First of all, I don't think
you're being fair to the little lady.

1084
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:08,958
Seriously, she's been an enormous help
to me throughout this whole thing.

1085
01:29:09,703 --> 01:29:12,297
You know the biggest thing
you could do for me?

1086
01:29:12,372 --> 01:29:16,001
- Don't always be knocking the pageant.
- Screw the pageant!

1087
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,513
What am I supposed to say to that?

1088
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,447
I'm sorry.

1089
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:30,581
- You going to work today?
- Hell, no!

1090
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:34,092
What are you gonna do?

1091
01:29:34,761 --> 01:29:36,854
You'll be out of here soon.

1092
01:29:38,965 --> 01:29:40,796
I don't know exactly.

1093
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:44,868
<i>- L'll</i> probably leave Santa Rosa- - 
- Oh, no.

1094
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,670
You got to stay in Santa Rosa, Andy.

1095
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:52,473
You can lick your problems,
right here in your own backyard.

1096
01:29:52,546 --> 01:29:54,013
Who wants to?

1097
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:58,249
Andy, it's very simple.
All it takes is a drop more perseverance...

1098
01:29:58,318 --> 01:30:01,219
a drop more optimism,
and a drop more energy.

1099
01:30:01,655 --> 01:30:02,883
Simple.

1100
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,455
Hey, wait a minute.

1101
01:30:09,129 --> 01:30:11,063
I've heard that before.

1102
01:30:11,331 --> 01:30:14,095
- Heard what before?
- That drip- drop crap.

1103
01:30:14,668 --> 01:30:16,568
Brenda read that to me.

1104
01:30:17,504 --> 01:30:20,803
That's right out of
the Young American Miss program.

1105
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,069
A good philosophy is good philosophy.

1106
01:30:23,143 --> 01:30:25,771
And I don't happen to be a snob
about where I get it from.

1107
01:30:25,845 --> 01:30:29,076
I can tell you another thing,
as your best friend talking to you...

1108
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:32,312
quit wallowing around
in all this self- indulgent self- pity...

1109
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:35,252
and get out there and start helping others.

1110
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:44,954
I've finally figured out what you are.

1111
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:46,961
You know what you are?

1112
01:30:47,033 --> 01:30:49,934
A goddamn Young American Miss.

1113
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:59,174
Okay, we got the list down to 10.

1114
01:30:59,713 --> 01:31:02,614
- All excellent choices.
- All wonderful girls.

1115
01:31:02,682 --> 01:31:05,742
- They sure are. Now, let's drop five.
- Right.

1116
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:07,483
We could drop her.

1117
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:10,148
You really hate jelly jars, don't you, Father?

1118
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:13,249
- Not as a container for jelly.
- This isn't getting us home.

1119
01:31:13,326 --> 01:31:15,089
Okay, you're right.

1120
01:31:15,161 --> 01:31:19,325
I think we've all lost our way a little here.
Let's go back to basics.

1121
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:21,629
It's all right here in the judges' manual.

1122
01:31:21,701 --> 01:31:25,535
Let's remind ourselves of the qualities
we are asked to find in the winner.

1123
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:28,165
A Young American Miss must be cheerful...

1124
01:31:28,241 --> 01:31:32,678
perseverant, sincere,
show a genuine concern for others.

1125
01:31:32,746 --> 01:31:35,544
Right. And those aren't bad things to be.

1126
01:31:37,684 --> 01:31:38,946
Are they?

1127
01:31:39,819 --> 01:31:42,253
Look, the deal was $2,000. I want my money.

1128
01:31:42,322 --> 01:31:45,758
You'll get your money as soon as
you take out that ramp you put in first.

1129
01:31:45,825 --> 01:31:48,157
God damn it, I told you I can't do that now!

1130
01:31:48,228 --> 01:31:50,662
Mr. French, I expect you
to be reasonable about this.

1131
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:54,530
You are a professional. The Jaycees
never really planned on that ramp.

1132
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:56,034
But you approved it.

1133
01:31:56,102 --> 01:32:00,198
We didn't realize it was going to eliminate
so many seats from our Golden Circle.

1134
01:32:00,273 --> 01:32:01,740
What Golden Circle?

1135
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,539
The golden chairs that go right here,
where your ramp is now.

1136
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:08,707
We always put them in on the final night.

1137
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,841
And as it is now,
they're already all sold out for $10 a head.

1138
01:32:11,918 --> 01:32:16,514
Now, if you need the ramp in here,
it means that we're out 50 chairs and $500.

1139
01:32:16,589 --> 01:32:19,581
I sympathize with your problem,
but you should've told me sooner.

1140
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:22,127
There's nothing I can do about it now.

1141
01:32:22,195 --> 01:32:24,857
Yes, there is. You can take out the ramp.

1142
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:26,694
If I take that ramp out now...

1143
01:32:26,766 --> 01:32:30,862
I will have to completely restage
all the numbers in one afternoon.

1144
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:32,829
Is that so hard?

1145
01:32:32,906 --> 01:32:37,036
These girls are not Ginger Rogers.
They dance more like Roy Rogers.

1146
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:39,943
I'd hoped you thought a little more
of our girls than that.

1147
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,674
Don't give me that sanctimonious shit!

1148
01:32:41,748 --> 01:32:44,512
You're the one
that doesn't give a goddamn about the girls.

1149
01:32:44,584 --> 01:32:48,418
If I take that ramp out now,
they'll fall all over themselves.

1150
01:32:48,488 --> 01:32:51,423
The finance committee
did come up with another idea...

1151
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:54,153
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

1152
01:32:54,227 --> 01:32:55,489
Try me.

1153
01:32:57,097 --> 01:32:59,531
How would you feel
about picking up the tab...

1154
01:32:59,599 --> 01:33:03,160
for the amount we lose
because of your ramp being there?

1155
01:33:04,003 --> 01:33:07,598
It means we would deduct
$500 from your check.

1156
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,539
How would you feel...

1157
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:13,045
about having the whole pageant
shoved up your ass, bamboo poles and all?

1158
01:33:13,113 --> 01:33:16,549
Now see here, Mr. French,
I'm trying to be reasonable about this.

1159
01:33:16,616 --> 01:33:21,280
Our Jaycee chapter is almost bankrupt
because of this meat show!

1160
01:33:23,823 --> 01:33:28,260
If we don't break even, we'll have to cancel
the Rodeo for the Retarded.

1161
01:33:30,864 --> 01:33:34,664
Surely $500 can't mean that much
to a Hollywood professional.

1162
01:33:34,868 --> 01:33:38,429
And one, two, three, four.

1163
01:33:38,772 --> 01:33:42,003
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, turn!

1164
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:45,575
One, two, three, four...

1165
01:33:45,678 --> 01:33:48,772
five, six, seven, eight.

1166
01:33:50,617 --> 01:33:51,879
Hold it!

1167
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,883
Get rid of the ramp.

1168
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:00,685
Now, ladies, pay attention.
We've got a lot of work to do.

1169
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,355
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

1170
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:07,559
<i>Me ol' bam- boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam- boo</i>

1171
01:34:07,634 --> 01:34:09,625
<i>You can have me hat or me bumber- shoot</i>

1172
01:34:09,702 --> 01:34:12,364
<i>But you better never bother
with me ol' bam- boo</i>

1173
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:19,378
- Mr. French, are you busy?
- Yeah.

1174
01:34:19,446 --> 01:34:24,042
I'd just like to ask you one question
about my daughter, Celia Parks?

1175
01:34:24,751 --> 01:34:27,083
<i>The one who sang I Feel Pretty.</i>

1176
01:34:27,754 --> 01:34:32,453
I just wanted to know if you think
she has a future as a professional singer.

1177
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,051
Not unless Florence Henderson dies.

1178
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:58,747
We feel we are not doing these new routines
as well without the ramp.

1179
01:35:04,257 --> 01:35:07,454
We were just wondering
why we can't have the ramp.

1180
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,823
Because I said so.

1181
01:35:27,547 --> 01:35:28,980
Was there something else?

1182
01:35:29,048 --> 01:35:31,846
We'll never be as good without the ramp.
It just isn't fair!

1183
01:35:31,918 --> 01:35:33,852
Few things in life are.

1184
01:35:35,788 --> 01:35:39,224
I've been working so hard all week.
Vim and Vigor is my best event.

1185
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:42,193
I've won the preliminaries,
and I was counting on that ramp- -

1186
01:35:42,262 --> 01:35:45,254
Hold it a minute!
Are you speaking for the group now?

1187
01:35:46,499 --> 01:35:49,764
Because if you are,
you're sure using the word "I" a lot.

1188
01:35:49,836 --> 01:35:52,396
No, I guess I'm speaking for myself.

1189
01:35:52,839 --> 01:35:56,275
Then here's an answer, just for you:
The ramp is out!

1190
01:35:58,511 --> 01:36:00,877
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty!

1191
01:36:00,947 --> 01:36:04,144
<i>Me ol' bam- boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam- boo</i>

1192
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:06,151
<i>You can have me hat or me bumber- shoot</i>

1193
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:11,623
<i>But you better never bother
with me ol' bam- boo</i>

1194
01:36:17,997 --> 01:36:21,763
And one, two, and turn!

1195
01:36:29,142 --> 01:36:30,939
Easy.

1196
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,309
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1197
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,813
What happened?

1198
01:36:35,882 --> 01:36:39,045
I should have gone left
instead of straight ahead.

1199
01:36:39,285 --> 01:36:42,049
I flunked Driver's Ed for the same thing.

1200
01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:54,294
Put back the ramp.

1201
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:01,403
You win, you little toad bastard!
I want the $1,500 tonight!

1202
01:37:01,474 --> 01:37:04,034
And if Miss Anaheim
is not smart enough to sue you...

1203
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,944
I will personally introduce her
to a nice lawyer who is not a Jaycee.

1204
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,779
- No, listen, I'm going to soak it.
- Are you all right, darling?

1205
01:37:15,855 --> 01:37:18,289
Can I get you anything, a doctor, a Pepsi?

1206
01:37:30,903 --> 01:37:33,133
Wait, let me help you.

1207
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:37,675
- Please don't make such a fuss, dear.
- l'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.

1208
01:37:37,744 --> 01:37:40,110
- Hello, Earl. How are you tonight?
- See you inside.

1209
01:37:40,179 --> 01:37:42,579
- Doesn't it hurt?
- lt's not important.

1210
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:46,813
Please remember I simply slipped
and sprained my arm. That's all.

1211
01:37:46,886 --> 01:37:51,016
Yeah, but I think you're being too good
to that bastard by keeping this thing quiet.

1212
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:54,685
If Gary took a shot at me,
I'd make sure it was on the front page.

1213
01:37:54,761 --> 01:37:56,888
Why are you protecting him?

1214
01:37:57,897 --> 01:38:01,560
It's not for Andy. It's for the girls.

1215
01:38:02,935 --> 01:38:05,802
He's lucky to be leaving someone like you.

1216
01:38:10,376 --> 01:38:12,276
How do you feel? How's your knee?

1217
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:15,212
The knee's okay, but I'm so nervous.

1218
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:19,041
I mean, I'm starting to feel
like I wanna win again, you know?

1219
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:21,484
Yeah. It's a hard feeling to get rid of,
isn't it?

1220
01:38:21,554 --> 01:38:22,543
Right.

1221
01:38:23,823 --> 01:38:26,758
Sometimes I feel like I could win, you know?

1222
01:38:27,293 --> 01:38:29,591
Then I get mad at myself for wanting to...

1223
01:38:29,662 --> 01:38:33,564
and then I get mad at myself
for being dumb enough to think that I could.

1224
01:38:33,633 --> 01:38:35,658
Yeah, I feel the same way.

1225
01:38:35,735 --> 01:38:36,997
I want to win so bad.

1226
01:38:53,186 --> 01:38:55,211
Big Bob. How are we doing?

1227
01:38:58,624 --> 01:39:00,455
- How are we doing?
- Yeah.

1228
01:39:01,027 --> 01:39:03,120
Oh, we're doing great, Wilson.

1229
01:39:03,196 --> 01:39:07,292
We are doing just great.
And a hell of job by you this year.

1230
01:39:12,138 --> 01:39:14,470
It's show time!

1231
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:22,411
<i>And to shine over
this great and fabulous evening...</i>

1232
01:39:22,482 --> 01:39:25,178
<i>Old Glory carried with honor...</i>

1233
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,584
<i>by the Santa Rosa
Marine Auxiliary Color Guard.</i>

1234
01:39:28,654 --> 01:39:31,953
<i>Three strong Americans
who keep America strong.</i>

1235
01:40:00,052 --> 01:40:03,021
<i>And with their symbolic rose of friendship...</i>

1236
01:40:03,256 --> 01:40:05,656
<i>each of our girls bids adieu...</i>

1237
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:09,359
<i>to the reigning Young American Miss,
Jo Ann Marshall.</i>

1238
01:40:33,219 --> 01:40:37,121
<i>Goodbye, Jo Ann.
Goodbye, Young American Miss.</i>

1239
01:40:51,404 --> 01:40:54,066
<i>There they go,
ladies and gentlemen, the judges.</i>

1240
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:57,200
<i>And frankly, I don't envy them one little bit.</i>

1241
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:01,178
<i>They have already done the impossible
by selecting the five most wonderful...</i>

1242
01:41:01,948 --> 01:41:05,008
<i>To entertain you
while our judges deliberate...</i>

1243
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:09,382
<i>those truly grand
and truly glorious has- beens...</i>

1244
01:41:09,455 --> 01:41:10,945
<i>have worked up a little number.</i>

1245
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:14,015
<i>You'll enjoy this. Let's bring them on
with a round of applause.</i>

1246
01:41:14,093 --> 01:41:16,618
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our has- beens.</i>

1247
01:41:39,085 --> 01:41:40,780
<i>Thank you, Jo Ann.</i>

1248
01:41:41,454 --> 01:41:43,820
<i>Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1249
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:48,383
<i>I sometimes wonder how those astronauts
handle all that pressure.</i>

1250
01:41:49,528 --> 01:41:53,020
<i>And our fourth runner- up,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1251
01:42:07,179 --> 01:42:10,808
<i>Miss Anaheim, Doria Houston!</i>

1252
01:42:11,851 --> 01:42:15,480
<i>Anaheim? own Doria Houston!</i>

1253
01:42:30,636 --> 01:42:33,696
<i>And our third runner- up:</i>

1254
01:42:39,712 --> 01:42:43,113
<i>Miss Fresno, Leslie Anderson!</i>

1255
01:42:50,089 --> 01:42:53,422
<i>And here it is, our second runner- up.</i>

1256
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:56,995
<i>What an exciting night.</i>

1257
01:42:58,698 --> 01:43:02,031
<i>Miss Modesto, Judy Wagner!</i>

1258
01:43:02,401 --> 01:43:06,132
<i>Modesto 's own Judy Wagner!</i>

1259
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:21,181
<i>And now, it's time for the first runner- up.</i>

1260
01:43:21,587 --> 01:43:24,249
<i>And remember, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1261
01:43:24,523 --> 01:43:29,222
<i>that if for any reason our California
Young American Miss selected tonight...</i>

1262
01:43:29,795 --> 01:43:32,764
<i>is unable to fulfill her responsibilities...</i>

1263
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:36,029
<i>this is the girl that would take her place.</i>

1264
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,367
<i>Our first runner- up:</i>

1265
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:48,705
<i>Greater Dinuba, Nancy Hess!</i>

1266
01:43:49,048 --> 01:43:51,642
<i>Nancy Hess from Greater Dinuba!</i>

1267
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:06,528
<i>And now, here it is, that special moment
that we've worked all week toward.</i>

1268
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:09,762
<i>don't mind telling you,
hairs are standing on end.</i>

1269
01:44:09,835 --> 01:44:11,393
<i>And remember...</i>

1270
01:44:12,772 --> 01:44:15,502
<i>there are no winners and losers here...</i>

1271
01:44:16,409 --> 01:44:19,936
<i>because each of our girls is a winner.</i>

1272
01:44:20,813 --> 01:44:23,782
<i>But if there ever was a winner,
this would be it.</i>

1273
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:28,075
<i>This is the gal to beat
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana...</i>

1274
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:32,355
<i>our new California Young American Miss.</i>

1275
01:44:45,004 --> 01:44:48,337
<i>Fountain Valley, Shawn Christianson!</i>

1276
01:44:48,474 --> 01:44:52,570
<i>Miss Fountain Valley, Shawn Christianson!</i>

1277
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:32,584
<i>Once she held her tears inside...</i>

1278
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:35,345
<i>but now there's nothing left to hide.</i>

1279
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:40,156
<i>An all- American girl you see</i>

1280
01:45:40,226 --> 01:45:43,389
<i>She's all an American girl should be</i>

1281
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:46,727
<i>With an inner beauty she shines bright</i>

1282
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:49,893
<i>With a sense of duty here tonight</i>

1283
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:53,132
<i>She'll wear her crown with love and respect</i>

1284
01:45:53,205 --> 01:45:57,608
<i>She's our Young American girl elect</i>

1285
01:45:58,144 --> 01:46:02,672
<i>An all- American girl you see</i>

1286
01:46:03,182 --> 01:46:09,018
<i>She's all an American girl should be</i>

1287
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:24,159
<i>There she is, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1288
01:46:24,236 --> 01:46:28,832
<i>California's new Young American Miss,
Shawn Christianson.</i>

1289
01:46:29,608 --> 01:46:31,235
<i>Isn't she lovely?</i>

1290
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,244
<i>Aren't they all lovely?</i>

1291
01:46:33,445 --> 01:46:35,310
Isn't everyone <i>lovely?</i>

1292
01:46:43,889 --> 01:46:46,449
<i>Our thanks to all of our lovely contestants...</i>

1293
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:49,983
<i>the great work done by the Jaycees,
our fabulously unique judges...</i>

1294
01:46:50,062 --> 01:46:54,465
<i>of course, the fantastic orchestra
under the supervision of Ray Brandy...</i>

1295
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:58,970
<i>our stupendous director, the superb
Hollywood professional, Mr. Tommy French.</i>

1296
01:46:59,405 --> 01:47:01,430
<i>And, of course, our miraculous stage crew.</i>

1297
01:47:01,507 --> 01:47:05,273
<i>Mostly, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for making it such a great evening.</i>

1298
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,812
<i>Thank you and good night.
See you next year!</i>

1299
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:41,406
Doria!

1300
01:47:49,855 --> 01:47:52,881
Robin, I wanted you to win, too.

1301
01:47:54,526 --> 01:47:56,687
Maybe I'm not an opportunist.

1302
01:47:57,096 --> 01:48:01,260
Listen, Doria, don't worry about it.
I'm just glad it's over.

1303
01:48:01,667 --> 01:48:02,929
No shit.

1304
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:07,632
Momma!

1305
01:48:11,777 --> 01:48:13,677
I'm so glad to see you.

1306
01:48:37,069 --> 01:48:39,299
Are you done with this stuff?

1307
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:43,230
- Excuse me?
- I throw it away.

1308
01:48:44,443 --> 01:48:46,877
Go ahead, throw it away. Thank you.

1309
01:48:49,448 --> 01:48:51,575
Front and center, two!

1310
01:48:57,189 --> 01:48:59,020
Forward, two!

1311
01:49:01,393 --> 01:49:03,156
Detail, halt.

1312
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:06,596
Order, two!

1313
01:49:08,334 --> 01:49:09,562
At ease.

1314
01:49:23,382 --> 01:49:25,043
Keep them tight. Roll them up.

1315
01:49:25,117 --> 01:49:27,415
- Hiya, fellas.
- How you doing?

1316
01:49:28,087 --> 01:49:31,079
You guys sure did a super job tonight.
Thank you.

1317
01:49:31,156 --> 01:49:33,522
Thank you. Watch the flag, Gene.

1318
01:49:35,594 --> 01:49:37,562
The First Division, huh?

1319
01:49:37,796 --> 01:49:39,058
Yes, sir.

1320
01:49:40,632 --> 01:49:42,122
Roll in tight.

1321
01:49:42,668 --> 01:49:44,829
I was in the First Division.

1322
01:49:44,903 --> 01:49:47,030
Watch your flag there, Gene.

1323
01:49:47,106 --> 01:49:49,301
We held the Josane Reservoir.

1324
01:49:49,775 --> 01:49:51,936
Did you see the knockers
on Miss Imperial County?

1325
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:54,911
- Yeah, both of them.
- Let's get out of here.

1326
01:50:14,266 --> 01:50:17,633
No, these are just for Sunday.
Actually, I have six more of them.

1327
01:50:17,703 --> 01:50:20,900
I just wear these on Sundays. What? Four.

1328
01:51:22,901 --> 01:51:25,893
Step right into my Guy here, Mom.
My open road. How about that?

1329
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:28,337
Have a balloon here, Dad.
Let me show you something.

1330
01:51:28,407 --> 01:51:32,434
How about solid construction?
Look at this solid body, solid steel.

1331
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:35,378
Why are you worrying about credit?
We don't worry about it...
