1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,033
- It's me, Sergeant Finney.
- Ah, Miss Sinclair...

2
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:07,035
- will I ring through to the mess?
- No.

3
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,037
- Something wrong, miss?
- No.

4
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,332
No, I'll only be five minutes.

5
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,345
- Is that Colonel Sinclair's daughter?
- Aye.

6
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,347
- Shall I ring through to him?
- No.

7
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,152
No, I wouldn't do that.

8
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:02,936
MacKinnon!

9
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,477
<i>- Colonel?
- For God's sake, smoke that bloody thing like a man!</i>

10
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,638
Stop puffing at it
like a ruddy debutante!

11
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,294
Go on, laddie. Smoke it, smoke it.

12
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>Draw it in. Draw it in.</i>

13
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,505
Am I coarse, Simpson?

14
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,584
Am I, Charlie?

15
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:37,937
Away you go, lads.
You're no so bad.

16
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,565
You can have a drink.

17
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,608
Oh, for Pete's sake, then.
Where's me whiskey?

18
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,622
Corporal, colonel's whiskey!

19
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:13,463
I think Lieutenant Colonel Jock bloody Sinclair, D.S.O., M.M

20
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,071
is a terror, that's what he is.

21
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:19,641
- He's a great man.
- Och, he's a terror, I'm telling ye.

22
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,776
Is that right
he used to be a piper?

23
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,778
He played pibroch
on the wireless.

24
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,381
Well, I'm no a corporal.
I never get to hear a wireless.

25
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:30,818
Is that right, the sergeants
are gonna get the TV?

26
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,354
- Are you not drinking?
- I'll be back in a wee while.

27
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:36,023
Is it a rendezvous you have,
Corporal Fraser?

28
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:39,705
You'll no get the TV that way,
I'm telling you.

29
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,163
It's no good. They're settling in.

30
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:52,971
- Can you not get away?
- You know what your father's like.

31
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,901
I'll be piping all night.

32
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:02,462
- Will I wait?
- No, no. You can't wait here.

33
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:06,249
- Was it all right about last night?
- No bother. He was in late himself.

34
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,085
- Are you angry I came?
- Morag, I'm not scared of him.

35
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:11,688
Let me tell him.
I'll speak to him straight.

36
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,822
He's got to know sooner or later.

37
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,752
It's not right like this.

38
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,428
- You're hot.
- Oh, listen to what I'm saying.

39
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,830
Look, lan, he'll not take it, not yet.

40
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,833
<i>- I'll speak to him when the moment comes.
- You're a white-kneed shower, you are.</i>

41
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,387
I've got to go now.

42
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:29,272
Tomorrow?

43
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:31,991
Sure.

44
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:58,973
- Miss Sinclair?
- Yes?

45
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:04,502
- Oh, it's you, Pipe Major.
- Miss Sinclair, a barracks is a very small place.

46
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:07,371
It's not the first time you've been
inside at night — I know that —

47
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:10,139
but if your father found out,
there might be bad trouble for you.

48
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,308
You've no right to speak
to me like that, have you?

49
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,812
- I'm only trying —
- It's nothing to do with you, is it?

50
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:20,454
I'm speaking to you as a friend, Miss Sinclair.
I didn't mean to interfere.

51
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:23,518
And I didn't mean to be rude.

52
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,489
Sorry, Pipey.

53
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,533
- Good night.
- Good night.

54
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,460
Well, gentlemen, I have news for you.

55
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,462
All of you!

56
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,872
You ignorant men.

57
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:44,120
News that'll affect you all.

58
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,451
Tomorrow,
there's a new colonel coming...

59
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,585
and he'll be taking over the battalion.

60
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,115
Are you receiving me loud and clear?

61
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,551
- No, Jock, you're pulling our leg.
- It's true what I'm telling you.

62
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:04,149
Ask the adjutant there.
Jimmy knows right enough.

63
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,659
- It's true.
- It doesn't surprise me.

64
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,661
They were bound
to catch up with him sometime.

65
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,895
- Let 'em try—
- I didn't call for comments...

66
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:13,523
one way or the other.

67
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,601
- It's just a fact.
- Who is it, Jock?

68
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:18,874
Uh, Basil Barrow.

69
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,738
Major Barrow? I remember him.
He lectured at Sandhurst.

70
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,074
He's a stickler for detail,
but a marvelous lecturer.

71
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,810
<i>He was out east.
He's an expert on jungle warfare.</i>

72
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,365
Half his family were colonels here.

73
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:34,949
Well, he —
He's really quite all right.

74
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,818
I mean, he's —
he's frightfully bright upstairs.

75
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,936
Aye, he's a great success...

76
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:41,640
as a lecturer.

77
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,136
Quite a turn with the cadets.

78
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:51,564
Colonel Barrow, Eton and Oxford,
joined the regiment in 1933.

79
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:55,301
He was only with it a year or two
before being posted on special duties.

80
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:58,576
It's as Simpson says.
He's bright upstairs.

81
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,998
That's his, uh,
grand-dad's ugly mug...

82
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,833
hangs halfway along the hall there.

83
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:12,433
Aye, I know all about him,
you see that.

84
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,615
Well, he's to command the battalion.
And I'll have another dram.

85
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,225
- What about you —
- Aye, and what about me, china?

86
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,961
- Are you staying on?
- Unless you're gonna get rid of me, Jimmy.

87
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,476
I thought there might have been a chance of it.

88
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,591
Staying on as second in command,
you mean?

89
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,671
So may it please you,
Captain Simpson.

90
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:39,508
- I'm glad you're not leaving us, sir.
- Thank you, Eric.

91
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:41,333
- And, Eric.
- Yes, sir?

92
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,766
No "sirs" in the mess.

93
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,067
Christian names, except for me,
and I'm Colonel.

94
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,657
I call you what I like. Understood?

95
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:53,522
Yes, Colonel.

96
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:56,917
"Yes, Colonel."

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,774
Go on, Charlie.
We'll go through the way.

98
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:03,991
Jock's last day.

99
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:08,566
Well, gentlemen, we'll have
a round of drinks on Jock. Corporal.

100
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,102
- Sir?
- whiskey for the gentlemen that like it...

101
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,504
and for the gentlemen
that don't like it...

102
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:14,110
whiskey.

103
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,875
I'm no use at talking
at my best of times, Charlie...

104
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,377
but tonight, I'm no coping at all.

105
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:22,780
- Will we have the pipers back?
- Your night, old boy.

106
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:25,930
Aye, my night.
Old boy. Old boy. Old boy.

107
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,413
Well, I say we'll have the pipers.

108
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:32,922
- Laddie, call the pipers.
- This minute, sir.

109
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:36,562
- Just "sir." That's all you need to say.
- Sir.

110
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,961
Aye, Charlie, we fought a war together...

111
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,963
- do you know that?
- Uh-huh.

112
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:44,199
And you will have a tune,
and I'll have a tune...

113
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,301
and MacMillan there'll have a tune.

114
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:50,037
- Thank you very much.
- And I'll have another tune.

115
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,372
Charlie, why the hell 'd
you shave the whiskers off?

116
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:54,374
Oh, I don't know.
Tickled the ladies.

117
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,887
I love you, Charlie.

118
00:09:56,644 --> 00:10:00,412
You're no a great talker, right enough,
but you're a lovely man.

119
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,949
- Aye, pipers, and where have you been?
- The pantry, sir.

120
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,712
- Are you sober?
- Sir.

121
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,953
You bloody well better be,
and that's a fact.

122
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,522
You're no here to get sick drunk
the same as the rest of us.

123
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,523
We'll have a reel to sweat it out.

124
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:14,714
- Aye!
- "The Duke of Perth."

125
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,696
Aye. That's right.
Hankies for the lassies.

126
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:21,116
And a prettier lady I never saw.

127
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,830
Officers' mess pantry, man.
Quick now.

128
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:03,970
- Mess pantry.
- Tell them Colonel Barrow's just arrived.

129
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,598
Sure, I'll tell them.

130
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,280
Sir, Colonel Barrow's here, sir.

131
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,686
- Who?
- Colonel Barrow, sir.

132
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:22,653
- Colonel.
- What is it? Get back to your proper place!

133
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,289
- Colonel's here.
- Of course, I'm here. You're drunk, laddie!

134
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,791
No, Jock, it's him.

135
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,428
But, damn it,
he's not due till the morn.

136
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,594
Pipers! Pipers, that's enough for you.

137
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,309
Good evening, gentlemen.
My name is Barrow.

138
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,053
Jock Sinclair, acting colonel.

139
00:11:56,918 --> 00:12:00,253
How do you do?
I've heard a great deal about you.

140
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,255
He might have given us a warning.

141
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,258
Do you fancy the waistcoat?

142
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,826
- Uh, Jimmy Cairns, Adjutant.
- Sir.

143
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,195
- How do you do?
- Charlie Scott, second in command.

144
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,603
- Colonel.
- Scott.

145
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,576
Aye, uh, Dusty Miller, Mess President.

146
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,518
- How do you do?
- Sir.

147
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,139
- What company?
- "C" Company, sir.

148
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,812
There are too many damn subalterns
to introduce. That's the deluge.

149
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,095
- Colonel.
- Sir.

150
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,220
How do you do?

151
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,153
And now, Colonel, may we have
your permission...

152
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,755
to resume the dance
that was interrupted?

153
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,824
Oh, for heaven's sake, please.
I'm not here officially until tomorrow.

154
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,890
Thank you.
Carry on, pipes.

155
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,255
Charlie, we better break off.

156
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:51,628
- You'll join us in a drink, Colonel.
- Thank you.

157
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,072
Straight or with water?

158
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:01,375
I'd rather have a soft drink, if I may.
Anything will do.

159
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:03,844
- Not a whiskey?
- Not a whiskey.

160
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:06,245
But we all drink whiskey
in this battalion.

161
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:10,216
Yes, I remember that. whiskey doesn't
really agree with me, I'm afraid.

162
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:13,084
- A lemonade for Colonel Barrow.
- Sir.

163
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,856
This is my farewell party,
you understand.

164
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:21,184
There's no a carry-on like this every night.

165
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,630
Aye, so you found
your way here all right.

166
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,632
Oh, yes, I've been here before, you know.

167
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,767
- Aye, when was that?
- I came as a subaltern.

168
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,036
- From Sandhurst?
- From Oxford, as a matter of fact.

169
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,799
From Oxford. Fancy that.

170
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:38,700
So, you came in that way,
with a university degree?

171
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:41,444
- For what it was worth.
- Well, I came in the other way...

172
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,381
by Sauchiehall Street —
boot-boy, band boy and Barlinnie.

173
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,895
- BarlinnieJail?
- Just the cooler.

174
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:49,736
Armistice night, 1933.

175
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,774
Dead drunk and disorderly.

176
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:55,724
Sounds a much better training.

177
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,674
- Happy days.
- Good luck.

178
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:05,465
It'll be some time since you were
with the battalion, I'm thinking.

179
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,701
Yes, indeed.
I feel quite a new boy.

180
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,936
It's a while since I've been
with any battalion.

181
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:12,072
I've been sitting behind a desk
for some time now.

182
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:14,573
One of the lads said
you used to teach at Sandhurst.

183
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:17,191
- Simpson?
- Aye, you're right now.

184
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,812
And what was it you said
you did before?

185
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:22,732
I don't think I did say.

186
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:26,746
- You didn't?
- Like you, Sinclair, I was in jail.

187
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,807
A prisoner-of-war camp, eh?

188
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,654
Officers' privileges
and amateur dramatics.

189
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,291
It's no quite the same thing.

190
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,956
I think I would have
preferred BarlinnieJail.

191
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:40,909
Good night.

192
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,474
- Scott.
- Colonel.

193
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:12,379
- The bottle's three quarters empty.
- Nonsense. It's a quarter full.

194
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:17,664
Have I been such a bad colonel, Charlie?
Have I?

195
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:21,564
- Never knew a better.
- Och, man. Stop your fibbing.

196
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:27,000
- Honest to God. Why, the war, old boy—
- Old boy, old boy, old boy.

197
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,874
You asked me and I told you.
For God's sake, chum.

198
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:38,681
- Do you really think that, Charlie?
- Sure. Absolutely.

199
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,021
It's no right.

200
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:45,455
You nurse them from Alamein to Casino,
from Dover to Berlin...

201
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:50,025
just to get some spry wee gent
put over your head at the end.

202
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,882
It's no fair, it isn't.

203
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,100
Och. He's here now.

204
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,136
The "new boy," he called himself...

205
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:02,461
all in his mufti.

206
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,777
I fancy the poor laddie's
got tabs in place of tits.

207
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,346
Pass the bottle.
There's a good chum.

208
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,515
Do you think we can
dispense with glasses?

209
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,548
- Aye.
- Hmm?

210
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,619
If anyone has the right
to get fool tonight...

211
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,088
it's Jock Sinclair
and his friend Charlie Scott.

212
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,224
Did you hear him say that
about the whiskey?

213
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:28,134
- He doesn't drink it, says he.
- Sad.

214
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,932
He had no right to come blowing
in here like that without warning.

215
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,384
- It was bad form, that's what it was.
- Hmm.

216
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,144
And whatever way you look at it,
they'd no right to put him in above me.

217
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:48,938
That makes me angry, Charlie.

218
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,857
It makes me very, very...

219
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:55,999
Angry.

220
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,168
Who's that through there?

221
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:05,894
Who's that through there saying
"Who's that through there?"

222
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:06,802
Whisht, man.

223
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:08,998
Who is it?

224
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,154
Corporal Fraser, sir.

225
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,503
What the hell are you doing here
at this hour of night?

226
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:19,069
- Waiting, sir.
- Waiting? Who for?

227
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,899
For you, sir.
You told me to wait.

228
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,478
Did I now?

229
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,319
And you've been waitin'...

230
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,238
and cussing and binding
and swearing —

231
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,059
Och, man. I know, uh —

232
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,971
- l-I've been a piper myself.
- Sir.

233
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,018
You got a girl downtown, Corporal?

234
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,884
You got a piece of cherry cake?

235
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,987
Have we kept you away from her?

236
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,168
Well, Corporal, have you got
a tongue in your head?

237
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:51,524
Sir.

238
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,972
- Have you got a lassie?
- Sir.

239
00:17:57,141 --> 00:18:00,643
Is that not dandy, Charlie,
the corporal's got a lassie?

240
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:04,116
<i>- Good for the corporal.
- No, no, Major Scott.</i>

241
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,189
You should say, um...

242
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,128
good for the lassie.

243
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,953
It's not every lassie
gets a corporal piper.

244
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:13,028
No, it's not.

245
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,358
Is she bonny, Corporal?

246
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:20,256
I think so, sir.

247
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:22,685
"I think so," he says.

248
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,863
Tell me, Corporal, um...

249
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:33,320
are your intentions
strictly honorable?

250
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:37,342
- Yes, indeed, sir.
- Then you're a bloody fool, that's what you are.

251
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:41,003
You leave honorable intentions
to fathers like me.

252
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,769
<i>It's latish, old chum.</i>

253
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:47,333
Are you failing,
you miserable man?

254
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:51,922
Are the lights going out
all over, Charlie?

255
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,925
Mmm. And all over barracks.

256
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,251
- It's after 3:00, old boy.
- Is that so...

257
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,285
old boy?

258
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,485
Corporal, you see before you...

259
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:07,993
the body of a major...

260
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,297
and the ghost of a colonel.

261
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,040
They instruct you to dismiss.

262
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:25,862
To some of us, sir,
you will always be the colonel.

263
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:33,880
Corporal Fraser,
the penalty for mutiny...

264
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,014
is death.

265
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,960
Dismissed.

266
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,849
l—l-I'm thinking when
l- I'm talking to the corporal there...

267
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:59,046
it's a pipe major
I should have been.

268
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,502
And I would have been good,
I would.

269
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,164
But that was not the way of it.

270
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,009
Hitler saw to that.

271
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:12,964
And Rommel...

272
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:15,969
one desert night.

273
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,308
<i>Well, this is my battalion.</i>

274
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,642
I've acted colonel,
and I should be colonel...

275
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:35,044
and by this hand, Charlie boy,
I bloody well will be colonel, so I will.

276
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:41,563
Oh, you bastard.

277
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:50,435
You bastard.

278
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,979
And you're no a good listener, either.

279
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,826
Were you late again last night?

280
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:25,797
<i>"Ish."Latish.</i>

281
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,531
<i>I had to stay
to keep the others company.</i>

282
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:33,827
- You're a bad man.
- I'm on parade now, spick and span.

283
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:39,048
- Do I have to finish all this?
- You do, every spoon of it.

284
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,617
- What's he like?
- Who?

285
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:44,977
- The new colonel, of course.
- How the hell'd you know he'd arrived?

286
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,604
A wee birdie told me.

287
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,715
Was anyone here last night,
someone from the barracks?

288
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:51,716
- Nobody.
- Did you go there, then?

289
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:55,287
- Did you? I've told you before —
- Let's not have all this over again.

290
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:58,956
You'll no go near the place
without telephoning me first.

291
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:01,525
There's only one sort of girl
seen hanging about a barracks.

292
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:05,062
- I'm not a child.
- I know you're not. That's what I'm saying.

293
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:08,599
- I'll go where I want!
- You'll go where you're told just yet a while.

294
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Where were you half the night?
Tell me that.

295
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,802
Down at the theater
with that actress, I suppose.

296
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,137
I'll no have that!
I'll no have impertinence from you!

297
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,139
Now, you listen to me, Morag!

298
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,495
Och.

299
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,289
Oh, lassie. Oh.

300
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:25,221
Don't turn away from me.
Don't do that.

301
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,484
Morag, I only make the rules
to help you.

302
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,485
But you've got to keep them.

303
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,945
Well, say something.

304
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:34,863
Yes, Father.

305
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,369
- It's time you went.
- Aye.

306
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,831
That's a fact.

307
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,470
<i>Away out to the car, lad,
and we'll give you a lift.</i>

308
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:51,825
Sir.

309
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:00,078
- What's he like?
- Barrow? Och, he's a wee man.

310
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,113
- Father, it had to be.
- I just said...

311
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,899
he's a wee man.

312
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,586
- It had to be.
- As a matter of fact, I'm no with you.

313
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,402
It need never have been.

314
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:15,691
But it's my opinion,
he'll no be C.O. For very long.

315
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:19,295
- Father, you'll not do something stupid?
- Oh, for Pete's sake, lassie.

316
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,829
You expect me to hang out a flag?

317
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,950
Out! Out! Out!

318
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:25,055
And!

319
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>Feet together! Next exercise!
Begin!</i>

320
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:31,053
One. Up, right.

321
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,594
<i>Up left. Up right.</i>

322
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:37,545
Personally, I was never very keen
on the ballet.

323
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:38,932
<i>Up right. Up left.</i>

324
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:43,217
<i>If you can't do it that way,
get down on your knees and do it!</i>

325
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:45,486
- Down, up, down!
- I'd almost forgotten.

326
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:48,288
- Ah, poor laddies, eh?
- No doubt they deserve it.

327
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,490
<i>You'll never see a woman again.</i>

328
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,045
<i>- Who's that man?
- Jim Cameron...</i>

329
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,963
the best heavyweight we ever had
till he got a bullet in his guts in the desert.

330
00:23:56,964 --> 00:24:00,790
Someone should tell him
to put his hat on straight.

331
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,987
Off! Come on! Off!

332
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:06,904
- Pick up! Off!
- Put your leg in it.

333
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:08,292
Pick your chin up.

334
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:18,055
Left arm stiff, lad. Do it again!
Put some guts into it!

335
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,993
Here, here.

336
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:22,751
- Have you got a mother-in-law, soldier?
- No, sir.

337
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,454
- Do you hate anyone?
- Don't think so, sir.

338
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:28,256
What about
the regimental sergeant major?

339
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:28,612
Sir.

340
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:36,130
- Have you no teeth, Corporal?
- Sir!

341
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:40,948
Then smile, laddie. Even under
king's regulations, that's allowed.

342
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:50,110
According to the timetable,
shouldn't they have finished at 10:00?

343
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:52,612
Dusty's mob's always 10 minutes
behind the rest of us.

344
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:55,681
That's a tradition
goes back to Alamein, boy.

345
00:24:55,682 --> 00:25:00,418
There's Greenwich time and summertime
and army time and Dusty time.

346
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,122
- You'll get used to it, Colonel.
- I don't promise that I will.

347
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,020
- Major Miller!
- Colonel.

348
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:06,577
Off! Off!

349
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:12,151
It is seven minutes past 10:00.

350
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,398
Aye, it's quite late, Colonel. It is.

351
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,634
Three minutes to go, eh, Dusty?

352
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,636
This period finishes at 10:00.

353
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:21,306
- I like things to be exact.
- Sir.

354
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:48,895
You can hear it for yourself.
It's a great band.

355
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:51,315
Not a wrong one anywhere. Here —

356
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:55,035
Tell me. Are there any regulations
as to what should be worn for band practice?

357
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,369
Och, no. You see, it's the piping
that's important.

358
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,371
Are there any regulations, Pipe Major?

359
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:02,107
Well, the hair sporran and the glengarry, sir,
but during the war—

360
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,350
I see three, four, five men...

361
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,979
<i>in tam-o'- shanters
improperly dressed.</i>

362
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,929
- Take their names.
- Sir.

363
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:17,087
- Colonel, there's a tradition here —
- I'm all in favor of good traditions.

364
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:20,457
I've always let the pipers wear pretty well
what they please at band practice.

365
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,659
Because you've let them wear
what they like, Jock...

366
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,777
doesn't make it a tradition.

367
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:30,985
Jimmy, I think we'd better tackle
some of that paperwork.

368
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,850
Tired, Dusty?

369
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:49,149
You know what the Barrow boy
made us do this morning?

370
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,352
Double halfway back from the ranges
in full marching order.

371
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:55,388
He's inspected "A" Company three times
in the last five days.

372
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:57,757
Yes, it's been
a somewhat harassing two weeks, what?

373
00:26:57,758 --> 00:27:00,326
Typical of him. He's beginning
where he means to finish.

374
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,829
Well, if he's finishing
on three inspections a week...

375
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,131
I'm going after
the commissionaire's job at the Royal.

376
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:08,800
You wouldn't get it, Dusty.
You'd have to keep your buttons clean.

377
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:11,570
Well, what's he want us for anyway?
I've got better things to do —

378
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:12,300
Gentlemen.

379
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,513
Sit down, please.

380
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:20,048
- All here, Jimmy?
- All present, sir.

381
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,477
Major Sinclair?

382
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:29,152
- Why—
- He's not been in, Colonel.

383
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:32,322
I didn't think the order
affected him, sir.

384
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:32,855
I see.

385
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,782
Well, gentlemen...

386
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:48,503
I've only got two announcements
to make this afternoon...

387
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:52,154
one perhaps a little less popular
than the other.

388
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:56,843
When I came here as a subaltern,
the social responsibilities of an officer...

389
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:59,279
greatly outweighed his military duties.

390
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,280
Now, this was quite common
before the war...

391
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,850
and the last thing I want to do
is to reestablish that order.

392
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:04,695
Hear! Hear!

393
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,532
We are first and foremost soldiers...

394
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:13,459
and the greater part of our energies
must naturally be devoted to training.

395
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,493
On the other hand, gentlemen...

396
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,495
it is important that we remember...

397
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:20,732
to play our part in the social life
of the locality.

398
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,412
On the 20th of February, therefore...

399
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,899
a month tomorrow...

400
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,902
I have decided
we will have a cocktail party.

401
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:33,855
Now, the next point
is a minor one...

402
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:37,035
but quite an important one,
I believe.

403
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,683
One of the great things
about a battalion such as this...

404
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:44,019
is that it's had its headquarters
in the same place...

405
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,834
for more than 200 years.

406
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:48,097
For this reason, gentlemen...

407
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,980
it is essential that we maintain
certain standards.

408
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,531
We have the reputation
for being tough men in war.

409
00:28:57,532 --> 00:29:02,349
We must also maintain our reputation
for being gentlemen in peace.

410
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:06,039
- What's he gettin' at?
- Old school tie.

411
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,355
<i>- Please don't talk!
- Colonel.</i>

412
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:11,265
In this connection...

413
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:14,593
I would mention the way we dance.

414
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:19,450
I'm well aware
that you all know the steps...

415
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:23,422
but some, I feel, need reminding
that dancing should be considered...

416
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:24,695
a social grace...

417
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,693
rather than a noisy ritual.

418
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:31,742
Therefore, starting tomorrow...

419
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:35,165
each Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday morning...

420
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,376
at 0715 hours...

421
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:43,125
there will be dancing for three quarters
of an hour before breakfast.

422
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:47,243
No one will raise his hands above his head
except in the foursome reel.

423
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,976
No shouting.
No swinging on one arm.

424
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:53,307
The pipe major will take the parade...

425
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:56,918
and you will report dressed as you are now,
but with plimsolls on.

426
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,120
subalterns turn out,
I presume, Colonel?

427
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:00,091
<i>All officers.</i>

428
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,594
I've been dancing reels
for 30 years.

429
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:10,162
I thought he said his visit
the other night was unofficial.

430
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:13,406
- You said something, Captain Rattray?
- Sir.

431
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:14,284
What?

432
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:19,438
I said I thought you said your presence
at Jock's party was unofficial, sir.

433
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,773
It was unofficial.

434
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:26,197
But I warn you, that sort of remark
is extremely ill-advised!

435
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,806
That's all, gentlemen.
Thank you.

436
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,461
- We've been dancers, all of us.
- Sure it is.

437
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,931
- I said he was a sassenach.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

438
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,579
Steady, steady, steady.

439
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:53,735
I'm afraid they're not
gonna like it, sir.

440
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:56,737
- Who aren't going to like what?
- I think you know what I mean, sir.

441
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,740
- That block over there — band block, isn't it?
- Sir.

442
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,842
The windows are filthy.
You can see from here.

443
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:05,146
- Colonel, I —
- I wouldn't do it unless I thought it was absolutely necessary.

444
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,380
- Colonel, it's almost an insult.
- I don't think so.

445
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:09,582
Some of them have been dancing
for 30 years or more.

446
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,218
Then it's a pity they haven't learned
to dance like gentlemen.

447
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:14,887
- Surely the officers of field rank—
- You will not contradict me!

448
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,223
Do you understand?

449
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,207
- Colonel.
- Kindly tell the pipe major I want to see him.

450
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,115
Sir.

451
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:25,410
<i>Order!</i>

452
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:34,272
- Pipe Major.
- Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?

453
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:37,542
C.O. Wants a word with you.
Oh, certainly, sir. Now?

454
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:40,702
- Right away.
- Yes. It's a pleasure, sir.

455
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:41,642
Attention!

456
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:47,882
Stand still, will you? Dozy lot.

457
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:50,980
- Stand out! Right! Corporal.
- Sir.

458
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:53,350
- March 'em off.
- Sir.

459
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,395
Attention! Left turn.
And a quick march. Left wheel.

460
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:05,734
Left, right, left, right, left, right!
Get a move on there, you idle, scruffy lot, you!

461
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:08,050
- C.O.?
- With your permission.

462
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,438
- March in, Mr. MacLean. March in.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Riddick.

463
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,848
That's just what I'll be doing.

464
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:18,266
You.

465
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,748
- What are you doing with that?
- Oh, it's tea, sir.

466
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:25,584
What do you suppose
I thought it was? Beer?

467
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:28,682
Tea break 1530 hours.
The time now, 1525.

468
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,922
- Sir.
- In there. Put it on the desk.

469
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:33,492
You will not fetch tea until
the proper time. You understand?

470
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,493
<i>- Sir.
- And wear your hat!</i>

471
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:36,276
March out.

472
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:49,672
All the pipers are good, sir.
And we'll send along Corporal Fraser.

473
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:51,874
- He's tactful, you know.
- Very good, Pipe Major.

474
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,919
Thank you, sir. It's, uh —

475
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:57,413
It's some time since we had
a subalterns' parade of this kind, sir.

476
00:32:57,414 --> 00:33:00,182
- It isn't only subalterns, you understand.
- Oh.

477
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:04,419
- Oh, but surely the senior officers —
- The order affects all officers.

478
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,964
All the officers, sir. I see, sir.

479
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:12,226
Oh, come in, Jimmy.
We've finished.

480
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,227
- Oh, Pipe Major.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:17,297
One other thing. The windows
of the band block could do with a wash.

482
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:21,568
Oh, aye, sir. I'll mention that to the drum major.
We'll have them seen to straightaway.

483
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,104
- It's a terrible —
- Straightaway.

484
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,982
Thank you very much, sir.

485
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:36,295
Cup of tea, Mr. MacLean?

486
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,798
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr. Riddick.

487
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,836
Ah, there's enough there for one.

488
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,616
Hello. Hello. That's trouble.
You mark my words.

489
00:33:58,335 --> 00:33:59,242
Hello, Jock.

490
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:12,738
Uh, do I intrude?

491
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:17,456
What can we do for you?
No, don't go, Jimmy.

492
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,721
l- I was wondering if you wanted me
for anything this afternoon.

493
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:26,391
Oh, thank you. No, I don't think there are
any more queries just at the moment.

494
00:34:26,392 --> 00:34:30,129
I'm afraid this must be
a terrible bore for you just now.

495
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,564
What have you been doing the day?

496
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,900
Oh, nothing much.
This and that.

497
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,836
Jimmy and I have just been running over
some of the fire precautions.

498
00:34:37,837 --> 00:34:41,072
I noticed on the chart here there aren't
any extinguishers in the NAFFI.

499
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:43,474
There are three or four there.
I remember them well.

500
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:46,477
- They're not on the chart here.
- You'll find them there, right enough.

501
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:49,546
- Is that not correct, Jimmy?
- Quite right. We've been over and checked.

502
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,487
Well, what the hell, then?

503
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,284
I was never any good
at the paperwork anyway.

504
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:56,485
I don't enjoy paperwork much myself.

505
00:34:56,486 --> 00:35:01,158
Is that so? I would have thought
Whitehall would give a man a taste for it.

506
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,941
Would you?

507
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:08,223
Well, Jock, thanks for calling in.
We mustn't keep you.

508
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,540
This, uh, dancing caper,
I just heard about it.

509
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,542
You don't expect me
to turn up, do you?

510
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:24,212
- All officers.
- It's not on, boy.

511
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:29,482
I'm not looking forward
to 7:15 myself very much...

512
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:32,131
but I think we'd best all turn up.

513
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:36,980
Is that an order?

514
00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:41,100
If you like to put it that way.

515
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:45,235
- Now, look here, boy—
- Colonel!

516
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:48,232
I prefer to be addressed as Colonel,
if you don't mind.

517
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:53,937
- Very well, Colonel. If you and I —
- And if I may suggest some other time.

518
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:03,479
<i>White-kneed, wee lily-boy.
That he is.</i>

519
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,481
With his "if I may suggests"...

520
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:07,181
and "some other times"!

521
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,068
<i>All the caper.</i>

522
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,279
What's the matter with you two?

523
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:23,598
Exactly as I said, Mr. MacLean.

524
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,233
I've seen change of commanding officer
before today.

525
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,329
Always trouble.

526
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:31,538
But this one will be better,
I tell you. Better by far.

527
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,107
- Uh, that's your opinion, Mr. Riddick, eh?
- Yes, and shall I tell you why?

528
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,777
- Well, I'm thinking we'll not agree.
- Right. I will.

529
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,845
Because he's a gentleman, that's why.

530
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,513
Och. You're the terrible snob,
Mr. Riddick.

531
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:45,551
It's always the same with you people
who started in the Brigade of Guard.

532
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,554
You're such terrible snobs.

533
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:50,454
- Och, it's wicked.
- Are you attempting to insult my late regiment?

534
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:52,957
- Tell me that, Mr. MacLean.
- No, I am not.

535
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,793
If you want to insult my late regiment,
then we'll meet in the gymnasium!

536
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:59,796
Peter Pan. That's what we should call you.

537
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:03,499
Och, man, you're far too old
to be going to the gymnasium.

538
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,935
Away home and watch
your television set.

539
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:08,220
Muffin the Mule's on at 5:00.

540
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:13,006
By God, you impudent man.
I'll march you right inside!

541
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:16,019
<i>Left, right, left, right, left, right!</i>

542
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:17,077
- You!
- Sir?

543
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:25,098
You horrible, filthy little man, you.

544
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:27,421
You're dirty!
That's what you are! Dirty!

545
00:37:27,422 --> 00:37:29,862
- Sergeant! Take his name!
- Sir.

546
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,588
- What's your name?
- Goring, E.

547
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:56,069
Kiltie, kiltie, kiltie.
A fine night, soldier.

548
00:37:58,116 --> 00:38:01,776
Kiltie, kiltie, cold bum. Kiltie, kiltie, cold bum.

549
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:03,953
- Off it!
- I'm just a wee lassie.

550
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:08,240
And you've no right to be.
Away you go, all of ye! Aye!

551
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:16,322
Come in.

552
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:24,714
Hello, Mary.

553
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:29,043
Hello, stranger.
Have you been drinking for long?

554
00:38:29,044 --> 00:38:31,913
No, lass, I have not been
drinking for long.

555
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:35,115
- You've just been drinking all day.
- I have not.

556
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:38,251
- Well, you've certainly had a few.
- How'd you know?

557
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:41,187
- Your eyes.
- Oh, that's very romantic.

558
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:45,557
- They're pink.
- You're bloody rude, that's what you are.

559
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:49,861
Will you have a seat, Jock?
Oh, thanks very much.

560
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:51,875
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

561
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,499
- Surprised to see me?
- Yes.

562
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:54,792
Ah.

563
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:01,872
- You're looking very well, Mary.
- Well, I can't think why.

564
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,802
I've had two shows today.

565
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,011
Has Miss, um —what's her name —
Rosie, your roommate, gone?

566
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,816
She's not in this play.

567
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,883
<i>"My Sister Eileen."
Is that it?</i>

568
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,252
- Next week's.
- Oh, very good.

569
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,609
A- And are you Eileen?

570
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:22,855
- Eileen's 18.
- You're Eileen. Sure you are.

571
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,062
I hear you've got
a new colonel up the road.

572
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,305
<i>- So we have.
- Are you sore?</i>

573
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:31,364
<i>What's he like?</i>

574
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:34,440
Och. He's a stupid wee man.

575
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:36,106
<i>For instance.</i>

576
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:38,097
Instance...

577
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:42,375
he's making us take dancing lessons.

578
00:39:42,376 --> 00:39:43,033
Me, too.

579
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,488
I'll put you over my knee.

580
00:39:46,814 --> 00:39:50,483
- And no just to spank you.
- You can forget that.

581
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:52,851
- Have you got a whiskey?
- No.

582
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,746
In the drawer, is it?

583
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,323
Now, Mary, I —
I'll pay for it.

584
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:00,391
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- No, I will.

585
00:40:00,392 --> 00:40:01,717
Course you won't.

586
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:05,443
For old times' sake, eh?

587
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:08,932
Shall we away out one of these nights —
the Highlander and the Welcome Hotel?

588
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,836
- For auld lang syne.
- It'll be cheaper at your own home.

589
00:40:12,837 --> 00:40:14,904
Well, you know l-I don't drink there.

590
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:18,007
- You mean you won't take me there.
- Oh, Mary, that's not it.

591
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:20,743
l- l-I'm no the man to drink
in front of a young daughter.

592
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:22,924
You're a liar, Jock Sinclair.

593
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:26,148
But I'll say this for you:
You're a bad liar.

594
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:26,868
Oh, Mary.

595
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:30,059
It's been a long time.

596
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:33,221
- Could we no lock the door?
- We could not.

597
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,297
<i>- Good night, Mary.
- Night.</i>

598
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,891
I could make you if I wanted to.

599
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:41,495
Jock Sinclair, you're the most
conceited man I've ever met.

600
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:43,697
You're not all that great shakes.

601
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:46,098
And there's lots know that,
I can assure you.

602
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:47,257
- Argh.
- Aaah!

603
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:49,498
Now, definitely no.

604
00:40:50,304 --> 00:40:52,348
You didn't used to say no.

605
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:56,241
- You didn't used to be a stranger.
- But, Mary, I'm back.

606
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:59,978
And stinking. You left stinking,
and you're back stinking.

607
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,013
You can't turn the clock back.

608
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:05,182
- We could wind it up again.
- Oh, Mac'll want to put the lights out.

609
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:06,810
Oh, come on, come on.

610
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:11,555
Go on, now. Away out of here
before you get me sacked.

611
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,391
I mean it.

612
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:14,517
Away you go.

613
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,761
Well, good-bye it is.

614
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:29,836
And I mean good-bye.

615
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,185
Good night.

616
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,581
Jock.
#Yo-ho-ho, yo-ho-ho #

617
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:42,808
Oh, you're a bloody woman.

618
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:35,501
Dusty! Dusty!

619
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,467
- Come on. Reveille's sounded.
- Eh?

620
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:42,670
- Reveille.
- Nonsense. Reveille's not for another 10 minutes.

621
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:46,274
That was 10 minutes ago.
It's dancing class. We're on in three minutes.

622
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:46,994
Oh, here.

623
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:52,260
Hand me my kilt
of burning gold.

624
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:55,949
Where are my plimsolls of desire?

625
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,950
It's cruelty. That's what it is, cruelty.

626
00:42:57,952 --> 00:43:03,718
- Margot Fonteyn couldn't suffer more.
- I must go up. I'll be on the carpet.

627
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:16,131
<i>Feet together! Next exercise. Begin!</i>

628
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,869
<i>Now, gentlemen, form up in your set.</i>

629
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,871
<i>We'll begin with the simplest part first.</i>

630
00:43:20,872 --> 00:43:24,141
<i>That is the first lady in the middle
facing your partner.</i>

631
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:27,363
<i>- Dusty!
- It's eight turns round and back.</i>

632
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:28,747
Ready, and...

633
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:33,719
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, round.

634
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,925
One, two, three, four,
five, six, set your partner.

635
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:39,533
Set, two, turn, two.

636
00:43:41,323 --> 00:43:43,752
And set, two, turn, figure three.

637
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,156
One, two, three, four...

638
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,132
five, six, seven and round.

639
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:56,206
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

640
00:43:56,304 --> 00:44:00,107
Captain Rattray, that little dance
you're doing in the middle there.

641
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,875
The hands at the sides,
if you please, not above the head.

642
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:05,611
But surely, Pipe Major,
that's a question of individual style.

643
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,812
I've put my hands up
ever since I learned to dance.

644
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:12,017
Yes, I know, sir, but it's just these little points
of style that we're trying to make consistent.

645
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:16,021
You know, Mr. MacLean, I'm darn sure
the hands should be above the head in the eighth.

646
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:20,258
It is known, Major Sinclair,
but before the war, at the balls, I mean...

647
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:22,726
the gentlemen did not
put their hands above their head.

648
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,728
I still think Captain Rattray's right.

649
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,097
Come along, Pipe Major.
It's far too cold to hang about.

650
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:30,567
- Am I keepin' 'em up, then, or what?
- Of course, you are. Isn't he, Mr. MacLean.

651
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,770
Kindly don't interrupt the pipe major.
He's in charge of this parade...

652
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,772
and we will all follow
his instructions.

653
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,174
- Carry on, Pipe Major.
- Sir. Corporal, with music this time.

654
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:42,678
Back to your places now, gentlemen.
And it's the same again.

655
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:43,764
Are you ready?

656
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:49,193
<i>And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, back.</i>

657
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:53,680
One, two, three, four,
five, six and set. Set!

658
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:55,703
<i>Two, turn, two.</i>

659
00:44:57,725 --> 00:44:59,967
<i>Set, two, turn, reel of three.</i>

660
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:03,191
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

661
00:45:05,198 --> 00:45:07,200
<i>five, six, seven and round.</i>

662
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:10,022
- Good night, Colonel.
- Oh, good night, sir.

663
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:12,024
I'm sorry you have to go so soon.

664
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:14,026
And we're very sorry, too,
Colonel Barrow.

665
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:16,461
If I'd known it was going to be
such a delightful evening...

666
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:18,463
we'd have canceled
our second function.

667
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:21,333
Look, here's the pony.
In the mess, too.

668
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:24,970
Yes, actually, he's collecting
for the soldiers, sailors and airmen's fund.

669
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:26,910
Oh, a most worthy charity.

670
00:46:27,506 --> 00:46:30,197
- Excellent idea.
- Good night again.

671
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:34,318
- Have you got a bob, Enid?
- Oh, yes.

672
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:39,317
Dear little thing.

673
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:44,987
- You enjoying yourself, Miss Sinclair?
- It's a wonderful party.

674
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:47,022
Such a good idea
having the dancing.

675
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:49,458
It's a pleasure to watch you.
I can see you're an expert.

676
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:51,628
Me? I'm nothing of the kind.

677
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,896
I've just been complimented
on my dancing.

678
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,972
- Oh, aye?
- Most sincerely.

679
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,867
What the hell does he know
about Highland dancing, eh?

680
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:02,602
- Aye. That's a question I'd like —
- I don't care what he knows.

681
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,338
It was nice of him to say so.
I think you're being unfair to him.

682
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:08,275
Oh, fine. But there's no need
to bow and scrape.

683
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:12,078
<i>He's no the brigadier, you know.
Just another colonel.</i>

684
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,986
Och. Father.

685
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,949
She's looking really lovely tonight, Jock.

686
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,585
- Keeping all the lads on their toes.
- You can cut that out!

687
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,599
- Jock, you dancing?
- Aye!

688
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:25,852
- I'm dancing, all right. Come on.
- Mmm.

689
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:33,086
Uh, Colonel Barrow...

690
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:37,234
I've been standing here envying you.

691
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,997
The first postwar party.

692
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:41,243
The fruits of victory, eh?

693
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:43,095
And the same day, too.

694
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:47,777
February 20th every year,
come snow or ice, the barracks party.

695
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,102
Right up to 1941.

696
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:54,383
But I'm teaching my grandmother
how to suck eggs.

697
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:57,452
I should think the first Colonel Barrow
started the tradition.

698
00:47:57,453 --> 00:48:00,102
You'll carry it on now, won't you?

699
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:02,117
Every year? You promise?

700
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,406
We'll insist, my friend.

701
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:08,996
I beg your pardon, sir.
I'm afraid I was interrupted.

702
00:48:08,997 --> 00:48:11,465
I was simply saying b-by putting on
a show like this...

703
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:13,466
you're giving us all a taste for it again.

704
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,869
I'm very glad you're enjoying it, sir.

705
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,003
It was the same with the Camerons
up in Inverness.

706
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:21,769
The barracks party was always
the best of the lot.

707
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,642
Excuse me, sir, please.

708
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,992
Jimmy, what's going on out there?

709
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,350
- Och, it's only one or two of them, Colonel.
- It sounds like a bullfight.

710
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:34,500
They'll quieten down.
They've had a dram.

711
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:37,954
- Good evening, Sir Alan.
- I will not tolerate this sort of behavior.

712
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:41,224
- I made it perfectly clear.
- Colonel, I agree. But not now.

713
00:48:41,225 --> 00:48:43,560
- The guests don't mind, sir.
- It's rank disobedience.

714
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:46,296
- I won't let it pass.
- We could have it out in the morning, sir.

715
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:47,861
Don't argue with me!

716
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:58,229
<i>Wendy, are you bruised?
Come on, then.</i>

717
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:05,370
Stop it! Stop it!

718
00:49:06,048 --> 00:49:07,320
Stop the dancing!

719
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:12,072
<i>- Sinclair, do you hear me?
- Sir?</i>

720
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,554
Shut up! Sinclair!

721
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:19,446
- You called me, Colonel?
- I did!

722
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:24,163
I've never seen such an exhibition!
You'll see me tomorrow!

723
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:25,373
Pipes, fall out!

724
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,334
I — I'm, uh —

725
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,938
I'm sorry. The —

726
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,951
The party's over.

727
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,061
It's, uh — It's late.

728
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:11,939
I'm sorry that, uh,
it should end like this.

729
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,587
I, um —

730
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:16,552
I apologize to my guests.

731
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:28,021
We were just beginning
to enjoy ourselves, Colonel.

732
00:50:28,022 --> 00:50:29,961
- Who said that?
- I did.

733
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:33,690
- Adjutant, take that officer's name.
- Sir.

734
00:50:36,596 --> 00:50:38,702
What the hell's the man on?

735
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:45,569
- I was in my rights.
- You were nothing of the sort.

736
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,572
That was damn bad form, that's what it was.
In front of all the guests.

737
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:52,008
What'll I say in the morn, eh?
What'll I tell him?

738
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,523
Jock, man, you'd no right
to behave like that.

739
00:50:56,446 --> 00:51:00,649
Wee Jimmy, are you telling Jock
how to behave? Is that it?

740
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,152
Oh, for God's sake.

741
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:10,631
Colonel!

742
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,123
Colonel Barrow.

743
00:51:25,105 --> 00:51:27,940
I know you'd walk the plank for him.
But I don't care what you say.

744
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:30,309
- He'd no right behaving like that. It was awful.
- Och.

745
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,310
Never heed. It's not your fault.

746
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:35,147
- Are you sure you can make it?
- Yes, but I have to go home first.

747
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:40,518
- Three quarters of an hour?
- All right. Bridge Hotel, private bar, okay?

748
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:20,131
Well, fast driving's one way
of getting something out of the system.

749
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:23,310
What a ghastly thing to do.

750
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:27,259
Och, people always do silly things
at mess parties. It's part of the tradition.

751
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:29,863
- Hmm. I remember somebody once —
- Not the colonel.

752
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:34,835
Why not? The colonel's human,
the same as the rest of us, isn't he?

753
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:39,038
- Ridicule is always the finish.
- Och, now, who said anything about ridicule?

754
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,180
They behaved badly, and you tore a strip
off them. Is there anything wrong in that?

755
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:47,912
Strange I should stop at this spot.

756
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,947
I used to come here sometimes.

757
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:52,565
- When was that?
- Oh, years ago...

758
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,953
when the future was bright.

759
00:52:54,953 --> 00:52:58,217
I had one pip and no chips
on my shoulder.

760
00:52:59,324 --> 00:53:01,658
Did you ever dream
when you were a subaltern, Jimmy?

761
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:06,851
Oh, aye. Big brave deeds —
I was gonna win the V.C. And die a hero.

762
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,001
When you're dying —

763
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:15,703
When you really believe you're dying,
you think of the most absurd things.

764
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:17,705
In my war,
I never had time to think.

765
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:20,808
Oh, they gave me time, all right,
again and again.

766
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:23,144
When I was in the prison camp...

767
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:26,555
nearly drowned me,
then they brought me round.

768
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:32,185
Then they put a wet cloth over my mouth
and kept it wet until I nearly drowned again.

769
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:35,854
And the only thing that pulled me through
was the thought that one day I'd come back...

770
00:53:35,855 --> 00:53:39,858
and sit in the middle of that table
as colonel of this battalion.

771
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:43,269
Like my grandfather
and his father before him.

772
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,669
Only I was gonna be
the best of the lot.

773
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:52,102
Well, it — it did pull you through.
You survived.

774
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:55,306
- Surely nothing could seem too hard now.
- Who said I survived?

775
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:58,935
Oh, come on, sir.
You're here to tell the tale.

776
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:02,224
I was married once, you know.

777
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,595
That's all finished now.

778
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:05,728
Sorry.

779
00:54:08,385 --> 00:54:11,711
I, uh —
I've been rather lonely since that.

780
00:54:12,656 --> 00:54:17,681
I think that's why I was
looking forward to this job —job so much.

781
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:20,397
I'm sorry.

782
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:24,966
You're a very patient man, Jimmy,
and I'm very—

783
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:26,353
I'm very grateful.

784
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,979
You've got no coat.
I'm sorry.

785
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:02,203
I thank you, Mr. Scoby. Cheers.

786
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:07,647
Thanks.

787
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,812
Uh, Export and orange, please.

788
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,387
<i>Export and an orange.</i>

789
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,952
- Where on earth did you meet her?
- At the ice rink.

790
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:27,355
- She was there and —
- And you talked to her, eh?

791
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,490
No, no.
No, I went back the next day.

792
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:32,860
- And then you talked to her.
- No, I had to go back the third day.

793
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:35,729
So you must be getting very proficient
at the ice-skating, eh?

794
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,099
Well, you're a good piper and a good corporal...

795
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,268
and a soldier's private life is his own...

796
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:42,051
but, uh...

797
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,575
you're asking for trouble, lan.

798
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:48,741
Do you have to go on seeing her?

799
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:49,524
Thank you.

800
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,301
Yes, Pipey, I do.

801
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:54,480
<i>#For we're no'awa'#</i>

802
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:57,283
- See you later, Pipey.
- Aye, see you later.

803
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:59,942
# For we're no' awa' tae leave ye #

804
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:04,008
# For we're no' awa' tae bide awa' #

805
00:56:06,424 --> 00:56:10,678
- #We'll aye come back an' see ye ##
- Party, eyes right!

806
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:12,446
Hold a minute!

807
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:16,094
You're a shower, you are.

808
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,234
So the band still goes to the Bridge.

809
00:56:18,235 --> 00:56:20,268
- Sir.
- Aye, it's a long tradition, that one.

810
00:56:20,269 --> 00:56:22,198
I went myself as a piper.

811
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:24,573
Come on in.
I'll give you all a dram.

812
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:26,575
- Now, sir?
- That's what I'm saying.

813
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:29,978
- Uh, it's late, sir.
- That's it, sir. It's too late. Right enough.

814
00:56:29,979 --> 00:56:34,214
Ah, there's time.
We'll all have a drink on an ex-piper...

815
00:56:34,215 --> 00:56:35,779
no a colonel at all.

816
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:39,186
For God's sake,
can you not stop him?

817
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,031
Lounge bar.

818
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,763
Hey, lounge bar, sir.

819
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:49,685
- No the priva'? We always used to —
- It's the lounge bar we use now, sir.

820
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:56,535
Aye, it's, uh, very cozy
and, uh, respectable.

821
00:56:56,536 --> 00:56:59,071
Good evening.
What's it to be, then? whiskey?

822
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:01,872
- There's no chance of that, sir.
- Still under the counter, then.

823
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:04,470
Mr. Scoby's an old friend of mine.

824
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:08,045
- Have you any whiskey for us?
- I have not.

825
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:09,913
Just a beer for me, sir.

826
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:11,215
- Corporal.
- Same, sir.

827
00:57:11,216 --> 00:57:12,650
- Rum, sir.
- Rum, sir.

828
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:14,684
- Rum, sir.
- You all take rum, then?

829
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,614
Aye, sir. It's our hobby.

830
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:20,356
Oh, I'm losing count.
Uh, that's, uh, two beers, Mr. Scoby...

831
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:23,986
and a dram for an ex-piper
and, uh, three rums.

832
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:32,955
Would —Would you care
for a cigarette, sir?

833
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,973
- You bloody wee liar!
- Father, I can tell you why I'm here.

834
00:57:39,974 --> 00:57:42,008
- Sir, I've been meaning —
- You're a liar!

835
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:43,876
Sir, it's my fault, sir—

836
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,235
You keep your nose out of this!

837
00:57:48,149 --> 00:57:49,953
I hate you! I hate you!

838
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,182
<i>I hate you!</i>

839
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:01,860
I'll no have any brawls in my hotel.

840
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:03,978
Wait in the other bar, lads.

841
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:06,317
And see to the lassie, too.

842
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,120
We'll just be one minute, Mr. Scoby.

843
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,601
Off you go now.

844
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:20,547
<i>Bring the cold water over here.</i>

845
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:29,184
I cannot understand it at all,
a man of your experience to do such a thing.

846
00:58:29,185 --> 00:58:30,885
Such a... stupid thing.

847
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:35,624
What do you think made me do it, eh?

848
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,492
Did you not know
about that young man?

849
00:58:38,493 --> 00:58:40,673
- No.
- Did she no tell you?

850
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:43,056
No.

851
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:48,668
Och, well, maybe it was just
the shock of it all, eh?

852
00:58:48,669 --> 00:58:49,816
Aye, just that.

853
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,651
He was in his uniform, wasn't he?

854
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:10,291
<i>- I'm afraid he was. Aye.
- I saw what happened.</i>

855
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:32,711
Jock! What on earth
are you doing here?

856
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:36,779
- Is something wrong?
- Aye, Mary.

857
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,514
I've done a stupid thing.
Can I come in?

858
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:43,551
Oh, Jock, I don't want you in
at this hour. I, um —

859
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:47,254
- Well, what is it you've done?
- I've bashed a corporal.

860
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,309
- You've what?
- In a pub.

861
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:51,959
Yeah, I don't know what came over me.

862
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,995
- And the lad was in uniform.
- Oh, Jock, that's serious.

863
00:59:54,996 --> 00:59:57,717
It's more than that.
It's suicidal.

864
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:00,519
Well, you'd better come in.

865
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:10,842
- As a matter of fact, I've got company.
- Oh, who?

866
01:00:10,843 --> 01:00:13,189
It's all right. It's a friend.

867
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:26,574
Charlie Scott?
What are you doing here?

868
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,492
Visiting, old boy. Just visiting.

869
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,390
Take a pew.

870
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,497
With you two all cozily tucked up?

871
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,166
Hell, I'm no as sorry for myself
as all that.

872
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,159
I'm only sorry I intruded.

873
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:43,454
Oh, don't judge everybody
by yourself, Jock.

874
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:46,431
Charlie, Jock's bashed a corporal.

875
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:50,410
- Not wise, old man.
- And maybe any minute he'll bash a major, too.

876
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,424
Fibbing, smooth, auld stoat.

877
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:55,394
- Jock!
- Och, never worry.

878
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:59,818
I'll no kick him.
He's a terror with the ladies...

879
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:00,727
our Charlie.

880
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:04,256
Oh, you're just jumping to conclusions.

881
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:06,959
Charlie, what can we do about this?
Jock hit him in a pub.

882
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,014
You'll do nothing about it.

883
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:12,064
Jock can see the score,
and Jock's away out of here.

884
01:01:12,065 --> 01:01:14,140
<i>- Charlie.
- Night, old boy.</i>

885
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,901
<i>To hell with the civilities...</i>

886
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:17,559
old boy.

887
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:19,748
Jock. Jock.

888
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:24,841
- You all right?
- I'm all right, lassie.

889
01:01:24,842 --> 01:01:26,302
Dinna fash yourself.

890
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:36,664
Take arms! Arms to the right!

891
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:39,629
Arms to the right,
then turn!

892
01:01:40,923 --> 01:01:41,830
Right, turn!

893
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:46,928
- Any news?
- The report went through to Barrow's office an hour ago.

894
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:49,397
- Oh, hell. And Jock?
- Taken cover.

895
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:53,334
The Barrow boy will fix him, by what right
I don't know after his exhibition last night.

896
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,212
Not the same thing, chum.

897
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,772
Shouting and screaming
at a cocktail party, that's one thing...

898
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:01,379
but thou shalt not bash a corporal.

899
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:03,610
That's different.
That's the law.

900
01:02:03,611 --> 01:02:07,747
It's very unpleasant.
My motives are bound to be suspected.

901
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:12,017
Th-That's neither here nor there.
I shan't be swayed by any personal considerations.

902
01:02:12,018 --> 01:02:14,886
One wants to try
and get an objective view of the thing.

903
01:02:14,887 --> 01:02:17,289
That's why I've asked Scott over.

904
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:20,492
It's all a great pity.
It's easy to be lenient...

905
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:24,629
but striking a corporal in uniform
in a public place, that is damn serious, Jimmy.

906
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,198
I see that, but I'm sure Charles
will take the same view as myself—

907
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:30,681
Well, I — Come in.
Hello, Scott.

908
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:36,605
- Colonel.
- You heard about last night?

909
01:02:36,606 --> 01:02:39,891
I heard.
High jinks at the pipers' hideaway.

910
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:44,947
The question now is,
do we forget the incident, or do we go on?

911
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:48,383
Jimmy here has expressed his views,
but before I make up my own mind...

912
01:02:48,384 --> 01:02:50,678
I'd like to have your opinion.

913
01:02:50,919 --> 01:02:54,489
Your realize that if we do go on,
it will probably mean a court-martial.

914
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,054
Certain to, I'd say.

915
01:02:56,491 --> 01:03:00,293
<i>That sort of thing doesn't do
the battalion's name any good.</i>

916
01:03:00,294 --> 01:03:04,598
It does its name more harm if the story leaks out
and we've done nothing about it, Colonel.

917
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,726
- You think so?
- Of course.

918
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,036
But, Charlie, Jock's a special case.

919
01:03:09,037 --> 01:03:10,476
Is he? In a pub...

920
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:14,240
in uniform,
in front of witnesses.

921
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:16,442
- Am I right?
- Perfectly correct.

922
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,424
Oh, I know, I know, but —

923
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:22,347
Look, if Corporal Fraser
had put in a complaint...

924
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:26,316
then there'd be nothing we could do,
but he hasn't and I don't think he will.

925
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:28,686
It wasn't really
a military matter at all, Charlie.

926
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:30,754
Afraid I can't agree with you, old man.

927
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:33,857
- Of course, it's your decision, Colonel.
- Yes, of course.

928
01:03:33,858 --> 01:03:36,593
It won't make you
very popular, I'm afraid.

929
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:38,695
That's the fate of a commanding officer.

930
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:42,752
I hope that won't sway me
from doing my job properly.

931
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:45,461
- Well, thank you, Scott.
- Colonel.

932
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,970
- Now, look, Charlie, before you go —
- Just a minute, Jimmy.

933
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,440
Tell the sergeant major
I've made up my mind...

934
01:03:51,441 --> 01:03:54,209
and make the necessary arrangements
to collect all the evidence.

935
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,892
There will be a formal inquiry
and papers passed up to brigade.

936
01:04:01,983 --> 01:04:04,214
<i>Don't take it too hard, chum.</i>

937
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,854
<i>Of course I take it hard, Charlie.</i>

938
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:12,120
<i>Didn't he lead us?
Didn't he teach me all the soldiering I ever knew?</i>

939
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,257
Jock.

940
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:33,024
<i>- Jock, are you there?
- Hello.</i>

941
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:38,516
Mary, what the hell
are you doing here, lass?

942
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:41,684
- What the hell are you doing there?
- Me? I'm cleaning my teeth.

943
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:44,755
In your greatcoat,
at this hour of the morning?

944
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,810
Laddie, what are you up to?

945
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:50,126
It's me own kind of NAFFI break.

946
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:51,451
Come in, come in.

947
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:58,967
I'd offer you some coffee
if I knew where it was.

948
01:04:58,968 --> 01:05:01,220
- Or some booze.
- Never mind.

949
01:05:03,372 --> 01:05:05,426
I think Morag must hide it.

950
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:10,372
- Do you not have an orderly these days?
- I sent him away.

951
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:13,391
Morag's gone, you know. Uh...

952
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:17,130
gone to stay with a friend,
shall we say.

953
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,101
- Poor wee lassie.
- Jock.

954
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:24,223
- I've told Charlie he's had it.
- You what?

955
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,792
Well, he'd no right to do it.
I'm through with him.

956
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:29,127
Barrow would never have dared
to move without him.

957
01:05:29,128 --> 01:05:31,830
- I could see that a mile off.
- You mystify me, woman.

958
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:36,325
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Charlie hasn't told you?

959
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:38,428
You tell me.

960
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,973
Well, Barrow had Charlie in this morning,
he asked him what he thought...

961
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,309
and Charlie came down against you.

962
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:50,314
- Charlie told you this?
- I was on the phone to him.

963
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,905
He never told me.

964
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:56,451
- Maybe he isn't going to.
- That's an awful thing to say.

965
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,141
Charlie is no a sneak.

966
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:02,138
Did he tell you what Barrow said?

967
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,194
There's going to be
a formal inquiry.

968
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:06,789
Uh-huh.

969
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:10,073
Well...

970
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:12,366
that's it.

971
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,589
That's the finish.

972
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:21,507
But Charlie'd never do anything
out of spite.

973
01:06:21,508 --> 01:06:24,109
You see us when we're drunk
and playing the fool.

974
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,341
You don't see the other side.

975
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:30,061
He's a good officer, Charlie.

976
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:33,218
- You know I never make trouble.
- I know nothing about you.

977
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:34,366
Nothing at all.

978
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,699
Oh, Mary dear...

979
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:42,795
I'm sorry.

980
01:06:43,963 --> 01:06:46,017
I shouldn't have said that.

981
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,299
I'm sorry. No, really, I am.

982
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,969
- Oh, it's no business of mine anyway.
- Oh, lassie.

983
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:57,412
You can't have officers bashing corporals.
I know that fine.

984
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:00,804
I'd have done the same as Charlie.

985
01:07:01,444 --> 01:07:03,748
Never in a hundred years, Jock.

986
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,377
That's the whole difference.

987
01:07:06,449 --> 01:07:10,719
You always think good of them,
but there's none of them live up to you.

988
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,154
- You're away out in front.
- Hmm. I'm tired.

989
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,063
Fair bashed.

990
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:19,626
- Look at me.
- Man, it was you that taught me...

991
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:21,744
that you could always go on.

992
01:07:22,162 --> 01:07:24,164
You had a word. Resilience.

993
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:26,508
The front teeth.

994
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,796
The ones you hang on with, eh?

995
01:07:31,437 --> 01:07:33,241
Och, I'll be all right.

996
01:07:33,606 --> 01:07:35,649
I had the hell of a night.

997
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:38,730
But you've gotta go back in there...

998
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,992
if it's only for my sake.

999
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:42,389
Jock...

1000
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:48,188
I lay in bed this morning
with my eyes closed...

1001
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:52,722
and I looked down a list of men
that's too long by half...

1002
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:56,793
and I asked myself what the hell
I can show at the end of it...

1003
01:07:56,794 --> 01:07:58,671
except for wear and tear.

1004
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:02,985
And I stopped at your name.

1005
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:07,185
And I said out loud to the ceiling...

1006
01:08:07,804 --> 01:08:10,538
I've been held in the arms of a man...

1007
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,051
who was truly brave.

1008
01:08:13,709 --> 01:08:17,478
For heaven's sake,
don't take that away from me, too.

1009
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:18,323
Oh, lassie.

1010
01:08:21,716 --> 01:08:24,418
- I'm no coping at all.
- No matter.

1011
01:08:24,419 --> 01:08:27,386
I'm not here to tell you
that I love you.

1012
01:08:27,387 --> 01:08:30,536
I'm not even here
for the old invitation.

1013
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:37,309
I'm just here to say that it's not possible
forJock Sinclair to be too tired.

1014
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:44,470
- Spit and polish, eh?
- That's it.

1015
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:47,860
Shoeshine and shave
and back in there.

1016
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:54,321
I'm no good at the compliments,
Mary dear.

1017
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:56,579
Does it sound more like an insult...

1018
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,982
if I say you're a soldier's girl?

1019
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:02,258
- No, Jock.
- Oh, it's not meant to anyway.

1020
01:09:05,022 --> 01:09:09,318
If it doesn't say one hell of a lot
for your chastity...

1021
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,529
it's a load about the heart.

1022
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:14,067
- Come on.
- Eh.

1023
01:09:17,499 --> 01:09:19,251
Away and run your bath.

1024
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:22,376
<i>Right, left, right, left, right, left!</i>

1025
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:23,544
Right, left!

1026
01:09:24,639 --> 01:09:25,421
Eyes left!

1027
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:27,552
Eyes front!

1028
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:30,546
<i>Pick it up, gentlemen!</i>

1029
01:09:30,945 --> 01:09:33,687
<i>Left, right, left, right, left, right!</i>

1030
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:48,352
Good morning, gents.

1031
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,531
Well, that's a fine, cheerful greeting.

1032
01:09:54,532 --> 01:09:57,167
Dusty, would you be so kind
as to press that on the wall...

1033
01:09:57,168 --> 01:09:59,169
and we'll see
if I can get myself a drink?

1034
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,068
Certainly, Jock. Certainly.

1035
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:11,679
Uh, Charlie, was it you
trying to telephone me this morning?

1036
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,942
Me, old boy? No.

1037
01:10:24,092 --> 01:10:26,960
Dear Mummy,
my chilblains are terrible.

1038
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:29,063
- Good morning, Corporal.
- Good morning, sir.

1039
01:10:29,064 --> 01:10:31,464
Are you feeling the heat, Corporal?

1040
01:10:31,465 --> 01:10:34,600
- It's cold, sir.
- No wonder it's cold, lad. You're naked.

1041
01:10:34,602 --> 01:10:37,219
- Do up your collar buttons.
- Sir.

1042
01:10:37,438 --> 01:10:39,906
Then you can bring me
one hell of a whiskey.

1043
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:42,044
- Sir.
- Steady, lad. Steady.

1044
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:45,177
- What are you drinking, Charlie?
- Actually, I've had lunch.

1045
01:10:45,178 --> 01:10:46,815
What are you drinking?

1046
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:49,881
I'm asking something
that's a question of fact...

1047
01:10:49,882 --> 01:10:51,206
not just a rumor.

1048
01:10:52,518 --> 01:10:55,010
- What's in your glass?
- Brandy.

1049
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,049
And one hell of a brandy.

1050
01:10:58,457 --> 01:11:01,092
- Old boy.
- Jock, man, can I have a word with you?

1051
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:02,792
- What is it?
- Not here.

1052
01:11:02,794 --> 01:11:04,527
- Is it shop?
- Sort of.

1053
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,332
Is it shop? I'm asking.

1054
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:10,033
- Aye, it is.
- Then not now. Not in the mess.

1055
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:12,161
Well, well, well, well, well.

1056
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,227
And what's news today?

1057
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:22,835
Is there no news?

1058
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,659
Surely some wee bit of gossip, eh?

1059
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:31,815
MacKinnon.

1060
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:40,713
- It snowed.
- Plus 10 for observation. Oh, laddie.

1061
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:44,463
Look, Jock, I've got to talk to you.
It's dead important.

1062
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,664
Jimmy, Jimmy, lad,
nothing's that important.

1063
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:47,812
Nothing at all.

1064
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:51,076
And maybe I don't want to know.

1065
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:54,532
This might be important, Jock.
Really, quite.

1066
01:11:55,074 --> 01:11:57,670
God knows what you all think I am.

1067
01:11:58,076 --> 01:12:00,068
You must think I'm deaf...

1068
01:12:00,078 --> 01:12:01,528
and dumb and blind.

1069
01:12:03,214 --> 01:12:06,529
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?

1070
01:12:09,053 --> 01:12:11,154
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

1071
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:12,594
Won't you join us?

1072
01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:17,282
Uh, thank you,
but I've just had lunch.

1073
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:19,294
- A brandy, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

1074
01:12:19,295 --> 01:12:21,963
Actually, I'm shooting this afternoon.
I won't, if you don't mind.

1075
01:12:21,964 --> 01:12:23,236
Just some coffee.

1076
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:28,837
Would Charlie like a coffee, too?

1077
01:12:28,838 --> 01:12:31,434
No, no, Major Scott.
I'll get it.

1078
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:34,305
Excuse me, Colonel.

1079
01:12:35,743 --> 01:12:38,840
Charlie doesn't take cream
in his coffee.

1080
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,949
That's very sophisticated, isn't it?

1081
01:12:42,183 --> 01:12:44,384
<i>- I really wouldn't know, Jock.
- Jock.</i>

1082
01:12:44,385 --> 01:12:46,637
Eric, is that no sophisticated?

1083
01:12:46,886 --> 01:12:48,954
Not especially,
I shouldn't have thought.

1084
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:53,192
"Not especially, I shouldn't have thought."
"Naturally." "In point of fact."

1085
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:55,726
<i>If you know what I mean, old boy.</i>

1086
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:58,796
To hell with you, Charlie Scott.
You can get your own coffee.

1087
01:12:58,797 --> 01:13:00,486
Jock's going to lunch.

1088
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:03,303
Who'll keep him company? Jimmy?

1089
01:13:04,402 --> 01:13:07,614
Not me, Jock.
Uh, I'm sorry. Early parade.

1090
01:13:11,943 --> 01:13:14,237
Have I got to eat alone, then?

1091
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:18,331
I'll keep you company, Jock.

1092
01:13:23,185 --> 01:13:23,842
Me, too.

1093
01:13:28,023 --> 01:13:31,349
Alec Rattray's not the lad
to let you down.

1094
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:40,886
Oh, my babies.

1095
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,905
For the last time, Mr. MacLean...

1096
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:25,040
I tell you it is not for us
to interfere.

1097
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:29,044
And I tell you, Mr. Riddick,
it's your duty as senior warrant officer...

1098
01:14:29,045 --> 01:14:32,780
to express the opinion of every other
noncommissioned officer in this battalion.

1099
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:34,950
I'll not do it, Mr. MacLean.

1100
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:40,221
- Then I shall, Mr. Riddick.
- You'll do no such thing, you impudent man!

1101
01:14:40,222 --> 01:14:42,651
March in, Mr. Riddick.
March in.

1102
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:53,490
Come in.

1103
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:06,878
- Permission to speak, sir, please.
- Yes, Mr. Riddick. What is it?

1104
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:10,682
Sir, been talking with the pipe major.
I believe he's had a word with the adjutant.

1105
01:15:10,683 --> 01:15:14,751
<i>- Well, go on.
- Perhaps we're being a little hasty with this inquiry, sir.</i>

1106
01:15:14,752 --> 01:15:16,076
What did you say?

1107
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:21,024
Wouldn't express an opinion of this sort unless it was
the opinion of all the noncommissioned officers, sir!

1108
01:15:21,025 --> 01:15:23,460
<i>It does seem as how they feel
such an inquiry would—</i>

1109
01:15:23,461 --> 01:15:25,588
Mr. Riddick, you astonish me.

1110
01:15:26,863 --> 01:15:30,166
I thought I gave an order
that the evidence would be collected.

1111
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,567
- Sir! I understood the order, sir!
- Then obey it!

1112
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:33,601
Mr. Riddick...

1113
01:15:36,138 --> 01:15:40,075
I realize this can't be a popular order,
but it is an order.

1114
01:15:40,076 --> 01:15:42,509
It's the good of the battalion
we must think of.

1115
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:46,213
Begging your pardon, sir. It was
the good of the battalion we were considering.

1116
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:50,450
Feel the battalion might best be served
if you were to deal with this little matter yourself.

1117
01:15:50,451 --> 01:15:53,319
There's no question of that, do you hear me?
No question of it.

1118
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,709
Damn it!
The sergeant's mess isn't a senate!

1119
01:15:57,691 --> 01:16:00,893
For God's sake, Mr. Riddick,
if an officer strikes another rank...

1120
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:02,894
he has to pay for it, hasn't he?

1121
01:16:02,895 --> 01:16:04,834
- Well, hasn't he?
- Sir.

1122
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:07,576
- Well, get cracking with it.
- Sir!

1123
01:16:29,053 --> 01:16:29,709
Come in.

1124
01:16:35,392 --> 01:16:39,060
Please, sir, would you like
a doughnut with your tea?

1125
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,062
- A what?
- A-A doughnut, sir.

1126
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,431
Some of the lads have doughnuts
with their teas...

1127
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,433
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

1128
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,101
They cost four pence each, sir,
but they're very good.

1129
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,872
- I could arrange it, sir.
- Not for me.

1130
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:53,373
- Oh, I strongly recommend them, sir.
- No, thank you.

1131
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:56,643
Very good, sir.
I just thought I would ask you.

1132
01:16:56,644 --> 01:17:00,547
Colonel Sinclair always used to
like one with his tea.

1133
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:03,342
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- Sir.

1134
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,996
<i>#I saw a woman in a big golden hayfield #</i>

1135
01:17:41,517 --> 01:17:44,196
Hello. You chaps been playing squash?

1136
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:47,842
The nearest squash court, sir,
is 30 miles.

1137
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,704
Been for a run, Colonel.

1138
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,792
You haven't, by any chance,
seen Major Sinclair, have you?

1139
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:56,696
- Jimmy said he was in the mess.
- He's sleeping it off in Dusty's room. Twenty-one.

1140
01:17:56,697 --> 01:17:58,731
Ah. Thank you, Simpson.
Thank you.

1141
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:04,736
I'm glad to see that some of my officers
take some energetic exercise in the afternoons.

1142
01:18:04,737 --> 01:18:07,607
I don't see why you should always
be so damn rude, Alec.

1143
01:18:07,608 --> 01:18:10,882
<i>After all,
it's a tricky situation for him.</i>

1144
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:23,515
Dusty's no here.

1145
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:32,215
I gathered that.
I came to see you.

1146
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:33,462
Did I wake you?

1147
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:39,739
- You did.
- Well, I'm sorry, but I think it's important.

1148
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:46,376
- I'm afraid that I haven't, um —
- There's a packet in me pocket there.

1149
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:52,456
What's the time, Colonel?

1150
01:18:52,647 --> 01:18:53,419
Uh, 4:00.

1151
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:56,286
On a gloomy afternoon.

1152
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:00,821
I thought you were out shooting
whatever it is gentlemen shoot.

1153
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:02,386
I decided not to go.

1154
01:19:04,526 --> 01:19:06,627
This is quite unofficial,
you understand...

1155
01:19:06,628 --> 01:19:08,961
but I want to have things
out in the open.

1156
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:11,696
If you're trying to bewilder me, Colonel,
you're doing fine.

1157
01:19:11,697 --> 01:19:15,333
I'm not trying to bewilder you.
On the contrary, I, uh —

1158
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,402
This isn't easy for me, you know.

1159
01:19:17,403 --> 01:19:22,006
- What do you think it is for me? A bloody picnic?
- No, I don't think that.

1160
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,312
Jock, I'm sorry.
Really sorry.

1161
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:27,145
Whatever the circumstances,
no reasonable man...

1162
01:19:27,146 --> 01:19:30,180
can be expected to enjoy
the business of hurting a brother officer.

1163
01:19:30,181 --> 01:19:31,745
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1164
01:19:33,084 --> 01:19:35,993
All right. You're sorry.
Good for you.

1165
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:40,145
You haven't told me yet
what you've done anyway.

1166
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:48,296
Mr. Riddick is collecting
formal evidence with a view to court-martial.

1167
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:52,033
- I'm afraid I had no choice.
- What do you mean, "no choice"?

1168
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:54,135
You could deal with it
yourself, couldn't you?

1169
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:56,737
- I wish I could.
- You're the colonel, aren't you?

1170
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:59,339
That's exactly what I mean,
and I put it to you:

1171
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:02,309
Under the given circumstances,
can you find any possible reason...

1172
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:04,411
why I shouldn't send you up for trial?

1173
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:09,416
If one of my officers had done it,
I'd give him one such hell of a row.

1174
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:13,552
I took my orders from brigade,
but I never had to take my dirty washing there.

1175
01:20:13,553 --> 01:20:15,654
There were
civilian witnesses present. If I —

1176
01:20:15,655 --> 01:20:17,656
Oh, to hell with you, Barrow boy.

1177
01:20:17,657 --> 01:20:19,857
What are you?
A man or a book?

1178
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:24,362
You come in here to say sorry in one breath
and ax me down with the next.

1179
01:20:24,363 --> 01:20:27,164
You'll be away to brigade
in a year or two anyway.

1180
01:20:27,165 --> 01:20:29,700
What does commanding
the battalion mean to you?

1181
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,234
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1182
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,209
You may have come in here
as a boy piper, Sinclair...

1183
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,202
but I was here before you.

1184
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:46,396
I was born with this regiment —
born into an idea.

1185
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,883
The bandaged feet at Corunna...

1186
01:20:48,884 --> 01:20:51,554
the square at Waterloo,
the thin red line...

1187
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,689
<i>the charge of our Highlanders
hanging onto the cavalry's stirrups...</i>

1188
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,640
<i>and "Scotland the Brave"...</i>

1189
01:20:56,992 --> 01:21:00,295
<i>the mud at Passchendaele,
in which my own father fell.</i>

1190
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:02,863
And I've kept up with the history.

1191
01:21:02,864 --> 01:21:05,932
I even know the chapter
where you took over in the desert...

1192
01:21:05,933 --> 01:21:11,209
sitting on the edge of a bren gun carrier
like a... bobby at a tattoo.

1193
01:21:11,271 --> 01:21:14,407
Accuse me of anything you like, Jock,
but don't accuse me of not caring.

1194
01:21:14,408 --> 01:21:16,909
I've eaten, walked, slept
and dreamt this regiment...

1195
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,912
since my first toy soldier.

1196
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,184
I'm sorry.

1197
01:21:26,986 --> 01:21:29,457
Oh, no, no.
No, don't be sorry.

1198
01:21:30,622 --> 01:21:33,957
Perhaps it's rather late for apologies
on either side.

1199
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:37,410
But if I could, with honor,
find a way out...

1200
01:21:37,662 --> 01:21:39,730
I assure you I would take it.

1201
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:41,545
No, no, no, no, Colonel.

1202
01:21:43,467 --> 01:21:46,011
But I'm lying here thinking, uh...

1203
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:48,653
who's hurt by the headlines?

1204
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,247
Ex-colonel strikes
lover-boy corporal, eh?

1205
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:56,210
And I'll tell you who suffers most.

1206
01:21:56,211 --> 01:22:00,028
Not Morag, not the corporal,
not me, but the, um —

1207
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,984
Uh, you express yourself
better than me.

1208
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:07,103
Uh — Uh, not just the battalion.
What was it you said?

1209
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:10,233
- The idea.
- That's it.

1210
01:22:11,592 --> 01:22:13,531
The idea of the battalion.

1211
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:18,052
The living and the dead,
all together.

1212
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:19,869
<i>The regiment.</i>

1213
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:23,178
<i>That's what suffers most.</i>

1214
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:29,274
Colonel, I've made
a bloody fool of myself.

1215
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:30,599
I know that fine.

1216
01:22:32,078 --> 01:22:34,184
But I'll not do that twice.

1217
01:22:34,747 --> 01:22:37,103
Not if I get the second chance.

1218
01:22:38,516 --> 01:22:40,508
I'd be behind you, Barrow.

1219
01:22:41,686 --> 01:22:43,427
We'd make a good team.

1220
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:47,429
You've Jock's word on that.

1221
01:23:06,808 --> 01:23:07,590
All right.

1222
01:23:10,212 --> 01:23:12,933
You mean you won't press it further?

1223
01:23:13,914 --> 01:23:16,385
That's what I seem to have said.

1224
01:23:17,551 --> 01:23:18,573
Oh, God, man!

1225
01:23:20,855 --> 01:23:22,419
You won't regret it.

1226
01:23:24,057 --> 01:23:27,759
You won't regret it, Colonel.
I promise you that.

1227
01:23:30,996 --> 01:23:32,560
I hope you're right.

1228
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:43,072
"Toy soldier."

1229
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:58,821
Any more talk of lasses in the mess, lad,
and we'll have the kilt off you.

1230
01:23:58,822 --> 01:24:01,891
- Is that not so, gentlemen?
- Aye, we'll sit him on the table...

1231
01:24:01,892 --> 01:24:03,892
<i>and have him dancing in his bare butt.</i>

1232
01:24:03,893 --> 01:24:05,994
<i>MacKinnon, let's see you do—</i>

1233
01:24:05,995 --> 01:24:08,129
Waiter! Where the hell
have they all got to?

1234
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:10,932
Waiter. You won't know what's
coming to you. Bring me a whiskey.

1235
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:12,966
And we'll have another round on me.

1236
01:24:12,967 --> 01:24:15,702
<i>Careful, that's the second round
you've had this month.</i>

1237
01:24:15,703 --> 01:24:18,133
<i>Are you accusing me ofbeing mean?</i>

1238
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:20,507
<i>- Oh, never that. Never.
- Oh, no.</i>

1239
01:24:20,508 --> 01:24:22,270
<i>Oh, you wicked bastards!</i>

1240
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:26,076
<i>I'll blow you all
out of the universe, I will.</i>

1241
01:24:29,183 --> 01:24:33,051
- I surrender.
- Now I've got you where I want you.

1242
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:37,255
The, uh —The colonel here
is the expert in the pentathlon.

1243
01:24:37,256 --> 01:24:39,018
Oh, aye, the pentathlon.

1244
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:42,126
I — I reckon you'll have to
train a team yourself, sir.

1245
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:44,995
Who do you think?
How about Rattray down there, eh?

1246
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:48,998
Uh, yes. Uh, yes, he'd do.
He'd have to get into pretty strict training.

1247
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,702
- A few cross-country—
- Come on, Jock. Give us a song.

1248
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,337
<i>Oh, no. I want to hear
young MacKinnon here sing.</i>

1249
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,772
<i>No, Jock, Dusty's the one for the song.</i>

1250
01:24:56,773 --> 01:24:59,008
<i>I'd rather sing myself
than hear Dusty sing.</i>

1251
01:24:59,009 --> 01:25:01,668
#A Gordon for me
A Gordon for me #

1252
01:25:02,111 --> 01:25:05,047
# If you're nae a Gordon
you're nae use to me #

1253
01:25:05,048 --> 01:25:08,317
<i># The Black Watch are braw
the Seaforths an'a'#</i>

1254
01:25:08,318 --> 01:25:11,352
<i># The cocky wee Gordon's
the pride o'them a'#</i>

1255
01:25:11,353 --> 01:25:14,755
- Come on, Alec.
- #A Gordon for me, a Gordon for me #

1256
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,792
# If you're nae a Gordon
you're nae use to me #

1257
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:21,062
<i># The Black Watch are braw
the Seaforths an'a'#</i>

1258
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:24,577
#The cocky wee Gordon's
the pride o' them a' #

1259
01:25:36,343 --> 01:25:37,615
Sit down, please.

1260
01:25:52,323 --> 01:25:55,472
<i>#I saw a lassie in a big golden hayfield #</i>

1261
01:26:22,718 --> 01:26:25,825
Not taking part
in the celebration, Scott?

1262
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:27,524
Celebration, Colonel?

1263
01:26:28,055 --> 01:26:31,517
I didn't know there was
anything to celebrate.

1264
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:34,627
You think I've made
the wrong decision, don't you?

1265
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:38,531
It's not for a company commander
to judge. Theirs not to reason why.

1266
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:42,567
There's a worid of difference
between strength and obstinacy.

1267
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:47,872
I didn't want to take action just for the sake
of showing it was in my power to do so.

1268
01:26:47,873 --> 01:26:50,241
In a way,
commanding a battalion is a...

1269
01:26:50,242 --> 01:26:52,677
question of compromise,
keeping a team together.

1270
01:26:52,678 --> 01:26:53,773
Oh, absolutely.

1271
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:58,659
<i>Aye, he's hoisted
on his own petard. Good old Jock!</i>

1272
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,118
It sounds as though
it's a popular idea anyway, Colonel.

1273
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:05,268
Do you think I made it
for my popularity?

1274
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,824
Do you really think
that's why I made this decision?

1275
01:27:08,825 --> 01:27:11,927
<i>My dear colonel, we didn't know
you'd made any decision.</i>

1276
01:27:11,928 --> 01:27:15,130
But... you must have heard
the matter's not to go to brigade.

1277
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:17,165
- Yes, we heard that.
- Well?

1278
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:20,401
But we thought that was Jock's decision.
Why, my dear fellow...

1279
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:23,311
we didn't even realize
you were there.

1280
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,544
In my own humdrum life,
I frequently flunked...

1281
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,746
doing something
which I ought to do...

1282
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,481
told myself after,
the reason I hesitated...

1283
01:27:35,482 --> 01:27:39,267
was for... humanity or loyalty
or even Christianity.

1284
01:27:39,987 --> 01:27:41,385
Not very dignified.

1285
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:46,247
One would have hoped a colonel
would be older than that.

1286
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:50,962
<i>You really mustn't get
so upset, Colonel.</i>

1287
01:27:50,963 --> 01:27:54,789
Jock's in a sweat
of loyal affection through there.

1288
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:57,601
Why not go back and join
the rest of his cronies?

1289
01:27:57,603 --> 01:28:00,804
<i>He'll give you a great welcome,
I'm sure.</i>

1290
01:28:38,372 --> 01:28:41,608
<i>- Where's the colonel gone?
- Barrow? He went right through.</i>

1291
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:44,076
<i>- In the billiard room.
- Let him sulk.</i>

1292
01:28:44,077 --> 01:28:46,780
<i>No, no, no.
He must have a dram tonight.</i>

1293
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:48,115
Search the saloon.

1294
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,356
Right wheel.

1295
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:54,123
Away. Away. Away.

1296
01:28:55,654 --> 01:28:58,222
- Where's he gone, my good man?
- Och, he must be hiding.

1297
01:28:58,223 --> 01:28:59,745
Here, search parties.

1298
01:29:00,225 --> 01:29:02,326
You take that room,
MacKinnon under the table —

1299
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:03,662
Oh, look. Snooker.

1300
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:09,198
- Oh, the snooker, is it?
- Is that not part of the pentathlon?

1301
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,234
Charlie Scott, what are you
on your ain for?

1302
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:14,136
- Are you low, Charlie?
- Right as a cricket, old boy.

1303
01:29:14,137 --> 01:29:16,172
- Low, tonight?
- Are you sad, Charlie?

1304
01:29:16,173 --> 01:29:17,622
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1305
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,376
Charlie Scott, you interest me.

1306
01:29:20,377 --> 01:29:24,345
Have you been having words with him
that's lost — me colonel, me benefactor?

1307
01:29:24,346 --> 01:29:24,941
I have.

1308
01:29:28,617 --> 01:29:32,486
- And what did he talk about?
- He talked about compromise...

1309
01:29:32,488 --> 01:29:34,922
not being prejudicial
to good discipline.

1310
01:29:34,923 --> 01:29:36,383
And you disapproved.

1311
01:29:36,925 --> 01:29:40,981
Didn't twig, old boy.
Too big words for me, you know.

1312
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,599
But you —you still think
it should go to brigade, don't you?

1313
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,601
I thought his reasons
for changing his mind hard to follow.

1314
01:29:49,602 --> 01:29:53,038
But you still think
I ought to be court-martialed.

1315
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:54,488
Of course, old boy.

1316
01:29:55,675 --> 01:29:59,310
- So we have the truth, have we?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1317
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,645
You're a cool one, Charlie Scott.

1318
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:05,249
- What else did he say?
- Nothing much. Just walked out.

1319
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:09,201
Gone into the garden,
shouldn't wonder, to eat worms.

1320
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:13,174
What was that?

1321
01:30:26,935 --> 01:30:28,875
Who's the orderly officer?

1322
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:30,460
Sir?

1323
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:35,342
Go upstairs to Colonel Barrow's room.

1324
01:30:35,343 --> 01:30:37,762
Then come back and report to me.

1325
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:57,919
- Has somebody gone up?
- The orderly officer.

1326
01:31:41,169 --> 01:31:41,753
He's —

1327
01:31:43,538 --> 01:31:46,968
He's not in his room.
He's in the tub room.

1328
01:31:48,642 --> 01:31:50,091
There's blood, sir.

1329
01:31:51,245 --> 01:31:52,455
He shot himself.

1330
01:31:59,852 --> 01:32:00,634
Wait here.

1331
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:34,852
The stupid wee beggar.

1332
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:40,706
Have you seen a shot man before?

1333
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:43,188
- No, sir.
- Come on, then.

1334
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,131
First we'll make sure he's dead.

1335
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:09,068
Aye.

1336
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,977
He's gone, all right.

1337
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:18,790
Laddie, you going to faint?

1338
01:33:19,257 --> 01:33:21,259
- Aye.
- Don't be ashamed.

1339
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:27,625
I — I don't think so, sir.

1340
01:33:27,798 --> 01:33:29,977
Then you can make your debut.

1341
01:33:31,835 --> 01:33:37,239
If you're gonna be a soldier, lad, you must learn
to handle both the living and the dead.

1342
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,294
That's your stock-in-trade.

1343
01:33:39,709 --> 01:33:41,273
No, don't turn away.

1344
01:33:43,178 --> 01:33:45,118
Look down at him straight.

1345
01:33:51,552 --> 01:33:53,669
Now away and get the doctor.

1346
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:19,210
It's no the body worries me.

1347
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,249
It's the ghost.

1348
01:35:03,384 --> 01:35:04,114
Gentlemen.

1349
01:35:09,523 --> 01:35:11,160
Bonnets off. Sit down.

1350
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:24,969
Information: Colonel Barrow was found dead
on the evening of February the 21 st...

1351
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:28,304
and on February the 23rd
was adjudged of having committed suicide...

1352
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:30,373
while the balance of his mind
was disturbed.

1353
01:35:30,374 --> 01:35:32,866
Inquiries were made of his wife...

1354
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:37,013
and it was her wish that the funeral arrangements
should be made and executed...

1355
01:35:37,014 --> 01:35:40,246
by the officer
now commanding the battalion.

1356
01:35:41,584 --> 01:35:45,129
Intention:
The battalion will bury their colonel.

1357
01:35:47,056 --> 01:35:48,328
Joke? Funny joke?

1358
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,908
I'm sorry, Colonel.

1359
01:35:52,028 --> 01:35:56,396
Method: The colonel will be given
the full honors of a martial funeral.

1360
01:35:56,397 --> 01:35:59,466
<i>We can divide the operation
into three distinct parts—</i>

1361
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:01,768
before the ceremony,
the burial itself...

1362
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:03,469
the return to barracks.

1363
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:05,356
Before the ceremony...

1364
01:36:06,873 --> 01:36:09,809
the regimental sergeant major
will parade the battalion in line...

1365
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:11,812
"A" Company on the right...

1366
01:36:11,812 --> 01:36:14,313
carrying party
and pipes and drums in the rear...

1367
01:36:14,314 --> 01:36:16,931
the color party under Mr. MacKinnon.

1368
01:36:17,082 --> 01:36:19,772
- Sir.
- The carrying party itself...

1369
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:23,521
will be comprised of the eight
senior sergeants acting as bearers...

1370
01:36:23,522 --> 01:36:27,625
with a full platoon of men drawn from
all companies to pull the gun carriage.

1371
01:36:27,626 --> 01:36:30,785
<i>- Good grief.
- I didn't ask for comments.</i>

1372
01:36:31,596 --> 01:36:34,932
On my command, the battalion will move
to the right in columns of three...

1373
01:36:34,933 --> 01:36:37,237
and slow-march out of barracks.

1374
01:36:37,734 --> 01:36:41,771
There will be a rehearsal tomorrow
at 1000 hours. We'll deal with —

1375
01:36:41,772 --> 01:36:44,775
- Permission to interrupt, sir.
- Granted.

1376
01:36:45,107 --> 01:36:47,075
1000 hours is battalion orders, sir.

1377
01:36:47,076 --> 01:36:49,077
There will be
no battalion orders tomorrow.

1378
01:36:49,078 --> 01:36:51,713
<i>Begging your pardon, sir.
There are several men under arrest.</i>

1379
01:36:51,714 --> 01:36:54,258
Don't answer me back, Mr. Riddick.

1380
01:36:54,383 --> 01:36:55,770
Not now, not ever.

1381
01:36:59,254 --> 01:37:02,455
The battalion will proceed
at the slow march down to the crossroads...

1382
01:37:02,456 --> 01:37:05,625
turning left off Stewart Road
along Bridge Road to the high street...

1383
01:37:05,626 --> 01:37:06,950
where the drums —

1384
01:37:09,096 --> 01:37:09,878
The drums.

1385
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:16,655
The battalion will halt...

1386
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:18,433
in Lothian Terrace.

1387
01:37:20,573 --> 01:37:21,418
Honor arms.

1388
01:37:24,377 --> 01:37:27,712
Officers of field rank
will detach themselves...

1389
01:37:27,713 --> 01:37:29,298
following the padre...

1390
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:31,668
And the band contingent...

1391
01:37:32,984 --> 01:37:34,371
to the grave side.

1392
01:37:37,388 --> 01:37:39,453
"The Flowers of the Forest."

1393
01:37:46,329 --> 01:37:47,914
<i>- Mr. MacLean.
- Sir.</i>

1394
01:37:48,865 --> 01:37:52,468
Who's the best piper?
Who's the picked piper to be?

1395
01:37:52,469 --> 01:37:56,827
Let me think now. They're —
They're all good pipers, sir.

1396
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:58,561
Jock's the best piper.

1397
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:03,147
<i>Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, I'm sure of that, sir.</i>

1398
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:06,718
Have you no teeth?
You're allowed to smile.

1399
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:09,182
You're permitted to be
of good cheer.

1400
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:12,885
So says the training manual,
who got it from Saint Paul.

1401
01:38:12,886 --> 01:38:15,021
- Have you picked him?
- Yes, sir. He's next door.

1402
01:38:15,022 --> 01:38:16,701
I'll get him in, sir.

1403
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:21,426
- What's the matter, Major Scott?
- Nothing, Jock.

1404
01:38:21,427 --> 01:38:24,774
Colonel. I prefer
to be addressed as colonel.

1405
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:27,611
Colonel. Quite an elaborate do, this.

1406
01:38:28,167 --> 01:38:30,826
It's a funeral for a field marshal.

1407
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:44,028
- You never said it was Corporal Fraser.
- He's my best piper, sir.

1408
01:38:44,114 --> 01:38:44,468
Aye.

1409
01:38:49,153 --> 01:38:50,415
Where did I get?

1410
01:38:51,254 --> 01:38:53,422
Is no one listening to the orders, then?

1411
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:55,675
After the ceremony itself, sir.

1412
01:38:55,925 --> 01:38:57,875
Thank you, Captain Simpson.

1413
01:38:58,461 --> 01:38:59,973
Uh, thank you, Eric.

1414
01:39:06,602 --> 01:39:07,947
<i>- Corporal.
- Sir.</i>

1415
01:39:08,703 --> 01:39:11,195
- You're the picked piper.
- Sir.

1416
01:39:12,207 --> 01:39:14,886
Are you married, Corporal, or single?

1417
01:39:15,309 --> 01:39:16,216
Single, sir.

1418
01:39:17,477 --> 01:39:19,657
Colonel, we're short of time.

1419
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:22,880
I like to have things out in the open.

1420
01:39:23,283 --> 01:39:26,552
Oh, for Pete's sake,
there's no secret now.

1421
01:39:26,553 --> 01:39:28,988
Seeing that we've come
to an interval, Colonel...

1422
01:39:28,989 --> 01:39:31,756
I wonder if this isn't too big a show
you're proposing?

1423
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:35,126
- Objection?
- Well, it isn't as though Barrow was with us a long while.

1424
01:39:35,127 --> 01:39:38,129
- He was a good man, all that —
- It's whatever you think, Colonel.

1425
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,665
It's right he should have
a proper burial, but —

1426
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:44,067
but the whole battalion, sir,
and the gun carriage —

1427
01:39:44,068 --> 01:39:46,269
Maybe a more private ceremony
would suit better.

1428
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:48,304
Surely the circumstances
of his death alone —

1429
01:39:48,305 --> 01:39:51,407
The circumstances of his death?
What does that mean?

1430
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:54,010
Well, sir, there's been
enough talk already.

1431
01:39:54,011 --> 01:39:56,145
Well, I know it was
one of unsound mind.

1432
01:39:56,146 --> 01:39:58,780
I mean, whichever way
you look at it, sir, it was suicide.

1433
01:39:58,781 --> 01:40:00,647
No, it damn well wasn't.

1434
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,658
It was something else.

1435
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,741
What was it, Jimmy?

1436
01:40:14,996 --> 01:40:15,903
Aye. Murder.

1437
01:40:18,599 --> 01:40:20,591
And I may be the murderer.

1438
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:23,365
But you are the accomplices.

1439
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:24,568
All of you.

1440
01:40:25,673 --> 01:40:26,893
ExceptJimmy here.

1441
01:40:27,675 --> 01:40:30,475
He served him better
than the rest of us put together.

1442
01:40:30,477 --> 01:40:34,111
Whatever it was, Colonel,
brigade will never permit this sort of a do.

1443
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:38,082
To hell with brigade. The way we bury
our colonels is our business — ours alone.

1444
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:41,419
Colonel, Major Scott is right.
Brigade'll never stand for it.

1445
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:45,174
Well, brigade won't know about it
till it's over.

1446
01:40:46,323 --> 01:40:49,357
Can you not see?
Can you not understand?

1447
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:53,530
Fifteen years after he left Scotland,
he came back to it.

1448
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:56,899
Fifteen years after he left
this battalion, he came back to it.

1449
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:00,424
The battalion that's known
as the friendly one.

1450
01:41:03,606 --> 01:41:06,025
And you'd grudge him his burial.

1451
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,310
We'll bury him the way
I say we'll bury him.

1452
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:12,085
That's an order,
and that's a fact.

1453
01:41:18,387 --> 01:41:19,231
Part three.

1454
01:41:20,521 --> 01:41:22,346
The return to barracks...

1455
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:24,479
you mean men.

1456
01:41:27,894 --> 01:41:29,531
The death, they say...

1457
01:41:30,163 --> 01:41:31,185
is a victory.

1458
01:41:32,165 --> 01:41:35,324
The death, they say,
is the great triumph.

1459
01:41:37,503 --> 01:41:40,099
We'll march back to a strong tune.

1460
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,241
"The Black Bear" will pull us together...

1461
01:41:43,242 --> 01:41:45,494
and "Scotland the Brave" and...

1462
01:41:46,411 --> 01:41:48,173
Some others, Pipe Major.

1463
01:41:48,413 --> 01:41:52,549
- "Cock of the North," sir?
- Ah, yon's a cheesy tune. You'll no play that.

1464
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:56,252
And we'll no have
"Charlie is My Darling" either.

1465
01:41:59,623 --> 01:42:00,352
Instead...

1466
01:42:03,127 --> 01:42:05,192
"The Gathering of Loch Eil."

1467
01:42:07,296 --> 01:42:10,017
We'll have all the tunes of glory...

1468
01:42:10,633 --> 01:42:12,760
to remember the more clearly.

1469
01:42:13,435 --> 01:42:14,457
Sure we will.

1470
01:42:16,705 --> 01:42:18,707
Back along the high street.

1471
01:42:20,275 --> 01:42:21,307
Bridge Road...

1472
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:23,616
and Stewart Road.

1473
01:42:25,613 --> 01:42:27,793
We'll have the quick marches.

1474
01:42:28,182 --> 01:42:29,808
The heads in the air.

1475
01:42:30,584 --> 01:42:32,888
"Ho Ro, My Nut Brown Maiden"...

1476
01:42:34,254 --> 01:42:36,684
And the bonnets of"Bonnie Dundee"

1477
01:42:40,326 --> 01:42:43,370
The marching must be perfect, Mr. Riddick.

1478
01:42:43,929 --> 01:42:46,296
All the people will be watching.

1479
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:48,740
Do you hear? Perfect.

1480
01:42:54,006 --> 01:42:56,790
And when you and I are long forgot...

1481
01:42:57,775 --> 01:43:01,424
they'll say, "You should have
heard them playing.

1482
01:43:02,879 --> 01:43:05,924
You should have
seen them marching then."

1483
01:43:13,923 --> 01:43:15,612
Then it'll snow again.

1484
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:26,982
But it'll no break
till after the parade.

1485
01:43:29,938 --> 01:43:32,482
When we come back from the hill...

1486
01:43:34,142 --> 01:43:35,893
it'll be bitter cold...

1487
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:40,361
and a wee bit misty maybe...

1488
01:43:43,749 --> 01:43:45,563
and pink over the roofs.

1489
01:43:49,589 --> 01:43:50,725
I see it fine.

1490
01:43:53,358 --> 01:43:55,423
The aprons over the kilts...

1491
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,490
and the lapped purple of the drapes...

1492
01:44:00,599 --> 01:44:02,121
over the kettledrums.

1493
01:44:06,336 --> 01:44:07,483
Just the drums.

1494
01:44:11,975 --> 01:44:13,435
A whole battalion...

1495
01:44:14,711 --> 01:44:15,618
coming home.

1496
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,719
A whole battalion of us...

1497
01:44:21,617 --> 01:44:22,816
at a slow pace.

1498
01:44:23,685 --> 01:44:26,302
There's just the four kettledrums...

1499
01:44:28,322 --> 01:44:29,052
beating...

1500
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:31,089
rapping...

1501
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,482
with a dae...

1502
01:44:35,196 --> 01:44:36,343
dit-dit, dae...

1503
01:44:38,766 --> 01:44:39,913
dit-dit, dae...

1504
01:44:42,168 --> 01:44:42,940

Take me home.
