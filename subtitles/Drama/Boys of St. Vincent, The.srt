Episode 24

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,111
Something happened to you, didn't it?

5
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:19,396
You weren't asleep?

6
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:22,068
Don't even think about lying to me.

7
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:26,195
What could happen?

8
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:30,959
I...

9
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:35,663
I'm going to live here with you,
Dad and Kang San.

10
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:36,879
What?

11
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:38,981
Why?

12
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:42,968
And what about Young Master Jun Pyo,
school and everything?

13
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:48,200
I already told you.
There's nothing between Jun Pyo and me.

14
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,034
<i>Also...</i>

15
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:53,204
Mom, after everything, you still think
that there's any future left?

16
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:54,101
You...

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,103
So in this small room, selling fish,
crabs and webfoot octopus,

18
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:59,404
smelling like fish,
that's how you want to live?

19
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,098
You want to live like that?

20
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:02,832
And what's wrong with that?

21
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:08,792
We're ruined.

22
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,450
<i>We're finished.</i>

23
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:16,254
Now, with what hope can we live on?

24
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,291
Mom...

25
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:28,523
Oh, that's enough!

26
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:49,436
Yi Jung sunbae.

27
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,955
Still no news about Jan Di?

28
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:12,779
No. I really don't what to think.

29
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,885
She turned off her phone and only
said that she was going somewhere.

30
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:20,075
Whether it was east or west,
she wouldn't even say.

31
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:21,769
She's probably fine.

32
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,884
It's Geum Jan Di, after all.

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,569
It seems like you know my
friend better than I.

34
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,036
I told you, I know a little bit about women.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,571
How is Jun Pyo sunbae doing?

36
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,838
He's a mess, what else.

37
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,041
Ga Eul.

38
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:53,426
Now, shouldn't we have a talk about us?

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,547
Ga Eul, I...

40
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,261
I'll go first.

41
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,962
You don't need to feel
any obligation towards me.

42
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,863
I know everything... how you feel.

43
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,926
That's why as of now,
I'm not going to seek you out.

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,477
Ga Eul.

45
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:26,912
My teacher...

46
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,347
No.

47
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:34,181
Eun Jae said that she did everything
she wanted to do so she had

48
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:37,182
no regrets or lingering feelings.

49
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,088
Thank you.

50
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,496
For giving me the opportunity to do my best.

51
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,571
When I hear from Jan Di,
I'll let you know immediately.

52
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,946
Well, then...

53
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:05,011
What would be good?

54
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:08,322
Ahjussi, our Jun Pyo...

55
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,133
If he continues like this,
he really might break down.

56
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,186
I'm so afraid.

57
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,319
Miss, you too can't be like this.

58
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,708
That's not it.

59
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,312
This time, I really don't
have a good feeling.

60
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,116
Miss.

61
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,508
Dad...

62
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,342
Dad...

63
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:57,993
Dad!

64
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,288
How could you do something like that?

65
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:30,511
Can't you see that even without you causing
a fuss, things are difficult enough as is?

66
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:31,746
Mom...

67
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,957
No, I'm beginning to hate calling you "Mom".

68
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,086
How...

69
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,395
How could someone...

70
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,603
do something as extreme as that?!

71
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,278
Exactly what are you talking about?

72
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:50,065
How could you tell me that
the father I love was dead?!

73
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,187
You...

74
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,901
How did I find out?

75
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,472
At this moment,
that's what you're curious about?

76
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,087
<i>I'm asking you.</i>

77
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:02,827
Leaving Dad buried like that,
did you intend to deceive me forever?!

78
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,080
Why did you do it? Why?!

79
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,467
Your father would have wanted it as well.

80
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,999
Wh-what did you say?

81
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,205
I planned to take responsibility
for everything.

82
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,862
But then, your father suddenly collapsed.

83
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:23,190
Into a condition no different
than the living dead.

84
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,663
The lineage of the great Shinhwa Group
ending in such manner.

85
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,964
I couldn't let that happen.

86
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:34,005
My pride wouldn't allow it.

87
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:37,036
Your pride?

88
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,516
You're saying that telling us
that the father we love died,

89
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,427
telling the whole world,
and also deceiving your children.

90
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,815
That absurd situation was
all because of your pride?!

91
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,324
It was for your father.

92
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,766
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,304
Jun Pyo.

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,112
I will carefully explain everything.

95
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:08,248
I...

96
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:11,154
I asked you what you were talking about!

97
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,928
What does Dad's son have
to do when Dad's not around?

98
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:49,637
I have to protect my sister,
Mom and Shinhwa Group.

99
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,973
Gu Jun Pyo!

100
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,545
As one man to another, can you promise?

101
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:54,621
Yes, Sir!

102
00:09:55,738 --> 00:10:00,661
For the sake of this group, which
you might toss away in an instant,

103
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,645
your father did his best until the very end.

104
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,549
Are you thinking of throwing him away too?

105
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,316
I'm sorry, Young Master.

106
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,027
I'm truly sorry.

107
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,364
<i>This time, I realized it.</i>

108
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:07,490
<i>That you and I are from
two very different worlds.</i>

109
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:12,139
<i>No matter how much you fight it,
you're Shinhwa Group's Gu Jun Pyo.</i>

110
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:16,245
<i>There's not a moment
that I ever forgot that.</i>

111
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,737
<i>I am at the fish market.</i>

112
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,239
Everyone, look over here. Right now,
it is overflowing with fresh seafood.

113
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,186
<i>{\a6}"Spring News:
Crowded early morning fish market"</i>

114
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,145
Oh, it's a webfoot octopus,
a webfoot octopus! Wow!

115
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,597
These days, webfoot octopuses
must be the best.

116
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:47,412
No! It's so good that if two
people eat it together,

117
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,013
one wouldn't notice if the other died!

118
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,299
<i>I'll give it you for cheap. Buy some!</i>

119
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,535
<i>Everyone, you heard, right?</i>

120
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:57,658
<i>For tonight's dinner, how about cooking
some webfoot octopus soup as a Spring dish?</i>

121
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,661
Reporting from Isangsaewodo,
I'm Cho Bo Ram reporter.

122
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,662
{\a6}Mister! Mister!

123
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:18,257
I'm going to see Dad.

124
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,500
You're gonna come with me, right?

125
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,975
I'm not going.

126
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,308
Jun Pyo!

127
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:39,919
Jun Pyo.

128
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,543
Come and talk with your mom.

129
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:49,706
"Mom"?

130
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:03,311
Was there even one moment when
you were like a real mother?

131
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:14,649
You should now stop the mother act
because such charity doesn't suit you...

132
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
President Kang.

133
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,230
I'm not interested.

134
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,087
What?

135
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,818
If you're going, then go by yourself.

136
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:46,592
Gu Jun Pyo.

137
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:48,287
Jun Pyo, are you serious?

138
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,689
Don't be like that and just go.

139
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,041
I said that I wasn't interested!

140
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:06,805
Let me ask you one more time.

141
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,380
Are you serious?

142
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,971
If you want to see her so badly, then leave.

143
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:20,350
I'm heading out first.
Come or not; do what you want.

144
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:54,942
Weren't times like these when
you needed Geum Jan Di more?

145
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,030
And after I bring her back,
what am I supposed to do?

146
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,715
Now, I can't promise her anything.

147
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:06,884
That I'll always make her laugh,

148
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,827
"I'll make you happy so believe only in me."

149
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,028
My confidence to say such
things has disappeared.

150
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,124
Jun Pyo.

151
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:16,153
Being the child of that kind of person.

152
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,618
Being a member of that kind of family.

153
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:24,621
If even I hate it this much,
then how do you think she'll feel?

154
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:31,089
During that time, given what she went
through, she probably detested it.

155
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,130
It's Geum Jan Di so it could be different.

156
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,542
That's even more reason why I can't.

157
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:39,357
Because it's the woman I love.

158
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:43,119
That's why I can't even more now.

159
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:57,587
It would've been nice if we
could've sold the rest of it.

160
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,107
<i>Mom, I'm hungry!</i>

161
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,017
Oh, Kang San, sorry, sorry!
I'll prepare dinner at once.

162
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,150
Let's go.

163
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,963
Wh... what's the matter with everyone?

164
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,710
"What's the matter?"
But that's what we want to ask you!

165
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,639
Even if you look down on us because
we're simple country people,

166
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,940
you should be discrete about it.

167
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,752
How could you try to con us?

168
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,147
Con?

169
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:23,902
You said that you're Shinhwa Group's
future daughter-in-law?

170
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:27,290
My daughter says that Shinhwa
Group has a different fiancée!

171
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,546
<i>Look at this!</i>

172
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:32,131
<i>This young lady is the daughter of a wealthy
family even bigger than Shinhwa Group!</i>

173
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,261
Those two getting married
was even on the news!

174
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,134
But that's already an old matter.

175
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:44,077
Eh? Then what? Are you really Shinhwa
Group's future daughter-in-law or what?!

176
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:46,649
That's not it.

177
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:49,759
Oh, whatever! Hurry up and immediately
pay back the money you borrowed!

178
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:51,714
Eh? Pay it back immediately?

179
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,442
That's right! Who knows if tonight,
you'll flee in the middle of the night?

180
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,392
Think about how you sat there and
ate the food that you got from us.

181
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,860
How is that any different from conning us?

182
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,052
<i>Even if it's only the interest,
hurry and pay up!</i>

183
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,501
<i>Wait, how can you suddenly...</i>

184
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,395
No, pay up now!

185
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,674
Hurry and pay up, huh?

186
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,965
I will give it to you.

187
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,715
Su... Sunbae!

188
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:27,748
That Yo...Young Mast...

189
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:32,054
That money... For now, I will repay it.

190
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,014
He's handsome.

191
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,337
<i>And tall...</i>

192
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,108
<i>He must be the son of a rich family.</i>

193
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,844
Oh, what should we do?

194
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,563
See! See!

195
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,101
So she was telling the truth about
having a chaebol* for a future son-in-law.

196
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:55,102
{\a6}*Son of a wealthy family.

197
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,948
So he's the young master of Shinhwa Group?

198
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,742
Just look at his face!

199
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,417
He just radiates refinement...

200
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:04,218
Oh my, it's the first time I saw such
a handsome young master!

201
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:05,772
Must be nice.

202
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:19,392
I'm not dying by myself.
I'm not going to die by myself.

203
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:41,296
How did you know that I was here?

204
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,448
I heard it.

205
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:47,914
The emergency bell.

206
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,875
I couldn't sleep at night because
I was scared I wouldn't hear it.

207
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,716
How could you do it?

208
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,919
How can someone be like this?

209
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,739
Sunbae, I've received too much from you.

210
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:28,775
You've done more for me.

211
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:37,162
<i>{\a6}Does it seem like I'd be fine without you?</i>

212
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:43,723
<i>{\a6}Are you fine without me?</i>

213
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:58,124
<i>{\a6}A world without you is so hard,
I resent myself for breathing.</i>

214
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:04,870
<i>{\a6}What should I do? Even now,
I live each day broken by your single word.</i>

215
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:13,619
<i>{\a6}If being like this is wrong,
tell me. You and me.</i>

216
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:17,288
How's your grandfather?

217
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,827
Like before, going to work at the clinic.

218
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:24,528
Perhaps, he'll keep going
until he collapses again?

219
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,701
That's like your grandfather.

220
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,636
Grandfather gave this to me.

221
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:50,284
He said that my grandmother
gave it to my mother.

222
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,313
Sunbae.

223
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:57,156
I don't know when it started either.

224
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:01,701
But... now, I can't live without you.

225
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:25,119
I can't accept this.

226
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,534
Jan Di.

227
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:35,788
I thought that I could forget him.

228
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,489
I thought that I'd forgotten him.

229
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,618
And yet...

230
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:49,246
And yet...

231
00:22:57,466 --> 00:23:00,456
This is the only thing I can't throw away.

232
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,479
It won't let go.

233
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:10,280
I can't sever my connection to Gu Jun Pyo.

234
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,048
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:22,935
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

236
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:26,423
It's OK.

237
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:34,624
It's OK.

238
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:07,291
<i>Jan Di...</i>

239
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:11,088
I don't think that I can let go of her.

240
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,992
Instead of me who only makes
things difficult for her,

241
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,249
I even once thought that it'd
be better to send her to you.

242
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:22,362
No, that's not it.

243
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,966
If I had to give up Jan Di to another guy...

244
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,527
I hated to even imagine
it but if I had to do that,

245
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:37,447
then that other guy
absolutely has to be you.

246
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:41,790
Ji Hoo, it couldn't be anyone else but you.

247
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:43,983
That's what I thought.

248
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:29,235
I'm not dying by myself.

249
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:32,405
I have to see the end of Shinhwa Group!

250
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:34,899
I won't be the only one who's ruined.

251
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:56,769
No!

252
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,926
Jun Pyo!

253
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:18,839
Jun Pyo.

254
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:20,255
Jun Pyo.

255
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:21,570
Jun Pyo!

256
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:23,504
Hey, Gu Jun Pyo.

257
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,557
Quickly, wake up.

258
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:27,353
Gu Jun Pyo!

259
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,127
He had it coming.
You reap what you sow.

260
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,773
It's not your fault.

261
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,886
It's not your fault.

262
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,222
<i>Hey, Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

263
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,597
<i>Wake up!</i>

264
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,886
Hello?

265
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:48,820
My friend is dying.

266
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:52,627
I said that my friend is dying!

267
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:55,677
Jun Pyo.

268
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,391
<i>Jun Pyo!</i>

269
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:58,947
<i>Wake up.</i>

270
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,163
<i>Hey!</i>

271
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,336
<i>Wake up!</i>

272
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,395
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

273
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:21,165
<i>Tonight around 8pm, in a local coastal town,
the successor to Shinhwa Group,</i>

274
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:24,466
<i>Managing Director Gu Jun Pyo,
was a victim of an assault.</i>

275
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,020
<i>This news comes as a shock.</i>

276
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,438
<i>Caught at the scene, the defendant Kim
was a representative of a company</i>

277
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,739
<i>that was bought out by Shinhwa Group.</i>

278
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:36,098
<i>It was revealed that
he did it for revenge.</i>

279
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:14,525
Now are you satisfied?

280
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:16,877
Is this what you wanted?

281
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,641
Miss, please calm down.

282
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:24,517
You said that in the end,
it was all for Jun Pyo's sake.

283
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,660
<i>You always said that it was because
of the Shinhwa Group assets</i>

284
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,361
<i>that were to be handed down to Jun Pyo.</i>

285
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:31,733
<i>So look.</i>

286
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:35,052
Look at what's happened to your son,
your overwhelmingly happy son

287
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:36,453
if we go by your words.

288
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:39,844
Mom...

289
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:45,345
Do you have any idea what
your son likes to eat,

290
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:49,346
what he likes or what he wanted to do?

291
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,670
They say that the surgery went well.

292
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,623
<i>It appears that he's
past the critical stage.</i>

293
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,273
That's a relief.

294
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,762
Then, we should go.

295
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,174
What did you say?

296
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,559
There is an urgent meeting in Hong Kong.

297
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,792
Was Dad not enough?

298
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:19,629
Answer me.

299
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,918
Which is more important to you,
Shinhwa Group or Jun Pyo?

300
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,769
Just once, tell me!

301
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:10,699
Madam President.

302
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,871
Jun Pyo...

303
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:17,635
really likes egg rollups and ramen.

304
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:24,273
He especially likes to eat the fish
sticks from street vendors.

305
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:29,954
In one sitting, he probably
would eat about 20 of them.

306
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,186
He also likes to pack a lunchbox
and go on a picnic.

307
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:42,548
Using the telescope that
his parents bought him,

308
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:45,143
<i>he likes to look at the stars.</i>

309
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,946
Don't worry.

310
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,457
Gu Jun Pyo

311
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,249
He'll get better.

312
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,174
Jun Pyo.

313
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,869
Jun Pyo.

314
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,683
- Jun Pyo.
- Are you okay?

315
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:42,569
Jun Pyo, it's your sister.

316
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,781
Jun Pyo.

317
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:47,353
Jun Pyo.

318
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,067
Jun Pyo.

319
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,016
Jun Pyo.

320
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,443
<i>Jun Pyo was moved to a room.</i>

321
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,098
You should go.

322
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:25,230
If he knows you're by his side,
he'll wake up sooner.

323
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,786
Stop here for a second.

324
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:51,478
Do you have any idea...

325
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,472
What your son...

326
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,306
Likes to eat?

327
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,099
What he likes or...

328
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,647
what he wanted to do?

329
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,056
<i>Jun Pyo...</i>

330
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:08,057
really likes egg rollups and ramen.

331
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:16,469
He especially likes to eat the fish
sticks from street vendors.

332
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,011
In one sitting, he probably
would eat about 20 of them.

333
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,575
Let's go.

334
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:40,527
I don't know when it started either.

335
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:41,762
But...

336
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:45,012
Now, I can't live without you.

337
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,686
Jun Pyo!

338
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,023
Jun Pyo!

339
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,704
I told you before.

340
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,750
It can't be anyone but you.

341
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:42,633
Grandpa.

342
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:57,939
Ji Hoo.

343
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,897
Grandpa.

344
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:07,265
Yes, yes.

345
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,322
<i>Tell me.</i>

346
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:45,528
Setting Shinhwa and me
being a plutocrat aside,

347
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:52,581
have you ever considered me as just one man?

348
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:55,969
No.

349
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:02,225
No matter how much you try,
you're still Shinhwa Group's Gu Jun Pyo.

350
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:07,234
I have never forgotten that
for not even a single second.

351
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:19,691
Gu Jun Pyo.

352
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,817
Can you hear me?

353
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:30,380
I lied to you again.

354
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,081
To me, you're...

355
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,276
Always just Gu Jun Pyo.

356
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:51,470
You're the dummy Gu Jun Pyo who
likes the ugly, poor, nameless Jan Di.

357
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,841
So wake up.

358
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,615
Wake up.

359
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:04,416
Wake up, Gu Jun Pyo. Wake up.

360
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:34,996
Oh!

361
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,746
Honey!

362
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,062
Honey!

363
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,358
Is everything okay?

364
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:42,092
You're healthy right?

365
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,306
We... We moved back to our house.

366
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,060
This is all because of you.

367
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,110
Because you suffered a lot on the boat.

368
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,246
Yeah!

369
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:56,196
The building owner felt bad about last time,
so we're renting it out for a cheaper price.

370
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:59,405
Dad! When I become a pro-gamer,
you won't have to ride a boat.

371
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,339
So come back soon! Soon! Soon!

372
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,608
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Don't worry about us and be safe!

373
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,684
Yes, Honey.

374
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:08,900
Come back soon!

375
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:27,448
Sunbae.

376
00:41:27,827 --> 00:41:29,461
Jun Pyo woke up.

377
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,316
Jan Di, welcome.

378
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,563
You look so normal for just waking up.

379
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:10,214
<i>That's the miracle of human recovery.</i>

380
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:13,304
Yo my bro. Welcome back.

381
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,606
Thanks.

382
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,696
For what?

383
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,111
For living.

384
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:37,868
Did you think the almighty Gu Jun Pyo
would live* an unnatural death?

385
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:37,869
{\a6}*He said 'Bi MONG Hoing Sa',
which should be 'Bi MYUNG Hoing Sa')

386
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:39,902
<i>You really are Gu Jun Pyo.</i>

387
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:42,333
He said it 'Bi MONG Hoing Sa'.

388
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:46,520
Jan Di, why are you just standing there?

389
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,556
Come here.

390
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:49,211
You worried a lot right?

391
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,722
All the test results came out fine.

392
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,897
That's great, Gu Jun Pyo.

393
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,890
But who's this rustic girl?

394
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,561
Jun Pyo, don't you know Geum Jan Di?

395
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,913
Stop playing around.

396
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:12,525
Geum Jan Di? What's that?

397
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,073
Gu Jun Pyo...

398
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,546
Jun Pyo...

399
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:21,057
Do you remember everyone else?

400
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:22,991
Are you kidding?

401
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,599
Tell me my name.

402
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:28,234
So Yi Jung.

403
00:43:28,354 --> 00:43:30,088
Then me? Do you remember me?

404
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,520
Are you crazy? You're Song Woo Bin.

405
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:35,829
But...

406
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:40,794
You don't know who Geum Jan Di is?

407
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,452
Am I supposed to?

408
00:43:49,738 --> 00:43:51,532
Is she your girl, Ji Hoo?

409
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:19,121
<i>It's selective memory loss.</i>

410
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:20,674
For this particular patient,

411
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:25,279
It's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder due to
the accident which was almost like a terror.

412
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:30,123
But how come he can't remember
just one person?

413
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:35,276
<i>It's perhaps because the memories
of that person were too painful</i>

414
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:39,961
<i>or too important that the strain
made him forget those memories.</i>

415
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:44,323
<i>Then, when do you think they'll come back?</i>

416
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,795
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

417
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,705
<i>Usually it takes about six months,</i>

418
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:53,732
<i>but sometimes there are cases
when they never come back.</i>

419
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:21,963
Hi, Gu Jun Pyo.

420
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,154
The weather's really nice, right?

421
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:25,709
Do you want to go take a walk?

422
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:26,705
You.

423
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:31,051
Who do you think you are
to come barging into my room?

424
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:34,651
Are you interested in me?

425
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:39,515
Don't you think you're being
ridiculous as Ji Hoo's girl?

426
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:40,691
Hey!

427
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:42,883
I'm not anyone's girl!

428
00:45:44,149 --> 00:45:47,578
If I have to say it,
more than being Ji Hoo's girl...

429
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,173
I'm your...

430
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:50,408
Get out.

431
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:53,379
Are you deaf?

432
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:56,554
I said get out. I hate girls like you.

433
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:58,886
Gu Jun Pyo.

434
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:04,009
Can you leave? I'm going to sleep.

435
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,605
Why aren't you coming out?

436
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:02,020
Come out!

437
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,233
I said to come out!

438
00:47:04,652 --> 00:47:06,107
Come out!

439
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,056
Hey!

440
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,596
Unni, here.

441
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:21,769
So don't cry anymore. Okay?

442
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:33,296
The vending machines here
have to be hit to do their job.

443
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,702
Thanks.

444
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:40,390
It sounds like you been
in the hospital for a long time.

445
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:43,340
- What's your name?
- Yumi. I'm Jang Yumi.

446
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,513
I'm a junior at Korea Arts School.

447
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:48,617
I'm Geum Jan Di.

448
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:49,693
A senior at Shinhwa High.

449
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:51,348
You go to Shinhwa High?

450
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm so jealous.

451
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,753
Anyways, who did you come to see?

452
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,872
A friend.

453
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:00,426
I see.

454
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:06,068
I broke my leg while skiing so I'm a long
stay guest here for the whole vacation.

455
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:11,137
Do you want to sit here?

456
00:48:11,874 --> 00:48:13,509
Be careful.

457
00:48:18,672 --> 00:48:23,026
Yumi, your personality seems really bright.

458
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:24,775
It's just because.

459
00:48:24,895 --> 00:48:30,117
In the hospital,
everyone gets very depressed and annoyed,

460
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:32,190
And I hate that.

461
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:37,008
What can you to do
for that type of people?

462
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:42,490
For people who've been in the
hospital and have gotten really annoyed.

463
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:45,205
You just have to act naturally.

464
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:47,378
Naturally?

465
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,195
Hey, are you okay?

466
00:49:02,604 --> 00:49:04,612
Oppa, it looks like you're
not fully healed yet.

467
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,825
<i>If you just walk around like that,
it's dangerous.</i>

468
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:07,881
<i>Oppa?</i>

469
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:09,835
Do you want ride a wheelchair?

470
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:11,190
Don't worry about it.

471
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:13,854
Then do you want my crutches?

472
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:16,266
Oppa, do you know how to use crutches?

473
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:20,711
Hey peanut,
don't pretend like you know me and get away.

474
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:23,043
Your personality's nasty huh?

475
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:26,172
I'm not a peanut but Yumi. Jang Yumi.

476
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,148
What?

477
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:28,962
You're the one in the VIP room, right?

478
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:33,069
I don't know what kind of great person
you are, but all patients are the same!

479
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,158
No wait.
In this hospital, I'm your senior!

480
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:41,663
If you don't want to break your other leg,
here lean on me.

481
00:49:43,324 --> 00:49:45,317
No. No, Yumi.

482
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:48,347
Since your leg is not healed yet,
here, lean on me.

483
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:53,250
You... didn't leave yet?

484
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:12,347
Unni, I'll see you later!

485
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:32,219
So we should do something
to give him some shock.

486
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,608
Or how about reenacting something
to trigger his memory back?

487
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:38,432
Like?

488
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,233
What events with big impact,
relating to Geum Jan Di, are there?

489
00:51:06,988 --> 00:51:08,204
Gu Jun Pyo.

490
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:13,010
What's with her now?

491
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:23,288
What are you doing?

492
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:32,560
When you get your memory back, call me.

493
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:36,507
What?

494
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,517
What kind of crazy girl is this?

495
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:45,191
What kind of girl are you?

496
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,523
Jun Pyo, did you remember anything?

497
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,975
Remember what?

498
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:54,177
How I am so unlucky,
that a trash girl is teasing me.

499
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,119
Was the memory too old?

500
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:04,451
No... I think it was too weak.

501
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:06,385
We should try something harder next time.

502
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:07,940
Harder?

503
00:52:27,713 --> 00:52:31,580
I told you this is the
last time I'm going to let it go.

504
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,387
Hey.

505
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:40,377
Who are you to keep playing jokes on me?

506
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:43,044
I'm not going to hold back
any longer even if you are Ji Hoo's girl.

507
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,655
Gu Jun Pyo.

508
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:49,907
I told you I wasn't going to let it slide!

509
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:51,860
I told you!

510
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,476
Hey Yoon Ji Hoo.

511
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:30,087
Make sure this girl never
crosses my sight again!

512
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,343
Understand?!

513
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:30,352
Don't worry about it.

514
00:54:30,472 --> 00:54:33,242
You're not a person who's easily forgotten.

515
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:41,935
He could've been having such a
hard time that he wanted to forget me.

516
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:43,749
Even if he did,

517
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,180
if it was a connection to be forgotten,

518
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:50,209
do you think you would
feel more comfortable?

519
00:54:54,782 --> 00:54:56,078
<i>That makes no sense!</i>

520
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,849
Where in the world is there a person
that gets special crutches?

521
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:01,101
I'm being serious.

522
00:55:01,221 --> 00:55:03,934
<i>Do you think the almighty Gu Jun
Pyo would use any kind of crutches?</i>

523
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,608
<i>Here, hold it once.</i>

524
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:09,017
You're serious! Why is this so light!

525
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:10,950
<i>It doesn't feel like I'm holding it.</i>

526
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,362
It's called titanium.

527
00:55:13,906 --> 00:55:16,158
<i>This is so funny, Oppa.</i>

528
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,770
Jun Pyo.

529
00:55:19,188 --> 00:55:20,902
Ji Hoo. You were here?

530
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,916
Oh, it's Jan Di unni!

531
00:55:25,415 --> 00:55:26,472
Hey!

532
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,422
Unni, did you see Jun Pyo's crutches?

533
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:31,615
He says it's titanium.
Isn't it funny?

534
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:33,867
It's not like he's Iron Man or anything.

535
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:39,607
Wow. Your boyfriend's really handsome.

536
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:47,996
Hello, my name's Jang Yumi.
It's nice to meet you.

537
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,312
It's cold, let's go in.

538
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:28,389
Who is it?

539
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:38,177
Late night delivery.

540
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,080
It'll be really nice to look
at the stars through a telescope.

541
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:47,512
Do you like stars?

542
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:50,778
Stars?

543
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:55,602
The star that shines the
brightest on a winter night.

544
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:59,470
I guess I can say it's a
star like the almighty Gu Jun Pyo.

545
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:01,009
<i>What?</i>

546
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:04,318
<i>Then I'll be that one.</i>

547
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:14,721
Oppa, what's wrong? Does something hurt?

548
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:19,923
I feel like I forgot something important...

549
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:24,196
but I can't remember.

550
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:27,804
I feel like my chest is going to explode.

551
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,435
Don't try so hard.

552
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:33,160
If it's important, you'll remember.

553
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:37,825
If you can't remember,
then it probably wasn't important.

554
00:57:37,945 --> 00:57:40,476
It's not good for your body
either if you stress out about it.

555
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:49,517
Yo, What's up?

556
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:51,032
How are you feeling?

557
00:57:51,152 --> 00:57:52,368
Hello!

558
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:53,604
We're seeing you a lot more.

559
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,319
We're HC.

560
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,714
HC?

561
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:58,249
Hospital Couple.

562
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:02,634
All the patients and the nurses
in the hospital said that we were.

563
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:05,161
What do you think?
Do we look good together?

564
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:09,287
Jun Pyo, do you still not
remember everything?

565
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,277
What am I supposed to remember?

566
00:58:12,397 --> 00:58:13,917
Geum Jan Di.

567
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:15,452
<i>Do you not remember?</i>

568
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:17,983
You keep saying something about Jan Di.

569
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:21,053
Why do I have to remember your girlfriend?

570
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,306
Just forget all that...

571
00:58:23,622 --> 00:58:26,472
And of all girls, where did you
find such a forceful girl like her?

572
00:58:26,592 --> 00:58:29,143
Does she think she's a
gangster or something?

573
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:30,917
Make sure she doesn't
come into my room ever again.

574
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:32,233
Gu Jun Pyo!

575
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:35,967
Just stop.

576
00:58:57,135 --> 00:58:59,129
What's wrong with him?

577
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:23,006
Sunbae.

578
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,956
I'll get some tea.

579
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:40,655
I'm sorry.

580
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:48,907
What are you sorry about?

581
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,572
I should the one that's sorry.

582
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:54,283
I got angry without thinking.

583
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:00,698
I didn't stop you because
Jun Pyo would had gotten hurt.

584
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:05,003
I thought that you would had
been more hurt if you had hit him.

585
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:06,957
So I stopped you.

586
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,342
How long did you wait outside.

587
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:17,694
Why is your hand so cold?

588
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:22,717
Give me.

589
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:32,267
The thing that's cold right
now is your heart.

590
01:00:35,157 --> 01:00:37,988
You don't have to act so
strong in front of me.

591
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,539
It's not acting strong.

592
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:49,745
But because you are here...

593
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:53,635
Because you are here for me,
I am can become strong.

594
01:00:58,518 --> 01:01:00,552
I'll go get the tea.

600
01:01:50,195 --> 01:01:55,218
Abracadabra~
Gu Jun Pyo will remember Geum Jan Di.

601
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:57,234
<i>I remember now.</i>

602
01:01:57,354 --> 01:02:00,942
The person I forgot is you.

603
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,992
<i>It's all over now.</i>

604
01:02:04,112 --> 01:02:09,149
<i>I'm not going to allow this
ridiculous situation break you two up.</i>

605
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:13,228
That girl's expression
won't disappear from my head.

606
01:02:13,348 --> 01:02:14,723
In the end...

607
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:23,509
Geum Jan Di and Gu Jun Pyo
was only... was only just this.

608
01:02:27,251 --> 01:02:32,215
Today, we have something to tell everyone
here, which is why we arranged this party.

609
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,808
Gu Jun Pyo, Jang Yumi...

610
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:38,909
We will be studying abroad together
in America starting next month.
