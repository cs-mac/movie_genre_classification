they were stuck in a deserted island for four months.

- It's a damp material, and... - It's too ordinary.

However, the excitement doesn't last.

After a sudden plane crash, she finds herself in a deserted island.

95

What should I do?

96
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,009
However, she doesn't lose hope.

97
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,339
She's strong enough and has skills to survive on a deserted island.

98
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,809
I can't let myself starve to death. I survived the plane crash.

99
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,539
(Bong Hee is always positive.)

100

After many dangerous situations and mysterious incidents,

102
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:59,209
she's rescued from the deserted island.

103
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,409
What secrets does she know after being rescued?

104

Ra Bong Hee came back as the only survivor.

105

107
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,469
There's another character we must take a careful look at.

108

Seo Joon Oh.

109

(A former leader of Dreamers, Joon Oh has the key to the mystery.)

111

112
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,009
(He's immature.)

113
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,209
Remove the splinter.

114
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,809
(He gets scared easily.)

115
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,769
Joon Oh used to be a big star.

116
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,209
I had been drinking, but I didn't drink and drive.

117
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,939
However, he makes a big mistake and completely ruins his career.

118
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,739
I made many new songs.

119
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,169
Let's take a look at other songs.

120
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,239
The president of his agency looks down on him.

121
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,009
In the end, he starts to do everything to make a living.

122
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:53,339
(He's willing to do anything.)

123
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,739
Open your mouth wide.

124
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,309
Hoping to make a comeback, he travels abroad for a concert.

125
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,769
After a sudden plane crash,

126
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,269
he lands on a deserted island.

127

(He lands on a deserted island after a sudden plane crash.)

128

While Joon Oh is devastated,

129
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,239
Bong Hee approaches first and takes care of him.

130
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,069
- Come here for a minute. - What is it?

131
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,469
(He gets his strength back.)

132
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,469
Thanks to Bong Hee, he gets his strength back.

133
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,539
They start their life with many ups and downs on a deserted island.

134
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,339
I think this is better.

135
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,469
(They argue a lot.)

136
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,939
They often get into arguments.

137
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,569
On a deserted island,

138
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,469
they start to open up...

139
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:34,969
little by little by depending on each other.

140
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,069
(They open up to each other.)

141
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,069
It's okay. Stop crying.

142
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,909
Don't cry.

143
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,839
(Joon Oh comforts Bong Hee.)

144
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,839
What will be their destiny?

145
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,669
(What will be their destiny?)

146
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,239
- What is it? - I play the leading role after all.

147
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,669
Please get me a new stylist, Mr. Hwang.

148
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,869
Sure I will. That's not difficult to do.

149
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,739
(Choi Tae Ho enjoys the prime of his career.)

150
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,839
(A top actor, he's a selfish, cold-hearted troublemaker.)

151
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,069
As we continue working together...

152
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,139
What do you want to say?

153
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,909
We'll get jealous of each other.

154
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,269
Why do you think we disbanded?

155
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,769
We'll worry.

156
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:23,009
(They start to worry.)

157
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,569
We'll also fight.

158

Don't bring other people down with you.

159
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,369
If you're leaving, leave by yourself.

160
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,409
We'll resent each other.

161

(They resent each other.)

162

165
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,669
They were close at one point.

166
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,909
Now, they became each other's enemy.

167
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,839
What created a distance between them?

168
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,709
- Why should we do that for them? - If you want to...

169
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,809
Tae Ho is utterly cold-hearted.

170
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,269
He's the most selfish of the selfish.

171
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,239
(His cold-heartedness becomes more obvious.)

172
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,269
If you want to survive,

173
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:04,739
you must listen to me.

174
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:05,869
(He provokes division and confusion.)

175
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:08,369
It's Ha Ji Ah, Tae Ho's girlfriend.

176
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,569
(Ha Ji Ah is a 26-year-old actress with an incurable disease.)

177
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,569
With arrogant looks,

178
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,069
Ji Ah is unfriendly and straightforward.

179
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,309
- Did you take the photos? - No, I didn't.

180
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,709
Gosh, your skin looks so old. You need to get some facial.

181
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,069
See you.

182
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,169
With her boyish charms,

183
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,769
she's very popular.

184
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,809
Do your fans know how mean you are?

185
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,109
They beg me to curse at them because it's sexy.

186
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,869
She has a secret that she couldn't tell anyone.

187
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,569
It's a mysterious disease she has.

188
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,509
Don't look at me like that. I won't die.

189
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,139
With an incurable disease, she's trapped on a deserted island.

190
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,039
Her life starts to be at risk.

191
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,969
Jeong Ki Joon is a character who helps people in secret.

192
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:02,139
(As Joon Oh's manager, he secretly takes care of Ji Ah.)

193
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,569
I caught it!

194
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,679
(He stays positive even in the worst situation.)

195
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,739
As you keep grilling it...

196
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,239
Even if the only food they have is coconuts,

197
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,179
he remains very positive.

198
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,369
Let's continue the shoot since I always listen to you.

199
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:18,369
All I have to do is shake that thing at the camera 2 or 3 times.

200
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,869
He put up with Joon Oh's demanding personality with patience...

201
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,569
and guides him.

202
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,609
We have to cancel the shoot. I don't like any of the outfits.

203
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,939
Though we're less popular, we're still Dreamers.

204
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,239
Ki Joon is a loyal person whose goal in life...

205
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,969
is to make Joon Oh a top star again.

206
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:42,209
The way Ki Joon looks at the couple...

207
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,009
is very suspicious.

208
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,509
I should go and look for them.

209
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,009
Aren't you worried about your girlfriend, Ji Ah?

210
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,239
(Ki Joon is unhappy with Tae Ho.)

211
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,409
The two men find Ji Ah in a dangerous situation,

212
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,969
and they run up to her at the same time.

213
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,509
(The two men run up to Ji Ah whose life is at stake.)

214
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,909
Ji Ah finally wakes up after overcoming difficult moments.

215
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,439
(Ji Ah overcomes difficult moments.)

216
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,939
She finds Tae Ho next to her.

217
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,939
Did you save me?

218
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,509
However, she could wake up...

219
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,939
because of Ki Joon's devoted care.

220
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:25,469
My boyfriend is amazing.

221
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,209
(Tae Ho doesn't tell her the truth.)

222
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:31,679
Gosh, you're so clumsy. Don't get hurt again, okay?

223
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,969
Stay tuned to find out how their love triangle...

224
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,239
will turn out.

225
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,369
A spectacular mystery drama, Missing9.

226
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,639
It's a whirlwind of shocking events...

227
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,609
that takes place around the nine missing people.

228
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,709
What will be their fate?

229
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,639
Was there a scene like that?

230
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,769
- Yes, there was. - That was great.

231
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,039
We just watched the whole drama.

232
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,209
Is that everything?

233
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,039
- We only shot until then. - You watched everything.

234
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,339
Kyung Ho.

235
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,809
What do you think makes your character charming?

236
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,669
I play an actor who doesn't know how to do...

237
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,009
anything for himself.

238
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,039
After the plane crash,

239
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,869
he learns a lot of things...

240
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,639
in the process of surviving.

241
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:21,469
He matures as a person.

242
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,739
On the other hand, Baek Jin Hee...

243
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,869
plays the stylist of a former star.

244
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,839
- She plays his stylist. - She plays Ra Bong Hee.

245
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,609
However, you only worked...

246
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:32,169
as his stylist for a day.

247
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,639
I was his stylist for one day.

248
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,739
I went in the water the most to catch fish...

249
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,209
and shellfish.

250
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,869
I did many things including building a hut.

251
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,909
- You worked as his manager, too. - You did everything.

252
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,209
I played many roles.

253
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,769
When you land on a deserted island,

254
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,139
- no stylist is necessary. - That's true.

255
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,609
You're too busy trying to survive.

256
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,309
In the beginning,

257
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:55,569
Bong Hee is very hopeful about being rescued.

258
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,039
- We will survive. - We will survive.

259
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:05,009
(We will survive, won't we?)

260
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,239
She plays a positive character.

261
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,509
However, including...

262
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,869
"Empress Ki" and "My Daughter, Geum Sa Wol",

263
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,409
every drama...

264
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,109
Baek Jin Hee appeared was very popular.

265
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,539
Do you feel pressured about this drama?

266
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,869
I don't feel pressured so much,

267
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,839
but we had a difficult time during the shoot.

268
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,609
All staff members and the cast...

269
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,209
went in the water despite the cold weather.

270
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,339
The weather was a big factor.

271
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,839
I hope the difficult times turn out worthwhile.

272
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,539
- Choi Tae Joon. - Choi Tae Joon.

273
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,869
His work has been impressive.

274
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:41,169
He's working on many things including variety shows.

275
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,439
I heard you play a malicious villain in this drama.

276
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,609
I feel at ease playing a villain.

277
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,039
As I play this character,

278
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,869
I can say everything I want.

279
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,239
Without hesitating, right?

280
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,809
When we land on the island, I'm the only one...

281
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,709
not carrying any luggage.

282
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,339
It was convenient during the shoot.

283
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,539
Everyone else was carrying water bottles.

284
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,569
Even Kim Sang Ho was carrying something.

285
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:07,339
(He's at ease in front of a senior actor.)

286
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,009
Why isn't he carrying anything when I am?

287
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,469
- What? - I think it's this way.

288
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,609
(The rest of the actors are having a hard time.)

289
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,969
Be quiet.

290
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,109
Joon Oh!

291
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:20,839
(The rest of the actors are having a hard time.)

292
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,469
Tae Ho.

293
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,139
(He's very comfortable.)

294
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,009
(While others are working, he stays seated and thinks.)

295
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:32,739
We received an emergency report.

296
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,509
- What is it? - If it's real,

297
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:37,109
it's shocking news.

298
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,569
According to this information I received,

299
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,169
Tae Joon and Sun Bin kissed as soon as they met.

300
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:45,039
(They're lovers in the drama.)

301
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,309
When are you going to kiss Tae Ho?

302
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,669
(The first scene they're shooting is a heated kissing scene.)

303
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,209
- Timing is important. - It shouldn't be too...

304
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,609
(The shoot began suddenly while they're still feeling all awkward.)

305
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,569
I'm very honored...

306
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,909
that Sun Bin shot her very first...

307
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,109
kissing scene in dramas with me.

308
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,609
- Aren't I right? - Yes.

309
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:11,469
- Really? - Yes. It'll be remembered...

310
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:12,569
as a good memory...

311
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,809
- That sounds weird. - "Good memory".

312
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:15,969
- No, I mean... - You made good memories?

313
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,139
- That's not what I meant. - You're saying it was memorable.

314
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,469
I tried my best to be considerate of her feelings...

315
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:24,009
and to make it less awkward.

316
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,509
- We were all over the place. - Yes, we were.

317
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:27,509
All of us were there.

318
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,009
- That's right. - We were peeping at them.

319
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,709
Sun Bin. When you were saying that you were all over the place,

320
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,739
- you gave him the thumbs up. - No, I didn't.

321
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,569
We were all over the place.

322
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,569
(She gave him the thumbs up.)

323
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,739
(Let's take a sneak peek at their kissing scene.)

324
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,509
(You can watch the full scene next Wednesday.)

325
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,239
- So the four of you came back. - Yes.

326
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:55,069
I want to know what happened to those who went missing with you.

327
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,939
- Here's Reporter Lee Teuk. - Do you know something?

328
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,769
Sadly, Chan Yeol...

329
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,809
couldn't get rescued. That's why...

330
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,869
he couldn't make it here today.

331
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,939
But since I'm so resourceful,

332
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,009
I managed to get a hold of him...

333
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:10,409
- who's on the deserted island now. - I see.

334
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,309
Let's talk to Chan Yeol now.

335
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,709
- Right now? - Yes. Chan Yeol?

336
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:17,939
Will he come out?

337
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:18,969
(She looks around.)

338
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,339
- What is going on? - Is he here?

339
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,569
Hello. I'm Chan Yeol, and I'll be playing Lee Yeol in Missing9.

340
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,209
Kyung Ho, Jin Hee,

341
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,669
- I miss him. - Tae Joon, and Sun Bin.

342
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,039
- I know, right? - Can you guys see me?

343
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,409
- He's cute. - Hello.

344
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:33,869
I haven't been rescued,

345
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:36,509
so I wasn't able to join the special today.

346
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,539
I'll be rescued soon, so don't worry about me too much.

347
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,469
The drama will make you...

348
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,709
sit at the edge of your seat the whole time you're watching it...

349
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,839
because it'll be filled with so many interesting and thrilling incidents,

350
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,409
so please look forward to it.

351
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:51,209
Also, please watch the drama...

352
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,969
and find out how I'll manage to return...

353
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,039
from the deserted island safe and sound.

354
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,639
If you want to rescue me from the island,

355
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,139
please make sure to watch Missing9 every Wednesday and Thursday.

356
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,169
Bye!

357
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:11,709
(Lee Yeol, age 23, former member of Dreamers and solo artist)

358
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,609
My character, Lee Yeol,

359
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,639
was the youngest member...

360
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,139
of the famous group, Dreamers. After the group disbanded,

361
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,809
he became a popular solo artist.

362
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:25,039
- You have to top the music charts. - I'll do my best.

363
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,939
- Mr. Hwang, the song is ready. - Okay! Let me hear it.

364
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,739
As a solo artist, he inherited Dreamers' style of music.

365
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:34,809
He also continues to respect Joon Oh even after the disbandment.

366
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,469
Joon Oh, are you okay? Did you get hurt?

367
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:38,569
(He's the only member who trusts Joon Oh.)

368
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:39,909
I'm going to do what Joon Oh says.

369
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,339
(I'm going to do what Joon Oh says.)

370
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,339
He's our leader, you know.

371
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,109
(President)

372
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,009
Hello, I'm Kim Sang Ho.

373
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,039
In Missing9,

374
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,169
I'll be playing the president of Legend Entertainment,

375
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,839
Hwang Jae Gook.

376
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,769
He doesn't lose his sense of humor even on the deserted island,

377
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,639
and he's so down-to-earth.

378
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,939
Hwang Jae Gook is like a big brother to everyone in Missing9.

379
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,509
Gather here, everyone. Let's lift our spirits up.

380
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,609
We should be grateful that we're alive. Wait, hold on a second.

381
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,269
(His quirky charms stand out even more on the island.)

382
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,269
I couldn't even sleep.

383
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:19,209
Then there's this guy who follows the big boss like his shadow...

384
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,509
while charming us with his presence.

385
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,209
In the drama, I'm Mr. Hwang Jae Gook's secretary...

386
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,939
as well as the director of Legend Entertainment,

387
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,509
Tae Ho Hang. I'm actor Tae Hang Ho.

388
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,609
My character tends to blow things out of proportion.

389
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,339
- Gosh, my goodness! - That's how his personality is.

390
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:38,379
(He's a timid guy.)

391
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,939
I won't make it. Just go.

392
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:41,939
Stop talking nonsense!

393
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:45,769
(They bicker at each other, yet they have the best teamwork.)

394
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,109
The mysterious last missing person...

395
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,009
is the top actress of Legend Entertainment, Yoon So Hee.

396
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,909
(Top actress of Legend Entertainment, Yoon So Hee)

397
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,739
Hello.

398
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,569
I'm Ryu Won, and I'll be playing Yoon So Hee.

399
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,709
She's a top actress of Korea.

400
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:04,239
She's very sensitive...

401
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,969
and tender-hearted. She also has a rich sensibility.

402
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,739
Hey, Yoon So Hee!

403
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:11,069
(She's unpredictable.)

404
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:14,269
I saw it. All of us will die here.

405
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,939
Someone is going to kill everyone so that they can survive.

406
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,439
And these two characters will add weight to the drama.

407
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,809
The person who is trying to conceal the truth.

408
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,039
I'm Cho Hee Kyung from the special investigation commission.

409
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,769
I'm Yoon Tae Young from the Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

410
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:28,809
(Yoon Tae Young is after the truth.)

411
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:31,839
The psychological warfare surrounding the truth.

412
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,569
Trying to unravel the mysterious relationships...

413
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,439
among the nine missing people...

414
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,609
makes the incident become more of an unsolvable riddle.

415
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,139
(Things get more mysterious.)

416
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:43,309
How will the truth about the mystery...

417
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:44,839
come to light?

418
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,439
I really want to know whom all of you were most excited...

419
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:51,739
about working with before the filming began.

420
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:52,809
- I'm curious, too. - In my case...

421
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,639
I've known Jin Hee for a while.

422
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,609
- I'd say it was Oh Jung Se. - I see, Oh Jung Se.

423
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,069
I've always been a fan of him.

424
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,609
I thought that I'd be able to learn a lot from him...

425
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,709
and that we'd have a lot of fun together, so I was very excited.

426
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,609
- I had to jump through hoops. - Stop it already.

427
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,209
I'm full. Why did you say that?

428
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,709
Are you all right? No! Don't do that.

429
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,769
(We look forward to their teamwork.)

430
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:16,939
I'm so glad that you're alive.

431
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:20,669
In my case, it was Kwon Hyuk Soo.

432
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,069
- He's usually seen as a funny guy, - That's right.

433
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,439
But he plays a prosecutor in our drama.

434
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,239
Tell him that his sister is the only one.

435
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,209
Ms. Ra Bong Hee.

436
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,439
(He'll surprise us with a side of him that we've never seen before.)

437
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,309
(We'll look forward to the teamwork between the two of you.)

438
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,469
We have to go in there. When you're there, you'll see...

439
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,609
I haven't shot any scenes with him yet,

440
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,879
but I was so excited about working with Yang Dong Geun. I'm a big fan.

441
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,339
I really want to see his acting...

442
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,509
and shoot with him soon.

443
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:50,539
(I'm a huge fan of yours.)

444
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,169
(Tae Joon is waiting for the drama to air to see Dong Geun's acting.)

445
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,739
But this layout is...

446
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,939
- In my case, it was Kim Sang Ho. - I see.

447
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,539
- I'm a fan of his. - Me, too.

448
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,739
He has been in so many dramas,

449
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:04,239
and he has played so many fun characters.

450
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,439
I'll teach you a lesson!

451
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,509
(Let's watch him on set.)

452
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,309
(He sure looks like a big boss.)

453
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,709
(Sun Bin looks so happy.)

454
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,069
I heard that you guys did a success-wishing ritual recently.

455
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:24,309
- What kind of wishes did you make? - Tell us what you wished for.

456
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:27,379
- I wished for my success. - There are always people like him.

457
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,569
In Kyung Ho's prayer,

458
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,209
he said, "I only care about my success."

459
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:35,569
- I'll answer again. - It's too late.

460
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,569
- Is it? - Yes.

461
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,939
Wish something else when you're starting a new drama.

462
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,939
(At the ritual)

463
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,939
We did a ritual to celebrate the first day of filming.

464
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,269
I hope that all of us can power up and do a good job together.

465
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:51,909
I'm really excited, and I think...

466
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,969
that I should do my very best. We can do this!

467
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,309
I hope Missing9 becomes a big hit.

468
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:00,139
I hope that we can finish filming the drama without any issues.

469
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,209
Please look forward to it.

470
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:04,039
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

471
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,379
(Best of luck, Missing9!)

472
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,239
I heard that Reporter Lee Teuk has another exclusive story.

473
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,269
Is it my turn again?

474
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:14,309
Hello, I'm Reporter Lee Teuk.

475
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:17,169
- My gosh. - With Chan Yeol's help,

476
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,009
we got an up-close-and-personal look at how the top stars are...

477
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:21,739
- surviving on the deserted island. - I see.

478
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,109
Seeing how desperate they are to survive will break your heart.

479
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,669
We'll reveal their survival stories...

480
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,709
to you now.

481
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,039
Part 1 of the in-depth coverage of Missing9.

482
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,169
"Tough Life on the Deserted Island".

483
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,809
(We'll reveal it now.)

484
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:38,909
Gosh, everyone looks so awesome.

485
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:43,209
Our team raided their shelter...

486
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,709
which is their home base on the island.

487
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,109
(What exactly is the shelter?)

488
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,809
Well... We initially live together...

489
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,069
on the beach,

490
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:54,339
but we soon feel danger and end up finding...

491
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:55,409
this shelter.

492
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,269
As you can see, it looks like it used to be inhabited by people.

493
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,339
Also, it's very spacious.

494
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,509
I think that it's a perfect place...

495
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,169
for the nine of us to live together.

496
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:08,409
- It's very well made. - The set looks amazing.

497
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,309
I must say, it's better than living right on the beach.

498
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,569
It has walls which block the wind.

499
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:17,639
It looks like a house, so I feel at peace here.

500
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,839
(The shelter is the survivors' only sanctuary on the island.)

501
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,769
- Did you know this was here? - Let's go in.

502
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,769
The color scheme is very nice.

503
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,169
- This is nice enough. - You guys must have bonded.

504
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,439
(Find out more in Missing9!)

505
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,139
And they shot the poster the next day.

506
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,439
It rained a lot that day.

507
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,839
- Oh, that day? - Yes. It rained so much.

508
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,209
The photo shoot is put on a quick pause,

509
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,439
and we spot these two engrossed in a serious conversation.

510
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,039
Our team went up to them.

511
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,209
What are you talking about?

512
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,369
(What's the topic of your conversation?)

513
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:00,369
We were talking about food.

514
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,769
(We were talking about food.)

515
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,509
- Eggs are rare in Jeju Island. - I'm hungry.

516
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,109
- I've been up since 4am. - It's a very serious topic.

517
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,439
I feel as if I've been living on tuna ever since arriving here.

518
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,839
Rice and tuna.

519
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,569
I've been eating all flavors of canned tuna.

520
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,269
(All flavors of canned tuna)

521
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,709
- I thought it was fresh tuna. - I thought she caught the fish.

522
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,209
- I thought she ate raw tuna. - She was talking about canned tuna.

523
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,039
Food is so precious here.

524
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,409
They're trying to simulate what it'd be like on a deserted island.

525
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,209
Is that why they don't give us food?

526
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,339
- They want us to experience it. - Exactly.

527
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,369
(He's shocked.)

528
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:35,969
I'm hungry!

529
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:39,069
(He's screaming that he's hungry so emotionally.)

530
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,909
(It's obvious that he really means it.)

531
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:44,169
- That's real acting. - He really meant it.

532
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,139
It wasn't even on the script.

533
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:47,609
I mean we weren't shooting.

534
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,769
When you're hungry, just talking about food helps.

535
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:55,039
Even the props become precious meals for them.

536
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,869
The best food of the deserted island is...

537
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,439
kimchi they found in the suitcase.

538
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:06,169
(She even licks her fingers.)

539
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:08,809
I have to go.

540
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,709
- Don't eat it all. - Gosh.

541
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:15,969
There is a scene where we eat kimchi in a small pack.

542
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,909
- I see. - I remember it was so delicious.

543
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,069
- It was actually delicious. - Kimchi in a small pack.

544
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,839
They are too hungry that they start to eat...

545
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,309
the snacks which were prepared as props.

546
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,539
It's so tasty.

547
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,069
I didn't open it to eat it.

548
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,139
I just opened it to act.

549
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,769
- Sure. - I'll just eat it to act.

550
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,969
Gosh. I feel too bad to watch them.

551
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,869
Should I send some sweet potatoes to the island?

552
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,469
"Sweet potatoes!"

553
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,609
Sweet potatoes!

554
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,509
"Sweet potatoes!"

555
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,009
(We'll definitely send you some.)

556
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,039
Aside from the food,

557
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,709
they have another difficulty.

558
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:56,669
When they're in the sea,

559
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:58,139
when they're in the rain,

560
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,039
and even when they eat food,

561
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:03,369
there's a disturbing fact that they always wear the same clothes.

562
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,409
We asked them how they feel about wearing the same clothes.

563
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,539
- You changed into these clothes. - Yes.

564
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,269
- Which ones feel more comfortable? - These.

565
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,209
I can sit on anywhere in these.

566
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,469
I now feel awkward to have pretty things.

567
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:18,809
No, Joon Oh. Wake up!

568
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,769
(Interestingly, all of their clothes are in beige.)

569
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,169
When they're in reality, they wear clothes in...

570
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,609
achromatic colors, including beige.

571
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:28,039
It's something we're consciously controlling.

572
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,439
When they drift to the island, they wear clothes in vivid colors.

573
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,509
I think you'll find out...

574
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:36,909
the reason when you watch the show.

575
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,669
You always wear the same clothes.

576
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,639
We can't even wash them for the consistency.

577
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,339
Didn't they smell bad?

578
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,039
Around the time they start to smell, we go into the sea,

579
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,209
or get in the rain. It's just like washing them.

580
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:50,269
(They get washed automatically.)

581
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,009
I actually realized something today.

582
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,209
- They even smell like flowers. - I didn't know...

583
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:56,139
the clothes actresses wear smell so great.

584
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:58,439
When we came here earlier today,

585
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,839
- I said, "You smell like a woman." - "Smell like a woman"?

586
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,439
- They smelled good. - Yes.

587
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,739
I didn't know they were so fragrant.

588
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:06,769
(We're fragrant women.)

589
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,139
What should I do?

590
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,909
The 1st difficulty that the actors of Missing9 had with water.

591
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,769
(Jumping into the sea in midwinter)

592
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,039
It looks so cold.

593
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,109
- It's literally a struggle. - Right.

594
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,209
(They do warm-up exercises before going into the sea.)

595
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,209
(In freezing weather, they go into the sea.)

596
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,769
- People normally do it to be funny. - That's right.

597
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,469
(It uses up a lot of their energy.)

598
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,609
- You have to finish it in one take. - That's right.

599
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,469
But the shivering people...

600
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:44,009
suddenly start to laugh.

601
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,709
This is the new trend of 2016.

602
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:54,109
Gosh, it was so funny. I had fun.

603
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:57,039
They go into the cold sea,

604
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,339
run hard on the sandy beach,

605
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:01,939
and go into the sea again.

606
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,569
Chan Yeol became a trendier sweater ghost.

607
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:08,909
- "Rubber..." - "Spear!"

608
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,709
(Su Geun notices something.)

609
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:13,969
There were ships.

610
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,369
Why didn't you ask for a rescue?

611
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,709
- I saw two big ships. - That's true.

612
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,009
I think you're mistaken.

613
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,369
- You're mistaken. - There's a boat, too.

614
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,709
Are those all computer graphics?

615
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,969
- You're mistaken. - I even saw the breakwater.

616
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,509
I think ships come to this island.

617
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,339
They had the second difficulty with water...

618
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:31,769
when they shot the plane crash.

619
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,869
(They pour water on her without mercy.)

620
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:38,069
(He's startled.)

621
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:40,709
Gosh. This is how you do it. I didn't know.

622
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,209
- This is how you shoot it. - Yes.

623
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,769
Let's do it again.

624
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,139
(They didn't pour it on the right timing.)

625
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:52,339
They keep retaking the scene because the timing is off.

626
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,639
- You were too fast. - It was too fast.

627
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,839
(They're practicing outside.)

628
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,909
We did it!

629
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,939
- Let's go. - Are we rolling?

630
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:03,809
- Yes, we are. Ready, - Ready,

631
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,909
- action. - action.

632
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:10,839
(They fire the water bomb.)

633
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,509
This is how they created the close-up shots of the plane crash.

634
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:22,809
The secret of this scene with a larger scale will be...

635
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,169
revealed later.

636
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:29,069
They were closely connected to water while they were on the location,

637
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:32,869
but the hardest thing was the underwater shooting.

638
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,339
I'm actually a little scared of water.

639
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,569
I have a trauma, and I don't know how to swim.

640
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,809
- I guess you don't like water. - I'm scared of water.

641
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:44,339
- I see. - Yes. I had a hard time at first.

642
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,969
To play Ra Bong Hee who used to be a diver,

643
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:52,169
Jin Hee spent long hours to fight with the water.

644
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,739
There was a scene where I go into the water...

645
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,409
upside down and get hurt...

646
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:00,409
and a scene where I rescue people. I had to shoot them all.

647
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,369
It was hard. My first underwater shooting lasted over 12 hours.

648
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,309
When I was done, I was really exhausted.

649
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:11,909
She overcame her trauma and attained a great underwater scene.

650
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:14,269
I'll show you a little bit of it.

651
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:30,939
- Gosh. Let's give her a big hand. - Goodness.

652
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,169
As we just saw on the video,

653
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,769
there were many scenes that looked so hard to shoot.

654
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,339
You jumped into the sea...

655
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,539
- and ran around in the rain. - You also got water poured on you.

656
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,169
You didn't even run around in an ordinary place.

657
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:45,009
- You ran in the dense woods. - Yes.

658
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,939
I think it was very hard for you to shoot such scenes.

659
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,739
Which scene was the hardest to shoot?

660
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,709
Do you remember any particular scenes?

661
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,309
For me,

662
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,109
- it was hard to go into the sea. - I suppose.

663
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,409
Is it because of your phobia?

664
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:59,909
I'm very scared of water.

665
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,239
But more than that, the water was so cold.

666
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,209
No matter how warm the weather was,

667
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:07,139
shooting the scene where I go into the sea or get in the rain was hard.

668
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,069
I was curious about something.

669
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,839
On the scene of the plane crash,

670
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,539
- they poured water on you. - That's right.

671
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:14,939
- They used a very special tool. - Yes.

672
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,869
How did you feel then?

673
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,669
After the first take, I was okay with it.

674
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,309
After the 2nd take, I thought we'll only have 3 takes.

675
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,239
But as we went on our 4th and 5th take,

676
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,139
I thought maybe they're mad at me or something.

677
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,309
Let me tell you something. When they pour water on you,

678
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,039
it gets into your ears and nose.

679
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,769
- It hurts so much. - I guess it stings.

680
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,009
They started it with a small bucket. I guess it wasn't enough.

681
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:35,739
- Even the director wanted more. - They switched it to a basin.

682
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:36,809
That's right.

683
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,169
Part 2 of the in-depth coverage of Missing9.

684
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,139
Checking the actors' charms.

685
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:46,509
(The first one to be checked out is...)

686
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,469
(Chan Yeol.)

687
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:50,839
Joon Oh. Joon Oh!

688
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,069
(You can describe his charm in one word.)

689
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:53,869
- Joon Oh! - He laughs a lot.

690
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,669
(Why do you keep calling names?)

691
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,409
When you were being funny, you called out names. Why did you?

692
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:04,309
It's because I call other people's name a lot in the drama.

693
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,239
I always call someone's name even when I'm sick, happy,

694
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,139
or sad.

695
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,539
To see if it's true, we analyzed the videos.

696
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:14,439
Tae Ho!

697
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:15,869
I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

698
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,339
Tae Ho. Let's stop, Tae Ho.

699
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:18,869
Joon Oh. Joon Oh.

700
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,639
Joon Oh. Joon Oh! Are you okay, Joon Oh? Are you hurt?

701
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:23,909
He really does that a lot.

702
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,209
- He really calls us often. - It's better than calling girls.

703
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,469
It's better to call the guys' names.

704
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,639
(He's cute.)

705
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:31,569
- I'm going to call them in vibrato. - Vibrato?

706
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,209
- "Joon Oh." - Joon Oh.

707
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,609
Check out his different ways of...

708
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,609
calling their names on the show.

709
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:42,809
The second person to be checked out is...

710
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,239
this man who makes everyone laugh with his witty words.

711
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,009
(Oh Jung Se, who makes everyone laugh)

712
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,039
We approached him to see what kind of charms he has.

713
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,839
(They approach Jung Se to see his charms.)

714
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,739
- He ran away. - He ran away.

715
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:58,939
(Whenever the camera goes near him, )

716
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:00,139
(he only shows his back.)

717
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,039
- He knows. - He knows it when...

718
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,669
- Really. - the camera approaches him.

719
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:04,839
He's a shy person.

720
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:07,109
It almost looks like he's one of the staff.

721
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,639
He rarely...

722
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,369
passes by in front of the camera, showing off his nonchalant charms.

723
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,169
I hope you could enjoy it on the show.

724
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,609
(We'll see your face on the show.)

725
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,939
Another man who lightens up the mood is Kim Sang Ho.

726
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,839
The word that he yells out the most often is...

727
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,109
Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!

728
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:26,939
They're shoes!

729
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:28,609
(Sang Ho heartily shouts out "shoes".)

730
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,439
I lost my shoes in the crash.

731
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,439
(It's because he lost them.)

732
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:36,269
(Barefoot Sang Ho's struggle is hard to watch.)

733
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,809
(Even while waiting for the shoot, he walks around barefoot.)

734
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,839
He plays a pitiful role,

735
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,039
but I hope you'll watch his cute charms closely.

736
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,569
The next one is Choi Tae Joon, who is kind of a simpleton.

737
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,939
(Tae Joon is charming in a silly way.)

738
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,239
Action.

739
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:57,369
Some clothes disappeared, too.

740
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,939
(He speaks the line correctly.)

741
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,039
(The line reads, "It's clear now.")

742
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,209
Now it's clear.

743
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,269
(He makes a mistake.)

744
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:06,609
It's clear now.

745
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,709
(Correct)

746
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:08,769
There is...

747
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:10,869
someone else in the...

748
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,439
What is it? My gosh.

749
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:16,039
It's because of Jung Se.

750
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,409
He's showing his back,

751
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,939
- but he makes a certain face. - To tease you?

752
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,039
I think I know what it is.

753
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:32,039
(Tae Joon keeps tripping over his tongue.)

754
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,609
(We went to ask him about it.)

755
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,639
I'm sorry.

756
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,069
Say it again.

757
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:39,369
Why did you keep making mistakes?

758
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,739
It's because it was so funny.

759
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:44,909
I made mistakes because I was laughing.

760
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:47,069
Who made you laugh?

761
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:50,369
- The one who made me laugh was... - I finally get to see his face.

762
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:51,439
(He's obviously the culprit.)

763
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,939
It was you.

764
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:53,969
Was it me?

765
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,409
We nominate Tae Joon...

766
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,909
as the king of bloopers for laughing too much.

767
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,339
(At the press conference room)

768
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,709
The mood of the scene...

769
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,109
We meet Kyung Ho getting ready for a scene...

770
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:07,169
of a press conference.

771
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,039
What's the next scene?

772
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,309
It's a press conference scene where Dreamers' breakup is announced.

773
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,639
It's set up.

774
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,469
You try to hug me.

775
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:23,039
Then I say, "No, no."

776
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,869
Ready, action.

777
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,509
I'd like to thank...

778
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,739
(He announces the disbandment of Dreamers.)

779
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,039
the reporters who are here today.

780
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,279
I'd like to apologize...

781
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:39,309
to our fans in China.

782
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,409
(He says something to the fans in China.)

783
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,609
(He speaks in Chinese.)

784
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,779
What was that?

785
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:50,669
Goodness.

786
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:54,239
(Chan Yeol laughs while Kyung Ho is serious.)

787
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,939
(The unexpected ad-lib makes him laugh.)

788
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:58,509
I apologize to all the fans abroad.

789
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,009
I said I drank but didn't drink and drive.

790
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,639
All of these are Kyung Ho's crazy ad-lib.

791
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,069
Cut.

792
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:11,069
I couldn't stop laughing.

793
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,469
Seriously, Kyung Ho.

794
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:15,439
You started speaking Chinese.

795
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:19,609
I can't do this. It's too funny.

796
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:22,209
(He personalizes the scene.)

797
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:25,469
You said you drank but didn't drink and drive.

798
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:27,669
That's the part I laughed at.

799
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:28,839
(What's the story behind the ad-lib?)

800
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:29,839
Actually,

801
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,279
this scene takes less than a page in the script.

802
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:36,279
It's a short scene.

803
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,309
However, Joon Oh turned it into an amazing scene.

804
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:40,609
What are you talking about?

805
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,309
It was a very difficult scene for me.

806
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,309
(He means, "Keep talking.")

807
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:47,739
Times like this makes the shoot...

808
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:49,839
fun and interesting.

809
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:54,839
We nominate Kyung Ho as the king of ad-lib on Missing9.

810
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,969
(They show their respect.)

811
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,639
During the press conference scene,

812
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,939
Kyung Ho made ad-libs endlessly.

813
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:07,309
It's a scene from the first episode.

814
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,779
The director and I wanted to make it more humorous.

815
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,709
Which ad-lib was the funniest that you remember?

816
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:16,209
This is what the directors and staff members say.

817
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,709
They say we can shoot until tomorrow if they don't stop us.

818
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,609
- We kept making ad-libs. - I see.

819
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:23,809
There's a scene where we play hopscotch.

820
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,569
The director couldn't cut...

821
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,009
because it was too funny.

822
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:28,609
Do it like this.

823
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,909
You can't play it that fast. I can't see what's going on.

824
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:32,279
Playing it fast is important.

825
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,709
(It's all ad-lib from now on.)

826
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:35,169
You can take off this foot.

827
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:37,869
Once you take off the foot, you can't put it back down.

828
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,209
I said you can either take off the foot or step on it.

829
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:43,509
Once you take off the foot, what is it called?

830
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:45,369
What was it called?

831
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,309
Joon Ho, speaking clearly and not stepping on the line...

832
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,109
are the most important in hopscotch.

833
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:51,669
Did you speak clearly or not?

834
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,109
What was it called when you can't put down the foot again?

835
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:55,169
It's "No Turning Back".

836
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,109
- "No Turning Back". - I know.

837
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,609
You stepped on the line again.

838
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:01,469
I won't play it anymore.

839
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,569
There was a question of...

840
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:08,709
who livens up the mood at the film set.

841
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,469
I thought the person who livens up the mood...

842
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:14,279
was Lee Sun Bin.

843
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,939
I met her on a different show.

844
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,779
She's good at singing and dancing.

845
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:22,039
- She was on "King of Mask Singer". - What did you sing?

846
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,069
I sang "Drink Again" by Vibe.

847
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:27,739
(To break stereotypes, she appeared on "King of Mask Singer".)

848
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,109
(Many were impressed by her singing skills.)

849
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:36,279
(Her unexpected singing surprised everyone.)

850
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:39,039
Could you sing one measure?

851
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,609
(She sings a measure for the viewers.)

852
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:44,669
I'm nervous.

853
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:46,539
Go ahead.

854
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,169
I always drink.

855
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,409
(She has a sweet voice.)

856
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,439
She's good.

857
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,639
(It's time to enjoy her singing voice.)

858
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:04,739
We're strangers now.

859
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:08,009
(Sun Bin loves music and acting.)

860
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,169
We're strangers.

861
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,909
After losing you.

862
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:18,339
You and I are strangers.

863
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:21,209
Forever.

864
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:24,339
That was great.

865
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,809
Next is a conversation that involves pointing at someone.

866
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,869
Here's the first question.

867
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:34,169
If you can go to a deserted island with one person from the cast,

868
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:37,539
with whom would you like to go?

869
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,569
In 1, 2, 3.

870
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,309
(Kyung Ho chooses Soo Geun.)

871
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:45,869
Why did you choose him?

872
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:47,909
I think you and I will get along.

873
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,809
- Why can't I choose him? - Aren't we part of the cast?

874
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,239
- What are we? - Us?

875
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,809
Do we choose among the four of us?

876
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,569
I'm sorry for not understanding.

877
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,109
Please invite me to a deserted island. I'll be happy to come.

878
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:02,539
- They can be a couple. - From the back,

879
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,039
I look similar to Kim Byung Man.

880
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,309
There you go.

881
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,639
Most people pointed at you.

882
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,409
All three of them pointed at you.

883
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:10,509
It's because he's the eldest.

884
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,109
- I see. - I pointed at you.

885
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:13,339
- Really? Thank you. - I pointed at Jin Hee.

886
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:14,409
I pointed at Jin Hee.

887
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:16,779
Right, Sun Bin chose Jin Hee.

888
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:19,279
It was the case in the drama.

889
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,339
The more I get to know Jin Hee,

890
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,339
the more I realized that she's good at cooking.

891
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:25,469
That's why.

892
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,369
Soo Geun,

893
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:30,369
which one of them would you go to a deserted island with?

894
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,609
Let me go to an island first.

895
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,109
- You can't. - How about you?

896
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,469
Which actress would you go with?

897
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,039
- Please choose one of them. - Am I blushing?

898
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,439
Yes, you're blushing.

899
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,909
The important part is the anticipation of the actresses.

900
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:48,369
- Really? - Of course. Choosing...

901
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,369
is the fun part.

902
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:51,409
Whom do you choose?

903
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,039
Gosh, it's so difficult.

904
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,009
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

905
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,639
There.

906
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,739
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

907
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,469
(He points at Jin Hee without hesitating.)

908
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,109
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

909
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,109
Since she's good at cooking,

910
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,839
I can catch something and give it to her.

911
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,339
- What are you doing? - All right.

912
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,969
He's told me many times...

913
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,239
that he likes women who are cute.

914
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:14,809
When did I say that?

915
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:17,339
Gosh, he's blushing a lot.

916
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,469
- Please stop. - I smell your ears burning.

917
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:20,939
His ears burning?

918
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:22,009
(Please stop, Soo Geun.)

919
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,369
Here's the second question.

920
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,609
Who looked the most pitiful on the deserted island?

921
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:29,669
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

922
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,969
(Jin Hee and Sun Bin each get two votes.)

923
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,569
Why did she look pitiful?

924
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:39,139
It was cold, and her costume...

925
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:41,779
- was a short skirt. - That's right.

926
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:43,069
I'm sure it was difficult.

927
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:45,939
I pointed at Jin Hee because she has many solo scenes.

928
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,209
She has to swim alone to catch fish.

929
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:51,339
She has to find her luggage as well.

930
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,809
When everyone else had free time,

931
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,339
she had to shoot her solo scene.

932
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:58,969
She couldn't join us when other actors had meetings.

933
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,539
I felt bad for her.

934
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:02,409
She's the female version of Conan.

935
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,839
- That's true. - Don't you think?

936
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,209
The 1st episode of Missing9 will air next Wednesday.

937
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:09,809
Since it's full of mysteries and secrets,

938
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,439
not much information about the drama...

939
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,909
has been made public.

940
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,669
It's different from other dramas.

941
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:18,539
Here's what I prepared.

942
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,869
For you to enjoy more of Missing9,

943
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,539
here are the key points. Let's watch them together.

944
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:28,239
A sudden plane crash.

945
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,939
Nine survivors and a mysterious dead body.

946
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:34,409
There's only one witness.

947
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,409
Here's a preview of Missing9 full of mysteries.

948
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,909
These are the three key points.

949
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,869
(First key point)

950
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,909
Here's the 1st key point of Missing9.

951
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:55,309
Lost memories create dramatic suspense.

952
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:57,869
(After the plane crash)

953
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,839
After the plane crash, Ra Bong Hee loses...

954
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:01,909
all of her memories.

955
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,009
She can't remember anything.

956
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:06,169
I don't remember.

957
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:08,039
She seems very sleepy.

958
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,209
I was under a hypnosis.

959
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:12,669
The story of Missing9...

960
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:14,869
starts from her lost memories.

961
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:16,739
What should I do?

962
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,969
The press and the whole nation...

963
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,469
focus on Bong Hee.

964
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,469
I don't think so.

965
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:24,709
Close your eyes.

966
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:28,809
(They try to retrieve her lost memories.)

967
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,469
They try everything...

968
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:32,539
to retrieve her memories.

969
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:36,779
However, as she regains her memories,

970
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:37,969
the shocking truth is revealed.

971
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,709
As mysterious events from the past and Bong Hee's present life...

972
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,969
intertwine, they create dramatic suspense.

973
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:53,569
I regained...

974
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,009
(I regained all my memories.)

975
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:58,009
- all my memories. - I remember that scene.

976
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:02,209
What kind of story will her memories create?

977
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,039
(Instead of investigating the truth...)

978
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,739
Instead of investigating the truth,

979
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,279
the chairwoman of the special committee Cho Hee Kyung...

980
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:13,209
tries to hide and manipulate the truth to save her face.

981
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,339
Four months after the plane crash,

982
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,239
the committee decided that no one had survived...

983
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:22,609
and stopped to search them.

984
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:24,779
Did we do the right thing?

985
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:28,939
You're making it more complicated.

986
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,609
Bong Hee's return only shows...

987
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,509
how unjust and irresponsible the government was...

988
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:35,469
in dealing with the situation.

989
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,139
Do whatever you can...

990
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,209
to recover your memories.

991
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:41,909
(A man struggles to reveal the truth.)

992
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:44,309
On the other hand, there's a man who struggles...

993
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:45,569
to find out the truth.

994
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,409
I'm Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young.

995
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,569
The procedure was...

996
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,409
Will he be able to uncover the truth...

997
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,139
which the government buried?

998
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:56,669
Also, will one person's justice...

999
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:59,539
be able to win against the lies fabricated by those in power?

1000
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,709
Can you trust me...

1001
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:03,969
and follow my guidance?

1002
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,869
This dichotomy makes us want to know more about the drama, Missing9.

1003
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:12,069
This drama is actually...

1004
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:14,809
a story about people who don't give up.

1005
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:16,139
That's how I'd like to define it.

1006
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,109
That's how our society is, too.

1007
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:21,739
Those who don't give up values like justice or truth...

1008
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:25,339
will eventually see a ray of light in the situation they're in.

1009
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:27,269
In contrast, those who don't give up...

1010
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:30,069
their selfish greed will end up...

1011
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:33,309
encountering darkness in the situation they face.

1012
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:35,369
That's what the story is about.

1013
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,339
"According to the statement given by the survivor, Ra Bong Hee..."

1014
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:44,039
(The government fails to save its citizens.)

1015
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:45,139
From now on, I will...

1016
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,639
brief you all on the crash of Legend Entertainment's private jet.

1017
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,869
(The government is busy trying to conceal the truth.)

1018
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:54,139
- My goodness! - Truth never remains buried.

1019
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,539
Revealing how unprepared...

1020
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:59,539
the Korean government is to manage such disasters...

1021
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:02,039
is another key point of this drama.

1022
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:04,709
(Second key point)

1023
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:06,569
Here's the 2nd key point of Missing9.

1024
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:09,769
The teamwork among the cast.

1025
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,669
Here! Here.

1026
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:17,269
First, let's take a look at the teamwork and chemistry...

1027
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,169
between Kyung Ho and Jin Hee.

1028
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:22,609
(At Jin Hee's very first shoot)

1029
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:23,869
That was my first shoot.

1030
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:25,669
- Do you remember that day? - Yes.

1031
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,109
This romantic guy, Kyung Ho, visited the set secretly...

1032
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:33,769
to cheer for Jin Hee on her first day of filming.

1033
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,769
- Congratulations. See you tomorrow. - See you.

1034
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:40,239
We could feel the chemistry between them before the filming even began.

1035
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:42,339
Kyung Ho is such a great friend.

1036
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,039
He visited her to cheer for her.

1037
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:47,239
Once, Kyung Ho showed up at our shoot...

1038
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:49,409
which took place on a beach on an extremely cold day...

1039
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:51,269
- with ice cream. - My gosh.

1040
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,439
(It was delicious, though.)

1041
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:58,609
However, Kyung Ho transforms into a guy...

1042
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:00,539
who is very cold towards Jin Hee in the drama.

1043
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,139
It's as if he has a split personality.

1044
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:04,869
This is why you shouldn't work with someone who has no experience.

1045
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,909
A cranky celebrity...

1046
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:09,769
and a stylist who has no experience.

1047
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,109
Bring the outfits you have put together. I'm counting on you.

1048
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:15,369
Even their first encounter was very special.

1049
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:16,369
(They meet on a mud flat.)

1050
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,569
Ra Bong Hee is desperately looking for job.

1051
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:22,939
It stings. Next.

1052
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,339
Seo Joon Oh tries to show her who the boss is.

1053
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:27,709
(Seo Joon Oh bosses her around.)

1054
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:28,939
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1055
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,439
(Bong Hee is burned out.)

1056
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:32,339
- Let's resume the shoot. - No.

1057
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:33,639
Let's start rolling again.

1058
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,639
However, he can't remain as the boss for a long time.

1059
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,839
Their situations get reversed on the deserted island.

1060
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,009
(He's trying so hard.)

1061
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,339
Is there anything you can do?

1062
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,069
Joon Oh can't do anything without Bong Hee's help,

1063
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:51,669
and he begins to completely rely on her.

1064
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:55,209
- That's the first fish I ate there. - Was it good?

1065
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,339
Look at his face.

1066
00:46:57,339 --> 00:46:58,409
(It was so delicious.)

1067
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:01,339
(He starts developing feelings for Bong Hee.)

1068
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:02,809
He gradually starts...

1069
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:04,769
to develop feelings for Bong Hee.

1070
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:11,909
How will their relationship evolve over time?

1071
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:12,969
(What will happen between them?)

1072
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,609
The bromance between Kyung Ho and Jung Se...

1073
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:19,239
beats romantic chemistry between any couples.

1074
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,409
- My gosh! - I'm so glad you're alive.

1075
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:23,139
You said I can just eat it.

1076
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,469
You have to catch it first, Joon Oh.

1077
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,169
- That's not what I agreed on. - What do you mean?

1078
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:27,869
Hey, congratulations!

1079
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,539
From the top to rock bottom,

1080
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,669
they've been through all the ups and downs together.

1081
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:34,509
I didn't see this before.

1082
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:36,739
(They're closer than family, but...)

1083
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:37,739
Joon Oh.

1084
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:40,709
Blocking each other's numbers is no big deal...

1085
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:41,939
in their love-and-hate relationship.

1086
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:46,809
- You never told me about it. - Those baby octopuses live there.

1087
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:47,969
Did I have to tell you that part?

1088
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,039
(They quibble over nothing.)

1089
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:51,669
Ki Joon, we promised not to keep any secrets from each other.

1090
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:53,239
I'm disappointed in you.

1091
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,039
(They flaunt their bromance.)

1092
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,139
There's another duo that wants to compete...

1093
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:58,639
with their friendly bromance.

1094
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,839
(Another duo flaunts their bromance.)

1095
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,909
It's the two best scene stealers of Missing9,

1096
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,369
Kim Sang Ho and Tae Hang Ho.

1097
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:05,969
This duo is so funny.

1098
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:06,969
- They're hilarious. - Yes.

1099
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,509
- They look like they belong there. - They do.

1100
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:12,639
They both look as if they were born and raised on the island.

1101
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,239
From their similar looks...

1102
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,009
How can you not catch these? They were already here.

1103
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,069
You told me to just steer them. You said you'll catch them.

1104
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:21,839
You said you've done this in the army.

1105
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,239
This is a very different situation!

1106
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:27,839
To their funny conversations and improvised lines.

1107
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:29,669
I'm so hungry!

1108
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:31,869
I should do it like this.

1109
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,069
Showing off the best teamwork among the cast,

1110
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,809
the two of them make the drama much more lively.

1111
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:41,269
Paying attention to the various range of acting styles...

1112
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,969
is another way to enjoy the drama more.

1113
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:47,739
(Third key point)

1114
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,909
Here's the 3rd key point of Missing9.

1115
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:53,109
The plane crash scene is the most...

1116
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:54,969
realistic one to date in the history of Korean dramas.

1117
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,139
My gosh, it looks so real.

1118
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,509
How did this amazing scene...

1119
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:00,709
- come into being? - My gosh.

1120
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:02,909
(How was the scene shot?)

1121
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,669
All right. It's rolling. Ready...

1122
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,469
and action.

1123
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,509
In order to make it look as realistic as possible,

1124
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,739
the best filming crew from films, "The Admiral: Roaring Currents"...

1125
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,439
and "Haemoo", was brought in.

1126
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,669
On top of that, they also got the body of the airplane made...

1127
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,909
in order to make the turbulence look real.

1128
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,669
Many types of special effects and equipment were used.

1129
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,409
It was the very first time...

1130
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,009
a plane crash scene was shot in the history...

1131
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,669
of Korean film and drama.

1132
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:30,709
Everyone worked so hard for a number of months...

1133
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:31,809
in order to come up...

1134
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:35,039
with the best solution to design and shoot the plane crash scene.

1135
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,739
The plane crashes into the sea, so we needed water to rush in.

1136
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:39,709
The process itself was challenging.

1137
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:43,139
It was difficult to simulate the aircraft turbulence.

1138
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,969
We had to use a few large-scale structures.

1139
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:48,869
We also needed a huge water tank...

1140
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,209
in order to show the plane getting submerged into the ocean.

1141
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,369
We used water slides and reenacted an actual plane crash.

1142
00:49:55,469 --> 00:49:56,709
(This water cannon will eat up the plane.)

1143
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:59,309
- That's a water cannon. - I see, a water cannon.

1144
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,639
(My gosh!)

1145
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,039
That really happened. Water actually rushed in like that.

1146
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,539
(It actually happened.)

1147
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,269
Meticulous computer graphics is a must to perfect the scene.

1148
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:14,409
Unlike other dramas, many scenes at the beginning...

1149
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,039
of Missing9 required...

1150
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,109
use of highly advanced computer graphics.

1151
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:21,109
In order to make them look as realistic as possible,

1152
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:23,209
we've had to consult 3D and SF specialists.

1153
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:27,069
We also had to manipulate lighting and use composite transformations.

1154
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,269
Here's a special sneak preview exclusively for you.

1155
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:32,039
(With the added touch of computer graphics, )

1156
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,939
(it became a perfect airplane crash scene!)

1157
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:39,009
The airplane crash scene looks so perfect.

1158
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,809
Isn't it from a real crash?

1159
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,369
Since it's a dangerous shoot, the air on set is very tense.

1160
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,539
The actors are stumbling and falling.

1161
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:50,909
It is a complete disaster.

1162
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:53,269
Ji Ah! Gosh.

1163
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:54,739
The plane crash scene could come into being...

1164
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:58,469
because of all the actors and crew members' hard work.

1165
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,769
It'll be revealed in the 1st episode of Missing9 next Wednesday.

1166
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:04,669
(You'll be able to watch it in the 1st episode of Missing9.)

1167
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:06,439
My gosh, I'm already so curious.

1168
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,939
- There are three key points. - That's right.

1169
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:11,069
- The drama sounds so amazing. - I agree.

1170
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,409
I'm wondering what else you think sets...

1171
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:14,809
- the drama apart. - What are your thoughts?

1172
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,509
This kind of theme has never been explored...

1173
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,069
- in a drama before. - That's right.

1174
00:51:19,069 --> 00:51:21,869
- I think it'll be refreshing. - Yes.

1175
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:24,239
The 1st episode of Missing9 will air on next Wednesday.

1176
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:26,539
- Since its genre is mystery, - Yes.

1177
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:29,039
I trust that many fans of the genre...

1178
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,939
will watch the drama.

1179
00:51:30,939 --> 00:51:32,209
- I'm really looking forward to it. - Yes.

1180
00:51:32,209 --> 00:51:35,609
I actually sent my agents out to gather Intel so that I can...

1181
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,739
provide those of you who are watching this with information...

1182
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:41,109
that will pique your curiosity before the drama begins.

1183
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:44,509
I'll go ahead and reveal the secret Intel right now.

1184
00:51:44,509 --> 00:51:45,809
- Exclusively for our viewers? - Yes.

1185
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,239
- I'm so excited. - It's our secret.

1186
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,239
- Come closer. - Show us.

1187
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,039
- It's secret. - Don't tell anyone.

1188
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:54,539
(One night in 2017)

1189
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:58,939
(Three articles of evidence are left in a secret place.)

1190
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:02,769
(They contain secrets of the nine missing people.)

1191
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:06,639
(They offer us pertinent clues.)

1192
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:12,109
(The mysterious incident that takes place on the deserted island)

1193
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:17,369
(What is the shocking truth...)

1194
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:21,509
(behind it?)

1195
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,609
(The answer...)

1196
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,369
(is here.)

1197
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:33,739
We went through hoops to obtain the pertinent clues...

1198
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,409
that will help us unravel the secret of Missing9.

1199
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:38,569
There are three clues in total,

1200
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:42,909
and I'm going to reveal them to you one at a time.

1201
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:46,209
(The 3 clues to the secret of Missing9)

1202
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,409
The first clue that holds the key...

1203
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,339
to the secret is...

1204
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,109
It's... It's...

1205
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:55,239
this necklace.

1206
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:59,339
(It looks like a normal necklace.)

1207
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,369
Ra Bong Hee...

1208
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:02,939
was wearing this necklace when she was rescued.

1209
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:04,909
What's surprising...

1210
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:08,009
is that this necklace isn't hers.

1211
00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:09,109
(It's not Ra Bong Hee's necklace?)

1212
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:11,669
That necklace you're wearing...

1213
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:16,569
(Whose necklace is it, then?)

1214
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,039
Whose necklace is this, then?

1215
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,139
And why was Ra Bong Hee wearing someone else's necklace?

1216
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,769
What is the truth behind this necklace?

1217
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:29,609
Please look forward to it.

1218
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,469
Here's the second clue that will...

1219
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:35,169
help us uncover the secret of Missing9.

1220
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:37,509
It's the USB stick here.

1221
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:40,769
It's inside this USB stick.

1222
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,769
I will reveal the video in it.

1223
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:45,569
(He reveals the secret video inside the USB stick.)

1224
00:53:46,939 --> 00:53:51,009
(What kind of a video is inside it?)

1225
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:53,909
Stop it!

1226
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:56,809
The video shows someone's funeral where...

1227
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:59,669
people of Legend Entertainment including...

1228
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:02,169
members of Dreamers cry out in sorrow.

1229
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:05,839
The man who died is Shin Jae Hyun.

1230
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:10,039
I saw everything. That's why you scare me the most.

1231
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,269
Don't you know why we disbanded? I mean...

1232
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:13,539
(His death is related to the disbandment of Dreamers.)

1233
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:14,809
why we had to disband?

1234
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:19,369
In Legend Entertainment, it's a taboo to even mention...

1235
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,509
his name.

1236
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:23,839
What kind of shocking secrets...

1237
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,939
are hidden behind his death?

1238
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:31,709
The final clue to solve the mystery of Missing9 is...

1239
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:35,269
this black jacket.

1240
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:39,869
Its somewhat bloody smell makes you feel repelled.

1241
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:43,539
Ra Bong Hee lost her memories.

1242
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,539
The man who hovers around her...

1243
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:50,039
always wears this black jacket.

1244
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:51,569
(The man in the black jacket has a plot.)

1245
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:54,539
The man in the black jacket approaches Bong Hee when...

1246
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:55,909
she starts to recover her memory.

1247
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,539
He is controlled by a great power...

1248
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,569
that fears the truth coming out.

1249
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:02,309
Who are you?

1250
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:06,209
This dark shadow threatens Bong Hee.

1251
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:07,939
- Get her! - Stop!

1252
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,039
No!

1253
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,609
Who is behind the man in this black jacket?

1254
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:18,369
If you want to...

1255
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:22,569
enjoy the thrilling drama series Missing9 to the fullest,

1256
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:24,569
remember these three clues that will...

1257
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:25,709
shock you in the end.

1258
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:28,069
Please don't...

1259
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,209
forget them.

1260
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,039
Let's say your show...

1261
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:35,369
records the highest ratings among other shows aired at the same time.

1262
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,709
Then what do you think its ratings will be like?

1263
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,309
The title has number 9, so maybe 19 percent.

1264
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:41,369
(19 percent)

1265
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:44,769
It was a little unexpected. She didn't say 9 percent.

1266
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:46,109
(She could've said 9 percent.)

1267
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,069
- She added 10. - Does the word "nine" mean 19?

1268
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:49,339
Does the word "nine" mean 19?

1269
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,969
(Nine percent is too little.)

1270
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,469
With Missing9 as a start, I hope you'll make...

1271
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,169
many big hits this year.

1272
00:55:57,169 --> 00:56:00,639
It's the new year, so let's hear what your wishes are.

1273
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:03,269
I think it'll be meaningful to tell it to the viewers.

1274
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:06,369
I'm starting this year with Missing9.

1275
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:08,769
Meeting these great people is already a gift for me.

1276
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:11,169
The fellow actors, actresses, and the staff members are so great.

1277
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:13,239
I feel like I've already gotten...

1278
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,139
a gift for this year.

1279
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,839
I suppose we all had a tough last year.

1280
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:18,939
Missing9 could be...

1281
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:22,109
a good drama that makes you forget about the bad things.

1282
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:25,239
It's fun and very touching.

1283
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:28,439
I hope you'll look forward to it, and love the show.

1284
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:29,769
- Gosh. - That was great.

1285
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:33,369
I hope many people will watch Missing9 in 2017...

1286
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,139
and get comfort from it.

1287
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,909
We're working hard to shoot the show even in bad conditions.

1288
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:39,809
I hope many of you will watch it.

1289
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:40,839
Great.

1290
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:45,509
- Dear viewers, Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

1291
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:49,369
- Also, please watch Missing9. - Please watch Missing9.

1292
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,809
The new year 2017 has dawned.

1293
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,969
We did our best to make a great show.

1294
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:58,269

1297
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:08,139
Joon Oh!

1298
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:10,639
(Missing9)

1299
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,069
The plane crashed.

1300
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:14,909
Seo Joon Oh and Ra Bong Hee are the only survivors.

1301
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:18,969
I don't remember.

1302
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,009
(They're left in a deserted island.)

1303
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:21,739
- Ki Joon! - Yeol!

1304
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,039
- Joon Oh! - In the underground...

1305
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,809
I don't remember what happened to those people.

1306
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,909
You can kill someone again, right? This is a deserted island.

1307
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:32,509
Let's not doubt and point swords at each other.

1308
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:33,939
Please believe me.

1309
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:37,039
You don't know whether they're alive or dead in that island.

1310
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:38,769
Please don't abandon them.

1311
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:43,109
