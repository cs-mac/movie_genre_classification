1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,009
Blue one to blue two, checkpoint
alpha bravo has been reached.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,493
Copy, leader one.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,295
Blue two, we have a suspicious
vehicle on the right,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,217
moving pretty fast.
Over.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,137
Army corps four, is he slowing down?

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,216
Blue one,
why are you driving so slow?

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,457
- You worried about a ticket? Over.
- Sorry, guys. Just rubbing one out.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,294
Phelps is down!

9
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,935
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

10
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,290
Once we're quartered,
we'll give you a rundown on battalion

11
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,853
and squadron-level readiness and

12
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,136
today's brief will focus
on first marine division.

13
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,013
The slide indicates that
personnel readiness 1st mardiv

14
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,732
is not as bad as they are reporting.

15
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,136
However, sir, as you are aware,
last Friday they made a request

16
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,898
for 300 additional augments.

17
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,219
Given the insurgency in Al-Anbar

18
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,615
and the recent spike in casualties,

19
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,691
it's not surprising that
they made this request.

20
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,972
Sir, it's my recommendation to just
send enough augments

21
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,694
to cover their casualties
of last month.

22
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,698
How many of you have
been in Iraq since 9 /11?

23
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,293
I know you've spent a lot of time
on these reports, but I cannot have

24
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,020
a bunch of analysts contradict
the commanders on the ground.

25
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,008
I don't know. With all
this administrative crap,

26
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,018
it makes you wonder if we're losing
focus on what really matters.

27
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,450
Sometimes I wish I was over there.

28
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,579
I don't know, sir.

29
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,817
Be careful what you wish for, right?

30
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,135
Hey, dad.

31
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,296
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

32
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,770
Guess who came in first
in her swim meet.

33
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,129
Let me guess.

34
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,373
You? High-five. That's great!

35
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,216
Listen, guys, how about we get some
homework done before dinner?

36
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,213
I think that sounds
like a great idea.

37
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,459
What are you cooking here?

38
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,048
White chicken chili
with a balsamic reduction.

39
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,770
- You're getting creative.
- Shut up.

40
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,649
Let us pray.

41
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,695
Ready. Down.

42
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,054
- Ready, two.
- Present arms!

43
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,011
Forward march.

44
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,259
Bearers, halt.

45
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,733
That is not nice.

46
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,418
Dad, I think I got all of
the words right, but I'm not sure.

47
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,179
I'll throw a quick one
at you right now. "Tortellini."

48
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,932
T-o-r-i..
I don't know.

49
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,419
Sir, last night I read the DOD
Announcement about PFC Phelps.

50
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,299
He is from my home town,
Clifton, Colorado.

51
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,935
I don't know if this falls to us

52
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,016
or to the Pentagon, but,

53
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,370
sir, if the duty does fall to us.

54
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,412
I would be honored
to escort him home.

55
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,898
It's a little unusual
for an officer to escort a PFC.

56
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,096
Yes, sir, I know that, but..

57
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,774
I would very much
like to do it, sir.

58
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,017
I'm going out of town for a few days.
I'm being picked up at 6:00.

59
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,291
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yeah.

60
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,536
I volunteered for escort duty.

61
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,212
There was this private first class,
killed in Iraq. Young kid.

62
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,179
He's from Clifton.
I volunteered to take him home.

63
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,811
What is this about, Mike?

64
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,090
It's not about anything.
He's from Clifton, that's all.

65
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,415
It's gonna be a quick trip, Stace.

66
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,852
I'll be back next week.

67
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,613
Please tell the family I'm so
sorry for their loss.

68
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,249
I will.

69
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,975
I love you.

70
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,496
The remains are to travel feet first

71
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,612
when being transported
from one point to another.

72
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,135
At every stop,

73
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,411
you must ensure that the remains
have been correctly loaded.

74
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,054
At each transfer point,

75
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,977
regardless of the mode of transport,

76
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,738
you will render honors.

77
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,770
Your duty, is not complete

78
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,808
until you have delivered
the remains to the funeral director.

79
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,250
Escorts are not required
to stay for the funeral.

80
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,092
However, should you decide to stay,

81
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,688
there are specific guidelines
for meeting the family.

82
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,697
At no point are you to discuss

83
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,856
the nature of the deceased's death,

84
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,972
no are you to speculate
on the activities surrounding the death.

85
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,612
You may deliver the personal effects
directly to the next of kin.

86
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,815
These effects must stay
on your person

87
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,136
at all times until delivery.

88
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,615
Gentlemen, we have
our first departure of the day.

89
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,653
We form about in the drive and
render honors as all remains depart.

90
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,615
Detail,

91
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,059
attention!

92
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,258
Present arms!

93
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,539
Order arms!

94
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,732
Present arms!

95
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,729
Dismissed!

96
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,334
I'm afraid we've taken
a lot of casualties this week.

97
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,138
He's not ready for departure today.

98
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,900
.. but not what he
completes in his lifetime.

99
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,253
Imagine an evolution
occurring over eons..

100
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,416
.. the attack tonight comes
amid rising violence

101
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,657
between insurgents and
coalition troops throughout Iraq.

102
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,612
Marines in Fallujah today pushed

103
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,015
into the chaotic city
from several directions.

104
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,099
They met with heavy fire from assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

105
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,215
I bet you didn't know
marines could sew.

106
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,568
He was quite impresse, your PFC.

107
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,488
He's so decorated
for such a young man.

108
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,529
I didn't know him.

109
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,935
You can be sure that
his uniform will be perfect.

110
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,779
Appreciate it, Colonel.

111
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,333
You know, whether it's now
or later, it doesn't matter.

112
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,689
But just in case..

113
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,928
He's a military shrink.
It's all confidential.

114
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,652
I'm good, thanks.

115
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,579
It's just an FYI.

116
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,413
Colonel Strobl, sir,
you'll be leaving in about 15 minutes.

117
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,736
Transport will deliver you
to Philadelphia airport

118
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,932
with your final destination,
Dubois, Wyoming.

119
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,049
Wyoming?

120
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,851
I thought I was on my way
to Colorado, Clifton.

121
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,017
He joined up out in Colorado,
but his parents lived in Wyoming.

122
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,256
That's where his family
wants him buried.

123
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,816
- That all right?
- Of course.

124
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,048
I have PFC Phelps's
personal effects.

125
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,740
We'll now do our
inventory and turnover.

126
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,297
Sir, Phelps's parents are divorced,

127
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,331
so you'll have an extra
flag to present to them.

128
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,214
That way, the mother
and the father will each get one.

129
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,178
If you could make sure everything's
here, then sign the inventory.

130
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,219
I also have a..

131
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,412
letter Phelps's platoon commander
wrote to the family.

132
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,537
Colonel, the mortuary specialist
did the best that he could.

133
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,379
However, these remains
are not recommended for viewing.

134
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,774
It's been my privilege
to care for him, sir.

135
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,929
That's everything, we'll need to make
a final identification before departure.

136
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,328
Sir, I need you to verify that
this is PFC Chance Phelps,

137
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,655
and that you are
ready for departure.

138
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,299
Present arms!

139
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,138
- Feeling okay?
- Yeah yeah. I'm good.

140
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,773
We're almost there.

141
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,091
Do you always do these routes?

142
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,731
I just started six months ago.

143
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,810
Nobody in my family's in the military
and none of my friends.

144
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,376
But I thought about joining up.

145
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,891
Yeah, but I was too chickenshit.

146
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,932
Sorry. I mean too chicken.

147
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,168
You can say shit.

148
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,536
And plus the whole haircut thing.

149
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,139
I'm in a band and..

150
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,968
you know, you got to keep it long
to keep the ladies happy.

151
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,210
What about you?
What's your deal?

152
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,059
My deal? My deal is complicated.

153
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,538
When did you join up?

154
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,334
When I was 17.

155
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,937
My parents had to sign something
because I was underage.

156
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,693
Yeah, that's young.

157
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,449
I know,

158
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,659
but I couldn't bear
the thought of waiting another year.

159
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,131
All I wanted was to be a marine

160
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,734
and I joined up.

161
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,339
You graduate from boot camp,
you think you're on top and you travel

162
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,730
and you see these things
you never thought you'd see.

163
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,771
It's hard, of course, but..

164
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,290
it's fun.

165
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,412
- It's fun?
- Yeah.

166
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,575
I'm serious.

167
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,498
I've got to be honest.

168
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,732
No offense, but..

169
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,734
I don't really get what
we're doing over there.

170
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,529
But..

171
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,132
last summer these two guys
from my high school went,

172
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,209
and one of them ended up
hurt really bad.

173
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,696
And last time I heard, he was
at something Reed hospital.

174
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,458
- Walter Reed.
- Yeah.

175
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,494
The other one,
he didn't make it back.

176
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,971
I just wanted to do something.

177
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,455
Hey, Henry.

178
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,414
How you doin'?

179
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,329
Colonel..

180
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,612
whenever you're ready.

181
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,612
- Will you do me a favor?
- Sure.

182
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,411
- Let the family know
we're thinking of them.

183
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,529
- Will do.

184
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,818
You're a good man, Rich.

185
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,374
- Thanks.
- Be safe.

186
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,499
All right. See ya.

187
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,896
Attention, passengers.
Increased security measures..

188
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,133
Welcome to Northwest Airlines.
ID, please.

189
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,813
I have a voucher.

190
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,213
He's the military escort.
I'll check him in.

191
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,136
I've booked you through to Billings,

192
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,218
but you can get your bags off
in Minneapolis tonight.

193
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,217
I upgraded you to first class

194
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,058
all the way to Billings.

195
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,532
Thanks.
Appreciate that.

196
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,936
Thank you for your service.

197
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,655
Thanks again.

198
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,453
Belt, shoes,
laptop in a separate bin.

199
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,416
All metal out of your pockets.

200
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,416
Sir, your bag needs to go through.

201
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,373
Yeah, you can wand this bag, but
it can't go through the x-ray machine.

202
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,094
Please don't tell me
how to do my job.

203
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,612
The bag can't go through.

204
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,015
Well, it's your call.
It's gonna take you longer.

205
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,058
Bag check, male.

206
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,092
Sir, I need you to remove your jacket
and place it in the bin.

207
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,494
I can't remove the jacket.
You can hand-check me.

208
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,656
- Is there a supervisor around?
- Not right here.

209
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,175
Remove your jacket.
It needs to go through the machine.

210
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,498
I will not remove this jacket
and denigrate this uniform.

211
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,017
You have a lot of metal on your jacket.
It needs to go through the machine.

212
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,378
Take me to a private room

213
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,299
and wand me there.

214
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,419
Turn around, please.

215
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,130
- Excuse me, sir. Are you the escort?
- Yes.

216
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,059
- How you doing?
- All right.

217
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,489
- I need to get down
to the tarmac to watch loading.

218
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,609
- Sure.

219
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,653
- So where you from?
- Colorado originally.

220
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,288
It's a long time
since I've been there.

221
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,218
- You?
- All over.

222
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,418
My old man was career air force,
so we moved around a lot.

223
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,690
- How was that?
- It was all right.

224
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,254
I actually kind of miss it
now that I'm settled here.

225
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,490
We're gonna wait right here.
He's coming around.

226
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,295
Yeah, the moving around is kind of cool
when you're single, and then..

227
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,929
you get married, have kids,
it's a other deal.

228
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,458
You do this escort stuff, mostly?

229
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,168
Me? No, I..
I work in a cubicle.

230
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,700
- I volunteered for this one.
- It must be hard.

231
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,133
- I need to verify.
- Yeah, go ahead.

232
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,172
- You can stand right here if you want.
- Thanks.

233
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,177
- 2A?
- It's right down on your right, sir.

234
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,812
Excuse me. Thank you.

235
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,770
Can I get you something to drink?

236
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,731
Jack daniels rocks, please.

237
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,853
- And for you, sir?
- Water, thank you.

238
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,608
What's the matter?
You on duty or something?

239
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,969
Yes, I am.

240
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,288
Excuse me, sir?

241
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,858
I want you to have this.

242
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,370
It'll be a couple of minutes.
Sorry about the delay.

243
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,411
We're waiting on a conveyor.

244
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,054
But we're gonna get
all the luggage off first,

245
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,939
then we'll remove the remains.

246
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,574
I'd like to keep him separate
from the baggage, if that's possible.

247
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,294
That's the plan. We're not gonna
move him with the rest of the luggage.

248
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,092
All right.
Sounds good.

249
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,052
You know, there's another escort
here from dover.

250
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,497
- I've seen a lot of you guys lately.
- Excuse me.

251
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,889
Evening.

252
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,728
Evening, sir. I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

253
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,455
I got a connecting flight.
How's your trip going so far?

254
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,374
It's been fine.

255
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,779
It's weird though, sir.

256
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,814
They all know,

257
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,090
like, without me telling anyone.

258
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,057
Both at Philadelphia
and so far here in Minneapolis.

259
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,810
I guess they figured it out
by the uniforms.

260
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,931
Yeah, you know,
I've had the same thing,

261
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,129
which is..

262
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,537
okay, because I'm not
really interested in explaining it.

263
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,369
It looks like yours
is coming out now.

264
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,578
Present.. Arms!

265
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,378
Order.. Arms!

266
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,175
When you're ready, we'll go over to the
cargo warehouse and get everything set.

267
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,417
Yeah, okay. Just give me a minute.
I still need to verify.

268
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,329
So what's your
destination, sergeant?

269
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,418
I'm headed to rochester.
It's about 90 miles from here.

270
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,331
My family is meeting us there.

271
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,249
Are you related to
the deceased, son?

272
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,049
Yes, sir.

273
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,179
He's my brother.

274
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,373
Present.. Arms!

275
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,052
Order.. Arms!

276
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,539
Well, you.. Take care of
yourself, son.

277
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,368
Thank you, sir.

278
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,569
You too.

279
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,408
So he can just, stay here all night?

280
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,611
- Yeah.
- There's no need to move him?

281
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,651
Don't worry.
No one's going near him.

282
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,699
When you're ready, we have a taxi
waiting to take you to your hotel.

283
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,817
Actually, I tell you, if I could
just get a chair, i'm all set.

284
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,693
I really don't want
to leave him here alone.

285
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,931
You want to sleep in here?

286
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,893
I need to check with my supervisor.
I'm not sure we're allowed to do that.

287
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,489
Could you?

288
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,614
I know it's late,
but I'd really appreciate it.

289
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,248
I had this in my jeep.

290
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,019
It should be a little
more comfortable than that chair.

291
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,889
Thanks.

292
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,294
- Thanks, I appreciate that.
- Take care.

293
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,169
Good night.

294
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,377
I heard we were
carrying remains today.

295
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,616
- You must be the escort.
- Mike Strobl.

296
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,458
- Tom garrett.
- How you doing, Tom?

297
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,899
Where'd you get that
combat action ribbon?

298
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,209
Desert Storm.

299
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,649
I was flying an A-10
in Desert Storm.

300
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,251
Man, we tore it up over there.

301
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,454
You guys were good.

302
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,770
I was a lieutenant, artillery battalion,
first marine division.

303
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,094
You've been..

304
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,812
back this time around?

305
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,652
No, I'm a numbers cruncher now.

306
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,410
I analyze manpower at Quantico.

307
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,898
Well, I guess you saw
enough action in Kuwait?

308
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,899
No, not so much.

309
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,848
I tell you,
I really miss it some days.

310
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,049
Excuse me.

311
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,849
Thank you.

312
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,409
Thank you.

313
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,373
- Annie.
- Mike.

314
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,099
I guess we're travel mates
for the next few hours.

315
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,018
I have tons of magazines.
I'm happy to share.

316
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,169
Thank you.

317
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,377
HOT SOLDIER SITTING
NEXT TO ME ON PLANE

318
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,373
It's marine, actually.

319
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,014
How embarrassing.

320
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,809
It's okay.

321
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,971
Trust me,
you're a breath of fresh air.

322
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,570
I can't believe how fast you get
with your thumbs on those things.

323
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,659
I have a lot to say.

324
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,017
Welcome to Billings, folks.

325
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,572
I'm going to ask that you
remain seated for a moment.

326
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,648
During this flight,

327
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,689
I've had the honor of carrying
the remains of a fallen marine.

328
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,178
I'm going to inconvenience you
for a few moments

329
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,973
while the escort
disembarks the plane.

330
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,215
- I didn't know. I'm so sorry.
- As you go about your day,

331
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,452
- keep the family in your thoughts.
- It's okay.

332
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,014
Thanks for the company.

333
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,417
Well, I'm off to Cheyenne.

334
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,496
- Thanks for the smooth flying.
- You bet.

335
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,336
What was his name, your marine?

336
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,699
PFC Chance Phelps.

337
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,294
Chance Phelps.

338
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,458
I know the name of every KIA
I've ever carried.

339
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,698
You take care of yourself.

340
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,139
Thanks. You too.

341
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,849
I'm Gary

342
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,812
- from Rafferty's funeral home.
- Gary, Mike Strobl.

343
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,490
It's a real honor to meet you, sir.

344
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,055
I've got a hearse.
It's ready to go.

345
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,696
We should get started as soon as we can.
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

346
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,288
Took me over five hours
to get up here this morning.

347
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,136
I didn't know Chance real well.

348
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,570
I've known his dad for years.

349
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,692
I'm glad he's finally home.

350
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,776
- You must be Major Thompson.
- Yes, sir. Mike Thompson

351
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,777
from I&I 223 down in Salt Lake City.

352
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,095
- Good to meet you, Major.
- Sir.

353
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,419
- I guess you've had a hell of a week?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,737
Sergeant Burton and I drove
all night to get up here on Saturday.

355
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,579
We notified the mother
at zero-two on saturday morning.

356
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,294
I tell you, sir,
I hope to never go through that again.

357
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,732
- So how's the family doing?
- Well, sir, it's kind of hard to say.

358
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,016
Sometimes I think
they're doing OK, but then..

359
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,290
You know. It's hard to say.

360
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,651
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

361
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,896
It's just been a long week, sir.

362
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,853
The VFW Post up in Dubois

363
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,295
is having a get-together tonight
in honor of Chance.

364
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,532
- You might want to come up for that.
- Okay. Sounds good.

365
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,734
- I'm glad you're here, sir.
- Yeah, me too.

366
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,217
Your hotel is up in Dubois,

367
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,932
where the ceremony's gonna be.

368
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,415
You'll want to head out
of here and get settled.

369
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,093
- I'm sorry about all the driving.
- Not a problem, Gary.

370
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,577
If I can get you to sign off
on the paperwork,

371
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,258
then we can call it a day.

372
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,575
That sounds fine.

373
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,812
I have some items the family would like
to have inserted into the casket.

374
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,851
They said they'd prefer
not to view the remains,

375
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,016
so I guess now would be
a good time to do that.

376
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,371
Yeah, that would be good,
and I need to check on his uniform.

377
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,931
You know it's gonna be
a closed-casket funeral?

378
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,659
I understand, but..

379
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,694
just want to make sure
he's squared away.

380
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,735
Okay, go ahead.

381
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,378
Look at that.
He's got six ribbons.

382
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,254
- And he's a PFC, it's amazing.
- Yeah.

383
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,770
The folks at Dover did a great job.

384
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,810
They knew he wasn't gonna be
viewed and his uniform is..

385
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,049
perfect.

386
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,329
I'm gonna..

387
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,732
take care of the paperwork.

388
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,099
If you're ready.

389
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,774
Excuse me, sir.

390
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,336
Are you the marine
who brought Chance home?

391
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,098
Yes, sir.
Mike Strobl.

392
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,215
Semper Fi, colonel.
I'm Charlie Fitts.

393
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,814
Listen, this whole town
is grateful to you.

394
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,539
It was my honor.

395
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,090
Korea?

396
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,451
It's a privilege to meet
an old first marine division warrior.

397
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,129
There's some fellows here
been waiting all night to meet you.

398
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,776
Fellas!

399
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,458
This is Chance's escort,

400
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,970
Colonel Strobl.

401
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,933
Larry Hertzog. Welcome.

402
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,493
- Robert Rouse.
- How are you?

403
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,530
A.V. Scott.

404
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,418
Here we have Gunny Mulcahy,

405
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,939
Chance's recruiter.

406
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,299
And Sergeant Michael Arenz.

407
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,090
He was with Chance when he died.

408
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,569
Sergeant.

409
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,934
Jenny, let's get
this man a cold beer.

410
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,897
He's been on a long and lonely trip.

411
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,419
Did you know Chance?

412
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,337
No, I didn't know him.

413
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,293
You missed out.

414
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,449
Sure did.

415
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,495
You know, a lot of recruits,
myself included,

416
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,373
lose a big part of their personality
when they go through boot camp.

417
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,769
Sort of the point.

418
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,209
But, Chance,
he comes back from boot camp,

419
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,411
he sure as hell was a marine,

420
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,934
but he was still Chance.

421
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,850
Same old wise-ass smile.

422
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,693
He could get away with anything
just by flashing that grin.

423
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,855
Our first mortar attack in Ramadi,

424
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,059
everybody's yelling,
"Grab your kevlars! Grab your flaks!"

425
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,694
We were all scared, you know?
Like, "welcome to Iraq."

426
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,135
Everybody's running,
trying to get to the bunker.

427
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,096
Phelps,

428
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,780
he's got his shower shoes on,
grabs his rifle, runs outside,

429
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,379
he's like, "where they at?"

430
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,572
Everybody's yelling, "Phelps, get
your ass back in here, man! Take cover!"

431
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,537
He's still standing outside

432
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,133
in his shower shoes.

433
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,013
If you guys would excuse us,
we need to head out.

434
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,496
We're building something special
to take him up to the cemetery tomorrow.

435
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,816
- Anything I can do?
- I think you've done enough.

436
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,095
- Colonel, good night. Thank you.
- Good night.

437
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,012
The convoy's moving along,

438
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,734
doing a routine patrol
south of Baghdad, and..

439
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,535
Chance wasn't even supposed
to be there that day.

440
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,694
It was his rest day.

441
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,378
And knowing we were going out,
he just had to come.

442
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,088
Chance was up in the turret
looking out for trouble.

443
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,369
That was his spot.

444
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,216
The most dangerous job
a marine can have.

445
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,535
Yeah, you're totally
exposed up there.

446
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,773
He loved it though.

447
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,058
It always made me feel safe

448
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,653
seeing those shoes there.

449
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,536
In Iraq, Chance was just a big old pair
of size-12 shoes looking out for us.

450
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,529
Anyhow, we were driving along.

451
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,572
Suddenly there's this huge boom.

452
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,977
Out of nowhere, an IED had gone off
in the front of the convoy, so..

453
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,018
I jump out, check on the rest
of the vehicles, and..

454
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,495
It was madness.

455
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,211
There was bullets flying everywhere.

456
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,336
It was chaos,
just total chaos, but..

457
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,449
I could hear behind me
Chance's 240 opening up,

458
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,219
just unleashing an ungodly
amount of fire on the mujahideen.

459
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,770
So I thought, "okay,
that part of the convoy's okay."

460
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,452
He attracted all the fire to himself

461
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,730
so that the rest of us
could take cover,

462
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,259
get organized and get out.

463
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,495
So after I checked on
the first two vehicles,

464
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,815
I run back towards
our vehicle, and..

465
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,016
I could see Chance was
shooting all over the place.

466
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,216
He was up in the air, everywhere.

467
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,813
Just erratic, you know?

468
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,208
I yelled at him.
I was like, "Jesus, Phelps,"

469
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,212
"don't shoot the birds, man."

470
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,574
I thought he was trying
to scare them or something.

471
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,811
His finger was still
on the trigger, shooting,

472
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,817
but his head was slumped over.

473
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,853
I got a little bit closer, I could see
some blood coming down of his head.

474
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,697
Inside the vehicle,
Doc checked his vitals, and..

475
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,253
he was gone.

476
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,568
Six of us..

477
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,294
held him in our hands
all the way back to the base.

478
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,173
I just keep running it,
you know, in my mind, like,

479
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,292
"What could I have done better?
What could I have done different?"

480
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,290
What do you say to somebody's mom
when they tell you,

481
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,729
"it's not your fault.
You couldn't have done anything."

482
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,138
I owed it to him to save him.

483
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,693
I'm the one who trained him.

484
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,415
I just can't believe
that I'm here and he's not.

485
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,538
I'm glad you're here, Sergeant.

486
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,295
Thank you, sir.

487
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,051
It means a lot coming from you.

488
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,495
He'd be so honored knowing
such a senior officer brought him home.

489
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,252
- Sir.
- Sergeant.

490
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,049
What that kid has to live with.

491
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,739
I should've been over there.

492
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,374
- It wasn't your time, Colonel.
- It was exactly my time.

493
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,172
I knew the clock was ticking,

494
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,333
knew my time was coming up.

495
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,735
But I just..

496
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,292
kept ignoring it, you know?

497
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,775
Except for the middle
of the night, when I..

498
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,330
would check
those casualty lists, just..

499
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,495
praying that I didn't recognize
any of the names.

500
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,896
I don't know, you know, I just..

501
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,809
I just got..

502
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,376
used to seeing my wife and kids

503
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,219
every day, and..

504
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,300
So I put in a request
for another office tour,

505
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,619
and it was granted.

506
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,338
They must've needed you here.

507
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,289
My friends went.

508
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,696
Guys I was in
Desert Storm with went.

509
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,014
I stayed home.

510
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,173
I was trained to fight.

511
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,018
If I'm not over there, what am I?

512
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,935
Those guys,

513
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,099
guys like Chance..

514
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,094
They're marines.

515
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,578
And you think you're not?

516
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,171
Want to be with
your family every night.

517
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,530
You think you have to justify that?

518
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,977
You'd better stop right there, sir.

519
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,733
You've brought Chance home.

520
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,298
You're his witness now.

521
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,659
Without a witness,

522
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,173
they just disappear.

523
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,259
You're Chance's escort?

524
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,294
- Mike Strobl.
- John Phelps, Chance's dad.

525
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,657
This is my wife, Chris,
Chance's step-mom.

526
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:03,735
Welcome.

527
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,499
- And Chance's step-dad Jeff.
- Colonel.

528
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,417
And this is Chance's sister Kelley,

529
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,730
- and her fiance Rob.
- Hello, sir.

530
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,733
I'm Chance's mother.

531
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,019
Thank you for your service.

532
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,414
It's my honor, ma'am.

533
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,977
I'm just so sorry for your loss.

534
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,328
Please come and sit.

535
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,289
A chair.

536
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,538
- Thank you.
- Come on, dear.

537
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,495
First, I..

538
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,893
want you all to know that..

539
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,019
all along the way,

540
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,216
Chance was treated with dignity

541
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,490
and respect

542
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,969
and honor.

543
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,898
I have here a letter from..

544
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,617
Chance's platoon commander.

545
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,249
Thank you.

546
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,819
I also have here

547
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,699
some of Chance's things.

548
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,537
It's still set on Baghdad time.

549
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:40,810
Here.

550
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,096
This is the medal
that grandma gave him.

551
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,849
Remember?

552
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,334
I want you to know

553
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,856
you do not mourn alone today.

554
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,699
All across America,

555
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,135
from Virginia

556
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,369
to Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota,

557
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,452
Montana, Wyoming,

558
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,975
people are thinking of you

559
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,053
and praying for you.

560
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,694
You should know that

561
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,294
Chance has touched

562
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,729
many people.

563
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,813
There's one more thing
that I'd like you to have.

564
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,329
A flight attendant in Philadelphia
handed this to me, and..

565
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,969
it seemed like it was
very special to her. I was..

566
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,330
going to keep it as
a reminder of the trip,

567
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,973
but then I realized that..

568
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,173
she wasn't giving it to me.

569
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,213
She was giving it to you.

570
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,137
April 9th, 2004..

571
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,490
To the family of PFC Chance Phelps.

572
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,258
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Phelps,

573
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,893
I'm sure by now you have
learned of Chance's death.

574
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,977
I don't have the words to tell you

575
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,250
how sorry I am for your loss.

576
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,537
Chance meant the world to me

577
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,128
and to all of us here
in the second platoon.

578
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,214
I know parents aren't supposed
to have favorites, but..

579
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,740
trust me, platoon commanders do.

580
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,297
Chance was a unique character.

581
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,850
Where most marines would
put in shows of false bravado,

582
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,414
Chance would quietly attend
to his business,

583
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,856
and he led to get people
to underestimate him.

584
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,936
His quick smile and friendly manner

585
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,210
were always disarming and warming,

586
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,452
but there was no mistaking.

587
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,730
He was as fierce in battle
as he was gentle in friendship.

588
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,009
Please be seated.

589
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,690
We are here to honor the life
of Private First Class

590
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,859
Chance Russell Phelps.

591
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,250
.. please know
that he died a hero,

592
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,493
but more importantly,

593
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,574
he lived a hero.

594
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,695
It's ironic,

595
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,095
but I am certain that if the world
had more men like Chance Phelps

596
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,133
there wouldn't be a need
for a marine corps.

597
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,809
Fire.

598
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,409
Ready,

599
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,129
aim,

600
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,654
fire.

601
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,539
From the president of the US
and commandant of the marine corps

602
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,015
and a grateful nation,
please accept this flag

603
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,416
as a token of your son's faithful
service to his country. Semper Fidelis.

604
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,895
From the president of the US,
the commandant of the marine corps

605
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,090
and a grateful nation,
please accept this flag

606
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,575
for your son's honorable
and faithful service to his country.

607
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,894
Semper Fidelis.

608
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:03,976
Thank you.

609
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,410
Put your cell phones
in the tray, please.

610
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,053
Can I ask you to step up?

611
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,538
Remove your shoes.

612
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,139
Chance Phelps was
wearing his St. Christopher medal

613
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,057
when he was killed on good friday.

614
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,888
Eight days later,

615
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,290
I handed the medallion
to his mother.

616
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:36,093
I watched them carry him
the final 15 yards.

617
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,535
I felt that..

618
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,692
as long as he was still moving,

619
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,011
he was somehow still alive.

620
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,491
When they put him down in his grave,

621
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,374
he'd stopped moving.

622
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,653
I didn't know Chance Phelps
before he died.

623
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,295
But today..

624
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,529
I miss him.

625
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,217
Come here. Group hug.

626
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,808
How you guys doing?

627
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,200
