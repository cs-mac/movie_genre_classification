1
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,696
Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...

2
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,034
howmuch he loves him?

3
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:08,369
He's never able to embrace him
and sayl love you my son'?

4
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,137
Andthe mother?

5
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:14,784
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.

6
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,287
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

7
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,054
No one can fathomthe amount of love
that amother has for her son...

8
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,827
not eventhe mother.

9
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,064
Because there is no measure
for amother's love.

10
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,060
lt's an emotion
that can only be felt...

11
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,059
amother's emotion.

12
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,066
Rahul, my son... my life!

13
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,538
The match between Woodstock
lnternational and Manor House...

14
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,504
is at a very interestingturn.
5runs and one ball...

15
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,539
Can Woodstock lnternational's9-year
victory spell be broken in just aball?

16
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,947
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...

17
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,443
...andthe two batsmen
take their positions.

18
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,580
The excitement amongthe students
is rising.

19
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,386
The tension is mounting.

20
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,556
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball...Will Rohan do it?

21
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,797
lt's up to Rohanto break.

22
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,727
Woodstock lnternational's nine-year
spell of victory... Seems impossible.

23
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,798
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.

24
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,869
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

25
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,628
lf youwant to be someone in life,
if youwant to achieve something...

26
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,632
if youwant to win,
always listento your heart.

27
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,774
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers,

28
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,045
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

29
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,714
Andthen youwill cross
allthe hurdles...

30
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,448
allyour problems willvanish...
victory will be yours.

31
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,519
Only yours.

32
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,423
Hey, Mom and Dad...
l won l won...

33
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,717
l was the Man of the match...
Hey Dad,...

34
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,063
l watchedyou on CNN.
You looked great.

35
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,659
Nowl know where l get
my good looks from.

36
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,733
Anyway, l have just completed
my finalterm and...

37
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:08,504
l'm coming home for Diwali.
Can't wait to see you guys.

38
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,396
Lots of Love, Rohan.

39
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,009
P.s., P.s... Before l come home
my two favourite girlfriends.

40
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,355
Hardwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Hardwar?

41
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,020
My two grandmothers...
maternal and paternal!

42
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,215
...8 a.m.

43
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,997
Are youwatchingthe photograph and
crying again?

44
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,996
Where am l crying?

45
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,995
Of course not...
Where are you crying?

46
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,133
That's one truth andthe other one is
thatyou are very young...

47
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,668
Stop jokingwith me
early inthe morning...

48
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,805
What's the matter, Lajoji?

49
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,004
l remember Rahul
very oftenthese days.

50
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,811
Even l remember him.

51
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,409
But inthe last few days...

52
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,415
l have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

53
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,814
But why?

54
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,750
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.

55
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,618
Speak for yourself... l have
along life ahead... Touchwood!

56
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes...
But l have to reach God's abode...

57
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,325
How will l face Himthere?

58
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,833
How will l explainthe reason, why
l couldn't unite my scattered family?

59
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,033
That l couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

60
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,704
How will l showmy face to Him?

61
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,208
Don't worry about it.

62
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,605
You are not goingto meet God anyway...
- Why?

63
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,780
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...

64
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,516
God... again your jokes
early inthe morning...

65
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:07,985
Hey you sweethearts...

66
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,485
Rohan!

67
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,089
Naani.
- My child.

68
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,991
What's the matter, Naani?
You look very sexy.

69
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,997
l know. Everyone says the same thing.

70
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,738
May you live long.

71
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,675
You have become very weak my son.

72
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,549
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

73
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,418
Oh!Just Shut up now.

74
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,821
What's the matter, Naani?
- What happened? ls she crying?

75
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,123
Then it's fine. l getvery worried
when she doesn't weep.

76
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,365
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop ityoutwo...

77
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,368
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.

78
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,716
Your tears will raise alot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...

79
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,052
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

80
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,055
What do l do Kaur?
What do l do?

81
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:17,056
Whenever l see Rohan,
l think of Rahul even more

82
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,793
Don'tyouthink we should
tell him everything?

83
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,067
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

84
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,897
Rohan was not even intown
when Rahul left home...

85
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,066
He doesn't know anything.

86
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,476
l think we should
tell him everything.

87
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,341
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

88
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:41,073
He doesn't even knowthat Rahulwas
not bornto Yash and Nandini.

89
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,484
He was adopted.

90
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:03,300
Rahulwas two days oldwhen
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

91
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,167
His tiny footsteps made aplace
in all our hearts.

92
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:30,727
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.

93
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,371
Nine years later,
when youwere born...

94
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:40,070
we felt that
our family was now complete.

95
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,742
l still remember
the astrologer sayingthat...

96
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,618
you fought destiny to be born.

97
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,089
Youwould be our strength.

98
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,622
Did Rahul bhaiyyaknow
that he was...?

99
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,696
Rahulwas eightyears old
when he got to know.

100
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,059
That was when Yash decidedthat...

101
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,731
the matter would never be mentioned
again inthe house...

102
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,060
Never again...

103
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,507
Rahulwas our son.
The eldest son of the house.

104
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,070
lt was atruththat could
never be changed.

105
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,076
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.

106
00:12:55,118 --> 00:13:02,820
Andthat was Rahul's last Diwaliwith
his family... Last Diwali.

107
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,212
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat...

108
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,851
that nothing fits you anymore.

109
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,619
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

110
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:45,866
''lt's allyour blessings''

111
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,639

112
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:01,482
''We shall never part,
through smiles or throughtears.''

113
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:51,057
''l feelyou in every breath
of mine...''

114
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:56,062
''my life is but under your shadow''

115
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,802
''l feelyou in every breath
of mine...''

116
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:07,008
''my life is but under your shadow''

117
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:12,344
''l pray to thee as long as l live''

118
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:17,823
''lt's allyour boons...
Whether smiles or tears''

119
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:24,027
''We shall never part...
through smiles nor throughtears''

120
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:10,163
''We light the lamps of love
atyour feet''

121
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,807
''We see you everywhere
in everythingwe see''

122
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:49,907
''Our lips chant no name butyours''

123
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:54,715
''Let our hearts be filled
with nothing butyour love''

124
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,186
''lt's allyour boons...
whether smiles or tears''

125
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,989
We shall never part...
through smiles nor throughtears''

126
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,435
Hey maa... How do you always sense
my presence much before l arrive?

127
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,607
Rahul...just tell me one thing...
Emails, letters, faxes...

128
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,082
l sentyou all of these andyou
didn't reply to any...very rude.

129
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,352
MBA is atough job, Naina!

130
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,719
Was it only MBA that keptyou busy?
Or was there something else?

131
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,885
l mean someone else.

132
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,092
Well... lt was more than just

133

137
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:12,570
Rahul, l don't think anyone other than
me can waste her time with you.

138
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,917
ln any case what do you know
what to do with a girl.

139
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,047
Oh really?
ls this done with a girl?

140
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,055
Stop it Rahul...
- Tell me...

141
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,621
Didyou remember me at all?

142
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:27,562
Should l tellyouthe truth or lie?
- Lie...

143
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:32,127
lf l have to lie then l'd say l did...
not remember you at all...

144
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,229
How sweet!

145
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,068
Are you stillthe same or is

Really?
- Really.

151
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,857
Don't bet onthat.

152
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,838
Yes....yes....

God, bhaiyya...l think
lndiais goingto kill England.

156
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,819
Anything can happen
at the last minute.

157
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,060
You can't bank onthemtoo much.
You never know with lndia, Rohan.

158
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,792
Here...take this...
Out Out...Whats the big deal?

159
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,531
Englandwas out of lndiain 1947.

160
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,063
DJ...that was a PJ...

161
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,833
Oh Allah...
What are these? Legs or...?

162
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,870
He still hasn't learnt
howto tie his shoe laces?

163
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,508
So what? He's a childyet...
He'll learn...

164
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,805
But if you don't allowhimto do it
himself, how will he learn? Fatty.

165
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,677
Why didyou come back from London?

166
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,875
What's happening here?

167
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,882
Mom you have over fed Rohan and
turned him into apumpkin.

168
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,885
Yes, yes please laugh at me...
When l go away to...

169
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:05,093
the boarding schoolyouwill all
remember me. Nobody loves me.

170
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,825
By the way Fatty...
Mother loves me more than you.

171
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,733
- DJ...Just look at him.
- Calm down. He's jealous of you.

172
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,766
Mom, l missedyou.
- l missedyoutoo, baby.

173
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:19,803
Youwon't leave me again
and go, willyou?

174
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,045
l won't, but promise me, youwill not
feed me the way you, this pumpkin.

175
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,050
Nandini! Nandini!

176
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,216
Yes... Coming.

177
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,488
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

178
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,857
Who will knot this tie?
- Can'tyou do eventhat without me?

179
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:53,064
Here... Now youtruly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

180
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,037
This's for you my son.

181
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,039
Fromtoday, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

182
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,957
Oops, Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

183
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:13,010
You know Rahul,
Thirty years ago he said...

184
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:17,748
certainthings to me inthis chamber,
which l will nowrepeat to you.

185
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,532
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.

186
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,029
You must always choose
the one that is right...

187
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,602
the one where you don't have to
bend...where you don't fall.

188
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,775
Never take a step in life...

189
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,443
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.

190
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:44,043
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.

191
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,059
l have not forgotten
his words tilltoday.

192
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,361
Even you should not.

193
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,003
Promise me thatyouwill follow
the traditions of the family.

194
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,008
Promise me thatyou'll never compromise
withthe self-respect of our family.

195
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:18,877
l promise papa...

196
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,256
that l will always keep
the family name flying high.

197
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,029
l promise youthat l will always
keep you happy... always Papa

198
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,036
We have won.

199
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,413
Pooja, Pooja
- What happened?

200
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,544
We have wonthe match.

201
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,046
God, Sachin played so well...
100 runs not out.

202
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,058
Ok nowlisten, take care
of the shop l will be back.

203
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,849
Haldiraaam!

204
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,329
What a game!
What a game!What a game!

205
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,125
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

206
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,570
lndiahas wonthe match!
- Oh so we have won... Hownice.

207
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,668
lf you didn't know,
what were you dancing for?

208
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,569
l was dancing because
allthe laddoos...

209
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,812
that my wife made
have been sold.

210
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,740
Sold out? How come?

211
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,879
There was a customer who told me
he wantedto eat laddoos...

212
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,280
that would drive him crazy.

213
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,922
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane and...

214
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:30,022
those who are normal become...
- Clean bowled!

215
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,251
lt was just ajoke...
- Stop it now...

216
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,019
Haven't even started ityet...
- Come on...

217
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:37,832
Rukhsar!
- Stop shouting so loudly...

218
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,194
The groom's side has come to
see Rukhsar for marriage.

219
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,404
Sit down. Salute them.

220
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,836
Grandmom...wake up...
the bride has arrived.

221
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,777
Oh! MashaAllah MashaAllah...

222
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,051
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

223
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,714
She is just what l had imagined.

224
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,422
Well... it's not me... its...
This is my daughter, Rukhsar.

225
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,651
What? Fever?

226
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,792
Not fever... mother,
She's Rukhsar!

227
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,226
Oh Rukhsar!

228
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,768
What happen?
- We have wonthe match.

229
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,007
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

230
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,402
We have won.
- Allah!What happened?

231
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,202
Quiet and introverted... eh?

232
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:28,016
lncidentally, what is her age?

233
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:30,852
Hundred.
- Grandmom, she says...

234
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,816
- she's hundredyears old.
- What? Nine years old?

235
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:37,424
She's goingto turntwenty-one soon.
- Well...the blossoming of youth.

236
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,824
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk,

237
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,026
l guess... anyway l forgot to
tellyou, my son's name is Ashfaque.

238
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,200
Sachin!
- Sachin?

239
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,029
Sachin? ln case there's
someone else in her life....

240
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,403
No! No! Please don't say suchthings.

241
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:58,376
lt's.... her uncle Sachin...
her late uncle Sachin.

242
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,109
She was very attachedto him.

243
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,350
She always remembers
him on happy occassions.

244
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:06,310
Sachin...
Poor Sachin...

245
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:14,992
C'mon you girls...
l'llteach you alesson...

246
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,996
Oh God, ls everything alright?

247
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,597
Forget about me...
Ask me what she hasn't.

248
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,132
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

249
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,373
What?

250
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,341
180 by 100...
your blood pressure is high.

251
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,173
You mean BP is high-wigh!

252
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,512
Yes, it's high and it's
why' because of you.

253
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,406
l have just increasedthe dosage.
Please get these medicines.

254
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:40,021
Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.
- This won't do...

255
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,482
Yes, Aunty...he just doesn't
take care of himself.

256
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,826
You just keep quiet...
l don't want to talkto you...

257
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,824
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

258
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:51,891
Oh! l wasn't serious at all.
l was just joking.

259
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,600
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...

260
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,531
Aren't they like my childrentoo?
Anyway, leave allthis aside.

261
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,805
The good news is that
they likedthis mad girl...

262
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,046
they have acceptedthe proposal.
- They have accepted?

263
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,111
Didn't they see you properly?

264
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:10,385
Shut up!

265
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,110
So youwill leave us and go...?

266
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,390
Some day allyou girls have to leave.

267
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,792
No way am l leaving
my father and going anywhere.

268
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,061
Even l'm not going.
- So then should l leave?

269
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,795
Why do you speak like this, father?

270
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,191
Some day you have to get married,
my child.

271
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,069
The only prayer
l have to the Lord is that...

272
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,401
the man you marry must
love you even more than l do.

273
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,075
C'mon...

274
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,635
l don't think such
aman exists inthis world...

275
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,079
Am l not there?

276
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,078
You did not eat, dance or eventalk
to anyone at the party tonight.

277
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,350
You didn't eventell me
howbeautiful l looktonight.

278
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,077
You look very beautiful, Naina.

279
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,084
Really? How sweet!

280
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,326
l'm sweet and l also lie very well.

281
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,325
Just go...
- No.

282
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,299
Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.

283
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,768
Are you lying or tellingthe truth?
- What do youthink?

284
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,430
l think...
- What do youthink?

285
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,296
l think Rahul...
- What do youthink?

286
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,233
Rahul, l think you should go now.

287
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,773
ln any case l wasn't planningto come
with you. But thanks for the offer.

288
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,448
Bye... l was lyingto you.

289
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,725
What's happening, Mom?

290
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:36,063
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

291
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,970
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.

292
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:43,074
That's because there's already
so much inthere.

293
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,807
Rahul, How come you are
back so early?

294
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,584
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.

295
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,884
Really?

296
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,748
lnthat case you have not taken
after your father inthese matters.

297
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,619
He usedto love such parties...

298
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,824
because there usedto be
alot of girls there...

299
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,198
Nandini

300
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,766
He usedto getvery happy
watchingthose girls.

301
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,596
Nandiniji...lf l hadn't
watchedthose beautiful girls...

302
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:13,205
how would l have foundyou?
- What didyou do?

303
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,177
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...

304
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:21,048
When he sawher for the first time
he was very pleased...

305
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,520
And said, he approved of her.

306
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,789
But he saidwe would have
to ask for dowry.

307
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,725
He insistedthat the girl should
bring from her parents' house...

308
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,223
lots of love and along,
long ladder.

309
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,062
lt's a great tradition.

310
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,598
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.

311
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,074
One can't trust these mad children.

312
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,574
No, Mataji... Allthat was then.

313
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,883
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed, Nandini.

314
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,752
But these days children make
their choices themselves...

315
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,615
Nothing has changed, Nandini.

316
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,756
What l meant was...
- Nothing has changed.

317
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,023
But...
- l said it... didn't l?

318
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,226
That's it!

319
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:23,042
Your beauty is goingto steal
his sleep inthe nights...

320
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,207
Shut up!
- You shut up!

321
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,880
Where is your Ashfaque?

322
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,614

327
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,049
Stop this coy bride act now...

328
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,861
By the way,
what does he do in Lucknow?

329
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,791
He is apoet.
- A poet?

330
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,861
Then l'll get
alongvery wellwith him.

331
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,727
Really? Why?

332
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,729
That's because l write
abit of poetry myself.

333
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,867
A ha... Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

334
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,872
Let me say a fewlines...
- Go on... Go on.

335
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,581
What heartache have
l gone through for thee...

336
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:03,284
What heartache have
l gone through for thee...

337
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,846
On one end is Rukhsar and
the other is Aunteee...

338
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,485
Shut up, you brat.

339
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,023

Really? Andwhat did she say?
- She agreed.

347
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,775
But now you make sure that
you don't mess things up.

348

Where has Bhaiiya gone?

Let me say a couplet.

372
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:33,220
So what if the evilwishes harm...
nothing can happen

373
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:40,193
The only willthat truimphs

Eh, Laddoo...
You can't enter Chandni Chowk.

377
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,081
Why?

378
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:56,050
And if youwant to enter,
you have to say this:

379
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:58,386
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty on
amoonlit night in Chandni Chowk

380
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,712
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni... Say it fast.

381
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,316
What exactly am l supposedto say?

382
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,787
Never mind... You don't say...
Can l say another one?

383
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:15,167
Love is not an easy path,

384
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:20,667
lt's atrial by fire
to be crossed bravely.

00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:39,424

388
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,758
So you call her
Daijaan' lovingly... eh?

Have you heard of the Raichands?
How couldyou have heard of them?

Can't do it.

And maybe l will never be able to

432
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,435
there's no one inthis world

513
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:11,745
These are the same goons

514
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,759
Hey, you speak Hindi, don'tyou?

515

But what was the need for
her to go into the school?

520
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:58,859
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

521
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,862
She just enteredthe school...
not murdered anyone.

522
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:03,999
What was the need for them
to say allthose things?

523
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,173
lf l was there l would have caught
each one of them and bashedthem up.

524
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,339
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

525
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:11,745
Let me meet that
Laddoo andthat Fattoo...

You don't know, Bauji...
Can never find place near the Lord...

Come on, say Sorry now.

Besides, Someone has told me that...

548
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,176
apologising doesn't make
anyone smaller.

549
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:28,017
Andthe one who forgives
owns abig heart.

lsn't it?

551

No one loves me

571
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:55,034

608
01:00:58,565 --> 01:01:01,033
Twins?

the other with alarge pocket
to pay the bills.

610
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:12,045
Let them be.
They look nice.

611
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:21,049
Bangles?Fair are my wrists...

617
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:43,065
What l want to say is that
l can't give youwhatyouwant.

618
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,803
Why not?
- l just can't.

619
01:01:46,113 --> 01:01:47,637
At least give it atry.

622
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:54,082
Lord save me!Why would
Bauji give you our shop?

623
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:57,685
What's the big....? Shop?

Our Bharat Sweetmeat shop, which else?
- What shop are youtalking about?

625
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:04,360
lt was alright till friendship but
what is allthis intimacy about?

626
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:08,193
You sneahed in my house.
Lord save me, eventhat is over.

627
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,537
After allthere's alimit
to friendship, isn't there?

628
01:02:13,073 --> 01:02:14,040
Shut up!

629
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,478
There are many bonds
other than friendship.

630
01:02:19,846 --> 01:02:24,044
Bonds that we don't understand...
that we don't needto understand.

631
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:27,377
l hope it's not hurtingyou.

632
01:02:28,522 --> 01:02:32,219
Bonds that are nameless...
that are just to be experienced.

633
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:35,855
l hope it's not hurtingyou.

634
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:39,058
Bonds that don't
have any boundaries...

635
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,058
no limits.
l hope it's not hurtingyou.

636
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:48,074
Bonds that bindthe
hearts together...

637
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:52,306
bonds of passion...
bonds of love.

638
01:02:56,116 --> 01:03:01,349
Hurtyou? ...Me too!

639
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,027

She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

674
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:25,060
She makes strange faces,
she talks alot.

675
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:29,068
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

676
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:33,072
Andwherever she goes
she breaks a vase apot

677
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:35,474
Pot?
- That's what she calls them.

678

But whenever l'm next to her,
l don't know what happens to me.

679
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:45,818
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,076
Mad.

681
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:51,886

Have you spokento Rahul
about this?

685
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:06,772
What's the needto speakto Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

686
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,040
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
of this house... our house!

687
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:18,447
DJ...Who will do all

01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,074
Dad, Why can't l stay with
all of you here?

689
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,406
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

690
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,881
Traditions, my child...

691
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,544
Your grandfather went there,
l did, so did bhaiyya.

692
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,354
You can't breakthe traditions
of the house, can you?

693
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:56,522
No...

694

Always remember
one more thing...

695
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,298
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

You have given me so much already...
l can't take allthese.

01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:04,036
''Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord''

759
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:08,778
''Oh lord,
this young man oh my lord''

760
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:13,044
''Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord''

761
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,216
Agreed!

762
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:21,326
Agreed!

763
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:42,871
Agreed!
- Even l agree.

764
01:20:47,687 --> 01:20:50,349
You love her don'tyou?
- Yes, Papa.

765
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:53,084
Didn't l tellyou, Nandini?
What did l tellyou?

766
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,096
l'm very happy,
today Rahul...very happy.

767
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:00,832
Just promise me that
youwill keep her happy too.

768
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:01,895
Youwill keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

769
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,035
Youwill keep Naina very happy.

770
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,063
You face has fallen as
if we are already married.

771
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:34,763
By the way this expression appears
only after aman gets married.

772
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,071
Eh Rahul, What's the matter?

773
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:44,804
What's her name?

774
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:46,638
Naina!

775
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:50,811
l wishthat was the name.
But it isn't.

776
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:57,081
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!

777
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,026
Ever since l can remember
l have lovedyou...

778
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:07,025
lovedyouvery much.
But it isn'tyour fault.

779
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:13,937
Just because l dreamt of marryingyou
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

780
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,836
And if you are worried
that l will miserable...

781
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,836
yes l will be.

782
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,808
l will feelvery bad...
it will hurt

783
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:27,041
alot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?

784
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,050
Perhaps a few years from now
l can laugh at the fact that...

785
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,785
l loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

786
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:44,730
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

787
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,070
But do me a favour Rahul.

788
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,081
Please complete your love story.

789
01:22:58,184 --> 01:23:00,675
Youwill, won'tyou Rahul?
For my sake.

790
01:23:05,057 --> 01:23:09,016
Now say something quickly
before l cry more.

791
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:12,360
Even me.

792
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:36,050
Raichand.

793
01:23:40,226 --> 01:23:44,322
The name andthe respect has been
givento us by our ancestors.

794
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:52,401
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.

795
01:23:54,974 --> 01:24:00,742
And l will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming ahurdle...

796
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,014
in performingthat duty.

797
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:08,809
You didn't eventhink once...

798
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:16,424
about the background of the girl,
her status... her breeding.

799
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:21,831
You didn't give athought to whether
the girlwill be able to understand...

800
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:23,694
our culture... our traditions.

801
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:27,863
Willthe girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?

802
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,835
Willthe girl understand our
ethics and principles?

803
01:24:33,812 --> 01:24:35,712
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

804
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:37,040
Will she...?

805
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:43,410
How didyou even dare to think
that she can be apart of our family?

806
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:48,291
That she can be a
part of my family?

807
01:24:51,263 --> 01:24:53,060
How didyouthink?

808
01:24:56,669 --> 01:25:01,003
Where did l think, Papa?
l didn't think at all.

809
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:09,345
l just loved...love.

810
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:12,276
Love?

811
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:24,359
lt's such apity that. l made
amistake in knowing my own son

812
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,035
l thought he knewme.

813
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,639
That he understands
the traditions of this family.

814
01:25:35,074 --> 01:25:37,770
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath of mine.

815
01:25:43,082 --> 01:25:48,714
l was so wrong... so wrong.

816
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:57,796
l was really proud of you.

817
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,990
Youwere my self-respect.
Youwere my strength.

818
01:26:05,604 --> 01:26:12,009
You have taken allthat away
from me... everything.

819
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,208
You have hurt me,

820
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:25,819
You have hurt me.

821
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,058
l never wantedto hurtyou.

822
01:27:03,362 --> 01:27:05,330
l only wantedto bringyou happiness.

823
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,001
What have l done?

824
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,674
How could l bringtears to your eyes?

825
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,674
How could l bringtears?

826
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:24,546
Don't ever forgive me.

827
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,820
Please don't say that
l have hurtyou.

828
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,754
Don't forgive me.

829
01:27:36,061 --> 01:27:38,689
l will do as you say
just as you say.

830
01:28:28,413 --> 01:28:30,005
Bauji... Bauji...

831
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:33,351
Please don't leave us and go.

832
01:28:35,053 --> 01:28:37,453
Get up Bauji...
Don't leave us, Bauji...

833
01:29:13,692 --> 01:29:15,660
Willthe girl be able to understand
our culture, our traditions.

834
01:29:16,495 --> 01:29:18,554
Willthe girl ever understand our
rituals... our rites?

835
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:20,992
Willthe girl understand
our ethics and principles?

836
01:29:21,366 --> 01:29:23,334
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

837
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:03,432
Today...

838
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:15,536
today you have provedthat
you are not my blood.

839
01:31:31,496 --> 01:31:33,464
You are not my blood.

840
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:49,078
You have provedthat
you are not mine.

841
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:53,885
Papa!

842
01:31:56,188 --> 01:31:58,315
You have lost the right
to call me that!

843
01:32:06,064 --> 01:32:13,766
Made me a stranger in amoment.
Made me a stranger in just amoment.

844
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,736
Does that mean l have no
place inthis house anymore?

845
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,399
l am right... am l not, mother?

846
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:58,076
l'm right, am l not?

847
01:34:04,049 --> 01:34:10,477
Then let me go... Can l go?

848
01:34:17,062 --> 01:34:19,758
''Through smiles or throughtears''

849
01:34:20,732 --> 01:34:27,365
''We shall never part,
through smiles nor throughtears''

850
01:35:04,843 --> 01:35:10,008
''My blessings live with you...''

851
01:35:10,749 --> 01:35:16,016
''to protectyou from evil eyes''

852
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:22,022
''My wishes for you...''

853
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:26,330
''wherever you go''

854
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:34,369
''May happiness and joy,
kiss your feet forever''

855
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,768
''lt's allyour blessings''

856
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:43,712
''Whether smiles or tears,
we shall never part''

857
01:35:44,349 --> 01:35:47,716
''through smiles or throughtears''

858
01:36:17,716 --> 01:36:25,020
Promise me thatyouwill never let
tears come to his eyes...promise me.

859
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:40,701
Now go!

860
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:47,035
Rahul...we didn't take
blessings from father.

861
01:36:48,413 --> 01:36:53,043
we don't have father's blessings...
Rahulwe didn't...

862
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:17,003
Go Sayeeda.
Go with my son.

863
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:20,000
Wherever he goes...

864
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:24,777
l don't want himto miss the warmth
of amother's affection.

865
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:29,612
lf youwant to be someone in life...
if youwant to achieve something...

866
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:33,024
lf youwant to win,
always listento your heart.

867
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,027
And if eventhat doesn't
give you any answers...

868
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:43,026
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

869
01:37:44,803 --> 01:37:51,641
Andthen youwill cross allthe hurdles
allyour problems willvanish.

870
01:37:53,078 --> 01:37:55,546
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

871
01:37:59,084 --> 01:38:00,984
Youwill remember allthis,
won'tyou Rohan?

872
01:38:01,419 --> 01:38:06,186
Why are you going, Bhaiyya?
Why? Please don't go.

873
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,657
Promise me Rohanthat after today

Get selected inthe cricket team.

877
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:56,774

882
01:41:22,253 --> 01:41:24,551
You have forgotten me

883
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:53,576
Where is Rohan?

01:43:26,978 --> 01:43:29,640
After that...Where?
-America... Didn'tyou just say?

913
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,948
And in between?

Wonder where these people come from.

What place are youtalking about?
-What place? Where?

919
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:47,392
Silence! Come here.

920
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,828
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

921
01:43:52,203 --> 01:43:55,172
She has gone to London.
Someday even l will go there.

922
01:44:07,218 --> 01:44:08,981
You have just come back, son.
Andyouwant to go away again?

923
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,778
l feel incomplete here, Dad!

924
01:44:11,155 --> 01:44:15,114
Why don'tyou study for MBA here?
There are alot of universities here.

925
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,119
Why do youwant to go to London?
-Traditions, Dad... Traditions.

926
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:24,794
Grandfather went there, you did...

927
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:30,402
so did Bhaiyya... So how can l break
the traditions of this house?

928
01:44:48,593 --> 01:44:50,561
So what shall l bring
back for the mother?

929
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:53,959
What does amother's heartyearn for?

930
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,159
Mother's heart? lt only yearns
for her son's happiness...

931
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:08,502
no matter where he is... no matter
howhe is...just happiness...

932
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:26,921
And a son's happiness is in
his mother's laughter... her smile...

933
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,465
somethingthat he
isn't able to see.

934
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,472
l promise, mother.
The laughter will return...

935
01:45:42,246 --> 01:45:47,843
that smile will return.
lt's a son's promise.

936
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,619
And abrother's!

937
01:46:17,348 --> 01:46:21,614
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances, doesn't it?

938
01:46:31,095 --> 01:46:33,325
Andwhen dear ones create distances
in between, it aches even more.

939
01:50:02,073 --> 01:50:05,338
Has your princess woken up?
-Oh yes... Pooja!

940
01:50:06,177 --> 01:50:09,146
No one knows her by that name. Call
her what she is called by everyone...

941
01:50:09,747 --> 01:50:10,873
Poo!

942
01:51:03,437 --> 01:51:07,396
You have no right to
look so beautiful.

943
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:18,018
She has arrived, the cunningvixen,
to drop her daughter.

944
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,721
After seeingyour face inthe morning
how can l call it alovely day?

945
01:51:27,861 --> 01:51:30,227
Liar! Liar! Come here...

946
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:38,229
Who is it, Anjali?
-Your future daughter-in-law.

947
01:51:38,973 --> 01:51:40,941
Come, let me serve you
some cornflakes.

948
01:52:01,295 --> 01:52:03,593
Anjali... Anjali l needto talkto you.
-What?

949
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:06,695
This songthatyou sing every morning.
-So?

950
01:52:08,302 --> 01:52:09,860
lt feels very nice.

951
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,675
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

952
01:52:16,043 --> 01:52:19,206
l don't sing for them do l? l sing so
that my son learns about our country.

953
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,676
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say thatyou have!

954
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:25,018
Yes... l have learnt everything.
- He has learnt nothing...

955
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:27,550
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion, our traditions...

956
01:52:27,921 --> 01:52:30,719
our heritage... Move out of my way.
Our country has...

957
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:33,025
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

958
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:36,229
Eh! The country best inthe world
is our lndia... don't ever forget!

959
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:43,027
OK... l won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

960
01:52:43,404 --> 01:52:45,634
when he turns a full one
don't complainto me.

961
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:52,570
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

962
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:09,922
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

963
01:53:26,246 --> 01:53:28,510
Let me knot it for you, Jeej!
-Aaaah!

964
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:34,709
What happened?
-What kind of clothes have youworn?

965
01:53:35,255 --> 01:53:37,223
lt's become too long hasn't it?

966
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:41,420
What now?

967
01:53:44,998 --> 01:53:46,556
Where's the back?

968
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:49,368
Didi, don't wait for me.

969
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:00,410
Anjali, Daijaan, come here.

970
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:03,909
How do you allow Poojato
go out wearing such little clothes?

971
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:26,302
By the way eventhe two of you
are looking decent today, l think...

972
01:55:12,986 --> 01:55:15,181
You hadwornthis eventhe

lt suits you alot!

974
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:41,981
Poo...the whole college
runs after Robbie.

975
01:55:47,054 --> 01:55:48,749
He's not my type!

976
01:55:49,256 --> 01:55:52,225
Who is your type?
Andwhen willyou meet him?

977
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:56,226
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

978
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:02,231
He could be right here somewhere.

979
01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:08,031
Oh God!Who is this... disturbing
Poo so early inthe morning!

980
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:43,300
Who is this who hasn't turnedto
give me a second look? Who is he?

981
01:57:34,728 --> 01:57:37,390
''He's so cute, he's so sweet''

982
01:57:39,232 --> 01:57:42,258
''Got to be careful,
l don't fall in love''

983
01:57:48,642 --> 01:57:51,372
''He's so cute, he's so sweet''

''For the first time

992
01:59:06,186 --> 01:59:08,450
''A stranger so familiar''

993
01:59:11,158 --> 01:59:13,149
''For the first time
l've met someone''

994
01:59:13,527 --> 01:59:15,495

02:00:02,943 --> 02:00:06,344

1005
02:00:54,394 --> 02:00:57,192

1006
02:00:59,633 --> 02:01:01,897

1008
02:01:08,808 --> 02:01:11,208
''Just one moment with her''

1009
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:17,339
''For years there has been a face
in my dreams''

1010
02:01:18,185 --> 02:01:21,780
''May be even she is waiting for me?''

1011
02:01:23,156 --> 02:01:26,182
''Oh lord, what do l say,

1012
02:01:27,994 --> 02:01:31,225
''With so much love in her eyes''

1013
02:01:32,499 --> 02:01:35,525
''She's so cute, she's so sweet''

1014
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:40,398

1015
02:01:42,075 --> 02:01:46,239

she'll steal my heart''

1016
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,376
''Wonder why l feelthis way?''

1017
02:02:39,399 --> 02:02:41,390
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on amoonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

1018
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:43,398
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni...

1019
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:46,973
some chatni.

1020
02:03:04,491 --> 02:03:08,587
Do you know Rohan, Didi always says
that amarriedwoman is the union of...

1021
02:03:08,962 --> 02:03:10,691
a wife and a daughter-in-law.

1022
02:03:11,698 --> 02:03:15,930
She is a goodwife, but she hasn't
managedto be an ideal daughter-in-law

1023
02:03:17,937 --> 02:03:21,202
Andyour brother?
Not a day passes...

1024
02:03:21,975 --> 02:03:24,205
not amoment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

1025
02:03:25,412 --> 02:03:29,542
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph inthe house.

1026
02:03:30,984 --> 02:03:33,009
But not once has he
turnedtowards it.

1027
02:03:35,255 --> 02:03:38,224
We have made a smallworld for
ourselves here, Rohan.

1028
02:03:39,259 --> 02:03:42,228
lf you look from afar
it's filledwith happiness...

1029
02:03:43,997 --> 02:03:47,524
but the closer you go,
youwill find alot of sorrow.

1030
02:03:51,371 --> 02:03:55,239
Why have you come, Rohan?
Why now?

1031
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:06,713
l had promised bhaiyyathat l will
never ask where he went or why he went

1032
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,317
But today l have realisedthat
he doesn't think of us as his own.

1033
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:20,859
That is apain l can't bear...
can't bear.

1034
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:24,530
l have left some broken
bonds back home, Pooja

1035
02:04:26,706 --> 02:04:29,197
that can only attainthe status
of a family through my elder brother.

1036
02:04:32,245 --> 02:04:38,013
l have come to take my brother back...
take my sister-in-lawback...

1037
02:04:41,254 --> 02:04:43,222
But l can't do this on my own.

1038
02:04:46,059 --> 02:04:47,890
l will needyour support Pooja.

1039
02:04:51,264 --> 02:04:54,233
Willyou support me?

1040
02:05:01,207 --> 02:05:06,577
No... No... never!
-He is Sonia's brother.

1041
02:05:07,013 --> 02:05:09,413
He's not my brother... And l didn't
even knowthat Soniahad abrother.

1042
02:05:09,783 --> 02:05:11,683
So Sonia, when was this
brother of yours born?

1043
02:05:11,918 --> 02:05:13,510
Brother? Who's brother?

1044
02:05:16,222 --> 02:05:18,190
My first brother from lndia
has come.

1045
02:05:18,925 --> 02:05:23,191
l mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

1046
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,200
lt's only amatter of few days.
At least meet him once.

1047
02:05:38,978 --> 02:05:40,946
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

1048
02:05:41,247 --> 02:05:43,215
Daijaan, please explainto her...
-Why are youtroubling him? Why?

1049
02:05:43,383 --> 02:05:44,680
Oh stop it Aunty.

1050
02:05:45,785 --> 02:05:47,878
C'mon, ln such abig house can't he...
- Can't stay.

1051
02:05:48,254 --> 02:05:51,018
This big house has youwearing
really small clothes...that's why.

1052
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:54,588
l don't want any young man staring at
you... And l'mthe boss of this house.

1053
02:05:54,961 --> 02:05:57,020
And l ring allthe bells.
Gosh!What is it?

1054
02:05:57,997 --> 02:05:59,965
What is it? l was just
savingyou from an evil eye!

1055
02:06:00,333 --> 02:06:03,894
Who's evil eye?
This whole family is mad.

1056
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:07,239
Allthe mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

1057
02:06:09,943 --> 02:06:14,403
Didi, Sonia's brother has just
arrived, he has no place to stay.

1058

lf you are here, who is singing

1116

By the way are you

1143
02:16:52,918 --> 02:16:53,885
Why?

1144
02:16:54,086 --> 02:16:56,554
Because there's amatch.

02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,184
Don't say anything now. Anything
can happen at the last minute.

1150
02:17:30,556 --> 02:17:31,989
You can never bank on lndia.

1151
02:17:39,732 --> 02:17:44,931
Didyou call mebhaiyya'?
- Why? Should l?

1152
02:17:45,371 --> 02:17:48,204
Why? Just drive the car carefully.

1153
02:17:52,578 --> 02:17:55,445
Hey!We won...

1154

three departments.

1158
02:19:15,194 --> 02:19:16,957
You are not so bad.

1159
02:19:17,429 --> 02:19:20,398

02:28:22,374 --> 02:28:23,966
Do you know everyone was
staring at us inthe temple?

1207
02:28:24,209 --> 02:28:27,906
lf everyone was staring at me instead
of Godthen it's not my problem.

1208
02:28:33,552 --> 02:28:36,521
Didyou hear that, Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?

1209
02:28:36,721 --> 02:28:38,348
Today is father's birthday.

1210
02:28:41,593 --> 02:28:43,561
Today is bauji's birthday?

1211
02:28:54,773 --> 02:28:57,003
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happenedto you?

1212
02:29:03,248 --> 02:29:05,216
Please take it...
it's the offering fromthe prayer

1213
02:29:09,254 --> 02:29:11,154
But aren't offerings on
birthday done for the...?

1214
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:14,158
l know. But Bauji
was a very funloving man...

1215
02:29:14,526 --> 02:29:17,495
he said even after l go
always remember me on ahappy day.

1216
02:29:18,463 --> 02:29:21,159
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and l've a special prayer for him

1217
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,160
lf he hadto see Poojalike this today,
he would've been unconscious.

1218
02:29:27,205 --> 02:29:30,572
You must feel sadthat he
is no longer with you now.

1219
02:29:31,543 --> 02:29:32,976
Yes...we do.

1220
02:29:34,679 --> 02:29:36,977
lt's important to have the warmth of
elders in ahouse...

1221
02:29:38,583 --> 02:29:42,178
or else a family always feels
incomplete... lsn't it?

1222
02:29:51,563 --> 02:29:53,190
Don'tyou miss him?

1223
02:29:57,636 --> 02:29:59,194
Don'tyou miss?

1224
02:30:02,307 --> 02:30:04,002
Don'tyou miss Bauji?

1225
02:30:07,312 --> 02:30:10,213
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja, Krishi...

1226
02:30:10,515 --> 02:30:12,142
Come on... Please come.

1227
02:30:15,854 --> 02:30:17,412
Even you are coming aren'tyou?

1228
02:31:04,369 --> 02:31:05,859
l forgot.

1229
02:31:08,673 --> 02:31:11,870
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory andthe one...

1230
02:31:13,478 --> 02:31:16,879
who is right here,
l forgot about him.

1231
02:31:19,584 --> 02:31:21,347
What present should l give you?

1232
02:31:23,254 --> 02:31:25,222
Just return my Nandini backto me.

1233
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:33,959
We have lost each other
inthis big house.

1234
02:31:37,602 --> 02:31:41,561
Just get back my Nandini for me.

1235
02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,578
l want nothing else.

1236
02:31:51,683 --> 02:31:52,809
Nothing else.

1237
02:31:58,523 --> 02:31:59,490
Listen...

1238
02:32:30,722 --> 02:32:33,486
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.

1239
02:32:34,592 --> 02:32:38,028
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...

1240
02:32:38,763 --> 02:32:40,958
what do they call it?Sexy'.

1241
02:32:46,438 --> 02:32:47,735
Krishiwill see.

1242
02:32:49,074 --> 02:32:52,043
By the way, that should have been
my line... Go now.

1243
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:54,578
My bag and my coat.
- l'lljust get it.

1244
02:33:00,285 --> 02:33:02,344
Listen, day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...

1245
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:04,053
Wow! So what am l supposedto do?

1246
02:33:04,289 --> 02:33:08,248
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for indians

1247
02:33:12,363 --> 02:33:13,921
You are leaving?

1248
02:33:20,705 --> 02:33:21,865
What is it?

1249
02:33:29,914 --> 02:33:31,211
He keeps popping up everywhere.

1250
02:33:43,561 --> 02:33:46,530
So Karwa Chauth!
- Yes... it's day after tomorrow.

1251
02:33:47,966 --> 02:33:50,935
So you must have receivedthe Sargi.
- Sargi?

1252
02:33:52,270 --> 02:33:57,333
Sargi... Don'tyou know what sargi is?
lt's aritual for karwa chauth...

1253
02:33:57,609 --> 02:33:59,577
it's somethingthat every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.

1254
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:04,048
Hasn'tyour mother-in-law
sent it for you?

1255
02:34:11,289 --> 02:34:14,190
Some elder person of your family
must be sending it to you.

1256
02:34:15,226 --> 02:34:16,716
No...

1257
02:34:22,367 --> 02:34:26,201
Don't worry. This year
youwill getyour sargi.

1258
02:34:31,976 --> 02:34:34,740
My mother... she will
explain everythingto you.

1259
02:34:43,254 --> 02:34:45,222
Greetings to you, my child!
- Greetings.

1260
02:34:46,257 --> 02:34:49,021
My son speaks so much about
your family that l feel almost like

1261
02:34:50,261 --> 02:34:52,229
l'mthere with all of you.

1262
02:34:53,431 --> 02:34:55,626
He has become apart of
our small family.

1263
02:34:57,168 --> 02:34:59,033
l hope he is not
troublingyoutoo much.

1264
02:35:02,273 --> 02:35:04,241
Dear child, Sargi is somethingthat...

1265
02:35:04,409 --> 02:35:06,570
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.

1266
02:35:09,214 --> 02:35:13,173
Some sweets, a few almonds and...

1267
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:22,752
signs of marital bliss...
and lots of love.

1268
02:35:32,237 --> 02:35:34,205

1270
02:35:51,723 --> 02:35:55,557
OKmy child l'll hang up now!
- OK.

1271
02:36:28,226 --> 02:36:33,357
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?

1272
02:36:51,983 --> 02:36:54,952
Andwhy is it, at times...

1273
02:36:55,586 --> 02:36:57,554
that even our own people
become strangers?

1274
02:37:04,429 --> 02:37:08,229
Listen... Even l have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.

1275
02:37:12,537 --> 02:37:14,164
For whom?

1276
02:37:16,741 --> 02:37:19,175
What's going onthere?
- Somethingthat doesn't happen here.

1277
02:37:21,212 --> 02:37:23,578
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?

1278
02:37:24,615 --> 02:37:27,846
Why? Who am l of yours?

1279
02:37:33,925 --> 02:37:35,893
You don't have the guts
to tellyour brother and bhabhi...

1280
02:37:36,127 --> 02:37:39,187
how you are relatedto them...
Tryingto be a great tiger before me!

1281
02:37:40,365 --> 02:37:41,764
Let go of my hand.

1282
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:44,000
Why has he held her hand?
- Let go of my hand.

1283
02:37:44,235 --> 02:37:45,532
l let go.

1284
02:37:46,704 --> 02:37:50,663
What if l tellthem?
Today inthe presence of everyone...

1285
02:37:52,143 --> 02:37:57,206
what if l tellthemthe truth,
what willyou do?

1286
02:37:57,615 --> 02:38:00,482
l don't think youwill be able to.
You are scared.

1287
02:38:02,587 --> 02:38:04,350
What if l do?

1288
02:38:04,922 --> 02:38:07,390
Then l willtell
everyone what's in my heart.

1289
02:38:08,393 --> 02:38:12,420
Really? ls that so?
- lt's abet.

1290
02:38:13,197 --> 02:38:15,427
Don't bet with me,
you might regret.

1291
02:38:17,201 --> 02:38:20,398
Maybe that's what l want.

1292
02:38:23,141 --> 02:38:24,972
But looking atyou...

1293
02:38:27,211 --> 02:38:29,179
l wonder if allthis is a dream.

1294
02:38:29,614 --> 02:38:30,581
Dream?

1295
02:38:32,517 --> 02:38:34,951
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

1296
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:04,333
Your turn.

1297

1317
02:44:03,714 --> 02:44:06,239
''may our soulmates be
with us forever''

1318
02:44:08,686 --> 02:44:13,180
''Nowthatyou have entered my world,

1319
02:44:13,624 --> 02:44:18,186

You are mad!

1330
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,993
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.

1331
02:47:38,228 --> 02:47:39,855
No. Not at all.

1332
02:47:40,230 --> 02:47:43,199
Really, Aunty... Sometimes
l wish we were living in lndia.

1333
02:47:44,568 --> 02:47:47,867
And Krishiwould singthe
same songs that l grewup singing.

1334
02:47:49,573 --> 02:47:53,942
But we are here and l have become
mummy' from amother.

1335
02:47:54,845 --> 02:47:56,938
Why do youthink so, Anjali?
the culture is yours, isn't it?

1336
02:47:58,949 --> 02:48:04,012
Still... lt's not the same, Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!

1337
02:48:08,659 --> 02:48:09,626
Mad!

1338
02:48:10,694 --> 02:48:14,494
By the way, D...j... Daijaan,
What are these children doing?

1339
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:19,897
There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.

1340
02:48:20,704 --> 02:48:23,434
All of us are going for it.

Daijaan... DJ!

1346
02:49:11,588 --> 02:49:15,615
My little child! My child!

1347
02:49:18,595 --> 02:49:23,157

My heart kept telling me

1348
02:49:24,535 --> 02:49:30,565
that it was my Baba. Oh Allah!
Howbigyou've grown up to be.

1349
02:49:35,446 --> 02:49:38,904
You hid it from your DJ too?
You didn't eventell me?

1350
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:42,450
Why? My child, why?

1351
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:50,183
Didn't l keep tellingyou, Anjali?

02:50:06,243 --> 02:50:07,540
My child!

1355
02:50:37,207 --> 02:50:38,504
Just coming!

1356
02:51:01,932 --> 02:51:03,365
Oh!Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?

1357
02:51:13,243 --> 02:51:15,006
Oh my God! ls this our table?

1358
02:51:15,245 --> 02:51:17,042
They do this allthe time.
Look at this, Aunty,

1359
02:51:17,247 --> 02:51:19,715
They give the front seats to the
shiningwhite army and seat us behind.

1360
02:51:19,917 --> 02:51:22,078
Why do they do it
always?... No... Aunty,

1361
02:51:22,386 --> 02:51:24,217
Where is that silly principle?

1362
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:31,955
She has arrived, the cunningvixen.

1363
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:39,228
ls she the Queen of Englandthat
she's got the table inthe front?

1364
02:51:45,275 --> 02:51:48,244
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...

1365
02:51:48,478 --> 02:51:50,036
hope your chair breaks to pieces.

1366
02:51:54,284 --> 02:51:56,047
Shouldwe sit?

1367
02:52:03,293 --> 02:52:05,022
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.

1368
02:52:05,295 --> 02:52:07,525
Even lastyear at this function
you had created aruckus!

1369
02:52:07,998 --> 02:52:10,466
Krishi is performing...Very nice...
what's the big deal?

1370
02:52:12,169 --> 02:52:14,399
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act of yours!

1371
02:52:14,605 --> 02:52:16,197
Anjali, she's right!
- You keep quiet.

1372
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:19,204
My son's on stage...
l will at least whistle once.

1373
02:52:19,576 --> 02:52:21,544
No... No...
-Just one whistle...

1374
02:52:43,066 --> 02:52:47,560
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you, sweetoo!

1375
02:52:52,709 --> 02:52:54,233
God, Please protect my son.

1376
02:52:54,645 --> 02:52:56,977
Eh! Your son is just performing...
not fighting a war onthe border.

1377
02:52:57,281 --> 02:52:59,249
Just see!

1378
02:53:04,988 --> 02:53:07,252
My son! My son!

1379
02:53:10,294 --> 02:53:11,591
Now singyour,Do Re Mi'.

1380
02:55:39,576 --> 02:55:41,203

1381
02:56:04,601 --> 02:56:07,832
Nowtell me something...
You must have been alittle nervous?

1382
02:56:08,171 --> 02:56:10,969
l was alittle nervous.
But someone said somethingto me...

1383
02:56:11,308 --> 02:56:12,969
and everythingwas alright.

1384
02:56:14,110 --> 02:56:16,169
What didthe person say?
- Just aminute.

1385
02:56:18,215 --> 02:56:21,981
lf youwant to be someone in life...
if youwant to achieve something...

1386
02:56:22,486 --> 02:56:24,920
lf youwant to win,always
listento your hear.

1387
02:56:25,455 --> 02:56:27,184
And if eventhat doesn't
give you any answers...

1388
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:30,689
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

1389
02:56:31,628 --> 02:56:34,529
Andthen youwill
cross allthe hurdles...

1390
02:56:35,232 --> 02:56:38,201
allyour problems willvanish,
victory will be yours...

1391
02:56:39,269 --> 02:56:40,566
only yours.

1392
02:56:44,641 --> 02:56:48,600
Who saidthis? Papa?
- No. He.

1393
02:57:19,209 --> 02:57:21,177
Didyoutake care of mother?

1394
02:57:28,218 --> 02:57:30,186
Didyou get selected
inthe cricket team?

1395
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:42,892
How didyou manage
to lose so much weight?

1396
02:57:51,541 --> 02:57:56,205
Why didn'tyoutell me?
Why didn'tyoutell me?

1397
02:57:56,613 --> 02:58:00,879
Come back home, Bhaiyya.
Please come back home.

1398
02:58:02,252 --> 02:58:04,220
Come back home, Bhaiyya.

1399
02:58:06,189 --> 02:58:08,020
Has Papa sentyou?

1400
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:19,760
Rohan, nowthis is my family.

1401
02:58:21,538 --> 02:58:24,632
These are my people.
This is my world!

1402
02:58:29,946 --> 02:58:34,508
Andthe home you are talking about
was never mine inthe first place...

1403
02:58:38,221 --> 02:58:40,189
andwill never be.

1404
02:58:44,227 --> 02:58:46,855
You go back now...just go back.
You...

1405
02:58:49,232 --> 02:58:53,191
l have seen you again,
that's enough for me.

1406
02:58:54,571 --> 02:58:56,198
Go back.

1407
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:09,016
Do you know Bhaiyya,
you often saidwhen l was a child

1408
02:59:11,588 --> 02:59:13,556
That mother lovedyou more than me.

1409
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:19,152
l never liked it then.

1410
02:59:21,564 --> 02:59:23,156
l usedto get angry.

1411
02:59:26,636 --> 02:59:28,968
But today, l would like to tellyou,
thatyouwere right.

1412
02:59:32,208 --> 02:59:34,176
Mother loves you more than me.

1413
02:59:37,213 --> 02:59:42,173
She loves youtoo much.
And she will always.

1414
02:59:45,221 --> 02:59:48,190
She will always
- l know.

1415
02:59:54,330 --> 02:59:56,195
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.

1416
03:00:02,238 --> 03:00:04,001
He will never come back.

1417
03:00:09,245 --> 03:00:13,147
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.

1418
03:00:14,551 --> 03:00:16,519
l knowmy brother-in-law well.

1419
03:00:18,188 --> 03:00:20,486
Just get himto meet
mother and father.

1420
03:00:26,196 --> 03:00:28,164
Willyou be able to do that?

1421
03:00:39,743 --> 03:00:42,576
You know, dad...
l had a strange dream last night.

1422
03:00:43,613 --> 03:00:46,173
l dreamt thatyou and Mom had come
to Londonto surprise me.

1423
03:00:47,617 --> 03:00:48,982
Then?
- What then, dad?

1424
03:00:49,219 --> 03:00:51,517
The alarm went off... l mean...

1425
03:00:52,222 --> 03:00:54,190
why wouldyou and Mom come to
Londonto surprise me?

1426
03:01:00,396 --> 03:01:01,693
l'll speakto you later

1427
03:01:11,574 --> 03:01:13,201
The work's done.

1428
03:01:28,258 --> 03:01:30,089
Guess where we are.
- Where, dad?

1429
03:01:33,997 --> 03:01:37,023
ls it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and l don't turn it true.

1430
03:01:38,535 --> 03:01:40,628
Tell me where you are right now,

1431
03:01:42,272 --> 03:01:44,035
You are meeting me
after such alongtime.

1432
03:01:45,508 --> 03:01:48,841
Present? Now...
at this time... here...

1433
03:01:49,179 --> 03:01:51,147
You meet me at 5p.m. at
the Blue water Shopping mall.

1434
03:01:51,681 --> 03:01:53,649
But tell me what
youwant, my child.

1435
03:01:54,017 --> 03:01:56,986
Youwill findwhat
l want right there, Dad.

1436
03:02:14,904 --> 03:02:16,337
What's happening here?
- l'm looking for the receipts.

1437
03:02:16,573 --> 03:02:18,541
What receipts?
- To returnthe clothes.

1438
03:02:18,908 --> 03:02:20,876
lf you have to returnthem, why do you
buy them inthe first place?

1439
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:24,007
The country best inthe world
is our lndia... Right Mom?

1440
03:02:24,247 --> 03:02:25,214
Mother's stooge!

1441
03:02:30,587 --> 03:02:32,714
Didyoutape that? That lndian serial,
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahuthi.

1442
03:02:33,156 --> 03:02:35,021
What abrilliant twist!
The son dies.

1443
03:02:35,258 --> 03:02:38,227
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.

1444
03:02:41,264 --> 03:02:43,232
What are you doing?
- lt's fine tillthe hugs

1445
03:02:43,499 --> 03:02:45,967
- but he keeps kissing me too.
- You have never kissed me so much.

1446
03:02:46,269 --> 03:02:48,237
Come home, darling... and see.

1447
03:07:20,510 --> 03:07:24,173
Lies! You liedto me.

1448
03:07:25,681 --> 03:07:28,172
Yes... l liedto you, Dad.

1449
03:07:29,552 --> 03:07:31,520
What would l have achieved even if
l hadtoldtruth.

1450
03:07:32,555 --> 03:07:34,182
l wouldn't be able to break
your ego.

1451
03:07:35,758 --> 03:07:37,726
What else is it if not ego, Dad?

1452
03:07:38,227 --> 03:07:41,287
That separates amother from her child
that takes away...

1453
03:07:41,564 --> 03:07:44,795
abrother from his sibling...that
throws a father away from his son...?

1454
03:07:45,067 --> 03:07:48,525
He is not my son!
l don't believe that he is my son.

1455
03:07:49,472 --> 03:07:51,440
Has he fulfilledthe duties
of a son? He didn't.

1456
03:07:52,575 --> 03:07:55,669
He did, Dad... he did.

1457
03:07:59,048 --> 03:08:00,811
He always fulfilledthem.

1458
03:08:02,919 --> 03:08:07,219
He only made one mistake... Love.

1459
03:08:09,258 --> 03:08:11,818
lf that is a crime accordingto
your law, so be it.

1460
03:08:13,596 --> 03:08:16,429
But isn't ityour duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?

1461
03:08:20,002 --> 03:08:21,970
Butyou came downto punishing him.

1462
03:08:26,209 --> 03:08:28,177
What kind of punishment is this, Dad?

1463
03:08:32,215 --> 03:08:33,978
What punishment is this?

1464
03:08:41,390 --> 03:08:42,982
Just look into my eyes and say that...

1465
03:08:43,226 --> 03:08:45,194
you don't feelthe pain
of partingwith him.

1466
03:08:47,129 --> 03:08:48,994
Say thatyou don't remember him.

1467
03:08:50,499 --> 03:08:52,194
Say thatyou don't love him.

1468
03:08:54,570 --> 03:08:57,300
Say it, Dad. Say it.

1469
03:08:57,940 --> 03:09:02,536
l don't love him.
l don't love him.

1470
03:09:03,779 --> 03:09:05,474
l said it, didn't l?

1471
03:09:19,462 --> 03:09:24,161
God has blessedyou
with everything, Dad... Everything.

1472
03:09:27,803 --> 03:09:29,566
l just wish he had given you aheart!
- Shut up!

1473
03:09:31,107 --> 03:09:32,438
You irreverent child!

1474
03:09:40,216 --> 03:09:41,979
You love him.

1475
03:09:45,655 --> 03:09:49,182
You love him alot.
You love him alot.

1476
03:09:52,228 --> 03:09:58,189
l have got my answer.
You really love him.

1477
03:10:01,804 --> 03:10:03,465
Let's go back, Rahul.

1478
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:08,540
lt's too much now...
This is not our country.

1479
03:10:09,178 --> 03:10:13,638
These are not our people.
We have set up ahouse here...

1480
03:10:14,183 --> 03:10:17,152
but have you ever wondered
what kind of ahome is this...

1481
03:10:19,188 --> 03:10:22,157
that doesn't have amother's
warmth or a father's blessings?

1482
03:10:25,461 --> 03:10:29,158
Let's go back, Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...

1483
03:10:30,199 --> 03:10:35,637
They are right here.
They are elders.

1484
03:10:38,207 --> 03:10:42,769
They are alittle angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.

1485
03:10:45,214 --> 03:10:49,173
Rahul... l know
they are as incomplete without us...

1486
03:10:50,219 --> 03:10:52,187
as we are without them.

1487
03:10:53,222 --> 03:10:56,191
We will ask for forgiveness, Rahul.
Let's go back.

1488
03:11:01,630 --> 03:11:03,461
Youwill never understand.

1489
03:11:07,970 --> 03:11:11,929
To turn a stranger into your own...

1490
03:11:12,575 --> 03:11:14,543
andthento turn him back
to a stranger...

1491
03:11:17,246 --> 03:11:19,214
you can never understandthe pain.

1492
03:11:21,417 --> 03:11:24,386
l agree they are elders...

1493
03:11:27,256 --> 03:11:29,554
but eventhey don't have the right
to break aheart.

1494
03:11:33,262 --> 03:11:35,560
Eventhey don't have
aright to break aheart.

1495
03:11:58,421 --> 03:12:00,389
l think we should call him back.

1496
03:12:43,365 --> 03:12:48,029
Yash, lt was her last wish
to have Rahul...

1497
03:12:49,271 --> 03:12:52,468
Just wait for a while...l
knowhe will definitely come.

1498
03:12:54,443 --> 03:12:57,241
We don't needto wait
for anyone... Rohan.

1499
03:14:00,643 --> 03:14:02,611
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.

1500
03:14:06,282 --> 03:14:08,250
They are leavingtomorrowfrom here.

1501
03:14:10,586 --> 03:14:12,554
They haven't even come home.

1502
03:14:18,294 --> 03:14:19,591
lf you say to them...

1503
03:14:38,514 --> 03:14:43,542
Do you knowmother always
says that...

1504
03:14:45,254 --> 03:14:47,017
ahusband is God.

1505
03:14:48,657 --> 03:14:52,616
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...

1506
03:14:53,562 --> 03:14:55,223
he is always right.

1507
03:14:56,932 --> 03:15:00,959
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.

1508
03:15:03,272 --> 03:15:11,179
We gave him lots of love... right.
He became apart of our family.

1509
03:15:14,483 --> 03:15:20,183
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!

1510
03:15:24,093 --> 03:15:28,996
Then... one day he left home
andwent away.

1511
03:15:31,634 --> 03:15:32,601
Wrong

1512
03:15:35,237 --> 03:15:39,196
You let him leave...wrong

1513
03:15:42,244 --> 03:15:47,204
You separated amother from
her child...wrong.

1514
03:15:50,586 --> 03:15:56,547
Our family shattered
to pieces...wrong.

1515
03:16:00,996 --> 03:16:03,226
Then how does ahusband become God?

1516
03:16:08,337 --> 03:16:10,498
God can't do any wrong can he?

1517
03:16:16,545 --> 03:16:23,974
My husband is just ahusband...
just ahusband... Not God.

1518
03:16:29,024 --> 03:16:30,457
Not God.

1519
03:16:33,395 --> 03:16:34,692
Nandini!

1520
03:16:36,231 --> 03:16:41,794
l said it... Didn't l?
That's it!

1521
03:17:22,444 --> 03:17:24,412
Ever since the day you left,
Bhaiyya...

1522
03:17:25,380 --> 03:17:27,177
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.

1523
03:17:30,018 --> 03:17:31,178
He is the one who gave amother...

1524
03:17:31,353 --> 03:17:33,651
the strengthto stay away
from her son.

1525
03:17:36,225 --> 03:17:38,193
Please swear on Him, Bhaiyya...

1526
03:17:40,229 --> 03:17:42,197
thatyouwill come home
at least once.

1527
03:17:44,166 --> 03:17:45,531
Just once, Bhaiyya.

1528
03:17:47,236 --> 03:17:51,730
Even if it is for amoment.
Even if it is for a day.

1529
03:17:54,409 --> 03:17:56,206
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that

1530
03:17:56,411 --> 03:17:58,379
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.

1531
03:18:00,249 --> 03:18:02,217
She is apart of the family.

1532
03:18:03,252 --> 03:18:05,345
At least letyour shadowfall
onthe photograph...

1533
03:18:05,587 --> 03:18:08,215
that has keptyour memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.

1534
03:18:14,196 --> 03:18:19,156
Just once, Bhaiyya.
Then you can leave

1535
03:18:21,003 --> 03:18:25,167
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.

1536
03:18:30,312 --> 03:18:32,280
Onthe strength of that one memory...

1537
03:18:32,614 --> 03:18:37,347
that one moment...Mother
can lead her entire life.

1538
03:18:41,390 --> 03:18:43,585
Can'tyou do just this
much for mother?

1539
03:23:03,618 --> 03:23:05,916
Youtook my words so muchto heart
thatyouwent away.

1540
03:23:08,023 --> 03:23:12,790
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.

1541
03:23:14,663 --> 03:23:16,187
Didn't come back.

1542
03:23:18,033 --> 03:23:20,001
Where didyou call
me back, Papa?

1543
03:23:23,638 --> 03:23:25,469
Did l have to callyou back?

1544
03:23:26,641 --> 03:23:28,370
Am l not elder?
Do l have to callyou back?

1545
03:23:28,610 --> 03:23:30,009

1546
03:23:32,314 --> 03:23:34,214
l thoughtyou didn't love me.

1547
03:23:35,250 --> 03:23:37,115

1548

the first time withthese hands.

1550

You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.

1551
03:23:54,002 --> 03:23:55,162

Just couldn't say it.

1559
03:24:40,248 --> 03:24:44,207
Elders' anger is apart of...
their love, my son.

1560
03:24:46,154 --> 03:24:49,954
Youtook it so muchto heart that

1564

1566
03:25:10,946 --> 03:25:12,914
You are my son... my son.
