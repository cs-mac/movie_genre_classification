- Loch Ness, Scotland.

No, John. I want you to go to
Loch Ness and not find the monster.

40
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,155
I want you to take this equipment

The only reason
I'm teaching freshmen

is because I chased
a no-show monster for three years!

Unless I say so.
What's the problem here?

Just run the sonar up the loch,
bring me evidence nothing's there.

Not to mention communications
from the lawyers of your ex-wife.

Yeah, I may be broke
and have no credibility left,

55
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,631
but I do have some dignity.

56
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,119
That's blackmail. So why don't you
take the whole loch and shove it?

Yeah. In coach, of course.

I recognise you
from that picture in <i>Time</i> magazine.

67

You were on the boat in Madagascar
with a lemur on your shoulder.

68
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,077
You've lost weight since then. If you
don't mind me saying, it suits you.

He shouted, and it submerged.

But you watch out, beastie,
'cause your man is here.

76
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,192
It is... It's very comfortable.

He also discovered an unknown
species of wasp in South America.

95

My method of tracking?

I like to locate what I'm after,
then I bend down like this,

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,551
Oh... Well, can I...?
Can I see the manager?

156
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,876
I am the manager.

157
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,959
- Could I... talk to the owner?
- I am the owner.

158
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,595
Bruce got into some dead fish
on the jetty. He likes to roll in it.

159
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,075
<i>Canis lupus</i> courtship behaviour.

160
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,589
Bruce is on the make.

161
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,230
You still blocking
people's driveways?

162
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,150
Yeah, I'm sorry... Hello?
You caught me off guard.

163
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,113
The little girl said
you were holding a room for me.

164
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,596
Isabel? She's a wee lass,
Mr Dempsey.

165
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,916
We're not accommodating.

166
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,355
Right. Well, let me ask you, ma'am.

167
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,350
When you are accommodating,
what do you usually get for a room?

168
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,949
£70 a night.

169
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,080
Well, let's make it 75, and I apologise
for blocking your driveway.

170
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,192
I'm sorry, but we're still closed.

171
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,188
Hey, please, this is the only place.
Just for five nights, please?

172
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,949
So you'll be another beastie hunter?

173
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,550
Yes. Yes, ma'am.
Have net, will travel. That's me.

174
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,557
£80. Please.

175
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,197
Overcharge me. It seems to be
the national pastime around here.

176
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,231
Hello, Mr Dempsey.

177
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,078
Isabel.

178
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,398
Why don't you work out a room deal?
Your mom's crucifying me.

179
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,114
- How much are you offering?
- Isabel!

180
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,871
All right, this is my last offer, though.
£90 and no pets in my room.

181
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,431
- That's really good.
- Yeah, see?

182
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,913
All right.

183
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,429
- Room D. It's along the landing.
- Yes!

184
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,837
- Come on, Isabel.
- Look at that, room D.

185
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,716
- Could you...?
- No, you're too late for breakfast!

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,357
Three of these, laddie, and you might
catch a glimpse of the beastie.

187
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,393
I think I got a pretty good look
at one, don't you?

188
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,558
- Some carrots.
- Yeah.

189
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,752
- How about four?
- Four. For sure.

190
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,277
They laughed at the very idea
of a dragon in Komodo.

191
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,311
And then they found it.

192
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,719
Same with the tree kangaroo.

193
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,272
Right over here.

194
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,599
Same with the megashark, of course.

195
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,273
And it was the same with your
discovery, eh? The Dempsey wasp.

196
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,916
Satellite mapping system.
And that's CP-500 sonar.

197
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,839
I thought only the military
had this equipment.

198
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,918
Nothing's too good for Mercer's army.

199
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,153
- Beer?
- No, thanks.

200
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,634
Right.

201
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,349
You can see every mollusc.

202
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,630
You can see every inch.

203
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,831
<i>(steady beeping)</i>

204
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,316
We're gonna see it.

205
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,839
I know it.

206
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,955
How can it not be there?

207
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,833
How can what not be there, Adrian?

208
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,396
The creature.

209
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,520
You know, in prehistoric times,
the loch was connected to the sea,

210
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,359
but it was cut off
during the second Ice Age.

211
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,596
An aquatic dinosaur
here would've been...

212
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,360
Trapped in an isolated aquarium,

213
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,757
able to sustain itself
and escape extinction.

214
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,513
Nice theory.

215
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,756
Come on, man.

216
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,236
We get the Discovery Channel, too,
you know.

217
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,071
Look, I don't want to seem
impertinent, Doctor...

218
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,875
Sometimes it sounds like
you believe there's nothing there.

219
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,277
You're in the ballpark there.

220
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,029
So the locals need a legend, because
their livelihood depends on it,

221
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,550
but what about the evidence?

222
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,435
It's a large pinniped,
maybe a Pleistocene relic.

223
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,633
I believe strongly, Doctor, that what's
down here is not a tabloid monster.

224
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,832
- It's a biological phenomenon.
- Come on!

225
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,749
Would you give me a break?

226
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,192
Dr Dempsey?

227
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,511
Nothing on the rear scanner, Adrian!

228
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,112
No, there's... there's something here.
I need help to get a fix on it.

229
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,235
It's nothing. It's probably just
a chunk of driftwood or something.

230
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,591
It's too big to be
a chunk of driftwood.

231
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,439
It's moving. It's moving!

232
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,598
It's propelled by trapped
bacterial gas. Relax.

233
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,152
There, see?
I told you, it was just a log.

234
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,756
It's always just a big damn log.

235
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,071
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,238

<i>Each Uisge! Each Uisge!</i>

239
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,919
He's the water bailiff,
the keeper of the loch.

240
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,554
He's been here since '32.

241

Dinner is at 7.30 sharp.
That'll be extra, of course.

246
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,279
Of course.

247
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,994
I suppose the breakfast I didn't have
is included?

248
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,033
- Aye.
- That makes sense.

249
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,599
- How's your room?
- It's nice, yes. Very nice.

250
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,871
Are you taking over
from poor Dr Abernathy?

251
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,638
Yeah, I suppose I am.

252
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,310
He was a good man. Such a tragedy.

253
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,910
You're here to solve
the mystery of the loch?

254
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,193
- There's no mystery to solve.
- I don't know about that.

255
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,671
You're a believer?

256
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,236
I wouldn't say yes,
but I wouldn't say no.

257
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,398
Come on, you can tell me.
Have you actually seen it?

258
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,398
Well, when I was a wee girl,

259
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,989
I saw a great wake in Urquhart Bay.

260
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,078
Three humps came up,
just beyond the castle there.

261
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,679
Really?

262
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,759
See, that's my personal favourite,
the old triple-humper.

263
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,150
If you don't believe in it,
why did you ask me?

264
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,076
I'm sorry.

265
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,031
- Is there a shower?
- Aye.

266
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,151
Thank God.

267
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,432
- But there's no hot water.
- Why not?

268
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,955
- The dog used the last of it.
- I'm sorry?

269
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,073
<i>Canis lupus</i> used the last of the H2O.
He's clean as a whistle now.

270
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,271
No, wait a minute...

271
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,836
You're telling me that I'm paying
£90 a night, that's $140,

272
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,749
I don't get the breakfast I paid for,
and the dog gets my hot water?

273
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,033
I didn't know you were coming,
and I didn't ask you to stay.

274
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,159
There'll be plenty of hot water later.
There are your towels.

275
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,396
Thank you. Yes, the towels.

276
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,115
Look at these! Should they be
away from their mother?

277
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,917
I've seen the snow
in wintertime five feet.

278

And my old grandpappy,
four feet eleven.

279
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,235
We never saw him till March.

- Except for his hat.

- I'll help you with that.

- I can manage, thanks!
- Sorry.

283
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,588
I wasn't suggesting 'cause you're
a woman you're not capable of...

284
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,588
You're more than capable of...
As well as being a woman.

285
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,109
Well, if you want to.

286
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,199

- I'm just pulling one for Duncan.

- On the self-serve pump.
- Stay your side of the bar, please!

288
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,550
I do apologise, Miss McFetridge.

289
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,274
Only trying to help, I'm sure.

290
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,750
Have you... thought any more
about what I said?

291
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,270
I have, and the answer's still no.

Actually, I'd love to. Thank you.

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,394
So, what do you wanna do?
You wanna grab a Scotch and cigar?

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,910
- No. You're funny.
- You think so?

299

Good. You wanna hear

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,593
- What else do you do?
- I can do the water kelpie.

308
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,315
Yes, the water kelpie.
All right, let me see your Nessie.

309
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,195
<i>(shrill whistle)</i>

310
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,598
That's good, but I think
it's actually a little more like this...

311
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,519
<i>(he growls)</i>

312
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,792
<i>(roars)</i>

313
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,837
You're silly.
It doesn't sound like that at all.

314
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,192
Great. A little success,
and all of a sudden you're a critic.

315
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,676
There you go, Tommy.

316
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,309
What's his story?

317
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,072
Mr Dempsey?

318
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,396
He's taking over, like you said.

319
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,797
Aye, and with more equipment
than I've ever seen on the loch.

320
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,516
But it's strange. He's not another
starry-eyed loony after a monster.

321
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,759
- In fact, he says it doesn't exist.
- How long is he staying?

322
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,428
As long as it takes him
to prove his point.

323
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,517
He thinks five days.

324
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,554
Did he pay in advance?

325
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,479
Bruce, drop!

326
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,554
Fetch it!

327
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,509
Not for Magnus.
Not with his colouring.

328
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,356
Good day to you, Laura.
How are you?

329
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,279
Not so bad, Mrs Macfarlane.
Hello, Mrs Tait.

330
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,914
- Laura.
- And lovely Isabel, is she well?

331
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,078
Fine, fine. She's becoming
quite a handful these days.

332
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,238
- Do you have any spare milk today?
- Yes, yes.

333
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,110
- For the guest, I suppose?
- Aye.

334
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,278
The American.
He bought a bonny pair of socks.

335
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,790
A single man...
Very nice. Very good-looking.

336
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,197
- I thought you'd closed.
- I had, too.

337
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,198
But he made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

338
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,159
- So... he'll be staying a time, then?
- A time, aye.

339
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,430
Is that him out there now?

340
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,034
Heavens! What's he done to the boat?
Is that some sort of equipment?

341
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,869
Aye. I heard he had... equipment.

342
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,117
That'll be Andy's boat he's using?

343
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,072
It is.

344
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,271
Does Andy not mind you
accommodating?

345
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,233
What's he got to do with it?

346
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,476
Well, nothing.

347
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,193
Just I heard that you two
had an understanding.

348
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,072
We certainly do not.

349
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,308
Whether or not I choose to take in
guests has nothing to do with Andy.

350
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,150
<i>(chug of boat)</i>

351
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,878
This loch is 25 miles long.
That's 263 billion cubic feet of water.

352
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,073
That's more water than all the lakes
in England and Wales put together.

353
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,311
Can't you read? Beware! Private!

354
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,595
Why don't you go and invade
a small country in South America

355
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,439
instead of invading my water,

356
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,952
my privacy and my monster's privacy?

357
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,311
Did he say his monster?

358
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,318
That's Gordon Shoals.
A total fruitcake.

359
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,231
- He's been here 16 years now.
- Beware the Ides of March!

360
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,477
The water never gives up its dead!

361
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,753
Yes, I know who you are!
And so does the monster!

362
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,235
And another thing, Dempsey,

363
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,753
the only bit of her you're gonna see
is the inside of her bloody stomach!

364
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,835
- Because she loves me, not you!
- Nutter.

365
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,474
I talk to her!

366
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,035
<i>(he wheezes)</i>

367
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,232
We got company.
You expecting anybody, Adrian?

368
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,879
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

369
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,353
- They're gonna hit us.
- Get out of the way!

370
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,553
Hey!

371
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,877
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

372
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,113
They've ruined the whole sweep!

<i>(roll of thunder)</i>

<i>(# music: "Sky Boat Song")</i>

375
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,552
That's a fact.

376
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,550
Listen, in the old days,
when a man transgressed,

377
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,355
you put him in a barrel
and slid him down the hill.

378
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,236
- And when a woman transgressed...
- Did God Almighty decide the sins?

379
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,638
Or maybe some men with fish eggs
for brains acted without thinking?

380
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,229
Don't worry, Laura,
your business is safe.

381
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,876
So sabotage makes everything
just grand for the community?

382
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,111
What do you know about
the community, young lady?

383
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,716
<i>(silence falls)</i>

384
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,393
- Any luck today, Professor?
- So, you're the law on the water.

385
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,591
Is that right?

386
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,429
Do you know what happened to me
out there today?

387
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,872
Caught a cold, by the sound of it.
Very harsh climate in these parts.

388
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,433
Listen up, Scottie.

389
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,871
You've not got some American patsy
to play Highland Games with.

390
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,757
I won't be run off by a bunch of
tight-fisted weenies in kilts! Got me?

391
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,835
Now, you listen to me,
you arrogant young whippersnapper.

392
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,271
The people you are speaking of
are the Celts.

393
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,439
Hung the heads of their enemies
from the manes of their horses.

394
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,235
You'll never solve
the mystery of the loch.

395
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,159
The Creator made it that way
and it'll stay that way.

396
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,477
The Chamber of Commerce
is behind this racket.

397
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,955
This isn't creation.
It's about the economy.

398
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,517
What told you that? Your lenses?
Your lights? Your computers?

399
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,831
I'm not a boastful man,

400
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,350
but I know more about these waters
than your machines!

401
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,432
I was baptised in them.
And I am the keeper of them.

402
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,270
I'll tell you something else. This
mystery goes back to St Columba.

403
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,790
He saw it and stated it
in the name of Kirk!

404
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,913
Let's see, would that be
Captain James T Kirk?

405
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,789
You and your puny machines...

406
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,833
will never destroy 1400 years
of mystery.

407
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,072
I'll tell you what.

408
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,511
Come out on the loch tomorrow
and you watch me.

409
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,354
- Good morning.
- Let's do it.

410
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,834
Fine.

411
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,033
Don't thank us. We liked being here
since 4 o'clock this morning (!)

412
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,551
I'm gonna blow this bullshit myth
out of the water.

413
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,228
- It's no myth.
- Don't start.

414
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,756
Turn the aperture correction
down to three, please.

415
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,909
He must be halfway up the loch.
I don't think he's found anything.

416
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,152
I've heard he only eats
the whites of his eggs.

417
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,954
Never touches the yolk.

418
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,914
- He walks in his sleep, you know.
- No!

419
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,394
Aye?

420
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,874
A lot of Americans do that.

421
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,833
And he sleeps in the nude.

422
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,589
Maybe the sonar activity
has driven it to the far end.

423
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,917
I mean, maybe we've got it cornered.

424
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,878
End of loch.

425
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,628
End of the Loch Ness monster.

426
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,834
It's over, Adrian.

427
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,948
You wanna know
what all that means?

428
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,596
It's time to rewrite your guidebooks,
Water Bailiff.

429
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,232
The computer...

430
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,432
The printout showed cracks
alongside the loch.

431
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,632
- Something could've hidden in there.
- Come on!

432
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,196
If there was a 30-foot dinosaur
out there, we'd have seen it.

433
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,473
But too many people have testified.
Priests and policemen! 10,000 others!

434
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,468
- You think it's mass hallucination?
- I did my job as ordered.

435
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,319
I proved it wasn't there.
Signed, sealed and delivered.

436
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,751
So it's over, then?
Because you say it is?

437
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,555
What would you know? You couldn't
find a dinosaur in a whisky glass!

438
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,399
No, no!
You listen to me, Dr Negativity!

439
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,354
You're not fit to shine
the shoes of Dr Abernathy!

440
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,028
"You cannot find something
you don't want to."

441
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,631
Remember those words? You should,
you wrote them nine years ago!

442
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,393
Shit. Hey, let me say something.
You wanna yell at me...

443
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,639
- I will yell at you! I'm not finished!
- Let me say something.

444
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,354
I've been here, Adrian, I did this.

445
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,314
I'm the guy who blew his reputation
chasing Sasquatch, remember?

446
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,159
British Columbia, 1986,
you found the tracks!

447
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,150
You still don't get it, do you?
I am a joke. I chase looney tunes.

448
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,114
And you think I don't want to find
something out there?

449
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,155
If I nailed a dinosaur in Loch Ness,
I'd be vindicated a thousand times.

450
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,955
I would have it all back. And more.

451
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,238
But it's not gonna happen. There's
nothing here or in British Columbia.

452
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,352
There's nothing unexplained
flying in the skies at night.

453
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,516
That is just a wish list, Adrian,

454
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,033
to make us feel there's more to life
than the shit we got stuck with.

455
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,708
Believing is not enough.

456
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,112
Don't make the same mistake I did.

457
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,395
- <i>(Laura)</i> Sit down, Izzy. Come on.
- It's just not comfortable.

458
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,592
<i>(Laura)</i> You're on cushions,
so you should be.

459
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,079
- Are there any napkins?
- Tomorrow I'll get some napkins.

460
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,350
- Promise?
- I promise.

461
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,473
What else do we have to get?
Milk, biscuits.

462
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,114
Potat... Potatoes.

463
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,792
You look sad, Mr Dempsey.

464
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,277
My mummy asked if you want to have
dinner with us before you leave.

465
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,391
Would you like to?

466
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,436
This is very nice.

467
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,714
Mr Dempsey...

468
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,229
Isabel said you were expecting me
to join you for dinner.

469
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,278
Right. Right, yeah. Of course.

470
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,510
Maybe I misunderstood.
Why don't I take this upstairs and...?

471
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,190
No, no.
I wouldn't hear of it, honestly.

472
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,551
Is there anything wrong with it?
You've hardly touched it.

473
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,877
No, it's wonderful.
I just wasn't very hungry.

474
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,798
Mm, mm.

475
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,236
- Have you finished on the loch?
- Yeah... Yeah, I've finished.

476
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,839
How come you didn't come
on holiday with your wife?

477
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,076
Isabel!

478
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,713
That's all right.

479
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,229
Number one, I'm not on holiday.
Number two, I don't have a wife.

480
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,556
- Never?
- Izzy!

481
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,199
- No, I did once.
- She ran off?

482
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,597
- Yeah. She ran off.
- Weren't you nice to her?

483
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,518
Isabel Mary McFetridge!

484
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,474
As a matter of fact, when I wasn't
in the jungle I was very nice to her.

485
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,478
I even named a new species
after her.

486
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,750
Is that true? What was it?

487
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,713
- A parasitic wasp.
- A wasp?

488
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,876
I named it <i>Protus Carolinus.</i>

489
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,632
The resemblance was uncanny.

490
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,752
You laugh now, but that was
one very dangerous wasp.

491
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,076
After it stings you, it hires a lawyer.

492
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,634
Ah, well. Pub's open.

493
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,994
Finish up as you like.
I'll clean it off later.

494
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,555
Well, yes. Thank you very much.

495
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,036
She's lonely, too.

496
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,749
The winds whistle down the glens
at 150 miles an hour.

497
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,757
150...

498
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,873
My Uncle Donald,
he had one ear bigger than the other,

499
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,871
and when the winds blew, it would
corkscrew him down into the ground.

500
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,230
- Your good health, son.
- Good health.

501
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,476
Stuart, same?

502
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,150
Hello there, Adrian.
What can I get you?

503
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,716
Nothing, thank you very much.
I'm all right.

504
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,077
Could I just say that you are looking
particularly lovely this evening?

505
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,633
Thank you.

506
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,637
- Will you marry me?
- Oh, no!

507
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,159
Not tonight.

508
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,275
Besides, I make it a rule never to
marry anyone who asks me in a bar.

509
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,391
Very wise.

510
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,871
Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind
passing these on to Dr Dempsey

511
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,638
to take back to America.

512
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,229
The hotel had a few
of Dr Abernathy's...

513
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,637
Of course. But if you want him,
he's in the kitchen.

514
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,078
No, thanks. I've had enough of
the great and world-famous Dr Dinky.

515
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,673
I have everything you wanted.
Photos, printouts, sonar readings.

516
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,758
Yes. I realise that.

517
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,712
I win.

518
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,559
I will see you
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

519
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,959
How do you do that?
You realise that is twelve in a row?

520
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,435
I tell you what.
Here, close your eyes.

521
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,713
I just want to shuffle them up here,
so they're a little different.

522
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,516
All right, go ahead, open.

523
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,955
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You give up?

524
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,879
You don't have a queen.

525
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,550
- How do you do that?
- I saw it in the mirror.

526
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,119
Yeah...

527
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,630
Let me just teach you
one more game here, all right?

528
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,513
Here we go.
Five cards, pick them up.

529
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,797
No beastie.

530
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,078
No beastie!

531
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,358
<i>(echoes)</i> That's a fact!

532
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,757
<i>(echoes)</i> Dr Dipstick says so!

533
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,033
Fact.

534
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,833
All right, I'll raise you four.

535
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,356
You're bluffing again, Mr Dempsey.

536
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,075
That is a miracle.
Absolutely amazing. Good for you.

537
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,192
Look, Mummy. Mr Dempsey
taught me how to play poker.

538
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,312
Mr Dempsey says he'll take me
to Disneyland some day.

539
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,751
Forget Disneyland,
we're going to Vegas, kiddo.

540
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,634
- Bed, please, Izzy. Now.
- May I kiss Mr Dempsey goodnight?

541
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,198
You can.

542
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,799
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

543
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,959
- Thank you for playing with me.
- Thanks for taking my money.

544
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,119
- You taught her poker?
- Yes... Yeah, I did.

545
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,790
I'm sorry if I did wrong,
but do you have any idea

546
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,675
the odds against somebody
winning that many times in a row?

547
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,190
She inherited it
from her grandmother.

548
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,315
- Grandma was a card shark?
- No. The ability to see things.

549
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,637
They call it
St Columba's Gift round here.

550
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,513
Yeah.
Whatever it is, I could use some.

551
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,759
Her grandmother...
she could read tea leaves,

552
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,669
and she could tell you whether
your baby would be a boy or a girl.

553
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,440
I didn't inherit it, but little Izzy did.

554
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,074
The only thing I got from
my grandmother was bad eyes.

555
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,589
Oh, no. I think you have nice...

556
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,753
What...

557
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,111
What I meant was
that I'm far-sighted.

558
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,953
This bag is for you. It has the rest
of Dr Abernathy's things in it.

559
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,516
Adrian thought that you could...
take it back with you.

560
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,156
- Right.
- Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

561
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,793
John.

562
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,273
All right. I'll see you in the morning.
Sleep well.

563
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,031
Will you be hurt very much when
Mr Dempsey goes home tomorrow?

564
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,392
- Of course not. What a question!
- Perhaps he won't go.

565
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,160
Why do you say that?

566
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,033
Because I don't want him to
and nor do you.

567
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,231
Isabel, what makes you think that?

568
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,955
You look at him.
I've never seen you do that.

569
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,755
Of course I look at him.
What else am I supposed to do?

570
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,316
Be pleasant to guests,
but don't make them your friends.

571
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,478
- I've told you that before.
- Yes, Mummy.

572
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,114
- Now go to sleep, please.
- Yes, Mummy.

573
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,108
And stop saying "Yes, Mummy"
like that. He's a guest, that's all!

574
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,788
Don't give me that
"I know what you're thinking" look.

575
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,912
- He'll stay if you ask him.
- Good night.

576
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,953
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

577
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,119
If they do, use dynamite.
Mr Dempsey taught me that.

578
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,598
<i>(tapping)</i>

579
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,074
Problem?

580
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,669
Yeah...
I don't seem to have the knack.

581
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,519
It has a slight
Highlands temperament.

582
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,473
It needs a little encouragement here.

583
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,433
- Need any help?
- Air has to be taken out of the pipes.

584
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,916
Can you watch the taps
and tell me when the water arrives?

585
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,758
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. I'm a PhD.

586
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,158
- Yeah, I hear something.
- Aye, it's running, touch wood.

587
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,508
Touch wood?
Back home, we knock on it.

588
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,190
You'll be leaving us in the morning.
Will you be requiring breakfast?

589
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,516
No, thanks.

590
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,318
Well, you know,
it's included in the price.

591
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,670
I realise that.

592
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,155
Well, if you want to,
you can always change your mind.

593
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,476
- About what?
- Breakfast.

594
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,159
Right.

595
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,919
We're going out again. Let's go.
Bring your pillow, but let's go.

596
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,874
Tell me, where were you the night
Abernathy got himself killed?

597
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,516
- I was at the Moffat Arms.
- But he left alone, right?

598
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,111
Aye. He'd had a few malts.
He wouldn't let me drive him home.

599
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,232
- But then he wouldn't have seen it.
- Seen what?

600
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,437
That is the last photo on his roll.

601
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,672
And that is not
the tail of a diving otter.

602
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,917
It's not a vegetable mat.
I don't know what it is.

603
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,633
But I tell you something.

604
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,278
My guess is it's part of something
very large and very much alive.

605
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,480
- Why do people keep doing this?
- Some people don't respect the loch.

606
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,432
They upset the waters.

607
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,192
<i>(Mr Dempsey)</i> Somehow it got by us.

608
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,789
Maybe it's hiding.

What are they?

610
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,758
Salmon.

611

Look at them all.

612
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,917
You notice anything unusual
about them?

613
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,712
Like what?

614
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,672
Like they weren't there yesterday.

Like where the hell
did they come from?

616

Is that more salmon?

617
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,869
You see, that's a separate object
chasing the salmon.

618
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,759
Three feet.

- Eel. Could be a conger eel.
- Yeah...

No, that's still coming.

621

No, that's a big vertebrate.
Sturgeon, yeah?

622
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,270
- Sturgeon, maybe.
- It's still coming.

623

That's 17... That's 40 feet long!

Yeah, maybe. No, no, no!

You stay right where you are.
I'm going to call a doctor.

You don't have to do that.

- Yes, I did. I think I did.

764
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,272
Turn the light off. It scares them.

765
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,111
Be very still.

766

- Listen.

Just for yourself.
That's all that matters.

Use people as long as you get
what you want.

Using me, I should've known better,
but to use a child?

- It wasn't like that.
- What? She nearly drowned.

- Laura...
- Don't you touch me.

- Don't you dare touch me.
- All right, all right.

Look what I have.
Come on, look at it.

810
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,313
You've got your precious monster.
Got your Scottish souvenir.

811
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,433
- I hope you got your money's worth.
- A man's here.

01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,879
No, I can't.

813
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,996
It's a convergent subspecies.

814
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,158
It's a hybrid of plesiosaur
and elasmosaur.

815
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,390
You actually saw this?

816
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,195
Now, wait a minute, John.
Hold on a minute.

817
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,597
You're saying that
this is a real thing you saw?

818
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,671
No, I don't believe it.

819
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:39,589
I can't believe it. It's not possible.
I don't believe it.

820
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,554
You saw it, didn't you? You did?
All right...

821
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,432
I believe it!

822
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,758
I knew it had to be there.
I knew there was something.

823
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,071
- You told anyone?
- No.

824

- You sure?
- Yeah.

825
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,398
Let's keep it quiet
till after the press conference.

826
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,390
I'll call London, have a symposium
at the Royal Academy tomorrow.

827
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,318
- You have a suit?
- Yeah.

828
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,317
- You have a suit?
- No!

829

There'll be no extra charge for sex.
That's a service I offer all my guests.

835
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,717
- Let me explain.
- About what?

836
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,469
- This is crazy.
- You've solved your mystery. Leave.

837
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,752
No, I found a colony
of prehistoric animals. Look at this.

838
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,428
- They're alive!
- I'm very happy for you.

839
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,519
It's not just for me,
this is gonna be good for all of us.

840
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,598
Come on, you'll have scientists,
marine biologists,

841
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,837
every lab and university in the world
will stay here.

842
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,272
When the loch becomes Marine Land
with the kelpie performing tricks?

843
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,597
- No. This is science.
- How do you stop it?

844
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,193
There'll be ten million nature lovers
queuing for a McNessie burger!

845
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:07,554
You want me to ignore this?
To pretend I didn't see this?

846
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,116
- That's up to you.
- Come on... Look at this.

847
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,995
- I've waited my entire life for this.
- Good.

848
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:19,079
- You're not even looking at it!
- I don't want to look at them!

849
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,113
I don't want to know
anything about them.

850
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:27,440
There's some things that are...
meant to be left alone.

851
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,429
I would've thought
that you would've understood that.

852
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,750
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

853
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,915
Where's Isabel?

854
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,315
She doesn't want to see you.

855
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,909
She trusted you, John.

856
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,790
Here, have three drams, laddie,

857

Hi, Izzy.

860
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,600
Why did you do it?
You scared it away.

861
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,078
- They'll never come back.
- Look... Yes, they will.

862
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,833
I'm sorry, don't be upset.
It's not your fault.

863
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,635
- It is my fault. I did wrong.
- No, you didn't.

864
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,391
No. See, it's not something that
you and I can just keep to ourselves.

865
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,754
- We have to share it with everybody.
- Why? I only wanted to show you.

866
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,269
I thought you liked me.

867
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,955
I do like you.

868
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,429
Are you going?

869
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,037
I would do anything not to hurt you.

870
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,788
You gotta believe me, Izzy.
It's just that I don't know what...

871
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,353
See, there's...

872
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,073
There's nothing I can do right now.

873
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,156
I know.

874
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,549
Hey, by tomorrow morning,

875
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,072
you just may be the most famous
man in the whole world.

876
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,315
I need a drink. You want anything?

877
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,478
I don't drink. I'm gonna take up
windsurfing, though.

878
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,468
The Royal Academy's too small. I got
the Natural History Museum instead.

879
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,319
No, no.
I'm not blowing off Larry King.

880
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,798
I'm saying it's fine if we can do it
by satellite. Get the phone!

881
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,274
Hello?

882
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,554
Have another. It's a celebration.

883
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,753
If you're gonna hang my head
from a horse's mane, get it over with.

884
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,235
No, sir, I wouldn't do that now.

885
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,637
No, you've beaten the loch.

886
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,308
There's no disputing that.

887
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,229
Savour it, is my advice. May I?

888
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:45,509
Yes... let's see, 1953 was
the first time that I went to London.

889
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,075
I didn't think too much of it.

890
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,592
And I thought to myself

891
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,554
if ever I went back, it would
have to be for a very good reason.

892
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,833
We both know why you're here,
so let's not play games.

893
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:08,430
We cannot let the survival
of the last specimens of the Ice Age

894
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,792
depend solely on the work of
one man, it doesn't make any sense.

895
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,878
Science can take care of them
professionally.

896
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,868
- The sad thing is you believe that.
- Yes. Yes, I do.

897
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,870
It wasn't exactly science
that helped your discovery, was it?

898
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,231
It was a wee girl. Nine years of age.

899
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,998
And wasn't it your precious science
that gave us

900
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:39,275
all this acid rain and pollution
and warming air in the first place?

901
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:49,268
These creatures have survived
for 15,000 years without your help.

902
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,109
What makes you think
that you're so special?

903
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,234
I...

904
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,913
This is very hard for me.

905
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,075
I'm a proud man.

906
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,910
And I have never asked anybody
for anything in my life...

907
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,476
as I'm asking you now.

908
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,679
Don't do this, Mr Dempsey.

909
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,871
Ah, well.

910
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,192
Well, I have a loch to tend to.

911
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,398

- Let's go. "Lead on, Macduff."
- Certainly.

919
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,430
I've seen two miracles now.
One is a man rising from the dead.

920
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,394
- It's good to be alive again, Bob.
- Nice suit, John.

921
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,635
Thank you, Doctor Binns.

922
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,278
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

923
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:47,029
When I began
my expedition to the loch,

924
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,879
it was based only on a hunch.

925
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,878
But so many discoveries
have been made

926
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,393
by using a little imagination and...
bending the rules.

927
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,558
Like Newton and Galileo.

928
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,153
With this in mind, I asked my colleague,
Dr Johnathan Dempsey,

929
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:12,036
to concentrate his efforts on
the scientific enigma of Loch Ness.

930
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:16,392
I'll ask him now to present you
with his findings. Dr Dempsey.

931
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,152
I used to dream about this
when I was a kid.

932
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,755
But I have to admit, this is...

933
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,151
much more overwhelming
than I thought it would be.

934
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,670
I'd like to say
that I wouldn't be here today

935
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:57,238
if it weren't for the confidence and
trust of the architect of this study,

936
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,919
Dr Robert Mercer.

937
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:22,997
Ladies and gentlemen,
the mystery of Loch Ness solved.

938
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,038
<i>Nessasaurus Marus.</i>

941
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,229
- Did they balls up the slides?
- What's going on?

942
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,428
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry. I apologise.

943
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,154
Ladies and gentlemen...
Sit down, Bob. Sit down.

944
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,112
I cancelled dinner for this.

945
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,788
- It's all right. Just a mistake.
- I hope so.

946
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,996
When you see this next picture,
I hope you ask yourself the question:

947
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:10,671
- "Where's Waldo?"
- Waldo? What's Waldo?

948
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,598
<i>(barrage of questions)</i>

949
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,910
As far as we're concerned,
this is purely the Americans.

950
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,829
Who's Waldo?
I have no idea who Waldo is!

951
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,317
Listen. The whole thing was
a ridiculous hoax. I never saw them.

952
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,798
I had the pictures made up
by computer before I even came.

953
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,234
Please...

954
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:02,156
John, you are either the biggest
bloody fool that ever lived,

955
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,036
or you are the biggest
bloody fool that ever lived.

956
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,238
Thank you.

957
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,436
Thank you for everything.

958
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,074
- Where are you going?
- Home.

959
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,839
Good luck.

He saw the pictures.

962
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,069
Tell Dr Binns about the photos.

963
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,190
What photos would they be, exactly?

964
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,558
Well...?

965
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,157

- There's a car blocking the drive.

01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,271
Do you realise
that you're blocking the drive?

974
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,152
I do now.

975
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:05,480
Well, what do you intend
to do about it?

976

What would you like me
to do about it?
