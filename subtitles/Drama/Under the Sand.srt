1
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:23,505
Switch!

2
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:32,280
Switch!

3
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,454
Switch!

4
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,392
Crixus!

5
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:48,129
Did you not hear my instruction?

6
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:49,864
Apologies, Doctore.

7
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,467
I did not mean to
scare the rabbit.

8
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,305
<i>The games of the
magistrate approach.</i>

9
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,642
Listen carefully
to my instruction,

10
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:02,944
and every man chosen

11
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:04,646
will see victory in the arena.

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,884
Perhaps not every man.

13
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,352
Pietros.

14
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:13,788
Save the water for
men who deserve it.

15
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,033
Rain! By Jupiter's cock,

16
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,035
would you fucking rain!

17
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,972
What are you doing?

18
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:32,841
Praying.

19
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,442
Blaspheming.

20
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,012
The two are narrowly separated
in these trying times.

21
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,949
Perhaps the gap widens...

22
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:42,617
More creditors, seeking action?

23
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:43,618
Something of more cheerful note,

24
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:44,919
recently delivered...

25
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,959
From magistrate Calavius!

26
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,996
He is coming here to personally

27
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:56,731
select men for his games!

28
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,100
Games to appease the
gods and end the drought!

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,468
The biggest games
since Theokoles

30
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,337
bested 100 men in the arena!

31
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,571
But why come himself? Unless...

32
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,976
The Primus.

33
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:10,345
If we were to secure the
main event at these games...

34
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:11,579
He arrives within the hour.

35
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:14,916
Prepare food.

36
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,651
And gather all the
water we have.

37
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,719
Quintus, your robe...

38
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,454
Uh, it's nothing.

39
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:20,555
Fetch the Medicus.

40
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,490
Lucretia..

41
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,161
I should talk to the
magistrate about it.

42
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,163
Those men tried to kill you,
an honest man.

43
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:30,665
In a dishonest place.

44
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:33,334
No, we won't concern the
magistrate with these things,

45
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:34,802
not with the Primus
in the balance.

46
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,441
I'll tend to the
matter myself, um.

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,414
That was the mark
of one of the slaves

48
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,182
who tried to kill Batiatus.

49
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,255
The mark is unknown to me.

50
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,256
Perhaps a closer look...

51
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,161
Details of such craftsmanship

52
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,796
should not be viewed in haste.

53
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:09,637
I may have seen a
similar mark...

54
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:10,637
Ahh.

55
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:14,642
So, what do you think?

56
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,512
You adorn them like a god.

57
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:18,780
I would be out of them...

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,215
And deep into you...

59
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,851
Apologies.

60
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,720
Magistrate Calavius arrives.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,923
Our fortunes rise,
like your cock.

62
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:32,994
Stay wet and we'll make
it rain presently... ohhh.

63
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,666
Magistrate!

64
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,134
You do us honor with your...

65
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:43,605
Presence!

66
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:44,906
Good Batiatus!
I was telling Solonius

67
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:47,408
how I knew your father.

68
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,510
Now there was a true roman.

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,048
A great man,
none of his like to follow.

70
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:56,084
I will attempt to fill your
needs as he would have.

71
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:57,852
To business then.

72
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,589
As you well know,
the drought has parched the city

73
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,591
to the point of madness.

74
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,160
We've tried everything to
tempted the skies into tears,

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,796
even to the point of hecatombe.

76
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:11,165
A hundred cattle sacrificed,
and yet not a drop.

77
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,567
Because the gods do not
want the blood of cattle.

78
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,002
They want the blood of men!

79
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,370
Good Solonius has
been kind enough

80
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,438
to lend a hand in
organizing games

81
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:19,173
to appease their appetite.

82
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:21,309
It will be sine missione.

83
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:23,044
No draw. No mercy shown.

84
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,412
Only the finest gladiators

85
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:27,548
will be invited to participate.

86
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,584
Only the finest are offered
in the House of Batiatus.

87
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,087
Come, examine my wares.

88
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,196
An impressive selection,

89
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:45,199
rivaling that of good
Solonius himself.

90
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,634
Yet I have the Primus.

91
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,603
Half.

92
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:50,605
Your opponent still
to be chosen.

93
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:51,939
If you wish to appease the gods,

94
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,042
you must have one upon the sands

95
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,577
Crixus the Champion of Capua,

96
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,514
will willing fight anyone
that Solonius has to offer.

97
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,049
Excellent!

98
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,252
It will truly be a
contest between legends!

99
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,588
Legends?

100
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,890
Oh, did I fail to mention?

101
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,528
Good Solonius has secured
Theokoles for the Primus!

102
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,662
Theokoles?

103
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,831
I managed to coax him
to our fair city,

104
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,499
at great expense.

105
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,301
With our gratitude.

106
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,370
If the gods fail to grant
us rain with such a tribute,

107
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,805
then we are surely cursed.

108
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,673
I fear the gods
will be displeased.

109
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,408
The match is unbalanced.

110
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:29,677
Only one man Theokoles

111
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,079
and lived.

112
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:36,084
What if Crixus were joined
by your man Spartacus?

113
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,186
His death was fated
in execution,

114
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:40,722
yet he refuse to own it.

115
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:44,258
And cost me four men
in his defiance.

116
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:47,328
Your debts are well known,
Batiatus.

117
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:48,463
Even if you lose the men,

118
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,732
the purse is enough to
hold off your creditors,

119
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:53,234
for a moment.

120
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,836
Unless of course
you would rather

121
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:55,903
sit out these games

122
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:57,305
or any others that follow,
which...

123
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,240
No. I will set my
men to the task.

124
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,884
My titans!

125
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,519
Pause, and hear glorious news!

126
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,358
Magistrate Titus Calavius
has invited our best men

127
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:20,628
to fight in his Primus!

128
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:21,796
Crixus!

129
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:22,797
Step forward!

130
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,069
Spartacus! Step forward.

131
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,944
You have been chosen
to fight as one...

132
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:39,947
Against Theokoles,
the shadow of death!

133
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:53,394
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

134
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:54,662
Fuck! Ow!

135
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,164
Shit! Fuck!

136
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,865
Ow! Ow! Shit!

137
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,067
Fuck! Ow! Ow!

138
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,542
I think you two will
make a fine couple.

139
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:12,313
I'd rather fight without him.

140
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,314
And die the same.

141
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,350
This Theokoles.

142
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:19,854
The legends can't be true.

143
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,290
He's en cut a thousand
times in the arena,

144
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,191
he's never fallen.

145
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:27,128
I fear you would have
been safer in the pits.

146
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,064
If we were to win,

147
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:33,234
how large would be the purse?

148
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:36,437
Large enough to wrest ten
wives from the syrian.

149
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,746
You send them to certain death.

150
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:47,315
Let me fight in their stead.

151
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:48,416
That's an excellent suggestion.

152
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,817
I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.

153
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,319
You were not requested!

154
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,587
Look, no one has
forgotten how bravely

155
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,322
you fought against Theokoles,
old friend.

156
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:56,090
Yet without victory.

157
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,092
You stand the only man to face
him in the arena and live.

158
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,627
That in itself is a victory.

159
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:02,997
Set your purpose to
the task of training

160
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,599
Crixus and Spartacus
for the match.

161
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,868
I fear no amount will save them

162
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,502
from the shadow's grasp.

163
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,204
Then prepare them for
a glorious death.

164
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,780
The brand belonged to Remus,
a slave trader

165
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,782
plying wares north of the city.

166
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,184
Remus? The name holds
no recognition.

167
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:24,585
Nor to I. Yet,

168
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:28,122
if I were to purchase a slave,
intent on foul designs...

169
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:30,057
Then it would be
from outside Capua,

170
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,493
to avoid simple discovery.

171
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,795
Find Remus and bring him.

172
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,530
I would have conversation.

173
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,665
Dominus.

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,674
Water.

175
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,181
From Domina.

176
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,850
To help with your training.

177
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,228
Wait a moment.

178
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,633
To what purpose?

179
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,437
Need there be one?

180
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,942
You shouldn't look
at me in that way.

181
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,814
I try with all my
strength not to.

182
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:27,915
But I am weak.

183
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,625
Sleep, then.

184
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,660
And regain your strength.

185
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,172
I seek no quarrel.

186
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,441
Your presence here
would state otherwise.

187
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,076
We've had our differences.

188
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,177
I own my part in them.

189
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,678
Yet if we are to
defeat Theokoles..

190
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:58,428
We?

191
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,083
There is no such
thing in the arena.

192
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:06,687
You believe you can
slay the giant?

193
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:07,888
Alone?

194
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,757
As I always stand.

195
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:11,092
This time you do not.

196
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:15,329
When Theokoles falls,
the glory will be mine.

197
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:17,098
And if we do not come
to common ground,

198
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,335
the death shared will be ours.

199
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:38,386
Oh. As if they stand
chance against Theokoles.

200
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,421
Um. Perhaps the gods
will favor them.

201
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:42,456
Yes, and perhaps I
should sprout wings

202
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,392
and flutter off.

203
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:46,994
The odds lay a thousand
to one against them.

204
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,697
No man has ever won
betting against Crixus.

205
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,234
I would lay coin
towards their victory.

206
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:56,670
A fool's wager.

207
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,339
Happily received.

208
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,245
You leave without words.

209
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,446
None to give.

210
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:07,581
Each time you step
beyond these walls,

211
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:09,683
I fear for you and what...

212
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:11,485
Grab hold of your
cock and be a man!

213
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,358
I do what I must, Pietros.

214
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:18,292
I'll return soon.

215
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,506
Mind the birds.

216
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,009
Pietros!

217
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,111
Weapons!

218
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:47,488
Ilithyia?

219
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,356
She comes at my invitation.

220
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:50,624
Now's not the time
to be entertaining

221
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,093
that spoiled little bitch.

222
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,994
Her father Albinius holds
the magistrate's ear.

223
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,229
If he were to place
a word in it,

224
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:57,431
then Crixus may be
replaced in the Primus.

225
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,867
He could place a thousand
and to no result.

226
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,769
Solonius maneuvered you.

227
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,370
With the aid of the magistrate!

228
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,139
Refuse and we would
quickly find ourselves

229
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,874
excluded from the
arena altogether.

230
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:08,042
And if Crixus falls?

231
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,610
Who will be our champion?

232
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,879
Who will the crowds clamor to
see from the House of Batiatus?

233
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,981
Not Spartacus,
that thing from the pits?

234
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,018
Your guest arrives.

235
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,453
Do not broach the
subject with her.

236
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:22,790
Ilithyia!

237
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,426
You do us honor
with your presence.

238
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,795
I would trade honor for water.

239
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,034
Ah, the heat is a thing living,
crawling down the throat.

240
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,637
Well, let us quench that thirst.

241
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,105
I must to tend to
business of the games.

242
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,707
I leave you in loving hands.

243
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,911
Is it true, then? What?

244
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:47,248
Crixus and Spartacus
face the shadow of death?

245
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,249
They do.

246
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,852
Blood will surely
flow on the day.

247
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:55,055
I long to see it pour
from the thracian.

248
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,372
You attack as you would a man.

249
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,508
Theokoles is beyond flesh.

250
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,977
Beyond blood and bone.

251
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:20,314
He is the shadow
that precedes death.

252
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:23,684
Allow him to fall
upon you alone...

253
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:26,120
And you are dead.

254
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,655
Now rise,

255
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,890
and come at me as one!

256
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,495
Give way, you fuck!

257
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,063
The advantage was mine!

258
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,180
How Crixus moves.

259
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,218
The way his muscles
catch the sun...

260
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,357
Truly the Champion of Capua.

261
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,460
None to his equal.

262
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,999
You jostle and trip over
the other like fools.

263
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,601
You face Theokoles
in the Primus!

264
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,472
Prove yourselves worthy!

265
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,092
Pathetic.

266
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,695
I crave a closer look.

267
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,100
Can we go down among them?

268
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,639
My husband would never allow it.

269
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,341
The bowels of a
ludus are no place

270
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,577
for a senator's daughter.

271
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,747
A private viewing then,
in the villa?

272
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:03,984
I would pay for it, of course.

273
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:07,388
A favor amongst friends.

274
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:10,124
You must let me return it, then.

275
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:12,259
I've given thought
to your problem,

276
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,595
and have discovered solution.

277
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,829
Problem...?

278
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,267
Children.

279
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,535
Yes.

280
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:24,571
I've heard of a woman,
a priestess of Juno,

281
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,641
blessed with certain
gifts of fertility.

282
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,943
Many prominent
women speak of her.

283
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:33,747
Servillia, Cornelia, Laelia..

284
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:34,882
Ovidius' wife?

285
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,250
You know her?

286
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,452
Oh, in passing.
She has a small boy.

287
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:40,087
And would have none,
if not touched

288
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,823
by the woman I speak of.

289
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:45,492
Will you let me
arrange it for you?

290
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,761
As a gift for your hospitality?

291
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,203
We are friends, aren't we?

292
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:57,471
The very best.

293
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,612
How are we to fare
against Theokoles,

294
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,047
when we cannot
even best Doctore?

295
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,850
I could have bested
him a dozen times,

296
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,719
if you'd not gotten underfoot.

297
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,555
I take the sands beside
you in this fight, Crixus.

298
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:15,622
Just because you stand beside me

299
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:16,824
with sword and shield,

300
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,360
do not mistake yourself
as a gladiator.

301
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,629
I fight to honor these walls,
you fight to leave them.

302
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:25,499
You fight...

303
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:28,469
Because you are a slave.

304
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:29,536
Like me.

305
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:30,771
No.

306
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,106
Not like you.

307
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,308
I accept my place here.

308
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:35,676
I embrace it.

309
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:36,844
But you...

310
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:39,580
You still dream of a
life beyond the arena.

311
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,482
Where that wife of yours
we've all heard about

312
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,450
is still nestled by your side.

313
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,853
And that is all it is,
Spartacus.

314
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:49,423
A dream and one day soon you
will awaken to the truth.

315
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:55,028
You will never leave this place.

316
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:58,132
And your wife if she's
not dead already,

317
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,101
has been fucked to madness
by a hundred roman cocks.

318
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,660
Get yourselves cleaned up.

319
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,163
Domina requests your presence.

320
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:30,631
Both of you.

321
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,913
Do you know who I am, thracian?

322
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:51,605
Speak.

323
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,723
I have seen you.

324
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:59,960
With Legatus Glaber.

325
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,995
I am his wife.

326
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,135
He is regrettably abroad,

327
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:11,772
and will not be able to witness
your death against Theokoles.

328
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,544
But...

329
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:24,685
I shall whisper of it to him,

330
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:28,922
replaying the moment

331
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:31,391
when we are entwined in our bed.

332
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,666
Apologies.

333
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,034
I require the
thracian for a moment.

334
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,837
Extend it by a lifetime.

335
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:44,938
I am done with him.

336
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,608
My office.

337
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:54,281
The Champion of Capua!

338
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,717
A rare honor to receive
a private audience.

339
00:18:56,717 --> 00:19:00,354
One I am most appreciative of.

340
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:01,955
Although,

341
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:08,395
he does seem a touch
overdressed for the occasion.

342
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,330
Your subligaria. Remove it.

343
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:26,113
Your champion is
bold to his purpose.

344
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:27,147
I take my leave.

345
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,804
His flesh is so hard...

346
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,716
Like marble.

347
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:14,461
Would that every man
were carved so...

348
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,266
We'd best not keep him.

349
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,736
His training resumes
at first light.

350
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,238
Do you think he will survive,
against the shadow?

351
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,544
Only the gods know.

352
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:34,715
It would be pity to
see such a man marred.

353
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,127
Perhaps there is a way to
see such a tragedy averted.

354
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,332
If your father where to
speak to the magistrate.

355
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,935
Perhaps... to what end?

356
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,772
To seeing Crixus
replaced in the games.

357
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,244
Is that what you want?

358
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,947
Do you fear entering the
arena with Theokoles?

359
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,721
I long for it.

360
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,027
As I long to see it.

361
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,734
You survived being dragged
from your homeland

362
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:28,634
by Legatus Glaber,

363
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:35,008
you survived execution by
four gladiators in the arena.

364
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:37,778
You even survived the
horror of the pits.

365
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,588
Can you survive this?

366
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:51,458
Crixus and I fight
at cross-purposes.

367
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,360
Then find a way to unite them.

368
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,731
You may have saved my life,

369
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,366
but yours is yet worth
little in the arena.

370
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:00,801
But to loose Crixus
along with you

371
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,736
that would be a blow
from which this ludus

372
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:05,038
would not recover.

373
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,641
My concern is only for my wife.

374
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,376
And her fate is
tied to these walls.

375
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,877
If they collapse around me,

376
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,847
then I will be unable to help
her from beneath the rubble.

377
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,752
I will not die
until she is safe.

378
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:19,953
Well, prove it so.

379
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,855
Fight as one with Crixus,
to best Theokoles.

380
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:24,324
Or we are all fucked.

381
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,560
Yes.

382
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,502
Barca has returned,
bearing gifts.

383
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,073
Remove him to the barracks.

384
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:55,021
Two slaves, broken by your hand,

385
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:56,957
made attempt on my life.

386
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:58,158
Who purchased them?

387
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:00,293
I know not of what you speak...

388
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,029
I speak of being fucked.

389
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,664
By the gods, by the magistrate,

390
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:08,869
by that cock suck Solonius
and his grinning schemes!

391
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,605
I'm of proud family!

392
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:15,408
A family of means and history,
you fucking cunt!

393
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,445
You sold the men!

394
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:21,648
Common slaves,

395
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:25,418
who tried to kill me,
tried to fuck me like a whore!

396
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:28,221
But I will not be fucked!

397
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:29,222
I! Will! Not!

398
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:30,590
Not! Be! Fucked!

399
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,460
You fuck you...

400
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,162
You fucking hemorrhoid

401
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:38,532
sucking fuck, you fuck!

402
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,839
Ovidius.

403
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,207
What?

404
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:49,009
Ovidius...

405
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,610
Sold...

406
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,946
To Ovidius...

407
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,519
There was that so fucking hard?

408
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,755
Ovidius' cousin
is the magistrate.

409
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:03,356
He could be cousin
to Jupiter himself,

410
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:05,492
I don't give a shit.

411
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:07,227
I will have satisfaction.

412
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,932
You dishonor me.

413
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:14,067
The thracian impedes my attack.

414
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,435
I seek to strengthen it.

415
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:16,736
I seek no aid.

416
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:19,906
No, you need the gods to descend

417
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:22,209
and fight by your side!

418
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:24,377
Even then victory is doubtful.

419
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,350
Words, falling on deaf ears.

420
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,257
Attend your eyes, then...

421
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,102
My failure.

422
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:50,837
Your lesson.

423
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,678
His first cut...

424
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:04,217
Dealt when I thought
him vulnerable.

425
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,686
And pressed my attack unwisely.

426
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:11,791
His next assault..

427
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,594
Came as I fell back

428
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,630
to regain position....

429
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,902
Yet these wounds are nothing.

430
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,439
A game of blood,
to amuse the crowd.

431
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,909
And when he tires of playing,

432
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:33,713
he will move to
separate your head..

433
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:34,881
From your neck...

434
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:39,920
I live because I survived
longer than any man

435
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,056
that stood against him.

436
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:45,492
Some herald that as a victory.

437
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:48,295
I am not among them.

438
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,933
You tell us the
shadow wounds both

439
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,801
when he is pressed and
when he is given ground.

440
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:57,537
How will he to be defeated?

441
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:00,707
By accomplishing both at once.

442
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:01,808
Press...

443
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:03,443
And defend.

444
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:04,511
Distract...

445
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:05,979
And strike.

446
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,047
Fight as one.

447
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:11,751
Or die as two.

448
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:26,683
Now, show me the way to honor.

449
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:33,856
The games tomorrow,
and yet he presses them.

450
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,258
To their benefit.

451
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,229
I have business in town.

452
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,699
It'll take me until
late into the night.

453
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:45,568
Lucretia.

454
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:46,569
Um?

455
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:47,737
Business.

456
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:51,007
Yeah, business, I heard you.

457
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,911
If you would prefer I delay..

458
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:57,480
No, I have diversion.

459
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,116
Ilithyia's coming
with her priestess.

460
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:08,925
May the gods grant us miracle.

461
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:11,461
They fucking owe us something.

462
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,516
A word of advice, Spartacus.

463
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,020
At what cost?

464
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,288
Freely given.

465
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:40,590
Do not think you can come
to terms with Crixus.

466
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:45,028
I've trusted him
once in the arena

467
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,063
and this was the result...

468
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,934
He may as well have cut
the balls from my shaft.

469
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,973
He'd turn a sword
against his ally?

470
00:27:56,973 --> 00:28:00,076
Even Barca, if stood
between him and glory.

471
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,146
The only way to survive
against Theokoles

472
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:07,517
is to consider Crixus
an equal enemy.

473
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:38,147
How often do you
engage in intercourse?

474
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:39,749
Several times a week.

475
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,384
Sometimes more.

476
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,619
Has seed ever taken hold?

477
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,721
Never.

478
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:50,860
Have there been other men,
besides your husband?

479
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,966
What bearing does that have?

480
00:28:56,966 --> 00:29:00,837
Well it will inform the correct
combination of elements.

481
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:02,271
The ritual is usually
a private matter.

482
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:03,439
Perhaps..

483
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:07,210
Oh please, can I stay?

484
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,911
I've never seen one of these.

485
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,047
It's so intriguing.

486
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,452
Other men?

487
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:20,022
Have there been any?

488
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,022
Yes.

489
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:24,160
How many?

490
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,929
One. But frequently.

491
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,399
Then the difficulty
lies not with the seed,

492
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,033
but within the vessel.

493
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,640
You mean there's
something wrong with her?

494
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,643
The gods have decided to
withhold the joy of children.

495
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:42,712
But we will entreat
them to reconsider...

496
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,201
Drink.

497
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:15,411
Juno has blessed you.

498
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,980
You must copulate
within the hour.

499
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,449
So soon?

500
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:21,818
Before the flame
of life expires.

501
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:25,655
Good fortune be with you.

502
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,433
Only an hour?

503
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,635
You think she would have told
you that before she started,

504
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,404
considering her price.

505
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,572
Gratitude for arranging this.

506
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:45,775
Unnecessary words from a friend.

507
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:51,013
And I being yours, I'll leave
you to complete the ritual.

508
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:54,817
Although tales of this other man

509
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:59,689
will be most expected when
time is not at issue...

510
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:06,896
Why are the fucking
torches not lit?

511
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:08,264
Laelia...?

512
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,619
I owe you a debt, Ovidius.

513
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,087
I've come to repay.

514
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,560
Please.

515
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,129
The boy is unstained.

516
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,636
No child is unstained by
the deeds of his father.

517
00:31:46,636 --> 00:31:48,504
They are not my own.

518
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:50,973
Two slaves, sent from
Remus to take my life.

519
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:54,310
Do you deny giving
coin to the cause?

520
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,512
I hired the men, yes.

521
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,347
But to another's purpose.

522
00:31:58,347 --> 00:31:59,549
Whose?

523
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:05,855
Whose?

524
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:08,624
Speak the name,
and I swear to the gods

525
00:32:08,624 --> 00:32:10,326
I will not kill you.

526
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,099
Solonius.

527
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:20,202
He paid the balance
of your debt to me.

528
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:24,140
In exchange for me
arranging your death.

529
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:31,814
Gratitude for your honesty,
Ovidius.

530
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:34,216
You're not going
to kill me, then?

531
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:35,451
No.

532
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,022
My slave is going to kill you.

533
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,611
Burn this fucking
place to the ground.

534
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,779
But first...

535
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,281
Take care of the child.

536
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,591
You were right.

537
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,362
I do not honor these walls.

538
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,099
A fact well known.

539
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:26,736
Has it always been so for you?

540
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,941
When you were brought
here for the first time,

541
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,377
against your will?

542
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:38,114
Your life traded
for a few coins?

543
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:43,052
More than a few.

544
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,487
Is that your worth, then?

545
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:52,228
Has it ever occurred to you

546
00:33:52,228 --> 00:33:53,663
why the great Theokoles

547
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:55,331
would grace us
with his presence?

548
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:00,169
A promise of wealth.

549
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:05,808
The shadow has earned
a thousand fortunes.

550
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,711
He comes here not for coin,

551
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:10,680
he comes here for the glory

552
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,648
of facing the Champion of Capua.

553
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:15,785
The Undefeated Gaul.

554
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:19,909
Glory.

555
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,492
There is no greater thing,

556
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:25,428
than standing victorious arena.

557
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,935
Is there no purpose
beyond the blood?

558
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:37,373
No dream beyond the
cheering crowd?

559
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:39,975
Is there nothing
else you fight for?

560
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,980
Crixus, you are summoned.

561
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,307
Step into the light.

562
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:17,446
Let me gaze upon the
Champion of Capua.

563
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,819
You are truly a wonder.

564
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:24,854
As are you, Domina.

565
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:32,661
We don't have much time and
I would see it well used.

566
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,734
Do I not stir you to passion?

567
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:40,069
Yes, Domina.

568
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,943
Your cock would disagree.

569
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:50,246
Excuse my distraction Domina.

570
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,280
I have thoughts of tomorrow.

571
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:59,955
I would have you in the moment,
deep inside me.

572
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,794
I've never faced an
opponent like Theokoles...

573
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:09,665
And he has never meet
a man like you...

574
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,540
I beg a favor Domina.

575
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,508
Love makes a man
weak before battle...

576
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,527
I would have you strong.

577
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,433
We will forgo the pleasures
of a single evening,

578
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,602
and pray to the gods
for many more to come.

579
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:56,585
Domina.

580
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:26,809
You are going to die
tomorrow aren't you?

581
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,412
Only the gods divine the future.

582
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:36,051
Why didn't you let
Ilithyia help you?

583
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,120
She could have spoken
to her father..

584
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,755
To what end?

585
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,359
Humiliation?

586
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:49,832
Honor and glory.

587
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,267
That's all you care about,
isn't it?

588
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,344
Not all.

589
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,920
Still the fool.

590
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,824
Still.

591
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:25,935
You said love drains a man.

592
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:32,174
It can give him hope,
in the right arms...

593
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,195
The odds do not favor you.

594
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,131
They seldom do.

595
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,102
I've heard Barca has laid

596
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:02,104
a large amount of coin on you.

597
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:04,907
More towards Crixus,
but still...

598
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:06,208
And you?

599
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:14,950
If I had the means,
I would wager all with Barca.

600
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,020
You're too fucking
stubborn to die.

601
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,092
Every man has his end.

602
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:27,763
I pray to the gods you
have not yet reached yours.

603
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:33,936
If they do not answer,

604
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,407
I would ask a thing of you.

605
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:41,443
I will do everything
I can to find her.

606
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:49,184
Now sleep.

607
00:39:49,184 --> 00:39:50,719
Tomorrow you face a legend.

608
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,990
And may yet become one yourself.

609
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,147
Did you see it?!

610
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:21,150
Septimus the victor, as I said!

611
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,053
Valarius always drops his
shield when he attacks,

612
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:26,688
a disadvantage
against the spear.

613
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:28,223
The boy has a keen eye.

614
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:29,391
Towards gladiators, yes.

615
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:31,126
His studies are another matter.

616
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,138
My hour of glory is long past.

617
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:46,775
Yours stands before you.

618
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:48,210
Heel old wounds.

619
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,981
Kill that fucking
son of a whore.

620
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:02,091
Finally, the Primus.

621
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:04,860
Another moment and my
tongue would turn to dust.

622
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,580
Water.

623
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,597
Apologies, Domina.

624
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:10,966
We've used our last.

625
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,535
Please. Share some of mine.

626
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,338
You're too kind, good Solonius.

627
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:18,907
You'd do the same,
if you were able.

628
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:20,342
No matter.

629
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:23,979
Soon Theokoles will honor
the gods with blood,

630
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:26,882
they turn will bless
us with endless rain.

631
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:28,717
I pray for the truth in it.

632
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,320
This drought is
driving the city mad!

633
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,855
Unfortunate word has reached us

634
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:36,492
that our dearest cousin Ovidius
was murdered in his home.

635
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:41,296
Ovidius?

636
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:42,046
<i>No.</i>

637
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:46,635
I mentioned his wife
not a night ago.

638
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:47,870
What of his son?

639
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,539
He was so young.

640
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:54,576
Their villa was burnt,
only a few bodies yet recovered.

641
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:58,013
I fear the boy is
among the ruins.

642
00:41:58,013 --> 00:42:00,449
A tragedy.

643
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:03,118
One cannot but wonder what
would prompt such an act.

644
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,258
<i>Let us turn our minds to
thoughts of rain,</i>

645
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,693
<i>to cool the fevered
brow of our city.</i>

646
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,833
Citizens of Capua!

647
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,368
Brothers of Rome!

648
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,773
In the name of my forefathers,

649
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:28,677
I, Titus Calavius,
present to you,

650
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:31,813
the final event!

651
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:34,449
<i>Your woman, is she the reason a
spectacle of blood and death,</i>

652
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,185
you refuse to die?

653
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:39,755
<i>A sacrifice to Ceres,
she is.</i>

654
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:41,490
<i>The great goddess
of renewal!</i>

655
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,792
Then perhaps there is
something beyond glory.

656
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,961
<i>... shower us with an
ocean of rain!</i>

657
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:54,203
From the house of Quintus
Lentulus Batiatus.

658
00:42:54,203 --> 00:42:58,173
Behold, Spartacus! Thraex!

659
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:10,519
<i>Joined in battle today by
the Undefeated Gaul!</i>

660
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,955
The Champion of Capua!

661
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,659
<i>Behold, Crixus!</i>

662
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,061
<i>Murmillo!</i>

663
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:23,966
<i>Crixus! Crixus!</i>

664
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:25,634
<i>Crixus!</i>

665
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,073
Capua!

666
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:36,311
Shall we begin?

667
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:52,594
Together they stand
against a man

668
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:54,396
<i>who has never fallen.</i>

669
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:58,166
<i>A beast that has never
been tamed.</i>

670
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:03,572
<i>A legend that has never
been tarnished.</i>

671
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:09,678
By the grace of Marcus
Decius Solonius,

672
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:15,817
behold! Theokoles!
The shadow of death!

673
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,711
Ahh!

674
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:20,282
Begin!

675
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,000
They draw blood!

676
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:37,993
Yes!

677
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:39,327
Yes!

678
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:31,012
Yeah, Capua!

679
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,171
Capua!

680
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,573
Shall I begin?!

681
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,988
Get out of the way.

682
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:22,797
Give ground,
or I'll kill you myself!

683
00:49:57,526 --> 00:49:59,561
Theokoles!

684
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:04,793
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

685
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,103
Yes!

686
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,235
Spar - ta - cus!!

687
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:55,085
Spar - ta - cus!!
